 We're big fans of Zipcar, the original by-the-hour car rental outfit, and now they're doing their members a solid by doling out a free first drink to anyone who shows up at Stitch (247 W. 37th Street) Thursday from 5:30 to 8pm and flashes a Zipcard. If you're not a member yet, find someone who is and head down.

 We're not restaurant reviewers per se but we can't let things go unnoticed when we pop into places for drinks and a few bites. Case in point - Bar Artisanal, where we were subjected to amateurish service and underwhelming food.After being seated, we waited ten minutes for some attention from the staff. Then a particularly zealous manager appeared - and gave us the \"evening's menus\" and a brief overview of how they are designed. Huh? This is a casual place? Then he circled the table, calling everyone sir and answering every request with \"my pleasure.\" By the end of the circle, he had dispensed so much pleasure that we thought we'd need to book a room in the hotel upstairs.Next up, some crimes against wine.

Five sakes will be tasted in Manhattan, four in Brooklyn and the list is online.ScheduleSakaya: Friday 5/1 6pm - 8pmGreene Grape: Friday 5pm - 7pm (55 Liberty Street, Manhattan), Saturday 5pm - 7pm (765 Fulton Street, Fort Greene)Acker & Merrill: Thursday 5:30 - 7:30pm and Saturday 5/2 2pm - 5pmIf you're looking for something other than sake, Astor Wines and Spririts (399 Lafayette Street) has multiple tastings. Tonight you can play out the classic Northern vs Southern Italy rivalry by trying four wines. On Saturday, you can try four more Italian wines as well as some Woodford Reserve Bourbon (the best bourbon there is in our humble opinion) in honor of Kentucky Derby day.Lastly, as much as we'd like to avoid it, Cinco de Mayo is coming up.

Raines Law Room Revisited

***DATE
2009-04-24 10:45:00
***CONTENT
 Recently we found ourselves in Chelsea and close enough to Raines Law Room (48 West 17th Street) that we decided to pop in for a spot check. The room was busy as usual and Paul, the host, was deftly juggling the crowds as we settled into one of the snug booths. The first time around, we loved the space and some of the cocktails but found imprecise execution in certain drinks. Our recent visit showed a bit surer hand behind the bar but still some issues to work out. And we have now learned our lesson - ignore the specials, which can be hit or miss, but generally don't justify the $16 pricetag for \"premium ingredients.\" Heck $13 is a bit steep for drinks in this day and age.Right away we re-visited the Gold Rush and made sure the waitress knew we liked a good amount of bourbon in it. The version we got was as good as we remembered it (after it was fixed the last time). We also tried the Smoke and Mirrors again - this time it was sweeter than we liked and just okay. Seems like execution is still an issue with this drink and as much as we want to like it, we just can't recommend it. Other specials included the Frida (Don Julio tequila, aperol topped with moet chandon), which was okay, and the Sylvia (made with Tanqueray Ten and a touch of absinthe), which was pretty good.Back ordering off the menu, we enjoyed both the Archangel and Corpse Reviver #2. A Manhattan made with Bulleit was terrific but the revelation was a perfectly made Negroni. One thing that sets Raines Law Room apart is the service - the staff, from the busboys to the waitresses, is really accomodating and without a trace of attitude. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the drinks and also extremely nice. And as we walked out into the night, Paul was as gracious as ever.

 A lot of time large scale tastings covering a certain region or country are not great ways to showcase wine - too much filler, too little interesting product. Thankfully, the Wines of Portugal event held this Tuesday intrigued us enough to overcome our skepticism, and thankfully we found lots of interesting wines - some available in the U.S. and some not.The wineries present represented all of Portugal's growing areas and specialized in whites, reds and ports along with a smattering of rose and sparkling wines. We stuck to the indigenous grapes such as Alvarinho, Arinto, Aragones and Touriga Nacional, avoiding the more international styles whenever possible.Here are some of the highlights, with a focus on wines that have distribution in place and thus possible to find in stores and restaurants:

Whether he can raise the $2 million is up for debate but it would be rather cool to have the city's first distillery since Prohibition.

 A tequila and mezcal cocktail bar? Just try keeping us away. Mayahuel is one sexy space, from the dark brown bar to the tiny tiled tables opposite to the plush lounge upstairs. With bar-master Phil Ward (Death & Co.) the brains behind it, expectations were high for the cocktails and we are happy to report we were not disappointed.The Lapsong Punch (lapsong suchong infused \"tea-killa,\" lemon, grapefruit and whiskey barrel bitters) is a great drink to start off, nicely balanced, light and citrusy-smoky. The Smoked Palomino (amontillado sherry, mezcal, grapefruit, lime, salted rim) was delicious, unique and a rare find: a good sherry drink. The Pequeno Cabeza (blanco, grapefruit infused vermouth, amaro and maraschino) was an inventive take on the Manhattan. The Slight Detour (jalapeno tequila, reposado and joven mezcal, agave nectar and Xocolati mole bitters) made for interesting drinking - both the chocolate and orange came through the booze, almost dessert-like. Like the Cabeza, it's a pretty potent concoction.El Jimadors Shifty didn't work as well - the pineapple-infused mezcal didn't cut through the Negra Modelo and was MIA until we drank through the beer and found it on the bottom.UrbanDaddy has a great slideshow that shows off the interiors.

CB2 Recap - Martignetti Gets Reamed, Cafe Noir a No-Show and a New Pera

***CONTENT
 Surprises and contentious moments abounded at last night's Community Board 2 meeting. Biggest of all was the curve ball thrown by the Martignetti brothers. Seems they want to split their liquor license and hold onto the basement club while giving over the ground floor to Cafe Noir... Except it's not Cafe Noir! Instead, Burak Karacam, managing partner of Pera, was before the board to apply for the license the Martignettis want to relinquish on the first floor - in addition to applying for a license for a new Pera at 54 Thompson. The folks from Cafe Noir were nowhere in sight and didn't answer the call, likely signaling the end of the road for that rumored takeover.Unfortunately for the attending brother, Tom Martignetti, the knives came out almost immediately. After several minutes explaining the idea of splitting a license and then bringing in someone else to run the restaurant independently, we witnessed a fascinating (not) discussion of ingress and egress. But lo the board was confused by this idea of two separate joints. Who's the other guy (Burak) and is this legal they asked. How did you get a license in the first place - did you apply as one entity, etc etc. Poor Tom stumbled along as they failed to grasp what he was saying - he didn't express the idea clearly enough to my mind but I still understood the point A vociferous board member signaled it would be a rough ride though, launching into a speech that there were too many liquor licenses in the area and that even if they rescinded one, they should not issue more than a beer & wine license. Then came the neighbors.

Deal or No Deal? - Bar Blanc Bistro

***CONTENT
 With just two days left in the Bar Blanc Bistro (142 West 10th Street) opening week deal, we decided to pop in and see how they were doing. The bar was fairly busy but the restaurant mostly empty when we arrived. We grabbed a pair of empty seats at the bar and were handed the menus. The bartender clearly explained the half-off deal and the exclusions - no bottled beer, burger or oysters for half price. Fair enough, we thought, since the bar menu had a good bit of choice.The half-off special applied to draft beer, wine by the glass and carafe, and house cocktails. (The not-included bottled beer is your typical rip-off with $7 Stellas, Leffe and Hoegaarden). There were lots of choices among the cocktails, normally $12, generally classics or riffs on them including a caipiroska, sidecar (very popular) and a grapefruit martinis. We stuck to beer and wine. The Grimbergen ale was new to us but quite good (normally $7) if a bit sweet at the bottom of the glass while Blue Moon is... Blue Moon. Wines were interesting but suffered from being too warm and open for a while. A Pinot Noir from France was good but neither the mundane Tempranillo nor the White Bordeaux excited us.Food-wise, we enjoyed most everything - the chicken liver mousse was very good as were the beef croquettes, though the underlying mustard was way too hot. The burger was large and juicy while fries were perfectly crisped.Overall, the space looks the same from its previous incarnation (pre-bistro). It certainly doesn't read bistro and it's way too dark - reading menus was only possible by candlelight. Will this incarnation make it? Certainly the bar is comfortable but beer and wine are a bit too expensive for it to be a regular stop. The restaurant itself is a tougher sell and they have their work cut out for them. The previous restaurants struggled in the same space so you have to wonder if it is cursed. In the meantime, is it a deal? Heck yea! 50% off the entire check (tip on the whole amount fellow boozers). We suggest you hurry over before it expires tomorrow night at 8pm. Rumor has it they will have some type of happy hour after the deal is gone but it won't be nearly as good.

 The SLA is diligently killing off the concept of BYOB for restaurants as evidenced by the latest report on Grub Street about Emporio's booze-less opening. Yup, no BYOB for them.As we've previously reported, the current laws are asinine - a restaurant can't be BYOB unless they have a liquor license (not even if you have applied and it is pending) but if they never intend to apply, they are not under the SLA's authority and thus they can't do anything to stop you. The cops could, theoretically, but we doubt they'll be raiding anyone over this.A much better idea would be to re-write the laws to allow any restaurant to be BYOB and to streamline the licensing procedure for restaurants. There was a movement to separate restaurants from bars and clubs but that seems to be up in the air. In the meantime, since it's clear people want booze with their dinner, shouldn't our state reps help foster a system that is a win-win for both customers and restaurant owners? Cause this cockamanie system is terrible for everyone and has damaged too many restaurants to count.

BYOB without a liquor license is always illegal, whether or not you're applying for license through the SLA. And even if you are, the SLA doesn't do anything to stop you. They'll just take note of the fact that you illegally allowed BYOB while your license was pending. It's true that cops probably aren't going to go door to door with no-license restaurants to enforce the law, but if, say, you have an upstairs neighbor that you've pissed off, they can call the cops on you, and then they'll HAVE to investigate.

 We've never been to any incarnation of the Russian Tea Room (150 W. 57th Street) so we have no qualms with it. However, their newest deal, coming to us via Eater's Dealfeed, seems a bit suspect. For the month of April, if you order the \"Business Express Lunch\" for $35 they will give you a free vodka martini to wash it down. Strikes us as an odd promotion - how many people want a vodka martini in the middle of the day? Especially when they are ordering an express lunch?

The cocktail menu had a few intriguing choices but we went straight for their version of the Manhattan ($14) - \"Rittenhouse Rye stirred with Italian Vermouth, Orange Curacao and Angostura bitters.\" The resulting drink is delicious - the orange curacao really rounded out the flavor. One of the best Manhattans we've tasted yet in this project.

 World wine consumption went down almost 1% last year but the U.S. increased its consumption according to The International Organization of Vine and Wine. Europe was the main culprit for the drop, with France, Italy and Germany all drinking less wine than in the past. In fact, the U.S. passed Italy for the first time in wine consumption. Both Canada and Australia did their part, consuming more wine than the year before. And in another shift, Europe accounted for less than half the world's wine production for the first time. Brazil is a big up-and-coming producer with about 100,000 hectares now under production.

***CONTENT
 Apotheke (9 Doyers Street) is an enigma - one of New York's sexiest spaces that is also often uncomfortable to be in coupled with one of the city's best known mixologists running a show that falls short on cocktails. The idea of a cocktail apothecary sets Apotheke apart, as does its focus on expensive house absinthe, but it's unclear whether people want a concept or just a good bar with great cocktails.Hidden away in Chinatown, the space is a knockout - much larger than your typical speakeasy - and if you can score a couch, quite comfortable. However, the long bar has no stools so you have to stand and staff can be overwhelmed. One busy night when we snagged a table, we experienced long waits while the lone waitress struggled to keep up with the busy bar. Apparently Apotheke was on Gossip Girl that week and it had brought a whole new crowd down to Chi-town. Another time, we stood near the bar and were taken care of by several bartenders, which meant the drinks came quickly (it was a pretty quiet night). We much prefer taking our cocktails sitting down, preferably at the bar, which they have made impossible. So what of the drinks?

That's odd, they wrote it out for us and it had Carpano Antica. Thanks for letting us know. We made a version with Cynar and Sweet Vermouth since we didn't have Nardini. It worked really well and was similar in taste to the Nardini. When we get some Nardini Amaro, I'll try it both ways and let the readers know.

 One cold night we found ourselves far off the beaten path - in East Williamsburg, a formerly unknown section of town - and in need of a good cocktail. We'd read a lot about Huckleberry Bar (588 Grand Street) so we decided to check it out.Perhaps too used to intimate Manhattan speakeasies, we found the amount of space in the bar a bit daunting. A long bar, two seating areas, a backyard and a DJ booth? We looked around and wondered if they could possibly pull this off. Happily, the DJ had the night off, the menu was long on classics and cocktails were just $10.The Juanhattan (old overholt rye, amaro averna, lillet blanc and angostura bitters) was quite good while the Article 57 (citrus infused vodka, young ginger juice, Q tonic) was more on the medicinal side and not entirely pleasant to drink - too much ginger. Better was the Tina Modotti, made with tequila, del maguey mezcal, spiced pear, orange bitters and chili salt.Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll size up the classics. It will be interesting to see how the bar does over the long haul on the wrong side of the BQE.

 Few things go as well together as pizza and beer. Unfortunately, few things are as ripe for extreme mark-up as those two items. In the case of Co., or Company as you like, don't expect the recession to mean customer-friendly pricing.We'll come right out and say it - we were underwhelmed. The pizzas were small (about 11\") and the edges of the ballyhooed crust were almost reminiscent of Pizza Hut. The crust itself was pretty good, but the toppings deserved to be seasoned properly though, with salt definitely missing in action. And the pizzas seemed overloaded with cheese and bechamel, guess to explain the pricing - the majority of pizzas are $16 to $18 and appetizer up-selling is heavy.But this is a booze blog. And there is nothing more depressing than staring at a beer list where everything is $7. Really, $7 for Blue Moon, Sixpoint and Stella? While we're at it, could they come up with a more cliched list of beers? What possible justification can there be for marking up beer over 500% anyway?We here at Boozy are getting real tired of being ripped off for the privilege of drinking designer beers - not to mention the Belgian equivalent of Bud. If restaurateurs have so little respect for beer drinkers that they view them merely as a profit center, maybe they should just stop serving beer. On this particular day, we silently drank water. That is not our preferred dining mode.

 We've had sparkling sake, dessert sake, aged sake, sake in a can, and now... sake in a jar. Yup the latest craze (maybe) is sake in a 200ml jar, the perfect size to slip into your suit jacket for that long ride home. Long popular in Japan, especially among commuting businessmen, single serve sakes have slowly been making their way into the U.S. market. Wakatsuru in Toyama (Western Japan) makes one of the first to be offered in a jar, a full-bodied and flavorful Junmai Daiginjo. The sake was good but better with food than on its own. And not quite as good as our favorite single-serve sake, Funaguchi Kikusui.Available at Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street, website). $5.99 per bottle.

 Disturbing news for New Yorkers - most BYO restaurants are breaking the law according to a story in Crains New York. As we previously reported, restaurants need to have a liquor license to allow BYO - unless they are under 20 seats. If they open and are applying for a license, they may jeopardize the application's status by allowing BYO. It's unclear what the consequences are since the SLA (State Liquor Authority) only has jurisdiction if an application for a license is underway - no application, no SLA authority. Then enforcement fall on the police.

 No name on display, long narrow room, buzzer for admission, classic cocktails, yup, it's another speakeasy. But the Raines Law Room seems to be a speakeasy that's a little bit different - and the odd absence of an actual bar is only part of it. Part of it is the people involved - the mixologist and owners are not \"big\" names, though they have solid backgrounds in the industry. Thus, a cocktail list that is more classically-inspired than the more mixologist-driven places like PDT and Tailor. And then there Paul - a doorman, manager and chocolatier, who elevates the place all by himself. He is unfailingly polite, extremely gracious and...nice. When he apologizes that there will be a wait and takes your number, you know he is sincere and will call you as soon as he can. Even better, he makes his own chocolates by hand and sells them on site ($12 for a box of 6). They are creative, unusual and delicious - and most of them are vegan. But you wouldn't know it as even the vegan ones taste rich and decadent.But we digress - a cocktail bar is first and foremost about the cocktails. And on that front, they are doing well, though list is shorter than we had expected.

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

 Last year, the Denton brothers, owners of downtown favorites 'ino and 'inoteca, took their show to Gramercy with the opening of Bar Milano. The buzz was deafening but the result underwhelming, headscratching Frank Bruni two-star review notwithstanding, and within months the struggling spot was closing to be transformed into what it should have been from the get go: 'inoteca north. Regardless of history, we're here now and 'inoteca is a marked improvement in several ways - the room is less fussy, the menu downscaled and the drinks cheaper - the terrific cocktails are just $10 each. The winelist is thankfully still extensive, interesting and well priced as well.Already carousing nearby, we decided to pop in for a few drinks and nibbles. We were intrigued to see a category devoted to egg white fizzes. The Apple Blow (lairds applejack, fresh lemon juice, sugar, egg white, chilled seltzer water) was very good but the Dubonnet was even better (dubonnet, cherry heering, fresh lemon and orange juice, egg whites). Another delicious option was the Cotillion (old forrester bourbon, appleton estate rum, fresh lemon, orange juice, cointreau and lucid absinthe), a nicely balanced and eminently quaffable drink. A much better showing than last year when the hyped cocktail program struck us as both too precious and too expensive, not to mention too reliant on pricey sweet pink drinks that seemed to be aimed at the fairer sex.The dishes we sampled were a bit spotty but we are happy to report the delicious truffed egg toast has made the trip uptown unscathed. With a bit more work on the food, we can see 'inoteca 2 hitting its stride. The crowds are already there.'inoteca Liquori Bar323 Third Avenue, 212-683-3035

 One of our readers has a bone to pick with the media, especially today's AM New York pizza article. \"Can everyone please stop calling Artichoke \"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery\"? The place is not a brewery! They have two beers - Bud and Bud Light available in 32 oz styrofoam cups for $5.50! Give me a break.\"We have to say he has a point. The media often just blindly repeats nonsense without doing even basic research. We don't care if the owners want it called by such a nonsensical moniker, the place is known as Artichoke to everyone and that's what we'll call it. Oh, and singling out Lombardi's as a \"legend\" is just wrong. The place is a tourist trap with overloaded crappy pizza. It's high time the media stop pushing that place as worth a visit.

 The much praised Death & Co. took some time to win us over. The cocktails were good but the doormen annoying, and so were the crowds. There was the constant impending doom of potential closing surrounding the place. And it was just too uneven on the bartender front. Yet over time, we were drawn back again and again until we couldn't deny it - it's become a favorite cocktail spot. Today, Death & Co. is as close to a classic NYC bar as has opened in the new millennium. The drink list is impressively vast yet smartly broken down by category of booze. The bartenders are sure of their craft. And the room is as comfortable as it gets, save the cold blast of air near the door in wintertime.It's all about the drinks, of course. And on that account, D&Co excels, with top-notch ingredients, creativity and highly balanced recipes, some with close to 10 ingredients.

 Why, we wonder, can't people just leave wine the way it is? First they added sugar-free sweetener to it. Now we have a \"new wine craze\" straight out of Cherry Valley, Ohio: Fruiteasers. Emerine Estates Winery has created a line of wine that uses a base such as chardonnay, riesling or merlot then adds in various fruits including apple, peach, blueberry and pineapple to create \"exotic fruit wines.\" Now, we don't mind old-fashioned wines made out of fruit (other than grapes). But why boost wines that naturally may have notes such as pineapple (riesling) or blueberries (merlot) with actual fruit? Or in the case of Seduction, a pinot noir with coffee, mocha, vanilla, cherries and chocolate. Are the wines themselves not enough? More of the head-scratching offerings here - Strawberry Shortcake Wine anyone? Speaking of cake, this wine definitely takes it: \"As seen on TV, its true (sic!), a 100% pure Chardonnay with Amish butter.\" No, we're not making this up. The name of the wine? Tear Drops. How a propos.

 A reader sent us a link to a Craigslist post entitled \"Opening a New Restaurant?\" featuring a sale of restaurant equipment at a familiar sounding address - 171 East Broadway - that made us curious. A quick Google search revealed the sale at none other than Broadway East. It's wrapping up this afternoon but you may be able to pick up pots, pans, toasters, knives and lots more. The listing is clearly written in a tone that worries it may signal impending doom - \"we bought too much\" - but it nonetheless strikes us as a bad sign for a place that can't be doing well in an off the beaten path location.

 Something just crossed our inbox that seemed enticing until we actually read it. TimeOut sent a sponsored promo invite to a March 4th event called \"Fabulously Frugal\" in... Yonkers. Yonkers? Yup, that \"city\" just up the Hudson River trying to revitalize itself as happening place. Seems a building called 66Main is trying to fill loft-style apartments and they've come up with an event they hope draws newly frugal New Yorkers to what is essentially an Open House. They promise food from area chefs, free \"spiked punch,\" giveaways and more!. As they put it, \"Westchester's hottest brands and hot new chefs will show you how as you mix and mingle at Yonkers' address for luxuriously affordable living.\"Apparently, after all the goodies, they had about $5 left in their budget for the graphic to the right. Anyway, if you're so inclined, here is the website. We would, however, like to remind those tempted by this fab offer that it is indeed YONKERS.

 The sad truth of this recession is no one and no thing is being spared. Even booze sales are now officially down. Conventional wisdom says that \"sins\" like booze and cigarettes survive well during recessions as people try to chemically cope with a depressing reality. But this recession is proving a lot of people wrong.Bloomberg reported yesterday that \"take-out sales of alcoholic beverages tumbled 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter\", the largest decline in fifty years of record keeping. The biggest bust? Surprisingly beer, down 14%. Wine was down 1.6% and liquor 0.9%. If you're into this sort of stuff, a handy chart at FiveThirtyEight.com shows the ups and downs of booze vis a vis GDP.

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

 A while back, we slapped Perbacco on the wrist for selling warm wine and placing candles in front of wine bottles. Unfortunately, new restaurant Sorella (95 Allen Street) is another offender. We slipped in for a glass of wine the other day and were impressed by the design and the attention to detail in everything from an interesting wine selection to the printed materials. Then we looked up to see wine everywhere.Folks, we can't stress enough that you store wine for customers properly. Having wine stored on shelves lit by candles is pretty but it's not wine we want to drink. Even worse, when the temperature control on the room's thermostat is set in the upper 70s, we get really concerned for the wine.The winelist is heavily skewed towards Northern Italy (good) but very pricey (bad). Since the cooking is skewed towards Piemontese, the region wines are well represented. Unfortunately, bottles under $50 are in short supply and the bulk of the reds from Piedmont were over $80. Wines by the glass tend towards the obscure, which is fine, but nothing we tried was really delicious. Prices by the glass, $10 to $17, would be fair if the pours were more generous. Right now they skimpy.

The drink we were served was made with Rittenhouse Rye and Carpano Antica, purportedly \"the original\" sweet Italian vermouth. It was terrific, perfectly balanced and nicely presented with three small cherries on a skewer across the top. If only all Manhattans could be this delicious.

***CONTENT
 When is a beer too fancy? That question is a common one these days as restaurants continue to look for ways to jack up prices with obscure beers and importers bring in ever more product. Case in point, Kasteel Cru, a fairly new arrival on the scene from Alsace, France made with champagne yeast and now selling at Whole Foods for $4.99 a bottle.That's a fair amount of scratch in these times, even for a lifestyle beer which this clearly is. So we picked up a bottle to see what the hype is all about. The first taste is of a well made lager with a bit of an effervescent character. Sipping further, we found that the slight bitterness of the initial taste seemed to mellow into an almost bubbly quality. This actually counteracts the \"beerness\" of the beer and makes the taste less cohesive but certainly makes for a bit of lightness in the mouth feel.We were curious how the beer held up over, say a half hour or sipping. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite hold the effervescence and gets a bit out of balance with more bitterness evident. The beer was passable with food and seemed best suited to cheese.All in all, it's a good, not great beer, with a fancy pedigree and way-too-high price. Stick with the regular lagers unless you're showing off new found wealth for a friend.

 A reader posted a comment to our news bit about LeNell's closing this week saying, \"the store itself is completely cleaned out already. I went on Saturday, and the shelves were bare save for a few of bottles of bitters and one or two lonely $200+ bourbons.\"If those bottles of bourbon are so lonely, we'll be happy to give them a proper comforting... In the meantime, keep those tips coming.

 Apparently the condo project did permanently kill Cedar Tavern (last found at 82 University Place). Grub Street is reporting that the tavern will not return, as was originally promised. Looks like the owner is out of the pub game for good. In the meantime, they have put up one ugly building, complete with million dollar apartments no one can afford. Thanks a bunch for that.

 Is Milk & Honey open to the public again? Sure seems that way after Urban Daddy published the \"secret phone number\" today in their email round-up. They cite the end of \"temporary shuttering\" as the reason for giving out the number, even though it was widely reported that M & H went private and started charging for membership. However, we will honor Eater's standing request to not publish the number, even if Ben Leventhal - a former UD consultant - had self-serving motives in writing the post. We get it, we like to get in too.Update: Seems the info is very public now - thanks to a Grub Street reader for pointing us in the right direction. For their website go here. You can text 718-308-6881 for reservations after 7pm.

 Lots of booze news to report today:Grub Street has the closing date for Red Hook booze-arium LeNell's - February 20. This of course is due to the dreaded \"lease issues\" and we can only wonder what kind of crack their landlord is smoking.Eater is on the scene with a report of how the Feds quashed Six Point Ale's \"Hop Obama\" brew. Seems the Dept of Homeland Security put the \"kabosh\" on the whole thing and even threatened seizure. Ouch.Lastly, we are somewhat intrigued that Dan Aykroyd is at Astor Wines today (12pm - 2pm) to shill for his vodka. Huh? Yup, you can get autographs but you can't taste the vodka. Guess you'll have to fork over $50 and let us know how if it's worth it.

 We noticed an odd sight outside FiDi's Gild Hall, a fancy Thompson Hotel venture complete with an upscale celeb chef resto - a whiteboard promoting happy hour. The joint, fancifully named the Libertine, opened with typical fanfare due to the name of its chef Todd English - English does English! - but failed to thrill both critics and diners.The beer-heavy ($4 Stellas, $5 Draughts) happy hour skews heavily towards guys with an appetite for oysters. The $1 - 1.50 oysters are a nice touch, but hey, how about something liquid for the ladies? Unlike Gild Hall, the trendy Thompson production, and Libertine, which was supposed to evoke London clubhouses circa 1970s (monied? plush?), the whiteboard sign is decidedly downscale and uninviting. Frankly, it looks to us like it was pulled from a back office (we hope the conference rooms' boards are cleaner than this!). Dear Management, this is the most passive-aggressive approach to promoting happy hour we've ever seen. Are you sure you want anyone coming in?The Libertine15 Gold StreetHappy Hour: 5pm - 7pm

 Today, Eric Asimov wrote a piece in The New York Times about little known Italian wines that are a good value. Unfortunately, the paper didn't include the most helpful information - where to buy them! That's right folks, the paper decided to only list importers since it insists on having a national food section. Too bad that isn't much help to New Yorkers.Here are a couple of our favorite places to pick up Italian wines from $10 to $20:Smith & Vine (268 Smith Street, Brooklyn) has a great selection - 50 different bottles in that price range.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is even more impressive, with over 90 wines in this price range.Enoteca DiPalo (200 Grand Street) opened in November two doors down from the original DiPalo, featuring wine from each of Italy's 20 regions. While the prices are generally higher than the Times range, more like $15 - $29 for most bottles, the selection includes some hard to find wines and is chosen with the usual DiPalo family care.Let us know where you like to pick up Italian (or any other) wines.

There you can partake in the Bruichladdich Malt Whiskey Academy's one week course in all things single malt. Writer Sarah Doyle Lacamoire wrote about her week at the distillery and she clearly had a blast, experiencing the entire distilling and bottling process before \"graduating,\" presumably with honors.If this sounds like a great way to spend a week, drop an email to ella@bruichladdich.com.The academy is only open May through November.

 Ninth Avenue in the area around Port Authority has never been the pretty part of town, and the Holland Cocktail Lounge (532 9th Avenue) has always seemed to fit right in. There was nothing modern or sceney about the neighborhood dive but it did the job, until its recent closure that is, due to the landlord trying to sell the building. Given the state of the market, that effort went nowhere and so the bar is open again, per Grub Street, and ready to serve $4 beers. In this day and age, that's something.

***CONTENT
 Thrillist, Eater, et al posted yesterday about a new speakeasy - yes, narrow space, downstairs, unmarked door, yada yada - called Raines Law Room (48 W. 17th Street) and immediately a couple of skeptics weighed in. Seems some people are tired of speakeasies and we can understand that - everything from tiny PDT, the world's most promoted speakeasy, to Woodson and Ford, the open but not basement joint on Bleecker Street, has started to grate on folks. These days, people want to drink and they kind of prefer places that a) they can get into and b) they can find.One of the bartenders hastily leapt to the spot's defense, promising \"it's not like any other bar in town.\" Now it's arguable that was even necessary since only two commenters initially posted their skepticism and it was hardly the usual Eater vitriol. Of course, the bartender's response opened him up for further criticism and a good bit of hole was dug, though he was certainly diligent and fair in his comments. However, it might serve folks working at speakeasies to be a little less sensitive to internet comments.From our perspective, the place actually sounds intriguing and we don't mind the concept - assuming they have a policy of actually letting people in. We'll let you know how that Old Fashioned tastes, it does sound like a delicious version. Raines Law Room48 W. 17th Street, downstairs, unmarked door

 Death + Company (433 East 6th Street) is undoubtedly one of New York's best cocktail bars, as well as one of its most controversial, due to its never-ending battle to stay open. We've spent some extended time there recently - look for a review later this week - and after much imbibing, decided to test the bartender's Manhattan chops. We left it up to him and his take ($13) was interesting and quite delicious - he used half Booker's Bourbon and half Rittenhouse Rye to create a rich, nicely balanced drink. It certainly sent us out into the cold night feeling no pain.

 We passed by respected Japanese kaiseki spot Rosanjin this weekend and came across this disturbing, misspelled sign signaling a \"temporary\" closure. We peered over the screens covering up the windows and saw an empty room, save a ladder in the center. Was their transformation from set menu to a la carte not enough to keep the restaurant afloat? Or is there a problem with the space that needed fixing? The outgoing message on the restaurant's machine gives no hint of closure and Open Table has tables available from Wednesday on (Mon and Tues not available).UPDATE 2/2/09 12:30pm - A call to the restaurant confirms the closure is temporary due to unspecified problems and they hope to be open Thursday or Friday.

Liquor Stores in a Tizzy

***CONTENT
 Crain's New York is reporting that liquor stores are up in arms over the proposal by Governor Paterson to expand sales of wine to grocery stores in an attempt to raise money for the state budget. 2,700 of them have banded together to form a coalition called \"The Last Store on Main Street\" to fight the proposal, which could lead to an additional 19,000+ licenses to sell wine.New York State has long been backwards in laws related to selling wine. Recall that only a few years ago, all liquor stores were closed on Sundays as if this were the deep South. Some of these same stores fought the change because they argued Sunday hours favored big liquor stores over mom & pop shops. They were wrong about that and they are wrong about this.Fewer than ten states limit wine sales to liquor stores. New Jersey has tons of liquor stores and you can buy wine in supermarkets. If you peruse the aisle of a Jersey supermarket, you'll find a good deal of plonck among the mostly pedestrian choices. If you want interesting or hard to find wine, you go to a liquor store. The same would happen in New York - not to mention that you would still have to buy liquor at a liquor store. Also, let's not forget that stores in New York City don't even have all that much room for wine due to high real estate costs - stuff is already stacked to the ceiling. Where are they going to put so much wine that it puts shops out of business? However, we do think wine shops should be able to sell more than alcohol - cheese, mixers and beer come to mind. We also support the proposal to allow shops to have multiple licenses - creating mini-chains that can then leverage distributors for better deals. Let's level the playing field and let capitalism take over, shall we?

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 Time Out New York would seem to be a fan of our own Manhattan Project - why else would they advertise the \"Perfect Manhattan\" on the cover of this week's issue? Sure, the article delves into NYC themed drinks that the Manhattan has inspired, but why do they fumble so badly when highlighting where to have the original?Our guess is the writer was not aware of our own post about the Bemelman's experience - short version: dated room, overpriced drinks and a piss poor Manhattan made by someone who could have cared less. We'd actually be willing to bet that the writer did not set foot in Bemelman's for the story - since the default Manhattan when we were there was made with Makers, which is certainly not a rye as listed in the recipe on TONY's website. Not to mention that the recipe doesn't even include bitters. Huh?Among their picks for Manhattan-inspired cocktails, our favorite is the Little Italy at Pegu Club. Basically a somewhat bitter Manhattan, made with Cynar, it's one of our favorite drinks around town.

 Yesterday we were perusing Chamber's Street Wines' January newsletter when we noticed in their list of sales and \"endangered\" wines that most were natural or organic. While most people are quite familiar with the term organic - for wine the grapes and means of production must be certified by some agency - the concept of \"natural\" is a lot less clear.We asked winemaker, wine tech expert and blogger Clark Smith for his take on what turns out to be a controversial issue in the wine world.

 Recent West Village wanderings took us into subterranean cocktail den Little Branch (22 Seventh Avenue South) in search of a good Manhattan. While we like the look of the space, the drinks themselves have never really impressed us. We slid into one of the tight booths and ordered a Manhattan. The waitress didn't ask for a booze preference but when it arrived, there was a familiar quality to it. Hmm, we thought. Could it be Old Overholt, our own house rye? Sure enough it was. Makes a nicely balanced Manhattan, though theirs was a tad drier than the Head Bartender version. At $12 a solid version of a classic cocktail.

 NYC diners know Restaurant Week is a bit of a crapshoot. Participants either take the promotion as an opportunity to introduce themselves to new diners - Danny Meyer's restaurants do this very well, so do restaurants such as Tocqueville and Cafe Boulud - or they do it for the volume or because they think they have to. We had hoped that Oceana's pedigree would put it firmly in the former category and their offer of 30% off the entire winelist during Restaurant Week was sufficient to lure us back, in spite of the mediocre food and wine service we had experienced there a few years ago. The chef had since changed, the Times' critic loved it (reaffirming its three stars just last July) and it seemed like a good opportunity to give it abother try.However, on our visit, it seemed like the kitchen wasn't even trying, just cranking out those menus and praying RW would soon be over soon. There was little imagination at work on the plates presented. Bland, boring, monotone presentation and flavors seemingly customized to a shabby room.

 The New York Times reported yesterday that Long Island vintner Robert Palmer died last week, making him the second winemaker to pass away within weeks after the tragic accident took Christian Wolffer's life in South America over the New Year's holiday. Palmer, though a pioneer in Long Island winemaking, was an ad man by trade and, as befits all true \"Mad Men,\" professed to like a good martini. Yet this non wine drinker still managed to build Palmer Vineyards into a well respected winery and popular tourist attraction. His ingenuity will live on as Long Island grows in stature as a world class wine region.

 The Joy of Sake takes place every September and is quite the party with over 300 sakes tasted and 1,000 attendees. However, if the size of their events ever seemed too much, you'll be happy to know they do hold more intimate Joy of Sake Aftertaste events centered on particular themes throughout the year.On Monday night January 26, Sumile (154 W. 13th Street) will be the venue for the latest Aftertaste - and the theme is aroma, or how do you get such a variety of aromas such as apple and banana from something made from water, yeast and rice. These events tend to be quite a steal and this is no exception - two hours of sake drinking plus appetizers by the restaurant. It's 37 sakes for $37, all inclusive.Buy tickets online or call the restaurant and speak with Karen (212-989-7699).

But in these times, any excuse to booze up is good enough for us.In honor of the historic occasion, many DC bars already got permission to stay open 2 extra hours and Maryland bars also got an extended hour.

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel.

 We popped into Bemelman's the other night for a quick drink and found the room surprisingly busy for a cold January weeknight. Whether this was due to the live music or the famed bar being bullet-proof in our recessionary times is unclear, but the welcome at the bar itself was hardly warm and inviting.Even before sitting, the bartender warned us there would be a $10 per person cover charge ($20 each at the tables, more on weekends). Then we looked at the menu - $19 for a cocktail. Sheesh. The list has fallen a ways since Audrey Saunders redid it and seemed tailored to the crowd. We were talked out of the famed \"punch of the day\" ($15) by the gruff bartender, who implied the punch is the same every day and predictably suggested the most expensive drink ($20). Instead, we got a barely stirred Manhattan made with Makers that was rough, to say the least. They do give you a sidecar and the nuts are good.The room itself has seen better days, even though it was renovated in 2002. The famed murals seemed dim and the large piano right in the middle of the room forces you to dodge musicians and tables to reach the bar. The bar itself is merely functional, and the footrail was partially dislodged and not a secure place for feet.I guess the joint is content to ride on its history and good will of the aged clientele. But who knows for how long at these prices?Bemelman's BarThe Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th Street (at Madison)

 Urban Daddy breaks the news today that Sasha Petraske's White Star has adjusted its concept and is now serving proper cocktails. Prior, it only served liquor, notably absinthe, and beer. Thankfully, you can now get an Old Fashioned, Caipirinha or Manhattan, among others, for $10. We can only surmise that they succumbed to the pressure to serve cocktails due to the concept not quite clicking and a nowhere location (21 Essex near Hester St). For a look at their expanded menu, visit Urban Daddy. Expect a review, not to mention a visit from the Manhattan Project, soonish.

Also--apparently during Milk & Honey's renovations, anyone with a key can drink at WS for $9.

 We get a lot of recipes from liquor companies, but few are any good. Most of their so-called signature drinks wind up being too heavy handed with the product they are pushing. A notable exception are the fine folks at St. Germain, who consistently craft good drinks made with the elderflower liqueur.Case in point is the Paris Manhattan, a twist on the classic made with St. Germain, which actually enhances the flavor of the bourbon. The 'Parisian' touch is light and flirty without being too frou frou. We'd raise a glass to the creator of the drink, if we knew who he or she is...Paris Manhattanmakes one2oz Bourbon1oz St. Germain1/2oz Dry Vermouth2 dashes Angostura BittersPour ingredients into an ice filled shaker and stir until cold, strain into a martini glass.

 The bar at Gotham Bar and Grill (12 E. 12th Street) has long been one of the city's best dining bars thanks to their ingenious trays that rest on the rail running along the bar. While not a go-to spot for the drinks crowd these days, we figured it would have a solid Manhattan, so we popped in just before the holidays. The bartender asked our choice of booze and we chose rye. He recommended Michters, which is quite good but it turns out a bit pricey ($16). The resulting drink was a taste of classic New York - smooth yet potent. It almost made us forget the howling wind just outside the doors. Alas, if we could afford two, we might have really been protected from the elements.

***CONTENT
 Always on the cutting edge of a trend, The New York Times looks at the effect absinthe is having on the NYC booze world. The resulting article is pretty silly and yet more evidence of the paper's cluelessness when it comes to popular trends - down to the decidedly un-glamorous \"ptooey\" in the article's title.The author is Eric Konigsberg, apparently best known for his revealing insights into such topics as cloned pets and the need for supernannies. His take is basically that absinthe is a scam, something with silly rituals and dubious marketing, not to mention a pretty vile tasting liquor. At the outset of the piece, he visits Chinatown hotspot Apotheke - one of only two spots serving absinthe mentioned in a piece purportedly about an uber hot NYC trend - and makes little effort to temper his derision of the owner, the atmosphere and the crowd. Then he heads uptown to L'Absinthe, a \"polished and perfectly highly-regarded French restaurant\" run by \"a perfectly charming fellow,\" where he was lured by the restaurant's PR materials and a PR girl named Alice, then proceeds to partake in four different absinthes and talk to a few fans. What follows is \"perfectly\" predictable...

The founder of Wolffer Estate and a key figure in the growth of Long Island as a world-class winemaking region, Wolffer was an outsized figure in the industry. A native of Hamburg, Germany, it is rumored that he invested $15 million in the creation of the successful winery also known for hosting the annual James Beard Chefs & Champagne event each summer.

 We popped into the \"soft opening\" of City Winery last night not knowing what to expect. Eater and Grub Street had written it up, there were a bunch of good wine deals and there is a big PR machine behind it. What we found, was a bit of a surprise - a cavernous space (at most a third full around 8:30pm) and a big stage with a piano. There are cool looking barrels and bottles-as-decor, too. Granted it was the day before New Year's Eve and the location, two blocks north of the Holland Tunnel, is challenging, but we expected a much bigger turnout of oenophiles.The first thing that strikes you about City Winery is the sheer size of the place. All blond wood, we can only imagine the acoustics when it is full. The main floor is the restaurant/bar/performance space with a small private room downstairs. Designed for maximum sightlines in relation to the stage, this unfortunately means that when there is no performance, your eyes are drawn to the emptiness of the stage. And with a room that large, you have to wonder how they will fill it when there are no performances. The opening night was low key and all about the wines. And the deals were impressive: $5 Henriot champagne, $20 for a 1970 Francesco Rinaldi Barolo, $15 Lopez de Heredia 1987 Rioja, $10 Olga Riffaut's 1989 Chinon - all well worth the price, even though there was significant bottle variation. The glass pours were generous and tastes were provided as well. This was easily the best place to taste old vintages in New York last night - how often does one get a chance to taste 20 and 30 year old wines by the glass? And at these prices?!

 We've been to Tailor at least half a dozen times since it opened and it remains an enigma to us. The subterranean bar, with adventurous drinks by mixologist Eben Freeman, remains a draw yet the place seems to still suffer a case of disjointedness. On the one hand, it has curry popcorn, as addictive as it gets for bar snacks, and a few seriously good drinks. On the other, it has sky high expectations, lots of hype and high prices to boot. Does it stand up to the the expectations? The answer is mainly yes, though it's not entirely successful from a barfly's point of view.

I visited Tailor for the first time before being aware of all the hype. And, even then, I found it disappointing. I have not dined upstairs, but the bar food was subpar. The cocktails on paper sounded fascinating, but simply did not fulfill the promise. I'd so much rather have a simple Old Fashioned than these creations which promise a lot, work hard to bring something new, but in the end, fall flat. I have since been back, and was as disappointed the second time around as the first. While I admire the efforts of Eben Freeman, the end result is a major disappointed. I have time and time again made tastier, more satisfying mixed drinks at home that lack the fuss and pretense. That said, I'll give it one more shot.

We don't disagree with you though we have found some good drinks there and the food is much improved. The thing that dismays us is the pricing, which has always been high in comparison to places like Death & Co or PDT.

 Waiting on a friend the other night, we slipped into the venerable Old Town Bar (45 E. 18th Street) and ordered up a Manhattan. The bartender asked if we preferred rye or bourbon and we went with rye, but left the brand choice up to him. The resulting drink was well balanced but bracing, to say the least. Kind of a working man's stiff drink, perfect for the blue collar crowd. The booze? McCormick's, the house rye. The price? $7.

 Every Tuesday, Astor Wines & Spirits discounts a region or type of booze 15%. Today: Austria. One of our (many) favorite wine-producing countries, it is well-known for its white wines, especially Gruner Veltliner and Riesling. And for those looking for them, there are plenty of delicious wines from great producers such as Nikolaihof, Nigl, Schloss Gobelsburg and Brundlmayer to be picked up for less today. But if you are looking for something different, try a fragrant dry muscat such as Ecker's Gelber Muskateller ($20.39 with the discount), which makes a great aperitif, or Weissburger (pinot blanc) from one of our favorite Austrian winemakers Heidi Schrock ($21.24 today). Discounted prices start at $10.19, today only.

 Today's Drinking Notes includes a few tips for dealing with hangovers and industry heavyweights weighing in on their last drink, if they were to give up alcohol. To shame that thought.StarChefs has a brief rundown on some hangover soothers. The resulting article is somewhat short on interesting tips, however, and a bit Seattle-centric. But we liked Tilth and Vessel, so we'll let it slide.Much more fun is Metromix's what if you only had one \"last drink\" article. Our favorite response is of course the reference to PDT's highly potent Staggerac (a sazerac made with George T. Stagg Bourbon) though demerits must be issued since it was suggested by a PDT bartender. We'll be by later to pick them up...Is it us or was that NY Times article on the move of P & G restaurant/bar a total snooze? Half way through, it turns its focus to Sirio Maccioni, subject of a documentary tonight on HBO. Guess P & G wasn't much of a story. Either that or an editor took a hacksaw to the piece.

 When asked our favorite libation, many potential answers present themselves depending on our mood. But when it comes to cocktails one drink stands above the rest - the Manhattan. This classic cocktail is the epitome of grown-up drinking: no juice, no shaking, no (plastic) monkeys. Just whiskey (usually rye or bourbon), vermouth and a few dashes of bitters, well stirred and served up. When well made, it's pure pleasure. When not, it's a boozy mess. Debuting in the Manhattan Club in the 1870s, the Manhattan is about a hundred years older than we are. In the intervening years, it has inspired many variations and knock-offs. In honor of the original's outsized influence, we decided to embark on a project to find the best Manhattans in Manhattan - and beyond. We will search far and wide, high end and low end, to identify the best and warn you about the worst. We'll let bartenders guide us when it comes to the booze and see where they take us. And we will also tell you about some of the city's best new creations inspired by the drink.But we can't drink the city by ourselves, hard as we try, so we'd like to hear from you about where to find the best Manhattan, who makes it or how you like to order it. Drop us an email or leave a comment.Our first stop was a natural, a New York institution with a great bar: Gramercy Tavern.

 We'd heard a lot of good things about Perbacco (234 E. 4th Street), so we popped in recently for dinner and ordered a bottle of red wine without a second thought. Then we noticed something odd - the wine was warm in the glass. It seemed the glasses themselves were warm so we had them replaced. New glasses arrived after several minutes and we were each poured wine - but the wine was still warm. Then we felt the bottle. Warm. Normally we'd ask for another bottle but in this particular situation it was not an option and the wine was quite drinkable, especially after it cooled off a bit. The culprit? Wine stored on shelves in the open - with votives in front of them keeping them nice and toasty. Message to restaurant owners - store your wine properly! If you do it for \"atmosphere,\" use those bottles as decor only - don't serve them to customers!As for the surprise two stars the restaurant received from the New York Times? Talk about a headscratcher of a review. Only the prices seemed to be at a two-star level. The cooking, mainly deconstructed Italian dishes, was okay but flavors and deliciousness were lost in the deconstruction process and the service was just average. We poured our own wine all night. There are plenty of better 1 star places.If you know of other crimes against wine, or any other booze, drop us a line or leave a comment.

 If you want to give the perfect gift to a rocker pal or club kid, how about a three-story music venue? That's right, the Knitting Factory space is up for sale. The original spot was a landmark but there are plenty of online gripes about how the new location at 74 Leonard Street was a drag on the joint's legacy. The venue is still running shows so it's unclear how long the owners plan to hang on at that location but they are entertaining offers. If you got the dough - over $500K a year just for rent - you can pick up a rare Tribeca triplex with 3 liquor licenses and a cabaret license. Give Steven Kamali a buzz -if you're interested.

 A reader asked us whether it was legal to charge corkage when you are BYOB and a quick call to the SLA (State Liquor Authority) clears up a few common misconceptions.Restaurants cannot be BYOB unless they have a license to sell alcohol. There is no separate BYOB permit. That means they have to go through the process, get the liquor license and have at least a temporary license on hand. If they choose to let you bring in booze and not sell their own, that is their call. So to answer the reader's question - licensed establishments can charge corkage. That is completely legal and outside the SLA's jurisdiction.

 Somewhat under the radar but worthy of a visit is the snug bar at Yerba Buena (23 Avenue A), overseen by the talented Artemio Vasquez, who learned a trick or two from his former employer, the doyenne of New York cocktails herself, Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club. The house cocktails we sampled ($12) were very good: the Jamaica 107 (left, hibiscus tea infused bernheim wheat whiskey + organic egg white + fresh lemon juice) was a hit with grown men, despite its pretty hibiscus color, and the Boludo \"Yerba Mate\" (yerba mate infused pisco + grapefruit & lime cordials + fresh lemon juice) was deliciously refreshing. We hear those mojitos go down real smooth too.And if you stop in by December 30, you can partake in their ongoing celebration of the repeal of prohibition. Classic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2 and Vieux Carre are $10.Perhaps best of all, plunk down $11 for a brunch cocktail and they will keep sending them until you beg them to stop. Yup, unlimited mimosas, bellinis, French 75 or the Peruvian Kiss, which has trouble written all over it.Yerba Buena23 Avenue A (bet Houston & 2nd Street)212-529-2919

 Next year, booze may well cost more. Gov. Paterson is proposing hikes in taxes on a whole assortment of goods, including beer and wine. Booze taxes are levied per gallon, and wine is currently taxed at the rate of 19 cents per gallon in New York. The proposal will raise that to about 51 cents, still below the national median tax rate.But there is some potential good news - the governor also wants to allow supermarkets to sell wine.

 The champagne bubble seems to have burst this year, but thankfully there are plenty of good, affordable sparkling wines you can serve at parties, bring along or give as gifts with no shame. For bubbly on the budget (or a splurge), we usually head to Astor Wines & Spirits, which has the most extensive selection of sparklers by country and region - and the best prices. For $20 or less, here are a few recently tasted winesProsecco is often the go-to sparkler for people since it's affordable and highly drinkable. Prosecco di Valdobbiadene Col Vetoraz is a very good option: clean, crisp and smooth with depth and complexity and refreshing citrus notes. While available at Vestry Wines and Italian Wine Merchants, Astor has the best price at $15.99.Made by a French champagne family in New Mexico, Gruet offers excellent quality for the price. Rich and creamy with a toasty finish, the Brut is nicely balanced. The Gruet Blanc de Noirs is even richer and both are $12.99 at Astor. A great value and a hands-down favorite under $15.Should you chance bubbly under $10? Delacroix Brut Blanc de Blancs is a French sparkler that's fairly simple but a great find for its price - $7.99 at Astor. A blend of chardonnay, chenin blanc and ugni blanc (used in cognac making), it is fresh, easy drinking and has good fizz - perfect for big parties.The elegant Parigot & Richard Crémant De Bourgogne Brut Blanc de Blancs is the closest to champagne in this group. Dry and polished, this delicious wine will easily stand up to higher priced champagnes. It's made with chardonnay and aligoté - and excellent with smoked salmon and crème fraiche. $19.99 at Astor.

 Liquor license woes are legendary in New York these days. All too often restaurants have to open without one. It gets reported in the media at opening time but then we are left to wonder - did they ever get that license? Heck, do they even want one? Here's an update on the status at some local favorites. Each restaurant has its charms and fans will attest to the food, but saving a few bucks on booze is an additional plus, especially these days.Motorino, East Williamsburg pizza hotspot (319 Graham Ave), is still without a liquor license. They welcome you to bring in beer or wine. Another Brooklyn pizza mecca, Lucali (575 Henry Street, Carroll Gardens), has also remained sans liquor license so pack your own. (Photo - Motorino pie)Petite self-professed \"neo-Korean\" East Villager Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street) is still going strong in the wake of summer critical praise and the Times review. Their website cryptically says they are \"BYOB again,\" so go ahead.Kuma Inn (113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor) continues to wow them on the LES. They are BYO for the time being but they do have corkage fees, depending on your booze of choice: $5 for 750ml wine, $1 per 12oz beer, $3 for 300ml of sake, $4 for 720ml of sake and $10 for 1.5L. No hard liquor allowed.

Please clarify, if the place doesn't have a liquor license, by law you can't charge customers even for services related to alcohol ie \"corkage\" I have no problem tipping the server for the extra service, just giving more money to an undeserving proprietor.

 In Japan sake is as everyday as soda pop, with cans of sake available from vending machines everywhere, including in railway stations for those long rides home. While you can't get it from a machine, you can still emulate those crafty Japanese with some great fresh-tasting sake out of a can right here in NYC.One of our favorites is Funaguchi Kikusui, a draft sake straight from the tank, unpasteurized with no additives. The can is perfect for preserving this fresh, easy drinking sake. Be careful though - these dynamite 200ml cans pack a punch since the sake is 19.8% alcohol. You can pick them up at Sakaya (324 E. 9th Street) for $6.99. Drink cold.Another sake available by the can, albeit in a larger 720ml version, is the delicious Narutotai Ginjo Nama Genshu. Let's break down the name -Narutotai is the name, ginjo is the type, nama means unpasteurized, and genshu means that no water was added at the end of the brewing process. This makes for a fresh, potent sake (18%+ alcohol) that is both rich and smooth. Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is selling the can right now for $32.99.

 What is the best new bar you can't get into? How about a new speakeasy (name TBD) that opened in a Village basement. And no, you likely can't get in right now.Places slipping in under the radar are a rarity in NYC. An unmarked basement location certainly helps. Limited operating hours, mostly on weekends, do too. Right now it is only an event space.But if you do make it in - with the secret password (available via text) given to the doorman - an underground world suddenly unfolds. The space is warm and welcoming, with nooks and crannies on either side of a long old school bar. Above is the requisite stuffed animal - a wolf's head peering down at the revelry. The decor (and staff) will be familiar to anyone who's been to Apotheke, Tailor or Clover Club - lots of wood, plush sofas, old-fashioned light fixtures. And there is an impressive amount a space, a welcome change from great but tiny places like PDT or Milk and Honey that but fill up quickly.The cellar has a fascinating history. It was once Pfaff's Beer Cellar, circa the early 1800s, and hosted Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, among others. Later incarnations included a photo studio where Abe Lincoln's portrait was taken, a 1900s brothel, the infamous Infinity Disco where 21 people died in a fire in the 1970s, and the gay club Mr. Black Dance Den.So what about the drinks? They are well-priced ($12 for cocktails) and well-balanced. We very much liked the eponymous Woodson and Ford (applejack, zacapa 23, benedictine, sweet vermouth, Fee brothers' whiskey barrel bitters). The Woodrow Wilson, however, would best be categorized as \"interesting\" since the flavors and booze - rittenhouse rye, amaro averna, champagne, demerara and orange zest - did not quite mesh. The floating ice cubes eventually melted and mellowed out the drink.The bar also has a nice vittles menu. The mostly Spanish-skewing plates range from $7 to $17 (kumamotos are $3 a pop) and come from the Corner Shop Cafe upstairs. Patatas Bravas deep fried in duck fat and served with homemade ketchup, were scrumptious ($7) while Fabada, fava beans and spiced pork, was good but overpriced at $11. The cheese selection (a hefty $6 each) is commendable, with Mrs. Quickie's cheddar, Tuxford & Tebbutt Stilton and Uplands Pleasant Ridge.After the jump, a look at the full cocktail menu plus other boozy details. We'll keep you posted on door policies and hours - we hear they might be opening on Mondays and Tuesdays as early as this week.Woodson and Ford643 Broadway, Downstairs

The woodrow Wilson is a variation in the jimmy Roosevelt which is a sophisticated palate, layered, champagne cocktail over ice. So interesting is right. As far as the space \"head bartender\" you will not receive any passwords. The unamed establishment is an event space. Clearly stealing our menus is frowned upon and since I would have seen you taking copious notes or taking photos I can only assume you vandalized our vintage books. I hope you enjoyed the event you attended but please fact check your blog. Woodson and ford is the zacapa cocktail name not the space.

Taking photos is easier than you think :) No books were vandalized in the process. You guys insist it's an event space and that's fine but I've never seen booze prices listed at a private party. That said, the place is great and we look forward to it being open for everyone.

The spot sounds cool and I'm looking forward to checking it out when it opens to the public. However, complaining about the positive coverage you're receiving as a result of this post doesn't make sense and is kinda lame. Having a bars status discussed on a NY blog is exactly where the conversation will play out. this blog just handed you the mic, and this is your oppertunity to clear up any misconceptions. Bashing the blogger for 'stealing' is not the message I would suggest. Social Media PR is tricky stuff, I would consider speaking with a firm that can help you navigate.

RQ, re: this whole password business--if you want to keep out the casual passerby/speakeasy stalker, why not just have a guest list like _every_ other private event in the city? I'd think that would be more effective, as then people can't just text their friends the password. And HB, I'm confused. Were you at a private party without realizing it?

2008-12-17 17:59:00
It was a birthday party for 2 people in the liquor industry. Apparently HB was invited by one of the hosts or managed to get swept in by the crowd. He sat center bar and ate food which was not included in the complimentary special cocktails paid for by the host. We were 6 deep so no one noticed the camera phone.

Here's the thing - nobody said it was not open or had anyone sign a non-disclosure agreement or the like. The city is rife with speakeasy marketing gimmicks like passwords and \"secret\" spots. The staff told us the place had been open a couple of weeks. They gave us hours. And when we were there, people were paying for their drinks. These are the facts. As for the post - you asked us to change the it and we did so. We look forward to the day when you are open to the public. H.B.

 The boozy season is upon us so here is our guide to surviving it - assuming your company still has the dough for a holiday party. The Head Bartender knows there's an equal chance you'll be naughty or nice, so here are some ways to make sure you keep your job and don't wind up making out with the boss at the end of the night:Keep in mind, holiday parties are extensions of work. Merry is good but don't make an ass of yourself.If you don't want to be seen on YouTube in it, don't wear it.Bring a partner or significant other to keep you in line. (This works as long as they don't imbibe as much or more than you.)Eat before drinking. Hit the carbs or the carving station - they'll give you good padding for a night of open bar.Go 1 for 1 water to booze to mitigate the effects. The last thing you want to do is call off the next day and be the endless butt of jokes. Leave one-half hour before the party is over. This way, you won't wind up drunk and uninhibited when the lights go out.The goal of attending an office party is to have a good time and survive with your dignity intact, not to get bombed. You'll thank us in the morning.

 Now that the dust has settled from the '08 elections, we can look at the effect the booze industry had on the race. And shocker of all shockers... it favored Democrats with donations this year. It's actually the first time since 1994 that the booze industry gave more to Democrats than Republicans - 52% - 48%, not too far off the popular vote of 53% - 46% for Pres Elect Obama. In all, the industry and individuals associated with it donated $12.997 million. Way to grease the rails of democracy! Out of 80 industries measured, the booze industry was #37 in terms of money donated. The numbers going back to the 1990 campaign are broken down at OpenSecrets.org.

***CONTENT
 You're probably not the only one confused by Ella and Elsa, two newish cocktail bars in the East Village that opened within weeks - and blocks - of each other. However, once you get past the names, there isn't a whole lot that the two places have in common.Ella is the slicker of the two joints, with Victoria's Secret-esque pink and black striped walls, a smoky underground performance space and velvet ropes out front. Assuming you can slip in past the doorman - they have a semi-strict door policy we bet gets dropped any minute- you'll find yourself in a glammed up space with a long bar and some banquettes up front. The drink list is impressively long - nine specialty cocktails, three champagne cocktails and eleven classic cocktails. We instinctively go for brown liquor so we tried the Clark Gable (maker's mark, lime, ginger-infused simple syrup) and it was the clear favorite. Finding another appealing drink was a bit of a challenge, however. The Mildred Pierce (bulldog gin, basil infused simple syrup, lime) was recommended by the bartender but highly acidic. Mommie Dearest (milagro tequila, lime, simple syrup, orange bitters) was also seriously out of balance and the Rye Smash (sazerac rye, muddled raspberries, lemon, simple syrup) was hardly a smashing success. In the meantime, a DJ bombarded us with some of the worst music this side of Jersey. Clearly Ella is for cool people. I guess they can hope to find a clientele too cool for taste buds.On to Elsa, over in Alphabet City. A former dive bar, the space was remade with a bespoke men's tailor in the front and a cocktail bar in the back. The room is kind of upstate antiques shop basic, with narrow booths up front across from a standing-only bar and rustic tables in the back. Mainly wood, the room is simple and bland (and way too bright), though we did like the barn-like effect of the bathroom ceiling. With the décor underwhelming, all we could hope for were some good cocktails. (There are also beers on tap, flowing through an old Singer sewing machine, and a few wines.) From the short list (4 signature concoctions and 4 classics), we tried The Jaszek (applejack, velvet falernum, lime, angostura, orange bitters) and the El Romero Borracho (souza blanco, grapefruit, campari, lime), coming away hopeful for the future. Both were balanced, complex and satisfying, showing skill on behalf of the resident mixologist. The Perfect Manhattan? Yes, please. When they get their feet wet, we'll be back for a second look.Ella9 Avenue A between 1st and 2nd streets, 212-777-2230Elsa217 E. 3rd Street between Avenue B and C, 917-882-7395

 We love eating at restaurant bars, in part because we prefer to chat up bartenders, but also because you have a lot more freedom in how and what you order. Unfortunately, something has started rubbing us the wrong way - restaurants charging wine prices for artisanal beers. OK folks, we know these beers are more expensive than your typical Bud or Coors Light but do they really cost you $3 each?New restaurants seem particularly egregious about jacking up beer prices. The John Dory has a tiny list of four beers, three for $8 and one for $9. I recall much better prices on the beers at sister restaurant The Spotted Pig. While they have only been open a few weeks, perhaps they'll see the light at the end of 10th Avenue and give beer drinkers a break.Irving Mill, a recent recipient of criticism for serving beer in less than pint size glasses, has a huge list of $7 and $8 tap beers. Ommegang from Cooperstown is $8? Brooklyn Pilsner is $7? That's pretty excessive in our opinion. Even worse, their list by the bottle has beers for $12 and $13.Perhaps restaurateurs are forced to raise beer prices because people will only pay so much for wine or food. But the approach is counter-productive. When faced with a list of over-priced artisanal beers, we now just tend to stop at one. What do you do?

You'll find it in Tiki drinks, classic Caribbean drinks like the Mai Tai and Zombie and, of course, in cool cocktails around NYC. The poplular brand is John D. Taylor Velvet Falernum from Barbados, which is an infusion of spices, sugar cane syrup and rum. You can try it in the unfortunately named Lovee Long Time at the new hotspot Macao Trading Co.

 Est Arrivee! Or something. Beaujolais Nouveau is the king of wine promotions - legally it cannot be served until the third Thursday of November and that means marketing up the wazoo to announce its somewhat dubious arrival. Here is where you can get your grapes off, so to speak:The king of promotions goes to producer Georges Duboeuf, which has an annual chef-biker ride to deliver Beaujolais. It's the middle of the day and involves no wine, so we say skip it.The FIAF (French Institute Alliance Francaise) has an event starting at 6:30pm. You can get all the BN you can drink plus food and entertainment. 22 East 60th Street, $55 for non-members. More infoJules Bistro (65 St. Marks) will be serving Antonin Rodet Beaujolais, which is a step up from Duboeuf. Jules has the added bonus of free bites at the bar, if you can get close enough, plus cool jazz. As an added bonus, you can pop in to register to win a free trip to France on Open Skies airline.

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 Somewhat under the radar but worthy of a visit is the snug bar at Yerba Buena (23 Avenue A), overseen by the talented Artemio Vasquez, who learned a trick or two from his former employer, the doyenne of New York cocktails herself, Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club. The house cocktails we sampled ($12) were very good: the Jamaica 107 (left, hibiscus tea infused bernheim wheat whiskey + organic egg white + fresh lemon juice) was a hit with grown men, despite its pretty hibiscus color, and the Boludo \"Yerba Mate\" (yerba mate infused pisco + grapefruit & lime cordials + fresh lemon juice) was deliciously refreshing. We hear those mojitos go down real smooth too.And if you stop in by December 30, you can partake in their ongoing celebration of the repeal of prohibition. Classic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2 and Vieux Carre are $10.Perhaps best of all, plunk down $11 for a brunch cocktail and they will keep sending them until you beg them to stop. Yup, unlimited mimosas, bellinis, French 75 or the Peruvian Kiss, which has trouble written all over it.Yerba Buena23 Avenue A (bet Houston & 2nd Street)212-529-2919

No BYOB in NYC?

 The SLA is diligently killing off the concept of BYOB for restaurants as evidenced by the latest report on Grub Street about Emporio's booze-less opening. Yup, no BYOB for them.As we've previously reported, the current laws are asinine - a restaurant can't be BYOB unless they have a liquor license (not even if you have applied and it is pending) but if they never intend to apply, they are not under the SLA's authority and thus they can't do anything to stop you. The cops could, theoretically, but we doubt they'll be raiding anyone over this.A much better idea would be to re-write the laws to allow any restaurant to be BYOB and to streamline the licensing procedure for restaurants. There was a movement to separate restaurants from bars and clubs but that seems to be up in the air. In the meantime, since it's clear people want booze with their dinner, shouldn't our state reps help foster a system that is a win-win for both customers and restaurant owners? Cause this cockamanie system is terrible for everyone and has damaged too many restaurants to count.

BYOB without a liquor license is always illegal, whether or not you're applying for license through the SLA. And even if you are, the SLA doesn't do anything to stop you. They'll just take note of the fact that you illegally allowed BYOB while your license was pending. It's true that cops probably aren't going to go door to door with no-license restaurants to enforce the law, but if, say, you have an upstairs neighbor that you've pissed off, they can call the cops on you, and then they'll HAVE to investigate.

 Disturbing news for New Yorkers - most BYO restaurants are breaking the law according to a story in Crains New York. As we previously reported, restaurants need to have a liquor license to allow BYO - unless they are under 20 seats. If they open and are applying for a license, they may jeopardize the application's status by allowing BYO. It's unclear what the consequences are since the SLA (State Liquor Authority) only has jurisdiction if an application for a license is underway - no application, no SLA authority. Then enforcement fall on the police.

 Liquor license woes are legendary in New York these days. All too often restaurants have to open without one. It gets reported in the media at opening time but then we are left to wonder - did they ever get that license? Heck, do they even want one? Here's an update on the status at some local favorites. Each restaurant has its charms and fans will attest to the food, but saving a few bucks on booze is an additional plus, especially these days.Motorino, East Williamsburg pizza hotspot (319 Graham Ave), is still without a liquor license. They welcome you to bring in beer or wine. Another Brooklyn pizza mecca, Lucali (575 Henry Street, Carroll Gardens), has also remained sans liquor license so pack your own. (Photo - Motorino pie)Petite self-professed \"neo-Korean\" East Villager Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street) is still going strong in the wake of summer critical praise and the Times review. Their website cryptically says they are \"BYOB again,\" so go ahead.Kuma Inn (113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor) continues to wow them on the LES. They are BYO for the time being but they do have corkage fees, depending on your booze of choice: $5 for 750ml wine, $1 per 12oz beer, $3 for 300ml of sake, $4 for 720ml of sake and $10 for 1.5L. No hard liquor allowed.

Please clarify, if the place doesn't have a liquor license, by law you can't charge customers even for services related to alcohol ie \"corkage\" I have no problem tipping the server for the extra service, just giving more money to an undeserving proprietor.

 We've never been to any incarnation of the Russian Tea Room (150 W. 57th Street) so we have no qualms with it. However, their newest deal, coming to us via Eater's Dealfeed, seems a bit suspect. For the month of April, if you order the \"Business Express Lunch\" for $35 they will give you a free vodka martini to wash it down. Strikes us as an odd promotion - how many people want a vodka martini in the middle of the day? Especially when they are ordering an express lunch?

 Today, Eric Asimov wrote a piece in The New York Times about little known Italian wines that are a good value. Unfortunately, the paper didn't include the most helpful information - where to buy them! That's right folks, the paper decided to only list importers since it insists on having a national food section. Too bad that isn't much help to New Yorkers.Here are a couple of our favorite places to pick up Italian wines from $10 to $20:Smith & Vine (268 Smith Street, Brooklyn) has a great selection - 50 different bottles in that price range.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is even more impressive, with over 90 wines in this price range.Enoteca DiPalo (200 Grand Street) opened in November two doors down from the original DiPalo, featuring wine from each of Italy's 20 regions. While the prices are generally higher than the Times range, more like $15 - $29 for most bottles, the selection includes some hard to find wines and is chosen with the usual DiPalo family care.Let us know where you like to pick up Italian (or any other) wines.

We peered over the screens covering up the windows and saw an empty room, save a ladder in the center. Was their transformation from set menu to a la carte not enough to keep the restaurant afloat? Or is there a problem with the space that needed fixing? The outgoing message on the restaurant's machine gives no hint of closure and Open Table has tables available from Wednesday on (Mon and Tues not available).UPDATE 2/2/09 12:30pm - A call to the restaurant confirms the closure is temporary due to unspecified problems and they hope to be open Thursday or Friday.

 Why, we wonder, can't people just leave wine the way it is? First they added sugar-free sweetener to it. Now we have a \"new wine craze\" straight out of Cherry Valley, Ohio: Fruiteasers. Emerine Estates Winery has created a line of wine that uses a base such as chardonnay, riesling or merlot then adds in various fruits including apple, peach, blueberry and pineapple to create \"exotic fruit wines.\" Now, we don't mind old-fashioned wines made out of fruit (other than grapes). But why boost wines that naturally may have notes such as pineapple (riesling) or blueberries (merlot) with actual fruit? Or in the case of Seduction, a pinot noir with coffee, mocha, vanilla, cherries and chocolate. Are the wines themselves not enough? More of the head-scratching offerings here - Strawberry Shortcake Wine anyone? Speaking of cake, this wine definitely takes it: \"As seen on TV, its true (sic!), a 100% pure Chardonnay with Amish butter.\" No, we're not making this up. The name of the wine? Tear Drops. How a propos.

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

 A while back, we slapped Perbacco on the wrist for selling warm wine and placing candles in front of wine bottles. Unfortunately, new restaurant Sorella (95 Allen Street) is another offender. We slipped in for a glass of wine the other day and were impressed by the design and the attention to detail in everything from an interesting wine selection to the printed materials. Then we looked up to see wine everywhere.Folks, we can't stress enough that you store wine for customers properly. Having wine stored on shelves lit by candles is pretty but it's not wine we want to drink. Even worse, when the temperature control on the room's thermostat is set in the upper 70s, we get really concerned for the wine.The winelist is heavily skewed towards Northern Italy (good) but very pricey (bad). Since the cooking is skewed towards Piemontese, the region wines are well represented. Unfortunately, bottles under $50 are in short supply and the bulk of the reds from Piedmont were over $80. Wines by the glass tend towards the obscure, which is fine, but nothing we tried was really delicious. Prices by the glass, $10 to $17, would be fair if the pours were more generous. Right now they skimpy.

 We'd heard a lot of good things about Perbacco (234 E. 4th Street), so we popped in recently for dinner and ordered a bottle of red wine without a second thought. Then we noticed something odd - the wine was warm in the glass. It seemed the glasses themselves were warm so we had them replaced. New glasses arrived after several minutes and we were each poured wine - but the wine was still warm. Then we felt the bottle. Warm. Normally we'd ask for another bottle but in this particular situation it was not an option and the wine was quite drinkable, especially after it cooled off a bit. The culprit? Wine stored on shelves in the open - with votives in front of them keeping them nice and toasty. Message to restaurant owners - store your wine properly! If you do it for \"atmosphere,\" use those bottles as decor only - don't serve them to customers!As for the surprise two stars the restaurant received from the New York Times? Talk about a headscratcher of a review. Only the prices seemed to be at a two-star level. The cooking, mainly deconstructed Italian dishes, was okay but flavors and deliciousness were lost in the deconstruction process and the service was just average. We poured our own wine all night. There are plenty of better 1 star places.If you know of other crimes against wine, or any other booze, drop us a line or leave a comment.

Deal or No Deal? - Bar Blanc Bistro

***CONTENT
 With just two days left in the Bar Blanc Bistro (142 West 10th Street) opening week deal, we decided to pop in and see how they were doing. The bar was fairly busy but the restaurant mostly empty when we arrived. We grabbed a pair of empty seats at the bar and were handed the menus. The bartender clearly explained the half-off deal and the exclusions - no bottled beer, burger or oysters for half price. Fair enough, we thought, since the bar menu had a good bit of choice.The half-off special applied to draft beer, wine by the glass and carafe, and house cocktails. (The not-included bottled beer is your typical rip-off with $7 Stellas, Leffe and Hoegaarden). There were lots of choices among the cocktails, normally $12, generally classics or riffs on them including a caipiroska, sidecar (very popular) and a grapefruit martinis. We stuck to beer and wine. The Grimbergen ale was new to us but quite good (normally $7) if a bit sweet at the bottom of the glass while Blue Moon is... Blue Moon. Wines were interesting but suffered from being too warm and open for a while. A Pinot Noir from France was good but neither the mundane Tempranillo nor the White Bordeaux excited us.Food-wise, we enjoyed most everything - the chicken liver mousse was very good as were the beef croquettes, though the underlying mustard was way too hot. The burger was large and juicy while fries were perfectly crisped.Overall, the space looks the same from its previous incarnation (pre-bistro). It certainly doesn't read bistro and it's way too dark - reading menus was only possible by candlelight. Will this incarnation make it? Certainly the bar is comfortable but beer and wine are a bit too expensive for it to be a regular stop. The restaurant itself is a tougher sell and they have their work cut out for them. The previous restaurants struggled in the same space so you have to wonder if it is cursed. In the meantime, is it a deal? Heck yea! 50% off the entire check (tip on the whole amount fellow boozers). We suggest you hurry over before it expires tomorrow night at 8pm. Rumor has it they will have some type of happy hour after the deal is gone but it won't be nearly as good.

Tonight you can play out the classic Northern vs Southern Italy rivalry by trying four wines. On Saturday, you can try four more Italian wines as well as some Woodford Reserve Bourbon (the best bourbon there is in our humble opinion) in honor of Kentucky Derby day.Lastly, as much as we'd like to avoid it, Cinco de Mayo is coming up.

 A lot of time large scale tastings covering a certain region or country are not great ways to showcase wine - too much filler, too little interesting product. Thankfully, the Wines of Portugal event held this Tuesday intrigued us enough to overcome our skepticism, and thankfully we found lots of interesting wines - some available in the U.S. and some not.The wineries present represented all of Portugal's growing areas and specialized in whites, reds and ports along with a smattering of rose and sparkling wines. We stuck to the indigenous grapes such as Alvarinho, Arinto, Aragones and Touriga Nacional, avoiding the more international styles whenever possible.Here are some of the highlights, with a focus on wines that have distribution in place and thus possible to find in stores and restaurants:

Over 100 of them in fact inside Chelsea Piers at the annual whiskey showcase \"Whisky Live\".The good stuff was distributed over 38 stations while around the corner various Scottish bands played fast and furious. Already familiar with the Highland Park, Oban and Macallan, we headed straight to the lesser known brands. The focus of the show is Scotch but there were also Bourbons, Rye, Blended Scotches and more. A lot of good stuff was being poured and we wasted no time exploring. Our favorites after the jump.

 Few things go as well together as pizza and beer. Unfortunately, few things are as ripe for extreme mark-up as those two items. In the case of Co., or Company as you like, don't expect the recession to mean customer-friendly pricing.We'll come right out and say it - we were underwhelmed. The pizzas were small (about 11\") and the edges of the ballyhooed crust were almost reminiscent of Pizza Hut. The crust itself was pretty good, but the toppings deserved to be seasoned properly though, with salt definitely missing in action. And the pizzas seemed overloaded with cheese and bechamel, guess to explain the pricing - the majority of pizzas are $16 to $18 and appetizer up-selling is heavy.But this is a booze blog. And there is nothing more depressing than staring at a beer list where everything is $7. Really, $7 for Blue Moon, Sixpoint and Stella? While we're at it, could they come up with a more cliched list of beers? What possible justification can there be for marking up beer over 500% anyway?We here at Boozy are getting real tired of being ripped off for the privilege of drinking designer beers - not to mention the Belgian equivalent of Bud. If restaurateurs have so little respect for beer drinkers that they view them merely as a profit center, maybe they should just stop serving beer. On this particular day, we silently drank water. That is not our preferred dining mode.

 One of our readers has a bone to pick with the media, especially today's AM New York pizza article. \"Can everyone please stop calling Artichoke \"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery\"? The place is not a brewery! They have two beers - Bud and Bud Light available in 32 oz styrofoam cups for $5.50! Give me a break.\"We have to say he has a point. The media often just blindly repeats nonsense without doing even basic research. We don't care if the owners want it called by such a nonsensical moniker, the place is known as Artichoke to everyone and that's what we'll call it. Oh, and singling out Lombardi's as a \"legend\" is just wrong. The place is a tourist trap with overloaded crappy pizza. It's high time the media stop pushing that place as worth a visit.

 Time Out New York would seem to be a fan of our own Manhattan Project - why else would they advertise the \"Perfect Manhattan\" on the cover of this week's issue? Sure, the article delves into NYC themed drinks that the Manhattan has inspired, but why do they fumble so badly when highlighting where to have the original?Our guess is the writer was not aware of our own post about the Bemelman's experience - short version: dated room, overpriced drinks and a piss poor Manhattan made by someone who could have cared less. We'd actually be willing to bet that the writer did not set foot in Bemelman's for the story - since the default Manhattan when we were there was made with Makers, which is certainly not a rye as listed in the recipe on TONY's website. Not to mention that the recipe doesn't even include bitters. Huh?Among their picks for Manhattan-inspired cocktails, our favorite is the Little Italy at Pegu Club. Basically a somewhat bitter Manhattan, made with Cynar, it's one of our favorite drinks around town.

Other than the Bemelman's blunder, I think it's a pretty good list. I'm a big fan of the Greenpoint, and am happy to see that Max at Jack the Horse made the list--although am worried that all this exposure may mean the end of quiet nights at \"my\" bar...

 We popped into Bemelman's the other night for a quick drink and found the room surprisingly busy for a cold January weeknight. Whether this was due to the live music or the famed bar being bullet-proof in our recessionary times is unclear, but the welcome at the bar itself was hardly warm and inviting.Even before sitting, the bartender warned us there would be a $10 per person cover charge ($20 each at the tables, more on weekends). Then we looked at the menu - $19 for a cocktail. Sheesh. The list has fallen a ways since Audrey Saunders redid it and seemed tailored to the crowd. We were talked out of the famed \"punch of the day\" ($15) by the gruff bartender, who implied the punch is the same every day and predictably suggested the most expensive drink ($20). Instead, we got a barely stirred Manhattan made with Makers that was rough, to say the least. They do give you a sidecar and the nuts are good.The room itself has seen better days, even though it was renovated in 2002. The famed murals seemed dim and the large piano right in the middle of the room forces you to dodge musicians and tables to reach the bar. The bar itself is merely functional, and the footrail was partially dislodged and not a secure place for feet.I guess the joint is content to ride on its history and good will of the aged clientele. But who knows for how long at these prices?Bemelman's BarThe Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th Street (at Madison)

 We love eating at restaurant bars, in part because we prefer to chat up bartenders, but also because you have a lot more freedom in how and what you order. Unfortunately, something has started rubbing us the wrong way - restaurants charging wine prices for artisanal beers. OK folks, we know these beers are more expensive than your typical Bud or Coors Light but do they really cost you $3 each?New restaurants seem particularly egregious about jacking up beer prices. The John Dory has a tiny list of four beers, three for $8 and one for $9. I recall much better prices on the beers at sister restaurant The Spotted Pig. While they have only been open a few weeks, perhaps they'll see the light at the end of 10th Avenue and give beer drinkers a break.Irving Mill, a recent recipient of criticism for serving beer in less than pint size glasses, has a huge list of $7 and $8 tap beers. Ommegang from Cooperstown is $8? Brooklyn Pilsner is $7? That's pretty excessive in our opinion. Even worse, their list by the bottle has beers for $12 and $13.Perhaps restaurateurs are forced to raise beer prices because people will only pay so much for wine or food. But the approach is counter-productive. When faced with a list of over-priced artisanal beers, we now just tend to stop at one. What do you do?

If you buy a pint, you'll get the second one for $3. The Stegmaier Amber (Lion Brewery, Wilkes Barre, PA) pairs well with creative pizzas like the Good Girl (kale, tallegio, Berkshire pork sausage) and Specken Wolf (speck, mushrooms, oregano, onion, mozzarella). Other options include a hoppy Recessionator from Brooklyn brewmeisters Kelso and the ubiquitous Blue Point and Six Point. Canned beer, the bane of our existence, is represented with six entries, but thankfully does not include the odious PBR.

 We noticed an odd sight outside FiDi's Gild Hall, a fancy Thompson Hotel venture complete with an upscale celeb chef resto - a whiteboard promoting happy hour. The joint, fancifully named the Libertine, opened with typical fanfare due to the name of its chef Todd English - English does English! - but failed to thrill both critics and diners.The beer-heavy ($4 Stellas, $5 Draughts) happy hour skews heavily towards guys with an appetite for oysters. The $1 - 1.50 oysters are a nice touch, but hey, how about something liquid for the ladies? Unlike Gild Hall, the trendy Thompson production, and Libertine, which was supposed to evoke London clubhouses circa 1970s (monied? plush?), the whiteboard sign is decidedly downscale and uninviting. Frankly, it looks to us like it was pulled from a back office (we hope the conference rooms' boards are cleaner than this!). Dear Management, this is the most passive-aggressive approach to promoting happy hour we've ever seen. Are you sure you want anyone coming in?The Libertine15 Gold StreetHappy Hour: 5pm - 7pm

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel.

 We've had sparkling sake, dessert sake, aged sake, sake in a can, and now... sake in a jar. Yup the latest craze (maybe) is sake in a 200ml jar, the perfect size to slip into your suit jacket for that long ride home. Long popular in Japan, especially among commuting businessmen, single serve sakes have slowly been making their way into the U.S. market. Wakatsuru in Toyama (Western Japan) makes one of the first to be offered in a jar, a full-bodied and flavorful Junmai Daiginjo. The sake was good but better with food than on its own. And not quite as good as our favorite single-serve sake, Funaguchi Kikusui.Available at Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street, website). $5.99 per bottle.

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

***CONTENT
 When is a beer too fancy? That question is a common one these days as restaurants continue to look for ways to jack up prices with obscure beers and importers bring in ever more product. Case in point, Kasteel Cru, a fairly new arrival on the scene from Alsace, France made with champagne yeast and now selling at Whole Foods for $4.99 a bottle.That's a fair amount of scratch in these times, even for a lifestyle beer which this clearly is. So we picked up a bottle to see what the hype is all about. The first taste is of a well made lager with a bit of an effervescent character. Sipping further, we found that the slight bitterness of the initial taste seemed to mellow into an almost bubbly quality. This actually counteracts the \"beerness\" of the beer and makes the taste less cohesive but certainly makes for a bit of lightness in the mouth feel.We were curious how the beer held up over, say a half hour or sipping. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite hold the effervescence and gets a bit out of balance with more bitterness evident. The beer was passable with food and seemed best suited to cheese.All in all, it's a good, not great beer, with a fancy pedigree and way-too-high price. Stick with the regular lagers unless you're showing off new found wealth for a friend.

Whether he can raise the $2 million is up for debate but it would be rather cool to have the city's first distillery since Prohibition.

CB2 Recap - Martignetti Gets Reamed, Cafe Noir a No-Show and a New Pera

***CONTENT
 Surprises and contentious moments abounded at last night's Community Board 2 meeting. Biggest of all was the curve ball thrown by the Martignetti brothers. Seems they want to split their liquor license and hold onto the basement club while giving over the ground floor to Cafe Noir... Except it's not Cafe Noir! Instead, Burak Karacam, managing partner of Pera, was before the board to apply for the license the Martignettis want to relinquish on the first floor - in addition to applying for a license for a new Pera at 54 Thompson. The folks from Cafe Noir were nowhere in sight and didn't answer the call, likely signaling the end of the road for that rumored takeover.Unfortunately for the attending brother, Tom Martignetti, the knives came out almost immediately. After several minutes explaining the idea of splitting a license and then bringing in someone else to run the restaurant independently, we witnessed a fascinating (not) discussion of ingress and egress. But lo the board was confused by this idea of two separate joints. Who's the other guy (Burak) and is this legal they asked. How did you get a license in the first place - did you apply as one entity, etc etc. Poor Tom stumbled along as they failed to grasp what he was saying - he didn't express the idea clearly enough to my mind but I still understood the point A vociferous board member signaled it would be a rough ride though, launching into a speech that there were too many liquor licenses in the area and that even if they rescinded one, they should not issue more than a beer & wine license. Then came the neighbors.

 World wine consumption went down almost 1% last year but the U.S. increased its consumption according to The International Organization of Vine and Wine. Europe was the main culprit for the drop, with France, Italy and Germany all drinking less wine than in the past. In fact, the U.S. passed Italy for the first time in wine consumption. Both Canada and Australia did their part, consuming more wine than the year before. And in another shift, Europe accounted for less than half the world's wine production for the first time. Brazil is a big up-and-coming producer with about 100,000 hectares now under production.

 The cash-strapped state government has apparently caved in to the liquor store lobby and taken the bill to expand wine sales to grocery stores to the woodshed. Crains NY is reporting the effort died today, another example of Governor Paterson's astounding political ineptitude. All across the state, crappy corner liquor stores are rejoicing as they get to stay in business due to a serious lack of competition. Meanwhile, the rest of us just scratch our heads in disbelief.

 A reader sent us a link to a Craigslist post entitled \"Opening a New Restaurant?\" featuring a sale of restaurant equipment at a familiar sounding address - 171 East Broadway - that made us curious. A quick Google search revealed the sale at none other than Broadway East. It's wrapping up this afternoon but you may be able to pick up pots, pans, toasters, knives and lots more. The listing is clearly written in a tone that worries it may signal impending doom - \"we bought too much\" - but it nonetheless strikes us as a bad sign for a place that can't be doing well in an off the beaten path location.

 The sad truth of this recession is no one and no thing is being spared. Even booze sales are now officially down. Conventional wisdom says that \"sins\" like booze and cigarettes survive well during recessions as people try to chemically cope with a depressing reality. But this recession is proving a lot of people wrong.Bloomberg reported yesterday that \"take-out sales of alcoholic beverages tumbled 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter\", the largest decline in fifty years of record keeping. The biggest bust? Surprisingly beer, down 14%. Wine was down 1.6% and liquor 0.9%. If you're into this sort of stuff, a handy chart at FiveThirtyEight.com shows the ups and downs of booze vis a vis GDP.

However, we will honor Eater's standing request to not publish the number, even if Ben Leventhal - a former UD consultant - had self-serving motives in writing the post. We get it, we like to get in too.Update: Seems the info is very public now - thanks to a Grub Street reader for pointing us in the right direction. For their website go here.

 Lots of booze news to report today:Grub Street has the closing date for Red Hook booze-arium LeNell's - February 20. This of course is due to the dreaded \"lease issues\" and we can only wonder what kind of crack their landlord is smoking.Eater is on the scene with a report of how the Feds quashed Six Point Ale's \"Hop Obama\" brew. Seems the Dept of Homeland Security put the \"kabosh\" on the whole thing and even threatened seizure. Ouch.Lastly, we are somewhat intrigued that Dan Aykroyd is at Astor Wines today (12pm - 2pm) to shill for his vodka. Huh? Yup, you can get autographs but you can't taste the vodka. Guess you'll have to fork over $50 and let us know how if it's worth it.

 Ninth Avenue in the area around Port Authority has never been the pretty part of town, and the Holland Cocktail Lounge (532 9th Avenue) has always seemed to fit right in. There was nothing modern or sceney about the neighborhood dive but it did the job, until its recent closure that is, due to the landlord trying to sell the building. Given the state of the market, that effort went nowhere and so the bar is open again, per Grub Street, and ready to serve $4 beers. In this day and age, that's something.

 Crain's New York is reporting that liquor stores are up in arms over the proposal by Governor Paterson to expand sales of wine to grocery stores in an attempt to raise money for the state budget. 2,700 of them have banded together to form a coalition called \"The Last Store on Main Street\" to fight the proposal, which could lead to an additional 19,000+ licenses to sell wine.New York State has long been backwards in laws related to selling wine. Recall that only a few years ago, all liquor stores were closed on Sundays as if this were the deep South. Some of these same stores fought the change because they argued Sunday hours favored big liquor stores over mom & pop shops. They were wrong about that and they are wrong about this.Fewer than ten states limit wine sales to liquor stores. New Jersey has tons of liquor stores and you can buy wine in supermarkets. If you peruse the aisle of a Jersey supermarket, you'll find a good deal of plonck among the mostly pedestrian choices. If you want interesting or hard to find wine, you go to a liquor store. The same would happen in New York - not to mention that you would still have to buy liquor at a liquor store. Also, let's not forget that stores in New York City don't even have all that much room for wine due to high real estate costs - stuff is already stacked to the ceiling. Where are they going to put so much wine that it puts shops out of business? However, we do think wine shops should be able to sell more than alcohol - cheese, mixers and beer come to mind. We also support the proposal to allow shops to have multiple licenses - creating mini-chains that can then leverage distributors for better deals. Let's level the playing field and let capitalism take over, shall we?

 The New York Times reported yesterday that Long Island vintner Robert Palmer died last week, making him the second winemaker to pass away within weeks after the tragic accident took Christian Wolffer's life in South America over the New Year's holiday. Palmer, though a pioneer in Long Island winemaking, was an ad man by trade and, as befits all true \"Mad Men,\" professed to like a good martini. Yet this non wine drinker still managed to build Palmer Vineyards into a well respected winery and popular tourist attraction. His ingenuity will live on as Long Island grows in stature as a world class wine region.

 It seems like the inauguration of the 44th President of the United States on Tuesday has suddenly become a reason to get sloshed. How ironic then that the new president replaces a reformed drunk. But in these times, any excuse to booze up is good enough for us.In honor of the historic occasion, many DC bars already got permission to stay open 2 extra hours and Maryland bars also got an extended hour. Meanwhile in NYC, email inboxes have been flooded with inauguration day promotions and websites are falling all over themselves to provide you with spots to celebrate history. Here are just a handful of places with inauguration day specials:

 Thrillist, Eater, et al posted yesterday about a new speakeasy - yes, narrow space, downstairs, unmarked door, yada yada - called Raines Law Room (48 W. 17th Street) and immediately a couple of skeptics weighed in. Seems some people are tired of speakeasies and we can understand that - everything from tiny PDT, the world's most promoted speakeasy, to Woodson and Ford, the open but not basement joint on Bleecker Street, has started to grate on folks. These days, people want to drink and they kind of prefer places that a) they can get into and b) they can find.One of the bartenders hastily leapt to the spot's defense, promising \"it's not like any other bar in town.\" Now it's arguable that was even necessary since only two commenters initially posted their skepticism and it was hardly the usual Eater vitriol. Of course, the bartender's response opened him up for further criticism and a good bit of hole was dug, though he was certainly diligent and fair in his comments. However, it might serve folks working at speakeasies to be a little less sensitive to internet comments.From our perspective, the place actually sounds intriguing and we don't mind the concept - assuming they have a policy of actually letting people in. We'll let you know how that Old Fashioned tastes, it does sound like a delicious version. Raines Law Room48 W. 17th Street, downstairs, unmarked door

 We popped into the \"soft opening\" of City Winery last night not knowing what to expect. Eater and Grub Street had written it up, there were a bunch of good wine deals and there is a big PR machine behind it. What we found, was a bit of a surprise - a cavernous space (at most a third full around 8:30pm) and a big stage with a piano. There are cool looking barrels and bottles-as-decor, too. Granted it was the day before New Year's Eve and the location, two blocks north of the Holland Tunnel, is challenging, but we expected a much bigger turnout of oenophiles.The first thing that strikes you about City Winery is the sheer size of the place. All blond wood, we can only imagine the acoustics when it is full. The main floor is the restaurant/bar/performance space with a small private room downstairs. Designed for maximum sightlines in relation to the stage, this unfortunately means that when there is no performance, your eyes are drawn to the emptiness of the stage. And with a room that large, you have to wonder how they will fill it when there are no performances. The opening night was low key and all about the wines. And the deals were impressive: $5 Henriot champagne, $20 for a 1970 Francesco Rinaldi Barolo, $15 Lopez de Heredia 1987 Rioja, $10 Olga Riffaut's 1989 Chinon - all well worth the price, even though there was significant bottle variation. The glass pours were generous and tastes were provided as well. This was easily the best place to taste old vintages in New York last night - how often does one get a chance to taste 20 and 30 year old wines by the glass? And at these prices?!

 What is the best new bar you can't get into? How about a new speakeasy (name TBD) that opened in a Village basement. And no, you likely can't get in right now.Places slipping in under the radar are a rarity in NYC. An unmarked basement location certainly helps. Limited operating hours, mostly on weekends, do too. Right now it is only an event space.But if you do make it in - with the secret password (available via text) given to the doorman - an underground world suddenly unfolds. The space is warm and welcoming, with nooks and crannies on either side of a long old school bar. Above is the requisite stuffed animal - a wolf's head peering down at the revelry. The decor (and staff) will be familiar to anyone who's been to Apotheke, Tailor or Clover Club - lots of wood, plush sofas, old-fashioned light fixtures. And there is an impressive amount a space, a welcome change from great but tiny places like PDT or Milk and Honey that but fill up quickly.The cellar has a fascinating history. It was once Pfaff's Beer Cellar, circa the early 1800s, and hosted Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, among others. Later incarnations included a photo studio where Abe Lincoln's portrait was taken, a 1900s brothel, the infamous Infinity Disco where 21 people died in a fire in the 1970s, and the gay club Mr. Black Dance Den.So what about the drinks? They are well-priced ($12 for cocktails) and well-balanced. We very much liked the eponymous Woodson and Ford (applejack, zacapa 23, benedictine, sweet vermouth, Fee brothers' whiskey barrel bitters). The Woodrow Wilson, however, would best be categorized as \"interesting\" since the flavors and booze - rittenhouse rye, amaro averna, champagne, demerara and orange zest - did not quite mesh. The floating ice cubes eventually melted and mellowed out the drink.The bar also has a nice vittles menu. The mostly Spanish-skewing plates range from $7 to $17 (kumamotos are $3 a pop) and come from the Corner Shop Cafe upstairs. Patatas Bravas deep fried in duck fat and served with homemade ketchup, were scrumptious ($7) while Fabada, fava beans and spiced pork, was good but overpriced at $11. The cheese selection (a hefty $6 each) is commendable, with Mrs. Quickie's cheddar, Tuxford & Tebbutt Stilton and Uplands Pleasant Ridge.After the jump, a look at the full cocktail menu plus other boozy details. We'll keep you posted on door policies and hours - we hear they might be opening on Mondays and Tuesdays as early as this week.Woodson and Ford643 Broadway, Downstairs

The woodrow Wilson is a variation in the jimmy Roosevelt which is a sophisticated palate, layered, champagne cocktail over ice. So interesting is right. As far as the space \"head bartender\" you will not receive any passwords. The unamed establishment is an event space. Clearly stealing our menus is frowned upon and since I would have seen you taking copious notes or taking photos I can only assume you vandalized our vintage books. I hope you enjoyed the event you attended but please fact check your blog. Woodson and ford is the zacapa cocktail name not the space.

The spot sounds cool and I'm looking forward to checking it out when it opens to the public. However, complaining about the positive coverage you're receiving as a result of this post doesn't make sense and is kinda lame. Having a bars status discussed on a NY blog is exactly where the conversation will play out. this blog just handed you the mic, and this is your oppertunity to clear up any misconceptions. Bashing the blogger for 'stealing' is not the message I would suggest. Social Media PR is tricky stuff, I would consider speaking with a firm that can help you navigate.

Here's the thing - nobody said it was not open or had anyone sign a non-disclosure agreement or the like. The city is rife with speakeasy marketing gimmicks like passwords and \"secret\" spots. The staff told us the place had been open a couple of weeks. They gave us hours. And when we were there, people were paying for their drinks. These are the facts. As for the post - you asked us to change the it and we did so. We look forward to the day when you are open to the public. H.B.

 A recent trip to Franny's in Brooklyn - still one of the the best pizza joints in NYC in our opinion - led to the discovery of an amaro (bitter) called Nardini. A bartender liked it enough to create an eponymous cocktail, which we thoroughly enjoyed as an aperitivo, and they were nice enough to provide us with the recipe.

Hi there! It's the team from franny's here! Just one correction to the recipe above, we actually DO NOT use Carpano Antica Formula in the Nardini Cocktail, it's just Bulldog Gin and Nardini Amaro! The rest of the portions are correct. Thanks for the support and we hope to see you soon at franny's! Best, Nekisia General Manager

That's odd, they wrote it out for us and it had Carpano Antica. Thanks for letting us know. We made a version with Cynar and Sweet Vermouth since we didn't have Nardini. It worked really well and was similar in taste to the Nardini. When we get some Nardini Amaro, I'll try it both ways and let the readers know.

 It's no secret we are big fans of Woodford Reserve bourbon here at BoozyNYC. Recently, we came across a yummy recipe for The Morris Cocktail from Jamie Boudreau, mixologist at Seattle's Vessel - a great drink spot right in the middle of that city's downtown. The recipe's not new but the drink is so good, it doesn't matter. If it strikes your fancy, Raines' Law Room does a good version of it locally. And Boudreau's blog is full of really good cocktail recipes you should check out.The full recipe after the jump...

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

Metromix has a new slide show up of Hot Toddies at joints around town, including one of our faves - Tribeca's The Brandy Library (25 N. Moore). The article is curious, however, in its Brooklyn slant - three of the five places listed are in Brooklyn.

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel. Juice oranges. Add OJ to sugar with peel. Pour boiling water and Arrack over the mix. Add hot (but not boiling) wine. Stir. Serve.

 We're not restaurant reviewers per se but we can't let things go unnoticed when we pop into places for drinks and a few bites. Case in point - Bar Artisanal, where we were subjected to amateurish service and underwhelming food.After being seated, we waited ten minutes for some attention from the staff. Then a particularly zealous manager appeared - and gave us the \"evening's menus\" and a brief overview of how they are designed. Huh? This is a casual place? Then he circled the table, calling everyone sir and answering every request with \"my pleasure.\" By the end of the circle, he had dispensed so much pleasure that we thought we'd need to book a room in the hotel upstairs.Next up, some crimes against wine.

Raines Law Room Revisited

***CONTENT
 Recently we found ourselves in Chelsea and close enough to Raines Law Room (48 West 17th Street) that we decided to pop in for a spot check. The room was busy as usual and Paul, the host, was deftly juggling the crowds as we settled into one of the snug booths. The first time around, we loved the space and some of the cocktails but found imprecise execution in certain drinks. Our recent visit showed a bit surer hand behind the bar but still some issues to work out. And we have now learned our lesson - ignore the specials, which can be hit or miss, but generally don't justify the $16 pricetag for \"premium ingredients.\" Heck $13 is a bit steep for drinks in this day and age.Right away we re-visited the Gold Rush and made sure the waitress knew we liked a good amount of bourbon in it. The version we got was as good as we remembered it (after it was fixed the last time). We also tried the Smoke and Mirrors again - this time it was sweeter than we liked and just okay. Seems like execution is still an issue with this drink and as much as we want to like it, we just can't recommend it. Other specials included the Frida (Don Julio tequila, aperol topped with moet chandon), which was okay, and the Sylvia (made with Tanqueray Ten and a touch of absinthe), which was pretty good.Back ordering off the menu, we enjoyed both the Archangel and Corpse Reviver #2. A Manhattan made with Bulleit was terrific but the revelation was a perfectly made Negroni. One thing that sets Raines Law Room apart is the service - the staff, from the busboys to the waitresses, is really accomodating and without a trace of attitude. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the drinks and also extremely nice. And as we walked out into the night, Paul was as gracious as ever.

 A tequila and mezcal cocktail bar? Just try keeping us away. Mayahuel is one sexy space, from the dark brown bar to the tiny tiled tables opposite to the plush lounge upstairs. With bar-master Phil Ward (Death & Co.) the brains behind it, expectations were high for the cocktails and we are happy to report we were not disappointed.The Lapsong Punch (lapsong suchong infused \"tea-killa,\" lemon, grapefruit and whiskey barrel bitters) is a great drink to start off, nicely balanced, light and citrusy-smoky. The Smoked Palomino (amontillado sherry, mezcal, grapefruit, lime, salted rim) was delicious, unique and a rare find: a good sherry drink. The Pequeno Cabeza (blanco, grapefruit infused vermouth, amaro and maraschino) was an inventive take on the Manhattan. The Slight Detour (jalapeno tequila, reposado and joven mezcal, agave nectar and Xocolati mole bitters) made for interesting drinking - both the chocolate and orange came through the booze, almost dessert-like. Like the Cabeza, it's a pretty potent concoction.El Jimadors Shifty didn't work as well - the pineapple-infused mezcal didn't cut through the Negra Modelo and was MIA until we drank through the beer and found it on the bottom.UrbanDaddy has a great slideshow that shows off the interiors.

***CONTENT
 Apotheke (9 Doyers Street) is an enigma - one of New York's sexiest spaces that is also often uncomfortable to be in coupled with one of the city's best known mixologists running a show that falls short on cocktails. The idea of a cocktail apothecary sets Apotheke apart, as does its focus on expensive house absinthe, but it's unclear whether people want a concept or just a good bar with great cocktails.Hidden away in Chinatown, the space is a knockout - much larger than your typical speakeasy - and if you can score a couch, quite comfortable. However, the long bar has no stools so you have to stand and staff can be overwhelmed. One busy night when we snagged a table, we experienced long waits while the lone waitress struggled to keep up with the busy bar. Apparently Apotheke was on Gossip Girl that week and it had brought a whole new crowd down to Chi-town. Another time, we stood near the bar and were taken care of by several bartenders, which meant the drinks came quickly (it was a pretty quiet night). We much prefer taking our cocktails sitting down, preferably at the bar, which they have made impossible. So what of the drinks?

 One cold night we found ourselves far off the beaten path - in East Williamsburg, a formerly unknown section of town - and in need of a good cocktail. We'd read a lot about Huckleberry Bar (588 Grand Street) so we decided to check it out.Perhaps too used to intimate Manhattan speakeasies, we found the amount of space in the bar a bit daunting. A long bar, two seating areas, a backyard and a DJ booth? We looked around and wondered if they could possibly pull this off. Happily, the DJ had the night off, the menu was long on classics and cocktails were just $10.The Juanhattan (old overholt rye, amaro averna, lillet blanc and angostura bitters) was quite good while the Article 57 (citrus infused vodka, young ginger juice, Q tonic) was more on the medicinal side and not entirely pleasant to drink - too much ginger. Better was the Tina Modotti, made with tequila, del maguey mezcal, spiced pear, orange bitters and chili salt.Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll size up the classics. It will be interesting to see how the bar does over the long haul on the wrong side of the BQE.

 No name on display, long narrow room, buzzer for admission, classic cocktails, yup, it's another speakeasy. But the Raines Law Room seems to be a speakeasy that's a little bit different - and the odd absence of an actual bar is only part of it. Part of it is the people involved - the mixologist and owners are not \"big\" names, though they have solid backgrounds in the industry. Thus, a cocktail list that is more classically-inspired than the more mixologist-driven places like PDT and Tailor. And then there Paul - a doorman, manager and chocolatier, who elevates the place all by himself. He is unfailingly polite, extremely gracious and...nice. When he apologizes that there will be a wait and takes your number, you know he is sincere and will call you as soon as he can. Even better, he makes his own chocolates by hand and sells them on site ($12 for a box of 6). They are creative, unusual and delicious - and most of them are vegan. But you wouldn't know it as even the vegan ones taste rich and decadent.But we digress - a cocktail bar is first and foremost about the cocktails. And on that front, they are doing well, though list is shorter than we had expected.

 Last year, the Denton brothers, owners of downtown favorites 'ino and 'inoteca, took their show to Gramercy with the opening of Bar Milano. The buzz was deafening but the result underwhelming, headscratching Frank Bruni two-star review notwithstanding, and within months the struggling spot was closing to be transformed into what it should have been from the get go: 'inoteca north. Regardless of history, we're here now and 'inoteca is a marked improvement in several ways - the room is less fussy, the menu downscaled and the drinks cheaper - the terrific cocktails are just $10 each. The winelist is thankfully still extensive, interesting and well priced as well.Already carousing nearby, we decided to pop in for a few drinks and nibbles. We were intrigued to see a category devoted to egg white fizzes. The Apple Blow (lairds applejack, fresh lemon juice, sugar, egg white, chilled seltzer water) was very good but the Dubonnet was even better (dubonnet, cherry heering, fresh lemon and orange juice, egg whites). Another delicious option was the Cotillion (old forrester bourbon, appleton estate rum, fresh lemon, orange juice, cointreau and lucid absinthe), a nicely balanced and eminently quaffable drink. A much better showing than last year when the hyped cocktail program struck us as both too precious and too expensive, not to mention too reliant on pricey sweet pink drinks that seemed to be aimed at the fairer sex.The dishes we sampled were a bit spotty but we are happy to report the delicious truffed egg toast has made the trip uptown unscathed. With a bit more work on the food, we can see 'inoteca 2 hitting its stride. The crowds are already there.'inoteca Liquori Bar323 Third Avenue, 212-683-3035

 The much praised Death & Co. took some time to win us over. The cocktails were good but the doormen annoying, and so were the crowds. There was the constant impending doom of potential closing surrounding the place. And it was just too uneven on the bartender front. Yet over time, we were drawn back again and again until we couldn't deny it - it's become a favorite cocktail spot. Today, Death & Co. is as close to a classic NYC bar as has opened in the new millennium. The drink list is impressively vast yet smartly broken down by category of booze. The bartenders are sure of their craft. And the room is as comfortable as it gets, save the cold blast of air near the door in wintertime.It's all about the drinks, of course. And on that account, D&Co excels, with top-notch ingredients, creativity and highly balanced recipes, some with close to 10 ingredients.

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 NYC diners know Restaurant Week is a bit of a crapshoot. Participants either take the promotion as an opportunity to introduce themselves to new diners - Danny Meyer's restaurants do this very well, so do restaurants such as Tocqueville and Cafe Boulud - or they do it for the volume or because they think they have to. We had hoped that Oceana's pedigree would put it firmly in the former category and their offer of 30% off the entire winelist during Restaurant Week was sufficient to lure us back, in spite of the mediocre food and wine service we had experienced there a few years ago. The chef had since changed, the Times' critic loved it (reaffirming its three stars just last July) and it seemed like a good opportunity to give it abother try.However, on our visit, it seemed like the kitchen wasn't even trying, just cranking out those menus and praying RW would soon be over soon. There was little imagination at work on the plates presented. Bland, boring, monotone presentation and flavors seemingly customized to a shabby room.

 We've been to Tailor at least half a dozen times since it opened and it remains an enigma to us. The subterranean bar, with adventurous drinks by mixologist Eben Freeman, remains a draw yet the place seems to still suffer a case of disjointedness. On the one hand, it has curry popcorn, as addictive as it gets for bar snacks, and a few seriously good drinks. On the other, it has sky high expectations, lots of hype and high prices to boot. Does it stand up to the the expectations? The answer is mainly yes, though it's not entirely successful from a barfly's point of view.

I visited Tailor for the first time before being aware of all the hype. And, even then, I found it disappointing. I have not dined upstairs, but the bar food was subpar. The cocktails on paper sounded fascinating, but simply did not fulfill the promise. I'd so much rather have a simple Old Fashioned than these creations which promise a lot, work hard to bring something new, but in the end, fall flat. I have since been back, and was as disappointed the second time around as the first. While I admire the efforts of Eben Freeman, the end result is a major disappointed. I have time and time again made tastier, more satisfying mixed drinks at home that lack the fuss and pretense. That said, I'll give it one more shot.

 You're probably not the only one confused by Ella and Elsa, two newish cocktail bars in the East Village that opened within weeks - and blocks - of each other. However, once you get past the names, there isn't a whole lot that the two places have in common.Ella is the slicker of the two joints, with Victoria's Secret-esque pink and black striped walls, a smoky underground performance space and velvet ropes out front. Assuming you can slip in past the doorman - they have a semi-strict door policy we bet gets dropped any minute- you'll find yourself in a glammed up space with a long bar and some banquettes up front. The drink list is impressively long - nine specialty cocktails, three champagne cocktails and eleven classic cocktails. We instinctively go for brown liquor so we tried the Clark Gable (maker's mark, lime, ginger-infused simple syrup) and it was the clear favorite. Finding another appealing drink was a bit of a challenge, however. The Mildred Pierce (bulldog gin, basil infused simple syrup, lime) was recommended by the bartender but highly acidic. Mommie Dearest (milagro tequila, lime, simple syrup, orange bitters) was also seriously out of balance and the Rye Smash (sazerac rye, muddled raspberries, lemon, simple syrup) was hardly a smashing success. In the meantime, a DJ bombarded us with some of the worst music this side of Jersey. Clearly Ella is for cool people. I guess they can hope to find a clientele too cool for taste buds.On to Elsa, over in Alphabet City. A former dive bar, the space was remade with a bespoke men's tailor in the front and a cocktail bar in the back. The room is kind of upstate antiques shop basic, with narrow booths up front across from a standing-only bar and rustic tables in the back. Mainly wood, the room is simple and bland (and way too bright), though we did like the barn-like effect of the bathroom ceiling. With the décor underwhelming, all we could hope for were some good cocktails. (There are also beers on tap, flowing through an old Singer sewing machine, and a few wines.) From the short list (4 signature concoctions and 4 classics), we tried The Jaszek (applejack, velvet falernum, lime, angostura, orange bitters) and the El Romero Borracho (souza blanco, grapefruit, campari, lime), coming away hopeful for the future. Both were balanced, complex and satisfying, showing skill on behalf of the resident mixologist. The Perfect Manhattan? Yes, please. When they get their feet wet, we'll be back for a second look.Ella9 Avenue A between 1st and 2nd streets, 212-777-2230Elsa217 E. 3rd Street between Avenue B and C, 917-882-7395

 In Japan sake is as everyday as soda pop, with cans of sake available from vending machines everywhere, including in railway stations for those long rides home. While you can't get it from a machine, you can still emulate those crafty Japanese with some great fresh-tasting sake out of a can right here in NYC.One of our favorites is Funaguchi Kikusui, a draft sake straight from the tank, unpasteurized with no additives. The can is perfect for preserving this fresh, easy drinking sake. Be careful though - these dynamite 200ml cans pack a punch since the sake is 19.8% alcohol. You can pick them up at Sakaya (324 E. 9th Street) for $6.99. Drink cold.Another sake available by the can, albeit in a larger 720ml version, is the delicious Narutotai Ginjo Nama Genshu. Let's break down the name -Narutotai is the name, ginjo is the type, nama means unpasteurized, and genshu means that no water was added at the end of the brewing process. This makes for a fresh, potent sake (18%+ alcohol) that is both rich and smooth. Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is selling the can right now for $32.99.

As they put it, \"Westchester's hottest brands and hot new chefs will show you how as you mix and mingle at Yonkers' address for luxuriously affordable living.\"Apparently, after all the goodies, they had about $5 left in their budget for the graphic to the right. Anyway, if you're so inclined, here is the website. We would, however, like to remind those tempted by this fab offer that it is indeed YONKERS.

 Now that the dust has settled from the '08 elections, we can look at the effect the booze industry had on the race. And shocker of all shockers... it favored Democrats with donations this year. It's actually the first time since 1994 that the booze industry gave more to Democrats than Republicans - 52% - 48%, not too far off the popular vote of 53% - 46% for Pres Elect Obama. In all, the industry and individuals associated with it donated $12.997 million. Way to grease the rails of democracy! Out of 80 industries measured, the booze industry was #37 in terms of money donated. The numbers going back to the 1990 campaign are broken down at OpenSecrets.org.

 We hadn't been at Employees Only (510 Hudson Street) in a while - it's not in our top tier of NYC drinks places - but recently found ourselves just down the block and needing a drink. The cocktail menu had a few intriguing choices but we went straight for their version of the Manhattan ($14) - \"Rittenhouse Rye stirred with Italian Vermouth, Orange Curacao and Angostura bitters.\" The resulting drink is delicious - the orange curacao really rounded out the flavor. One of the best Manhattans we've tasted yet in this project.

 Subterranean bar PDT (113 St. Mark's Place) is one of the best drink spots in the city, so it's not often we partake in a classic cocktail while we're there. However, a recent night got late in a hurry and we needed our usual nightcap - the Manhattan.We didn't offer a liquor suggestion and we were not disappointed. The drink we were served was made with Rittenhouse Rye and Carpano Antica, purportedly \"the original\" sweet Italian vermouth. It was terrific, perfectly balanced and nicely presented with three small cherries on a skewer across the top. If only all Manhattans could be this delicious.

 Death + Company (433 East 6th Street) is undoubtedly one of New York's best cocktail bars, as well as one of its most controversial, due to its never-ending battle to stay open. We've spent some extended time there recently - look for a review later this week - and after much imbibing, decided to test the bartender's Manhattan chops. We left it up to him and his take ($13) was interesting and quite delicious - he used half Booker's Bourbon and half Rittenhouse Rye to create a rich, nicely balanced drink. It certainly sent us out into the cold night feeling no pain.

 Recent West Village wanderings took us into subterranean cocktail den Little Branch (22 Seventh Avenue South) in search of a good Manhattan. While we like the look of the space, the drinks themselves have never really impressed us. We slid into one of the tight booths and ordered a Manhattan. The waitress didn't ask for a booze preference but when it arrived, there was a familiar quality to it. Hmm, we thought. Could it be Old Overholt, our own house rye? Sure enough it was. Makes a nicely balanced Manhattan, though theirs was a tad drier than the Head Bartender version. At $12 a solid version of a classic cocktail.

 We get a lot of recipes from liquor companies, but few are any good. Most of their so-called signature drinks wind up being too heavy handed with the product they are pushing. A notable exception are the fine folks at St. Germain, who consistently craft good drinks made with the elderflower liqueur.Case in point is the Paris Manhattan, a twist on the classic made with St. Germain, which actually enhances the flavor of the bourbon. The 'Parisian' touch is light and flirty without being too frou frou. We'd raise a glass to the creator of the drink, if we knew who he or she is...Paris Manhattanmakes one2oz Bourbon1oz St. Germain1/2oz Dry Vermouth2 dashes Angostura BittersPour ingredients into an ice filled shaker and stir until cold, strain into a martini glass.

 The bar at Gotham Bar and Grill (12 E. 12th Street) has long been one of the city's best dining bars thanks to their ingenious trays that rest on the rail running along the bar. While not a go-to spot for the drinks crowd these days, we figured it would have a solid Manhattan, so we popped in just before the holidays. The bartender asked our choice of booze and we chose rye. He recommended Michters, which is quite good but it turns out a bit pricey ($16). The resulting drink was a taste of classic New York - smooth yet potent. It almost made us forget the howling wind just outside the doors. Alas, if we could afford two, we might have really been protected from the elements.

 Waiting on a friend the other night, we slipped into the venerable Old Town Bar (45 E. 18th Street) and ordered up a Manhattan. The bartender asked if we preferred rye or bourbon and we went with rye, but left the brand choice up to him. The resulting drink was well balanced but bracing, to say the least. Kind of a working man's stiff drink, perfect for the blue collar crowd. The booze? McCormick's, the house rye. The price? $7.

 When asked our favorite libation, many potential answers present themselves depending on our mood. But when it comes to cocktails one drink stands above the rest - the Manhattan. This classic cocktail is the epitome of grown-up drinking: no juice, no shaking, no (plastic) monkeys. Just whiskey (usually rye or bourbon), vermouth and a few dashes of bitters, well stirred and served up. When well made, it's pure pleasure. When not, it's a boozy mess. Debuting in the Manhattan Club in the 1870s, the Manhattan is about a hundred years older than we are. In the intervening years, it has inspired many variations and knock-offs. In honor of the original's outsized influence, we decided to embark on a project to find the best Manhattans in Manhattan - and beyond. We will search far and wide, high end and low end, to identify the best and warn you about the worst. We'll let bartenders guide us when it comes to the booze and see where they take us. And we will also tell you about some of the city's best new creations inspired by the drink.But we can't drink the city by ourselves, hard as we try, so we'd like to hear from you about where to find the best Manhattan, who makes it or how you like to order it. Drop us an email or leave a comment.Our first stop was a natural, a New York institution with a great bar: Gramercy Tavern.

 We're not restaurant reviewers per se but we can't let things go unnoticed when we pop into places for drinks and a few bites. Case in point - Bar Artisanal, where we were subjected to amateurish service and underwhelming food.After being seated, we waited ten minutes for some attention from the staff. Then a particularly zealous manager appeared - and gave us the \"evening's menus\" and a brief overview of how they are designed. Huh? This is a casual place? Then he circled the table, calling everyone sir and answering every request with \"my pleasure.\" By the end of the circle, he had dispensed so much pleasure that we thought we'd need to book a room in the hotel upstairs.Next up, some crimes against wine.

Raines Law Room Revisited

***CONTENT
 Recently we found ourselves in Chelsea and close enough to Raines Law Room (48 West 17th Street) that we decided to pop in for a spot check. The room was busy as usual and Paul, the host, was deftly juggling the crowds as we settled into one of the snug booths. The first time around, we loved the space and some of the cocktails but found imprecise execution in certain drinks. Our recent visit showed a bit surer hand behind the bar but still some issues to work out. And we have now learned our lesson - ignore the specials, which can be hit or miss, but generally don't justify the $16 pricetag for \"premium ingredients.\" Heck $13 is a bit steep for drinks in this day and age.Right away we re-visited the Gold Rush and made sure the waitress knew we liked a good amount of bourbon in it. The version we got was as good as we remembered it (after it was fixed the last time). We also tried the Smoke and Mirrors again - this time it was sweeter than we liked and just okay. Seems like execution is still an issue with this drink and as much as we want to like it, we just can't recommend it. Other specials included the Frida (Don Julio tequila, aperol topped with moet chandon), which was okay, and the Sylvia (made with Tanqueray Ten and a touch of absinthe), which was pretty good.Back ordering off the menu, we enjoyed both the Archangel and Corpse Reviver #2. A Manhattan made with Bulleit was terrific but the revelation was a perfectly made Negroni. One thing that sets Raines Law Room apart is the service - the staff, from the busboys to the waitresses, is really accomodating and without a trace of attitude. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the drinks and also extremely nice. And as we walked out into the night, Paul was as gracious as ever.

***CONTENT
 A lot of time large scale tastings covering a certain region or country are not great ways to showcase wine - too much filler, too little interesting product. Thankfully, the Wines of Portugal event held this Tuesday intrigued us enough to overcome our skepticism, and thankfully we found lots of interesting wines - some available in the U.S. and some not.The wineries present represented all of Portugal's growing areas and specialized in whites, reds and ports along with a smattering of rose and sparkling wines. We stuck to the indigenous grapes such as Alvarinho, Arinto, Aragones and Touriga Nacional, avoiding the more international styles whenever possible.Here are some of the highlights, with a focus on wines that have distribution in place and thus possible to find in stores and restaurants:

 Crains NY is reporting that Brooklyn brewery co-founder Tom Potter is raising money to open the New York Distilling Co. somewhere in Brooklyn next year. The distillery plans to make both gin and whiskey, mainly from local and organic ingredients. It also plans to be open for tours that showcase the distilling and tasting process. Whether he can raise the $2 million is up for debate but it would be rather cool to have the city's first distillery since Prohibition.

 A tequila and mezcal cocktail bar? Just try keeping us away. Mayahuel is one sexy space, from the dark brown bar to the tiny tiled tables opposite to the plush lounge upstairs. With bar-master Phil Ward (Death & Co.) the brains behind it, expectations were high for the cocktails and we are happy to report we were not disappointed.The Lapsong Punch (lapsong suchong infused \"tea-killa,\" lemon, grapefruit and whiskey barrel bitters) is a great drink to start off, nicely balanced, light and citrusy-smoky. The Smoked Palomino (amontillado sherry, mezcal, grapefruit, lime, salted rim) was delicious, unique and a rare find: a good sherry drink. The Pequeno Cabeza (blanco, grapefruit infused vermouth, amaro and maraschino) was an inventive take on the Manhattan. The Slight Detour (jalapeno tequila, reposado and joven mezcal, agave nectar and Xocolati mole bitters) made for interesting drinking - both the chocolate and orange came through the booze, almost dessert-like. Like the Cabeza, it's a pretty potent concoction.El Jimadors Shifty didn't work as well - the pineapple-infused mezcal didn't cut through the Negra Modelo and was MIA until we drank through the beer and found it on the bottom.UrbanDaddy has a great slideshow that shows off the interiors. Mayahuel is soft open now.Mayahuel304 E. 6th StreetCocktails $13, Beer-based cocktails $7 to $12

CB2 Recap - Martignetti Gets Reamed, Cafe Noir a No-Show and a New Pera

***CONTENT
 Surprises and contentious moments abounded at last night's Community Board 2 meeting. Biggest of all was the curve ball thrown by the Martignetti brothers. Seems they want to split their liquor license and hold onto the basement club while giving over the ground floor to Cafe Noir... Except it's not Cafe Noir! Instead, Burak Karacam, managing partner of Pera, was before the board to apply for the license the Martignettis want to relinquish on the first floor - in addition to applying for a license for a new Pera at 54 Thompson. The folks from Cafe Noir were nowhere in sight and didn't answer the call, likely signaling the end of the road for that rumored takeover.Unfortunately for the attending brother, Tom Martignetti, the knives came out almost immediately. After several minutes explaining the idea of splitting a license and then bringing in someone else to run the restaurant independently, we witnessed a fascinating (not) discussion of ingress and egress. But lo the board was confused by this idea of two separate joints. Who's the other guy (Burak) and is this legal they asked. How did you get a license in the first place - did you apply as one entity, etc etc. Poor Tom stumbled along as they failed to grasp what he was saying - he didn't express the idea clearly enough to my mind but I still understood the point A vociferous board member signaled it would be a rough ride though, launching into a speech that there were too many liquor licenses in the area and that even if they rescinded one, they should not issue more than a beer & wine license. Then came the neighbors.

Deal or No Deal? - Bar Blanc Bistro

***DATE
2009-04-14 16:20:00
***CONTENT
 With just two days left in the Bar Blanc Bistro (142 West 10th Street) opening week deal, we decided to pop in and see how they were doing. The bar was fairly busy but the restaurant mostly empty when we arrived. We grabbed a pair of empty seats at the bar and were handed the menus. The bartender clearly explained the half-off deal and the exclusions - no bottled beer, burger or oysters for half price. Fair enough, we thought, since the bar menu had a good bit of choice.The half-off special applied to draft beer, wine by the glass and carafe, and house cocktails. (The not-included bottled beer is your typical rip-off with $7 Stellas, Leffe and Hoegaarden). There were lots of choices among the cocktails, normally $12, generally classics or riffs on them including a caipiroska, sidecar (very popular) and a grapefruit martinis. We stuck to beer and wine. The Grimbergen ale was new to us but quite good (normally $7) if a bit sweet at the bottom of the glass while Blue Moon is... Blue Moon. Wines were interesting but suffered from being too warm and open for a while. A Pinot Noir from France was good but neither the mundane Tempranillo nor the White Bordeaux excited us.Food-wise, we enjoyed most everything - the chicken liver mousse was very good as were the beef croquettes, though the underlying mustard was way too hot. The burger was large and juicy while fries were perfectly crisped.Overall, the space looks the same from its previous incarnation (pre-bistro). It certainly doesn't read bistro and it's way too dark - reading menus was only possible by candlelight. Will this incarnation make it? Certainly the bar is comfortable but beer and wine are a bit too expensive for it to be a regular stop. The restaurant itself is a tougher sell and they have their work cut out for them. The previous restaurants struggled in the same space so you have to wonder if it is cursed. In the meantime, is it a deal? Heck yea! 50% off the entire check (tip on the whole amount fellow boozers). We suggest you hurry over before it expires tomorrow night at 8pm. Rumor has it they will have some type of happy hour after the deal is gone but it won't be nearly as good.

***CONTENT
 The SLA is diligently killing off the concept of BYOB for restaurants as evidenced by the latest report on Grub Street about Emporio's booze-less opening. Yup, no BYOB for them.As we've previously reported, the current laws are asinine - a restaurant can't be BYOB unless they have a liquor license (not even if you have applied and it is pending) but if they never intend to apply, they are not under the SLA's authority and thus they can't do anything to stop you. The cops could, theoretically, but we doubt they'll be raiding anyone over this.A much better idea would be to re-write the laws to allow any restaurant to be BYOB and to streamline the licensing procedure for restaurants. There was a movement to separate restaurants from bars and clubs but that seems to be up in the air. In the meantime, since it's clear people want booze with their dinner, shouldn't our state reps help foster a system that is a win-win for both customers and restaurant owners? Cause this cockamanie system is terrible for everyone and has damaged too many restaurants to count.

BYOB without a liquor license is always illegal, whether or not you're applying for license through the SLA. And even if you are, the SLA doesn't do anything to stop you. They'll just take note of the fact that you illegally allowed BYOB while your license was pending. It's true that cops probably aren't going to go door to door with no-license restaurants to enforce the law, but if, say, you have an upstairs neighbor that you've pissed off, they can call the cops on you, and then they'll HAVE to investigate.

 We've never been to any incarnation of the Russian Tea Room (150 W. 57th Street) so we have no qualms with it. However, their newest deal, coming to us via Eater's Dealfeed, seems a bit suspect. For the month of April, if you order the \"Business Express Lunch\" for $35 they will give you a free vodka martini to wash it down. Strikes us as an odd promotion - how many people want a vodka martini in the middle of the day? Especially when they are ordering an express lunch?

The cocktail menu had a few intriguing choices but we went straight for their version of the Manhattan ($14) - \"Rittenhouse Rye stirred with Italian Vermouth, Orange Curacao and Angostura bitters.\" The resulting drink is delicious - the orange curacao really rounded out the flavor. One of the best Manhattans we've tasted yet in this project.

 World wine consumption went down almost 1% last year but the U.S. increased its consumption according to The International Organization of Vine and Wine. Europe was the main culprit for the drop, with France, Italy and Germany all drinking less wine than in the past. In fact, the U.S. passed Italy for the first time in wine consumption. Both Canada and Australia did their part, consuming more wine than the year before. And in another shift, Europe accounted for less than half the world's wine production for the first time. Brazil is a big up-and-coming producer with about 100,000 hectares now under production.

***CONTENT
 Apotheke (9 Doyers Street) is an enigma - one of New York's sexiest spaces that is also often uncomfortable to be in coupled with one of the city's best known mixologists running a show that falls short on cocktails. The idea of a cocktail apothecary sets Apotheke apart, as does its focus on expensive house absinthe, but it's unclear whether people want a concept or just a good bar with great cocktails.Hidden away in Chinatown, the space is a knockout - much larger than your typical speakeasy - and if you can score a couch, quite comfortable. However, the long bar has no stools so you have to stand and staff can be overwhelmed. One busy night when we snagged a table, we experienced long waits while the lone waitress struggled to keep up with the busy bar. Apparently Apotheke was on Gossip Girl that week and it had brought a whole new crowd down to Chi-town. Another time, we stood near the bar and were taken care of by several bartenders, which meant the drinks came quickly (it was a pretty quiet night). We much prefer taking our cocktails sitting down, preferably at the bar, which they have made impossible. So what of the drinks?

 From half a block away you could hear the bagpipes. That meant just one thing - whiskey awaited. Over 100 of them in fact inside Chelsea Piers at the annual whiskey showcase \"Whisky Live\".The good stuff was distributed over 38 stations while around the corner various Scottish bands played fast and furious. Already familiar with the Highland Park, Oban and Macallan, we headed straight to the lesser known brands. The focus of the show is Scotch but there were also Bourbons, Rye, Blended Scotches and more. A lot of good stuff was being poured and we wasted no time exploring. Our favorites after the jump.

 The cash-strapped state government has apparently caved in to the liquor store lobby and taken the bill to expand wine sales to grocery stores to the woodshed. Crains NY is reporting the effort died today, another example of Governor Paterson's astounding political ineptitude. All across the state, crappy corner liquor stores are rejoicing as they get to stay in business due to a serious lack of competition. Meanwhile, the rest of us just scratch our heads in disbelief.

 A recent trip to Franny's in Brooklyn - still one of the the best pizza joints in NYC in our opinion - led to the discovery of an amaro (bitter) called Nardini. A bartender liked it enough to create an eponymous cocktail, which we thoroughly enjoyed as an aperitivo, and they were nice enough to provide us with the recipe.

Hi there! It's the team from franny's here! Just one correction to the recipe above, we actually DO NOT use Carpano Antica Formula in the Nardini Cocktail, it's just Bulldog Gin and Nardini Amaro! The rest of the portions are correct. Thanks for the support and we hope to see you soon at franny's! Best, Nekisia General Manager

That's odd, they wrote it out for us and it had Carpano Antica. Thanks for letting us know. We made a version with Cynar and Sweet Vermouth since we didn't have Nardini. It worked really well and was similar in taste to the Nardini. When we get some Nardini Amaro, I'll try it both ways and let the readers know.

 It's no secret we are big fans of Woodford Reserve bourbon here at BoozyNYC. Recently, we came across a yummy recipe for The Morris Cocktail from Jamie Boudreau, mixologist at Seattle's Vessel - a great drink spot right in the middle of that city's downtown. The recipe's not new but the drink is so good, it doesn't matter. If it strikes your fancy, Raines' Law Room does a good version of it locally. And Boudreau's blog is full of really good cocktail recipes you should check out.The full recipe after the jump...

 One cold night we found ourselves far off the beaten path - in East Williamsburg, a formerly unknown section of town - and in need of a good cocktail. We'd read a lot about Huckleberry Bar (588 Grand Street) so we decided to check it out.Perhaps too used to intimate Manhattan speakeasies, we found the amount of space in the bar a bit daunting. A long bar, two seating areas, a backyard and a DJ booth? We looked around and wondered if they could possibly pull this off. Happily, the DJ had the night off, the menu was long on classics and cocktails were just $10.The Juanhattan (old overholt rye, amaro averna, lillet blanc and angostura bitters) was quite good while the Article 57 (citrus infused vodka, young ginger juice, Q tonic) was more on the medicinal side and not entirely pleasant to drink - too much ginger. Better was the Tina Modotti, made with tequila, del maguey mezcal, spiced pear, orange bitters and chili salt.Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll size up the classics. It will be interesting to see how the bar does over the long haul on the wrong side of the BQE.

 Few things go as well together as pizza and beer. Unfortunately, few things are as ripe for extreme mark-up as those two items. In the case of Co., or Company as you like, don't expect the recession to mean customer-friendly pricing.We'll come right out and say it - we were underwhelmed. The pizzas were small (about 11\") and the edges of the ballyhooed crust were almost reminiscent of Pizza Hut. The crust itself was pretty good, but the toppings deserved to be seasoned properly though, with salt definitely missing in action. And the pizzas seemed overloaded with cheese and bechamel, guess to explain the pricing - the majority of pizzas are $16 to $18 and appetizer up-selling is heavy.But this is a booze blog. And there is nothing more depressing than staring at a beer list where everything is $7. Really, $7 for Blue Moon, Sixpoint and Stella? While we're at it, could they come up with a more cliched list of beers? What possible justification can there be for marking up beer over 500% anyway?We here at Boozy are getting real tired of being ripped off for the privilege of drinking designer beers - not to mention the Belgian equivalent of Bud. If restaurateurs have so little respect for beer drinkers that they view them merely as a profit center, maybe they should just stop serving beer. On this particular day, we silently drank water. That is not our preferred dining mode.

 We've had sparkling sake, dessert sake, aged sake, sake in a can, and now... sake in a jar. Yup the latest craze (maybe) is sake in a 200ml jar, the perfect size to slip into your suit jacket for that long ride home. Long popular in Japan, especially among commuting businessmen, single serve sakes have slowly been making their way into the U.S. market. Wakatsuru in Toyama (Western Japan) makes one of the first to be offered in a jar, a full-bodied and flavorful Junmai Daiginjo. The sake was good but better with food than on its own. And not quite as good as our favorite single-serve sake, Funaguchi Kikusui.Available at Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street, website). $5.99 per bottle.

 Disturbing news for New Yorkers - most BYO restaurants are breaking the law according to a story in Crains New York. As we previously reported, restaurants need to have a liquor license to allow BYO - unless they are under 20 seats. If they open and are applying for a license, they may jeopardize the application's status by allowing BYO. It's unclear what the consequences are since the SLA (State Liquor Authority) only has jurisdiction if an application for a license is underway - no application, no SLA authority. Then enforcement fall on the police.

 No name on display, long narrow room, buzzer for admission, classic cocktails, yup, it's another speakeasy. But the Raines Law Room seems to be a speakeasy that's a little bit different - and the odd absence of an actual bar is only part of it. Part of it is the people involved - the mixologist and owners are not \"big\" names, though they have solid backgrounds in the industry. Thus, a cocktail list that is more classically-inspired than the more mixologist-driven places like PDT and Tailor. And then there Paul - a doorman, manager and chocolatier, who elevates the place all by himself. He is unfailingly polite, extremely gracious and...nice. When he apologizes that there will be a wait and takes your number, you know he is sincere and will call you as soon as he can. Even better, he makes his own chocolates by hand and sells them on site ($12 for a box of 6). They are creative, unusual and delicious - and most of them are vegan. But you wouldn't know it as even the vegan ones taste rich and decadent.But we digress - a cocktail bar is first and foremost about the cocktails. And on that front, they are doing well, though list is shorter than we had expected.

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

 Last year, the Denton brothers, owners of downtown favorites 'ino and 'inoteca, took their show to Gramercy with the opening of Bar Milano. The buzz was deafening but the result underwhelming, headscratching Frank Bruni two-star review notwithstanding, and within months the struggling spot was closing to be transformed into what it should have been from the get go: 'inoteca north. Regardless of history, we're here now and 'inoteca is a marked improvement in several ways - the room is less fussy, the menu downscaled and the drinks cheaper - the terrific cocktails are just $10 each. The winelist is thankfully still extensive, interesting and well priced as well.Already carousing nearby, we decided to pop in for a few drinks and nibbles. We were intrigued to see a category devoted to egg white fizzes. The Apple Blow (lairds applejack, fresh lemon juice, sugar, egg white, chilled seltzer water) was very good but the Dubonnet was even better (dubonnet, cherry heering, fresh lemon and orange juice, egg whites). Another delicious option was the Cotillion (old forrester bourbon, appleton estate rum, fresh lemon, orange juice, cointreau and lucid absinthe), a nicely balanced and eminently quaffable drink. A much better showing than last year when the hyped cocktail program struck us as both too precious and too expensive, not to mention too reliant on pricey sweet pink drinks that seemed to be aimed at the fairer sex.The dishes we sampled were a bit spotty but we are happy to report the delicious truffed egg toast has made the trip uptown unscathed. With a bit more work on the food, we can see 'inoteca 2 hitting its stride. The crowds are already there.'inoteca Liquori Bar323 Third Avenue, 212-683-3035

 One of our readers has a bone to pick with the media, especially today's AM New York pizza article. \"Can everyone please stop calling Artichoke \"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery\"? The place is not a brewery! They have two beers - Bud and Bud Light available in 32 oz styrofoam cups for $5.50! Give me a break.\"We have to say he has a point. The media often just blindly repeats nonsense without doing even basic research. We don't care if the owners want it called by such a nonsensical moniker, the place is known as Artichoke to everyone and that's what we'll call it. Oh, and singling out Lombardi's as a \"legend\" is just wrong. The place is a tourist trap with overloaded crappy pizza. It's high time the media stop pushing that place as worth a visit.

 The much praised Death & Co. took some time to win us over. The cocktails were good but the doormen annoying, and so were the crowds. There was the constant impending doom of potential closing surrounding the place. And it was just too uneven on the bartender front. Yet over time, we were drawn back again and again until we couldn't deny it - it's become a favorite cocktail spot. Today, Death & Co. is as close to a classic NYC bar as has opened in the new millennium. The drink list is impressively vast yet smartly broken down by category of booze. The bartenders are sure of their craft. And the room is as comfortable as it gets, save the cold blast of air near the door in wintertime.It's all about the drinks, of course. And on that account, D&Co excels, with top-notch ingredients, creativity and highly balanced recipes, some with close to 10 ingredients.

 Why, we wonder, can't people just leave wine the way it is? First they added sugar-free sweetener to it. Now we have a \"new wine craze\" straight out of Cherry Valley, Ohio: Fruiteasers. Emerine Estates Winery has created a line of wine that uses a base such as chardonnay, riesling or merlot then adds in various fruits including apple, peach, blueberry and pineapple to create \"exotic fruit wines.\" Now, we don't mind old-fashioned wines made out of fruit (other than grapes). But why boost wines that naturally may have notes such as pineapple (riesling) or blueberries (merlot) with actual fruit? Or in the case of Seduction, a pinot noir with coffee, mocha, vanilla, cherries and chocolate. Are the wines themselves not enough? More of the head-scratching offerings here - Strawberry Shortcake Wine anyone? Speaking of cake, this wine definitely takes it: \"As seen on TV, its true (sic!), a 100% pure Chardonnay with Amish butter.\" No, we're not making this up. The name of the wine? Tear Drops. How a propos.

 A reader sent us a link to a Craigslist post entitled \"Opening a New Restaurant?\" featuring a sale of restaurant equipment at a familiar sounding address - 171 East Broadway - that made us curious. A quick Google search revealed the sale at none other than Broadway East. It's wrapping up this afternoon but you may be able to pick up pots, pans, toasters, knives and lots more. The listing is clearly written in a tone that worries it may signal impending doom - \"we bought too much\" - but it nonetheless strikes us as a bad sign for a place that can't be doing well in an off the beaten path location.

 Good pizza and beer are a natural combination. Relative newbie Roberta's in Brooklyn (261 Moore Street) ups the anted with a six hour long happy hour Monday to Friday (Noon - 6pm). If you buy a pint, you'll get the second one for $3. The Stegmaier Amber (Lion Brewery, Wilkes Barre, PA) pairs well with creative pizzas like the Good Girl (kale, tallegio, Berkshire pork sausage) and Specken Wolf (speck, mushrooms, oregano, onion, mozzarella).

 Something just crossed our inbox that seemed enticing until we actually read it. TimeOut sent a sponsored promo invite to a March 4th event called \"Fabulously Frugal\" in... Yonkers. Yonkers? Yup, that \"city\" just up the Hudson River trying to revitalize itself as happening place. Seems a building called 66Main is trying to fill loft-style apartments and they've come up with an event they hope draws newly frugal New Yorkers to what is essentially an Open House. They promise food from area chefs, free \"spiked punch,\" giveaways and more!. As they put it, \"Westchester's hottest brands and hot new chefs will show you how as you mix and mingle at Yonkers' address for luxuriously affordable living.\"Apparently, after all the goodies, they had about $5 left in their budget for the graphic to the right. Anyway, if you're so inclined, here is the website. We would, however, like to remind those tempted by this fab offer that it is indeed YONKERS.

 The sad truth of this recession is no one and no thing is being spared. Even booze sales are now officially down. Conventional wisdom says that \"sins\" like booze and cigarettes survive well during recessions as people try to chemically cope with a depressing reality. But this recession is proving a lot of people wrong.Bloomberg reported yesterday that \"take-out sales of alcoholic beverages tumbled 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter\", the largest decline in fifty years of record keeping. The biggest bust? Surprisingly beer, down 14%. Wine was down 1.6% and liquor 0.9%. If you're into this sort of stuff, a handy chart at FiveThirtyEight.com shows the ups and downs of booze vis a vis GDP.

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

 A while back, we slapped Perbacco on the wrist for selling warm wine and placing candles in front of wine bottles. Unfortunately, new restaurant Sorella (95 Allen Street) is another offender. We slipped in for a glass of wine the other day and were impressed by the design and the attention to detail in everything from an interesting wine selection to the printed materials. Then we looked up to see wine everywhere.Folks, we can't stress enough that you store wine for customers properly. Having wine stored on shelves lit by candles is pretty but it's not wine we want to drink. Even worse, when the temperature control on the room's thermostat is set in the upper 70s, we get really concerned for the wine.The winelist is heavily skewed towards Northern Italy (good) but very pricey (bad). Since the cooking is skewed towards Piemontese, the region wines are well represented. Unfortunately, bottles under $50 are in short supply and the bulk of the reds from Piedmont were over $80. Wines by the glass tend towards the obscure, which is fine, but nothing we tried was really delicious. Prices by the glass, $10 to $17, would be fair if the pours were more generous. Right now they skimpy.

However, a recent night got late in a hurry and we needed our usual nightcap - the Manhattan.We didn't offer a liquor suggestion and we were not disappointed. The drink we were served was made with Rittenhouse Rye and Carpano Antica, purportedly \"the original\" sweet Italian vermouth. It was terrific, perfectly balanced and nicely presented with three small cherries on a skewer across the top. If only all Manhattans could be this delicious.

***CONTENT
 When is a beer too fancy? That question is a common one these days as restaurants continue to look for ways to jack up prices with obscure beers and importers bring in ever more product. Case in point, Kasteel Cru, a fairly new arrival on the scene from Alsace, France made with champagne yeast and now selling at Whole Foods for $4.99 a bottle.That's a fair amount of scratch in these times, even for a lifestyle beer which this clearly is. So we picked up a bottle to see what the hype is all about. The first taste is of a well made lager with a bit of an effervescent character. Sipping further, we found that the slight bitterness of the initial taste seemed to mellow into an almost bubbly quality. This actually counteracts the \"beerness\" of the beer and makes the taste less cohesive but certainly makes for a bit of lightness in the mouth feel.We were curious how the beer held up over, say a half hour or sipping. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite hold the effervescence and gets a bit out of balance with more bitterness evident. The beer was passable with food and seemed best suited to cheese.All in all, it's a good, not great beer, with a fancy pedigree and way-too-high price. Stick with the regular lagers unless you're showing off new found wealth for a friend.

 Is Milk & Honey open to the public again? Sure seems that way after Urban Daddy published the \"secret phone number\" today in their email round-up. They cite the end of \"temporary shuttering\" as the reason for giving out the number, even though it was widely reported that M & H went private and started charging for membership. However, we will honor Eater's standing request to not publish the number, even if Ben Leventhal - a former UD consultant - had self-serving motives in writing the post. We get it, we like to get in too.Update: Seems the info is very public now - thanks to a Grub Street reader for pointing us in the right direction. For their website go here. You can text 718-308-6881 for reservations after 7pm.

 Lots of booze news to report today:Grub Street has the closing date for Red Hook booze-arium LeNell's - February 20. This of course is due to the dreaded \"lease issues\" and we can only wonder what kind of crack their landlord is smoking.Eater is on the scene with a report of how the Feds quashed Six Point Ale's \"Hop Obama\" brew. Seems the Dept of Homeland Security put the \"kabosh\" on the whole thing and even threatened seizure. Ouch.Lastly, we are somewhat intrigued that Dan Aykroyd is at Astor Wines today (12pm - 2pm) to shill for his vodka. Huh? Yup, you can get autographs but you can't taste the vodka. Guess you'll have to fork over $50 and let us know how if it's worth it.

 We noticed an odd sight outside FiDi's Gild Hall, a fancy Thompson Hotel venture complete with an upscale celeb chef resto - a whiteboard promoting happy hour. The joint, fancifully named the Libertine, opened with typical fanfare due to the name of its chef Todd English - English does English! - but failed to thrill both critics and diners.The beer-heavy ($4 Stellas, $5 Draughts) happy hour skews heavily towards guys with an appetite for oysters. The $1 - 1.50 oysters are a nice touch, but hey, how about something liquid for the ladies? Unlike Gild Hall, the trendy Thompson production, and Libertine, which was supposed to evoke London clubhouses circa 1970s (monied? plush?), the whiteboard sign is decidedly downscale and uninviting. Frankly, it looks to us like it was pulled from a back office (we hope the conference rooms' boards are cleaner than this!). Dear Management, this is the most passive-aggressive approach to promoting happy hour we've ever seen. Are you sure you want anyone coming in?The Libertine15 Gold StreetHappy Hour: 5pm - 7pm

 Today, Eric Asimov wrote a piece in The New York Times about little known Italian wines that are a good value. Unfortunately, the paper didn't include the most helpful information - where to buy them! That's right folks, the paper decided to only list importers since it insists on having a national food section. Too bad that isn't much help to New Yorkers.Here are a couple of our favorite places to pick up Italian wines from $10 to $20:Smith & Vine (268 Smith Street, Brooklyn) has a great selection - 50 different bottles in that price range.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is even more impressive, with over 90 wines in this price range.Enoteca DiPalo (200 Grand Street) opened in November two doors down from the original DiPalo, featuring wine from each of Italy's 20 regions. While the prices are generally higher than the Times range, more like $15 - $29 for most bottles, the selection includes some hard to find wines and is chosen with the usual DiPalo family care.Let us know where you like to pick up Italian (or any other) wines.

 Ninth Avenue in the area around Port Authority has never been the pretty part of town, and the Holland Cocktail Lounge (532 9th Avenue) has always seemed to fit right in. There was nothing modern or sceney about the neighborhood dive but it did the job, until its recent closure that is, due to the landlord trying to sell the building. Given the state of the market, that effort went nowhere and so the bar is open again, per Grub Street, and ready to serve $4 beers. In this day and age, that's something.

***CONTENT
 Thrillist, Eater, et al posted yesterday about a new speakeasy - yes, narrow space, downstairs, unmarked door, yada yada - called Raines Law Room (48 W. 17th Street) and immediately a couple of skeptics weighed in. Seems some people are tired of speakeasies and we can understand that - everything from tiny PDT, the world's most promoted speakeasy, to Woodson and Ford, the open but not basement joint on Bleecker Street, has started to grate on folks. These days, people want to drink and they kind of prefer places that a) they can get into and b) they can find.One of the bartenders hastily leapt to the spot's defense, promising \"it's not like any other bar in town.\" Now it's arguable that was even necessary since only two commenters initially posted their skepticism and it was hardly the usual Eater vitriol. Of course, the bartender's response opened him up for further criticism and a good bit of hole was dug, though he was certainly diligent and fair in his comments. However, it might serve folks working at speakeasies to be a little less sensitive to internet comments.From our perspective, the place actually sounds intriguing and we don't mind the concept - assuming they have a policy of actually letting people in. We'll let you know how that Old Fashioned tastes, it does sound like a delicious version. Raines Law Room48 W. 17th Street, downstairs, unmarked door

 Death + Company (433 East 6th Street) is undoubtedly one of New York's best cocktail bars, as well as one of its most controversial, due to its never-ending battle to stay open. We've spent some extended time there recently - look for a review later this week - and after much imbibing, decided to test the bartender's Manhattan chops. We left it up to him and his take ($13) was interesting and quite delicious - he used half Booker's Bourbon and half Rittenhouse Rye to create a rich, nicely balanced drink. It certainly sent us out into the cold night feeling no pain.

We peered over the screens covering up the windows and saw an empty room, save a ladder in the center. Was their transformation from set menu to a la carte not enough to keep the restaurant afloat? Or is there a problem with the space that needed fixing? The outgoing message on the restaurant's machine gives no hint of closure and Open Table has tables available from Wednesday on (Mon and Tues not available).UPDATE 2/2/09 12:30pm - A call to the restaurant confirms the closure is temporary due to unspecified problems and they hope to be open Thursday or Friday.

 When we get emails that start off with the phrase \"Learn to Drink Like an Australian,\" we can't help but peruse the contents. Yup, the intrepid Aussies behind Sunburnt Cow (137 Avenue C) and Bondi Road (153 Rivington Street) have struck again - a two hour all you can drink happy hour for $20.Basically, this early frontrunner for boozy deal of the year is an invitation to get ripped. Just sidle up to the bar and get two hours of tap beer, wine, moojuice (huh?) cocktails and well drinks every day from 4pm to 8pm. No word on whether if you arrive at 4pm, drink for two hours and then throw down another $20 at 6pm you can stay for two more. But we suspect they're up for all sorts of rowdy behavior with this kind of offer. Then they'll drop you off via their Moo Mobile... 646-315-1786 for info on pickup and drop off services.

 According to the VinExpo study by the International Wine & Spirit Record reported by MSNBC, the US continues to experience a boom in wine and liquor sales. Within three years, the US is poised to become the planet's biggest consumer of still wine, at roughly 4 billion bottles.Liquor sales are also way up, with a further 10% rise expected - recession be damned - by 2012. Vodka continues to lead the way, as the planet's favorite spirit. In the US, vodka sales are expected to reach 65 million cases. That's a lot of cosmos.

You'll also get 15% off these wines - the Riserva is a steal at $15.29.Tomorrow, January 30th, Union Square Wines will also be tasting these wines. Their website has good notes on the wines, and while they generally discount wines being tasted, no discount is mentioned.On Saturday, they will taste five Librandi wines paired with cheese and charcuterie at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria (1 Fifth Avenue). Cost is $45 (tip extra) and reservations can be made at 212-995-9559. More info is on Otto's website.

Liquor Stores in a Tizzy

***CONTENT
 Crain's New York is reporting that liquor stores are up in arms over the proposal by Governor Paterson to expand sales of wine to grocery stores in an attempt to raise money for the state budget. 2,700 of them have banded together to form a coalition called \"The Last Store on Main Street\" to fight the proposal, which could lead to an additional 19,000+ licenses to sell wine.New York State has long been backwards in laws related to selling wine. Recall that only a few years ago, all liquor stores were closed on Sundays as if this were the deep South. Some of these same stores fought the change because they argued Sunday hours favored big liquor stores over mom & pop shops. They were wrong about that and they are wrong about this.Fewer than ten states limit wine sales to liquor stores. New Jersey has tons of liquor stores and you can buy wine in supermarkets. If you peruse the aisle of a Jersey supermarket, you'll find a good deal of plonck among the mostly pedestrian choices. If you want interesting or hard to find wine, you go to a liquor store. The same would happen in New York - not to mention that you would still have to buy liquor at a liquor store. Also, let's not forget that stores in New York City don't even have all that much room for wine due to high real estate costs - stuff is already stacked to the ceiling. Where are they going to put so much wine that it puts shops out of business? However, we do think wine shops should be able to sell more than alcohol - cheese, mixers and beer come to mind. We also support the proposal to allow shops to have multiple licenses - creating mini-chains that can then leverage distributors for better deals. Let's level the playing field and let capitalism take over, shall we?

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 Time Out New York would seem to be a fan of our own Manhattan Project - why else would they advertise the \"Perfect Manhattan\" on the cover of this week's issue? Sure, the article delves into NYC themed drinks that the Manhattan has inspired, but why do they fumble so badly when highlighting where to have the original?Our guess is the writer was not aware of our own post about the Bemelman's experience - short version: dated room, overpriced drinks and a piss poor Manhattan made by someone who could have cared less. We'd actually be willing to bet that the writer did not set foot in Bemelman's for the story - since the default Manhattan when we were there was made with Makers, which is certainly not a rye as listed in the recipe on TONY's website. Not to mention that the recipe doesn't even include bitters. Huh?Among their picks for Manhattan-inspired cocktails, our favorite is the Little Italy at Pegu Club. Basically a somewhat bitter Manhattan, made with Cynar, it's one of our favorite drinks around town.

 Recent West Village wanderings took us into subterranean cocktail den Little Branch (22 Seventh Avenue South) in search of a good Manhattan. While we like the look of the space, the drinks themselves have never really impressed us. We slid into one of the tight booths and ordered a Manhattan. The waitress didn't ask for a booze preference but when it arrived, there was a familiar quality to it. Hmm, we thought. Could it be Old Overholt, our own house rye? Sure enough it was. Makes a nicely balanced Manhattan, though theirs was a tad drier than the Head Bartender version. At $12 a solid version of a classic cocktail.

 NYC diners know Restaurant Week is a bit of a crapshoot. Participants either take the promotion as an opportunity to introduce themselves to new diners - Danny Meyer's restaurants do this very well, so do restaurants such as Tocqueville and Cafe Boulud - or they do it for the volume or because they think they have to. We had hoped that Oceana's pedigree would put it firmly in the former category and their offer of 30% off the entire winelist during Restaurant Week was sufficient to lure us back, in spite of the mediocre food and wine service we had experienced there a few years ago. The chef had since changed, the Times' critic loved it (reaffirming its three stars just last July) and it seemed like a good opportunity to give it abother try.However, on our visit, it seemed like the kitchen wasn't even trying, just cranking out those menus and praying RW would soon be over soon. There was little imagination at work on the plates presented. Bland, boring, monotone presentation and flavors seemingly customized to a shabby room.

 The New York Times reported yesterday that Long Island vintner Robert Palmer died last week, making him the second winemaker to pass away within weeks after the tragic accident took Christian Wolffer's life in South America over the New Year's holiday. Palmer, though a pioneer in Long Island winemaking, was an ad man by trade and, as befits all true \"Mad Men,\" professed to like a good martini. Yet this non wine drinker still managed to build Palmer Vineyards into a well respected winery and popular tourist attraction. His ingenuity will live on as Long Island grows in stature as a world class wine region.

These events tend to be quite a steal and this is no exception - two hours of sake drinking plus appetizers by the restaurant. It's 37 sakes for $37, all inclusive.Buy tickets online or call the restaurant and speak with Karen (212-989-7699).

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel.

 We popped into Bemelman's the other night for a quick drink and found the room surprisingly busy for a cold January weeknight. Whether this was due to the live music or the famed bar being bullet-proof in our recessionary times is unclear, but the welcome at the bar itself was hardly warm and inviting.Even before sitting, the bartender warned us there would be a $10 per person cover charge ($20 each at the tables, more on weekends). Then we looked at the menu - $19 for a cocktail. Sheesh. The list has fallen a ways since Audrey Saunders redid it and seemed tailored to the crowd. We were talked out of the famed \"punch of the day\" ($15) by the gruff bartender, who implied the punch is the same every day and predictably suggested the most expensive drink ($20). Instead, we got a barely stirred Manhattan made with Makers that was rough, to say the least. They do give you a sidecar and the nuts are good.The room itself has seen better days, even though it was renovated in 2002. The famed murals seemed dim and the large piano right in the middle of the room forces you to dodge musicians and tables to reach the bar. The bar itself is merely functional, and the footrail was partially dislodged and not a secure place for feet.I guess the joint is content to ride on its history and good will of the aged clientele. But who knows for how long at these prices?Bemelman's BarThe Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th Street (at Madison)

 Urban Daddy breaks the news today that Sasha Petraske's White Star has adjusted its concept and is now serving proper cocktails. Prior, it only served liquor, notably absinthe, and beer. Thankfully, you can now get an Old Fashioned, Caipirinha or Manhattan, among others, for $10. We can only surmise that they succumbed to the pressure to serve cocktails due to the concept not quite clicking and a nowhere location (21 Essex near Hester St). For a look at their expanded menu, visit Urban Daddy. Expect a review, not to mention a visit from the Manhattan Project, soonish.

Also--apparently during Milk & Honey's renovations, anyone with a key can drink at WS for $9.

 We get a lot of recipes from liquor companies, but few are any good. Most of their so-called signature drinks wind up being too heavy handed with the product they are pushing. A notable exception are the fine folks at St. Germain, who consistently craft good drinks made with the elderflower liqueur.Case in point is the Paris Manhattan, a twist on the classic made with St. Germain, which actually enhances the flavor of the bourbon. The 'Parisian' touch is light and flirty without being too frou frou. We'd raise a glass to the creator of the drink, if we knew who he or she is...Paris Manhattanmakes one2oz Bourbon1oz St. Germain1/2oz Dry Vermouth2 dashes Angostura BittersPour ingredients into an ice filled shaker and stir until cold, strain into a martini glass.

 Last night at the New York Film Critics Circle Awards, actor Josh Brolin accepted the Best Supporting Actor award from presenter and Milk co-star Sean Penn. After Penn teased him, he launched into a bizarre attack on Russell Crowe, calling him an \"Asshole\". He then proceeded to say \"Fuck you, Ben. God I hate that motherfucker\" to NY Times reviewer Ben Brantley. We hear the audience was stunned at the tirade.Of course, Brolin later apologized, blaming booze, along with the \"ambiance\" of the ceremony, for the outburst. Yeah right, blame it on the booze!

 Apparently Obama-mania spread to the booze world when we weren't looking. The Daily News reported today on the ingenious beer created by Red Hook-based Six Point Craft Ales, Obama Beer. Unfortunately for us, the beer sold out after election day and there are no plans to make any more. However, on Inauguration Day, you can head out to a few places like d.b.a to get a small glass for $7. Crafty indeed.

 The bar at Gotham Bar and Grill (12 E. 12th Street) has long been one of the city's best dining bars thanks to their ingenious trays that rest on the rail running along the bar. While not a go-to spot for the drinks crowd these days, we figured it would have a solid Manhattan, so we popped in just before the holidays. The bartender asked our choice of booze and we chose rye. He recommended Michters, which is quite good but it turns out a bit pricey ($16). The resulting drink was a taste of classic New York - smooth yet potent. It almost made us forget the howling wind just outside the doors. Alas, if we could afford two, we might have really been protected from the elements.

 Vanishing New York is reporting the possible demise of one of the East Village's great dives - the Holiday Cocktail Lounge.

Opened in 1965, the Holiday was the epitome of the EV dives and one of the few that has survived to the present day. We raise a glass to it and hope reports of its death are greatly exaggerated.

***CONTENT
 Always on the cutting edge of a trend, The New York Times looks at the effect absinthe is having on the NYC booze world. The resulting article is pretty silly and yet more evidence of the paper's cluelessness when it comes to popular trends - down to the decidedly un-glamorous \"ptooey\" in the article's title.The author is Eric Konigsberg, apparently best known for his revealing insights into such topics as cloned pets and the need for supernannies. His take is basically that absinthe is a scam, something with silly rituals and dubious marketing, not to mention a pretty vile tasting liquor. At the outset of the piece, he visits Chinatown hotspot Apotheke - one of only two spots serving absinthe mentioned in a piece purportedly about an uber hot NYC trend - and makes little effort to temper his derision of the owner, the atmosphere and the crowd. Then he heads uptown to L'Absinthe, a \"polished and perfectly highly-regarded French restaurant\" run by \"a perfectly charming fellow,\" where he was lured by the restaurant's PR materials and a PR girl named Alice, then proceeds to partake in four different absinthes and talk to a few fans. What follows is \"perfectly\" predictable...

 Acclaimed Long Island winemaker Christian Wolffer died in bizarre circumstances near Rio de Janeiro on New Year's Eve. Apparently he was swimming when he was struck by the propeller of a passing boat. A nearby swimmer rescued him but he died from the wounds. Newsday reports an autopsy was performed but has not been released. The founder of Wolffer Estate and a key figure in the growth of Long Island as a world-class winemaking region, Wolffer was an outsized figure in the industry. A native of Hamburg, Germany, it is rumored that he invested $15 million in the creation of the successful winery also known for hosting the annual James Beard Chefs & Champagne event each summer. His influence will be missed.

 We popped into the \"soft opening\" of City Winery last night not knowing what to expect. Eater and Grub Street had written it up, there were a bunch of good wine deals and there is a big PR machine behind it. What we found, was a bit of a surprise - a cavernous space (at most a third full around 8:30pm) and a big stage with a piano. There are cool looking barrels and bottles-as-decor, too. Granted it was the day before New Year's Eve and the location, two blocks north of the Holland Tunnel, is challenging, but we expected a much bigger turnout of oenophiles.The first thing that strikes you about City Winery is the sheer size of the place. All blond wood, we can only imagine the acoustics when it is full. The main floor is the restaurant/bar/performance space with a small private room downstairs. Designed for maximum sightlines in relation to the stage, this unfortunately means that when there is no performance, your eyes are drawn to the emptiness of the stage. And with a room that large, you have to wonder how they will fill it when there are no performances. The opening night was low key and all about the wines. And the deals were impressive: $5 Henriot champagne, $20 for a 1970 Francesco Rinaldi Barolo, $15 Lopez de Heredia 1987 Rioja, $10 Olga Riffaut's 1989 Chinon - all well worth the price, even though there was significant bottle variation. The glass pours were generous and tastes were provided as well. This was easily the best place to taste old vintages in New York last night - how often does one get a chance to taste 20 and 30 year old wines by the glass? And at these prices?!

 We've been to Tailor at least half a dozen times since it opened and it remains an enigma to us. The subterranean bar, with adventurous drinks by mixologist Eben Freeman, remains a draw yet the place seems to still suffer a case of disjointedness. On the one hand, it has curry popcorn, as addictive as it gets for bar snacks, and a few seriously good drinks. On the other, it has sky high expectations, lots of hype and high prices to boot. Does it stand up to the the expectations? The answer is mainly yes, though it's not entirely successful from a barfly's point of view.

I visited Tailor for the first time before being aware of all the hype. And, even then, I found it disappointing. I have not dined upstairs, but the bar food was subpar. The cocktails on paper sounded fascinating, but simply did not fulfill the promise. I'd so much rather have a simple Old Fashioned than these creations which promise a lot, work hard to bring something new, but in the end, fall flat. I have since been back, and was as disappointed the second time around as the first. While I admire the efforts of Eben Freeman, the end result is a major disappointed. I have time and time again made tastier, more satisfying mixed drinks at home that lack the fuss and pretense. That said, I'll give it one more shot.

We don't disagree with you though we have found some good drinks there and the food is much improved. The thing that dismays us is the pricing, which has always been high in comparison to places like Death & Co or PDT.

 Waiting on a friend the other night, we slipped into the venerable Old Town Bar (45 E. 18th Street) and ordered up a Manhattan. The bartender asked if we preferred rye or bourbon and we went with rye, but left the brand choice up to him. The resulting drink was well balanced but bracing, to say the least. Kind of a working man's stiff drink, perfect for the blue collar crowd. The booze? McCormick's, the house rye. The price? $7.

 Every Tuesday, Astor Wines & Spirits discounts a region or type of booze 15%. Today: Austria. One of our (many) favorite wine-producing countries, it is well-known for its white wines, especially Gruner Veltliner and Riesling. And for those looking for them, there are plenty of delicious wines from great producers such as Nikolaihof, Nigl, Schloss Gobelsburg and Brundlmayer to be picked up for less today. But if you are looking for something different, try a fragrant dry muscat such as Ecker's Gelber Muskateller ($20.39 with the discount), which makes a great aperitif, or Weissburger (pinot blanc) from one of our favorite Austrian winemakers Heidi Schrock ($21.24 today). Discounted prices start at $10.19, today only.

 Today's Drinking Notes includes a few tips for dealing with hangovers and industry heavyweights weighing in on their last drink, if they were to give up alcohol. To shame that thought.StarChefs has a brief rundown on some hangover soothers. The resulting article is somewhat short on interesting tips, however, and a bit Seattle-centric. But we liked Tilth and Vessel, so we'll let it slide.Much more fun is Metromix's what if you only had one \"last drink\" article. Our favorite response is of course the reference to PDT's highly potent Staggerac (a sazerac made with George T. Stagg Bourbon) though demerits must be issued since it was suggested by a PDT bartender. We'll be by later to pick them up...Is it us or was that NY Times article on the move of P & G restaurant/bar a total snooze? Half way through, it turns its focus to Sirio Maccioni, subject of a documentary tonight on HBO. Guess P & G wasn't much of a story. Either that or an editor took a hacksaw to the piece.

 When asked our favorite libation, many potential answers present themselves depending on our mood. But when it comes to cocktails one drink stands above the rest - the Manhattan. This classic cocktail is the epitome of grown-up drinking: no juice, no shaking, no (plastic) monkeys. Just whiskey (usually rye or bourbon), vermouth and a few dashes of bitters, well stirred and served up. When well made, it's pure pleasure. When not, it's a boozy mess. Debuting in the Manhattan Club in the 1870s, the Manhattan is about a hundred years older than we are. In the intervening years, it has inspired many variations and knock-offs. In honor of the original's outsized influence, we decided to embark on a project to find the best Manhattans in Manhattan - and beyond. We will search far and wide, high end and low end, to identify the best and warn you about the worst. We'll let bartenders guide us when it comes to the booze and see where they take us. And we will also tell you about some of the city's best new creations inspired by the drink.But we can't drink the city by ourselves, hard as we try, so we'd like to hear from you about where to find the best Manhattan, who makes it or how you like to order it. Drop us an email or leave a comment.Our first stop was a natural, a New York institution with a great bar: Gramercy Tavern.

 We'd heard a lot of good things about Perbacco (234 E. 4th Street), so we popped in recently for dinner and ordered a bottle of red wine without a second thought. Then we noticed something odd - the wine was warm in the glass. It seemed the glasses themselves were warm so we had them replaced. New glasses arrived after several minutes and we were each poured wine - but the wine was still warm. Then we felt the bottle. Warm. Normally we'd ask for another bottle but in this particular situation it was not an option and the wine was quite drinkable, especially after it cooled off a bit. The culprit? Wine stored on shelves in the open - with votives in front of them keeping them nice and toasty. Message to restaurant owners - store your wine properly! If you do it for \"atmosphere,\" use those bottles as decor only - don't serve them to customers!As for the surprise two stars the restaurant received from the New York Times? Talk about a headscratcher of a review. Only the prices seemed to be at a two-star level. The cooking, mainly deconstructed Italian dishes, was okay but flavors and deliciousness were lost in the deconstruction process and the service was just average. We poured our own wine all night. There are plenty of better 1 star places.If you know of other crimes against wine, or any other booze, drop us a line or leave a comment.

 If you want to give the perfect gift to a rocker pal or club kid, how about a three-story music venue? That's right, the Knitting Factory space is up for sale. The original spot was a landmark but there are plenty of online gripes about how the new location at 74 Leonard Street was a drag on the joint's legacy. The venue is still running shows so it's unclear how long the owners plan to hang on at that location but they are entertaining offers. If you got the dough - over $500K a year just for rent - you can pick up a rare Tribeca triplex with 3 liquor licenses and a cabaret license. Give Steven Kamali a buzz -if you're interested.

 A reader asked us whether it was legal to charge corkage when you are BYOB and a quick call to the SLA (State Liquor Authority) clears up a few common misconceptions.Restaurants cannot be BYOB unless they have a license to sell alcohol. There is no separate BYOB permit. That means they have to go through the process, get the liquor license and have at least a temporary license on hand. If they choose to let you bring in booze and not sell their own, that is their call. So to answer the reader's question - licensed establishments can charge corkage. That is completely legal and outside the SLA's jurisdiction.

 Somewhat under the radar but worthy of a visit is the snug bar at Yerba Buena (23 Avenue A), overseen by the talented Artemio Vasquez, who learned a trick or two from his former employer, the doyenne of New York cocktails herself, Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club. The house cocktails we sampled ($12) were very good: the Jamaica 107 (left, hibiscus tea infused bernheim wheat whiskey + organic egg white + fresh lemon juice) was a hit with grown men, despite its pretty hibiscus color, and the Boludo \"Yerba Mate\" (yerba mate infused pisco + grapefruit & lime cordials + fresh lemon juice) was deliciously refreshing. We hear those mojitos go down real smooth too.And if you stop in by December 30, you can partake in their ongoing celebration of the repeal of prohibition. Classic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2 and Vieux Carre are $10.Perhaps best of all, plunk down $11 for a brunch cocktail and they will keep sending them until you beg them to stop. Yup, unlimited mimosas, bellinis, French 75 or the Peruvian Kiss, which has trouble written all over it.Yerba Buena23 Avenue A (bet Houston & 2nd Street)212-529-2919

 Next year, booze may well cost more. Gov. Paterson is proposing hikes in taxes on a whole assortment of goods, including beer and wine. Booze taxes are levied per gallon, and wine is currently taxed at the rate of 19 cents per gallon in New York. The proposal will raise that to about 51 cents, still below the national median tax rate.But there is some potential good news - the governor also wants to allow supermarkets to sell wine.

 The champagne bubble seems to have burst this year, but thankfully there are plenty of good, affordable sparkling wines you can serve at parties, bring along or give as gifts with no shame. For bubbly on the budget (or a splurge), we usually head to Astor Wines & Spirits, which has the most extensive selection of sparklers by country and region - and the best prices. For $20 or less, here are a few recently tasted winesProsecco is often the go-to sparkler for people since it's affordable and highly drinkable. Prosecco di Valdobbiadene Col Vetoraz is a very good option: clean, crisp and smooth with depth and complexity and refreshing citrus notes. While available at Vestry Wines and Italian Wine Merchants, Astor has the best price at $15.99.Made by a French champagne family in New Mexico, Gruet offers excellent quality for the price. Rich and creamy with a toasty finish, the Brut is nicely balanced. The Gruet Blanc de Noirs is even richer and both are $12.99 at Astor. A great value and a hands-down favorite under $15.Should you chance bubbly under $10? Delacroix Brut Blanc de Blancs is a French sparkler that's fairly simple but a great find for its price - $7.99 at Astor. A blend of chardonnay, chenin blanc and ugni blanc (used in cognac making), it is fresh, easy drinking and has good fizz - perfect for big parties.The elegant Parigot & Richard Crémant De Bourgogne Brut Blanc de Blancs is the closest to champagne in this group. Dry and polished, this delicious wine will easily stand up to higher priced champagnes. It's made with chardonnay and aligoté - and excellent with smoked salmon and crème fraiche. $19.99 at Astor.

 Liquor license woes are legendary in New York these days. All too often restaurants have to open without one. It gets reported in the media at opening time but then we are left to wonder - did they ever get that license? Heck, do they even want one? Here's an update on the status at some local favorites. Each restaurant has its charms and fans will attest to the food, but saving a few bucks on booze is an additional plus, especially these days.Motorino, East Williamsburg pizza hotspot (319 Graham Ave), is still without a liquor license. They welcome you to bring in beer or wine. Another Brooklyn pizza mecca, Lucali (575 Henry Street, Carroll Gardens), has also remained sans liquor license so pack your own. (Photo - Motorino pie)Petite self-professed \"neo-Korean\" East Villager Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street) is still going strong in the wake of summer critical praise and the Times review. Their website cryptically says they are \"BYOB again,\" so go ahead.Kuma Inn (113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor) continues to wow them on the LES. They are BYO for the time being but they do have corkage fees, depending on your booze of choice: $5 for 750ml wine, $1 per 12oz beer, $3 for 300ml of sake, $4 for 720ml of sake and $10 for 1.5L. No hard liquor allowed.

Please clarify, if the place doesn't have a liquor license, by law you can't charge customers even for services related to alcohol ie \"corkage\" I have no problem tipping the server for the extra service, just giving more money to an undeserving proprietor.

 In Japan sake is as everyday as soda pop, with cans of sake available from vending machines everywhere, including in railway stations for those long rides home. While you can't get it from a machine, you can still emulate those crafty Japanese with some great fresh-tasting sake out of a can right here in NYC.One of our favorites is Funaguchi Kikusui, a draft sake straight from the tank, unpasteurized with no additives. The can is perfect for preserving this fresh, easy drinking sake. Be careful though - these dynamite 200ml cans pack a punch since the sake is 19.8% alcohol. You can pick them up at Sakaya (324 E. 9th Street) for $6.99. Drink cold.Another sake available by the can, albeit in a larger 720ml version, is the delicious Narutotai Ginjo Nama Genshu. Let's break down the name -Narutotai is the name, ginjo is the type, nama means unpasteurized, and genshu means that no water was added at the end of the brewing process. This makes for a fresh, potent sake (18%+ alcohol) that is both rich and smooth. Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is selling the can right now for $32.99.

 What is the best new bar you can't get into? How about a new speakeasy (name TBD) that opened in a Village basement. And no, you likely can't get in right now.Places slipping in under the radar are a rarity in NYC. An unmarked basement location certainly helps. Limited operating hours, mostly on weekends, do too. Right now it is only an event space.But if you do make it in - with the secret password (available via text) given to the doorman - an underground world suddenly unfolds. The space is warm and welcoming, with nooks and crannies on either side of a long old school bar. Above is the requisite stuffed animal - a wolf's head peering down at the revelry. The decor (and staff) will be familiar to anyone who's been to Apotheke, Tailor or Clover Club - lots of wood, plush sofas, old-fashioned light fixtures. And there is an impressive amount a space, a welcome change from great but tiny places like PDT or Milk and Honey that but fill up quickly.The cellar has a fascinating history. It was once Pfaff's Beer Cellar, circa the early 1800s, and hosted Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, among others. Later incarnations included a photo studio where Abe Lincoln's portrait was taken, a 1900s brothel, the infamous Infinity Disco where 21 people died in a fire in the 1970s, and the gay club Mr. Black Dance Den.So what about the drinks? They are well-priced ($12 for cocktails) and well-balanced. We very much liked the eponymous Woodson and Ford (applejack, zacapa 23, benedictine, sweet vermouth, Fee brothers' whiskey barrel bitters). The Woodrow Wilson, however, would best be categorized as \"interesting\" since the flavors and booze - rittenhouse rye, amaro averna, champagne, demerara and orange zest - did not quite mesh. The floating ice cubes eventually melted and mellowed out the drink.The bar also has a nice vittles menu. The mostly Spanish-skewing plates range from $7 to $17 (kumamotos are $3 a pop) and come from the Corner Shop Cafe upstairs. Patatas Bravas deep fried in duck fat and served with homemade ketchup, were scrumptious ($7) while Fabada, fava beans and spiced pork, was good but overpriced at $11. The cheese selection (a hefty $6 each) is commendable, with Mrs. Quickie's cheddar, Tuxford & Tebbutt Stilton and Uplands Pleasant Ridge.After the jump, a look at the full cocktail menu plus other boozy details. We'll keep you posted on door policies and hours - we hear they might be opening on Mondays and Tuesdays as early as this week.Woodson and Ford643 Broadway, Downstairs

The woodrow Wilson is a variation in the jimmy Roosevelt which is a sophisticated palate, layered, champagne cocktail over ice. So interesting is right. As far as the space \"head bartender\" you will not receive any passwords. The unamed establishment is an event space. Clearly stealing our menus is frowned upon and since I would have seen you taking copious notes or taking photos I can only assume you vandalized our vintage books. I hope you enjoyed the event you attended but please fact check your blog. Woodson and ford is the zacapa cocktail name not the space.

The spot sounds cool and I'm looking forward to checking it out when it opens to the public. However, complaining about the positive coverage you're receiving as a result of this post doesn't make sense and is kinda lame. Having a bars status discussed on a NY blog is exactly where the conversation will play out. this blog just handed you the mic, and this is your oppertunity to clear up any misconceptions. Bashing the blogger for 'stealing' is not the message I would suggest. Social Media PR is tricky stuff, I would consider speaking with a firm that can help you navigate.

RQ, re: this whole password business--if you want to keep out the casual passerby/speakeasy stalker, why not just have a guest list like _every_ other private event in the city? I'd think that would be more effective, as then people can't just text their friends the password. And HB, I'm confused. Were you at a private party without realizing it?

2008-12-17 17:59:00
It was a birthday party for 2 people in the liquor industry. Apparently HB was invited by one of the hosts or managed to get swept in by the crowd. He sat center bar and ate food which was not included in the complimentary special cocktails paid for by the host. We were 6 deep so no one noticed the camera phone.

Here's the thing - nobody said it was not open or had anyone sign a non-disclosure agreement or the like. The city is rife with speakeasy marketing gimmicks like passwords and \"secret\" spots. The staff told us the place had been open a couple of weeks. They gave us hours. And when we were there, people were paying for their drinks. These are the facts. As for the post - you asked us to change the it and we did so. We look forward to the day when you are open to the public. H.B.

 The boozy season is upon us so here is our guide to surviving it - assuming your company still has the dough for a holiday party. The Head Bartender knows there's an equal chance you'll be naughty or nice, so here are some ways to make sure you keep your job and don't wind up making out with the boss at the end of the night:Keep in mind, holiday parties are extensions of work. Merry is good but don't make an ass of yourself.If you don't want to be seen on YouTube in it, don't wear it.Bring a partner or significant other to keep you in line. (This works as long as they don't imbibe as much or more than you.)Eat before drinking. Hit the carbs or the carving station - they'll give you good padding for a night of open bar.Go 1 for 1 water to booze to mitigate the effects. The last thing you want to do is call off the next day and be the endless butt of jokes. Leave one-half hour before the party is over. This way, you won't wind up drunk and uninhibited when the lights go out.The goal of attending an office party is to have a good time and survive with your dignity intact, not to get bombed. You'll thank us in the morning.

 Now that the dust has settled from the '08 elections, we can look at the effect the booze industry had on the race. And shocker of all shockers... it favored Democrats with donations this year. It's actually the first time since 1994 that the booze industry gave more to Democrats than Republicans - 52% - 48%, not too far off the popular vote of 53% - 46% for Pres Elect Obama. In all, the industry and individuals associated with it donated $12.997 million. Way to grease the rails of democracy! Out of 80 industries measured, the booze industry was #37 in terms of money donated. The numbers going back to the 1990 campaign are broken down at OpenSecrets.org.

***CONTENT
 You're probably not the only one confused by Ella and Elsa, two newish cocktail bars in the East Village that opened within weeks - and blocks - of each other. However, once you get past the names, there isn't a whole lot that the two places have in common.Ella is the slicker of the two joints, with Victoria's Secret-esque pink and black striped walls, a smoky underground performance space and velvet ropes out front. Assuming you can slip in past the doorman - they have a semi-strict door policy we bet gets dropped any minute- you'll find yourself in a glammed up space with a long bar and some banquettes up front. The drink list is impressively long - nine specialty cocktails, three champagne cocktails and eleven classic cocktails. We instinctively go for brown liquor so we tried the Clark Gable (maker's mark, lime, ginger-infused simple syrup) and it was the clear favorite. Finding another appealing drink was a bit of a challenge, however. The Mildred Pierce (bulldog gin, basil infused simple syrup, lime) was recommended by the bartender but highly acidic. Mommie Dearest (milagro tequila, lime, simple syrup, orange bitters) was also seriously out of balance and the Rye Smash (sazerac rye, muddled raspberries, lemon, simple syrup) was hardly a smashing success. In the meantime, a DJ bombarded us with some of the worst music this side of Jersey. Clearly Ella is for cool people. I guess they can hope to find a clientele too cool for taste buds.On to Elsa, over in Alphabet City. A former dive bar, the space was remade with a bespoke men's tailor in the front and a cocktail bar in the back. The room is kind of upstate antiques shop basic, with narrow booths up front across from a standing-only bar and rustic tables in the back. Mainly wood, the room is simple and bland (and way too bright), though we did like the barn-like effect of the bathroom ceiling. With the décor underwhelming, all we could hope for were some good cocktails. (There are also beers on tap, flowing through an old Singer sewing machine, and a few wines.) From the short list (4 signature concoctions and 4 classics), we tried The Jaszek (applejack, velvet falernum, lime, angostura, orange bitters) and the El Romero Borracho (souza blanco, grapefruit, campari, lime), coming away hopeful for the future. Both were balanced, complex and satisfying, showing skill on behalf of the resident mixologist. The Perfect Manhattan? Yes, please. When they get their feet wet, we'll be back for a second look.Ella9 Avenue A between 1st and 2nd streets, 212-777-2230Elsa217 E. 3rd Street between Avenue B and C, 917-882-7395

 We love eating at restaurant bars, in part because we prefer to chat up bartenders, but also because you have a lot more freedom in how and what you order. Unfortunately, something has started rubbing us the wrong way - restaurants charging wine prices for artisanal beers. OK folks, we know these beers are more expensive than your typical Bud or Coors Light but do they really cost you $3 each?New restaurants seem particularly egregious about jacking up beer prices. The John Dory has a tiny list of four beers, three for $8 and one for $9. I recall much better prices on the beers at sister restaurant The Spotted Pig. While they have only been open a few weeks, perhaps they'll see the light at the end of 10th Avenue and give beer drinkers a break.Irving Mill, a recent recipient of criticism for serving beer in less than pint size glasses, has a huge list of $7 and $8 tap beers. Ommegang from Cooperstown is $8? Brooklyn Pilsner is $7? That's pretty excessive in our opinion. Even worse, their list by the bottle has beers for $12 and $13.Perhaps restaurateurs are forced to raise beer prices because people will only pay so much for wine or food. But the approach is counter-productive. When faced with a list of over-priced artisanal beers, we now just tend to stop at one. What do you do?

 You've seen the vougue cocktail ingredient \"Velvet Falernum\" around town, but just what exactly is it?Falernum is a mix of several spices (generally ginger, almond, clove) and lime, sometimes alcoholic and sometimes not. You'll find it in Tiki drinks, classic Caribbean drinks like the Mai Tai and Zombie and, of course, in cool cocktails around NYC. The poplular brand is John D. Taylor Velvet Falernum from Barbados, which is an infusion of spices, sugar cane syrup and rum. You can try it in the unfortunately named Lovee Long Time at the new hotspot Macao Trading Co. (311 Church Street, Tribeca)

Can't decide? They will pour your tastes to help your decision making along.Prices aren't cheap, generally $7 for a pint of beer, so Happy Hour is a good deal with $5 beers and $6 wines.

 Est Arrivee! Or something. Beaujolais Nouveau is the king of wine promotions - legally it cannot be served until the third Thursday of November and that means marketing up the wazoo to announce its somewhat dubious arrival. Here is where you can get your grapes off, so to speak:The king of promotions goes to producer Georges Duboeuf, which has an annual chef-biker ride to deliver Beaujolais. It's the middle of the day and involves no wine, so we say skip it.The FIAF (French Institute Alliance Francaise) has an event starting at 6:30pm. You can get all the BN you can drink plus food and entertainment. 22 East 60th Street, $55 for non-members. More infoJules Bistro (65 St. Marks) will be serving Antonin Rodet Beaujolais, which is a step up from Duboeuf. Jules has the added bonus of free bites at the bar, if you can get close enough, plus cool jazz. As an added bonus, you can pop in to register to win a free trip to France on Open Skies airline.

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 Somewhat under the radar but worthy of a visit is the snug bar at Yerba Buena (23 Avenue A), overseen by the talented Artemio Vasquez, who learned a trick or two from his former employer, the doyenne of New York cocktails herself, Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club. The house cocktails we sampled ($12) were very good: the Jamaica 107 (left, hibiscus tea infused bernheim wheat whiskey + organic egg white + fresh lemon juice) was a hit with grown men, despite its pretty hibiscus color, and the Boludo \"Yerba Mate\" (yerba mate infused pisco + grapefruit & lime cordials + fresh lemon juice) was deliciously refreshing. We hear those mojitos go down real smooth too.And if you stop in by December 30, you can partake in their ongoing celebration of the repeal of prohibition. Classic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2 and Vieux Carre are $10.Perhaps best of all, plunk down $11 for a brunch cocktail and they will keep sending them until you beg them to stop. Yup, unlimited mimosas, bellinis, French 75 or the Peruvian Kiss, which has trouble written all over it.Yerba Buena23 Avenue A (bet Houston & 2nd Street)212-529-2919

 The SLA is diligently killing off the concept of BYOB for restaurants as evidenced by the latest report on Grub Street about Emporio's booze-less opening. Yup, no BYOB for them.As we've previously reported, the current laws are asinine - a restaurant can't be BYOB unless they have a liquor license (not even if you have applied and it is pending) but if they never intend to apply, they are not under the SLA's authority and thus they can't do anything to stop you. The cops could, theoretically, but we doubt they'll be raiding anyone over this.A much better idea would be to re-write the laws to allow any restaurant to be BYOB and to streamline the licensing procedure for restaurants. There was a movement to separate restaurants from bars and clubs but that seems to be up in the air. In the meantime, since it's clear people want booze with their dinner, shouldn't our state reps help foster a system that is a win-win for both customers and restaurant owners? Cause this cockamanie system is terrible for everyone and has damaged too many restaurants to count.

BYOB without a liquor license is always illegal, whether or not you're applying for license through the SLA. And even if you are, the SLA doesn't do anything to stop you. They'll just take note of the fact that you illegally allowed BYOB while your license was pending. It's true that cops probably aren't going to go door to door with no-license restaurants to enforce the law, but if, say, you have an upstairs neighbor that you've pissed off, they can call the cops on you, and then they'll HAVE to investigate.

 Disturbing news for New Yorkers - most BYO restaurants are breaking the law according to a story in Crains New York. As we previously reported, restaurants need to have a liquor license to allow BYO - unless they are under 20 seats. If they open and are applying for a license, they may jeopardize the application's status by allowing BYO. It's unclear what the consequences are since the SLA (State Liquor Authority) only has jurisdiction if an application for a license is underway - no application, no SLA authority. Then enforcement fall on the police.

 Liquor license woes are legendary in New York these days. All too often restaurants have to open without one. It gets reported in the media at opening time but then we are left to wonder - did they ever get that license? Heck, do they even want one? Here's an update on the status at some local favorites. Each restaurant has its charms and fans will attest to the food, but saving a few bucks on booze is an additional plus, especially these days.Motorino, East Williamsburg pizza hotspot (319 Graham Ave), is still without a liquor license. They welcome you to bring in beer or wine. Another Brooklyn pizza mecca, Lucali (575 Henry Street, Carroll Gardens), has also remained sans liquor license so pack your own. (Photo - Motorino pie)Petite self-professed \"neo-Korean\" East Villager Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street) is still going strong in the wake of summer critical praise and the Times review. Their website cryptically says they are \"BYOB again,\" so go ahead.Kuma Inn (113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor) continues to wow them on the LES. They are BYO for the time being but they do have corkage fees, depending on your booze of choice: $5 for 750ml wine, $1 per 12oz beer, $3 for 300ml of sake, $4 for 720ml of sake and $10 for 1.5L. No hard liquor allowed.

Please clarify, if the place doesn't have a liquor license, by law you can't charge customers even for services related to alcohol ie \"corkage\" I have no problem tipping the server for the extra service, just giving more money to an undeserving proprietor.

Strikes us as an odd promotion - how many people want a vodka martini in the middle of the day? Especially when they are ordering an express lunch?

 Today, Eric Asimov wrote a piece in The New York Times about little known Italian wines that are a good value. Unfortunately, the paper didn't include the most helpful information - where to buy them! That's right folks, the paper decided to only list importers since it insists on having a national food section. Too bad that isn't much help to New Yorkers.Here are a couple of our favorite places to pick up Italian wines from $10 to $20:Smith & Vine (268 Smith Street, Brooklyn) has a great selection - 50 different bottles in that price range.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is even more impressive, with over 90 wines in this price range.Enoteca DiPalo (200 Grand Street) opened in November two doors down from the original DiPalo, featuring wine from each of Italy's 20 regions. While the prices are generally higher than the Times range, more like $15 - $29 for most bottles, the selection includes some hard to find wines and is chosen with the usual DiPalo family care.Let us know where you like to pick up Italian (or any other) wines.

 We passed by respected Japanese kaiseki spot Rosanjin this weekend and came across this disturbing, misspelled sign signaling a \"temporary\" closure. We peered over the screens covering up the windows and saw an empty room, save a ladder in the center. Was their transformation from set menu to a la carte not enough to keep the restaurant afloat? Or is there a problem with the space that needed fixing? The outgoing message on the restaurant's machine gives no hint of closure and Open Table has tables available from Wednesday on (Mon and Tues not available).UPDATE 2/2/09 12:30pm - A call to the restaurant confirms the closure is temporary due to unspecified problems and they hope to be open Thursday or Friday.

***CONTENT
 Why, we wonder, can't people just leave wine the way it is? First they added sugar-free sweetener to it. Now we have a \"new wine craze\" straight out of Cherry Valley, Ohio: Fruiteasers. Emerine Estates Winery has created a line of wine that uses a base such as chardonnay, riesling or merlot then adds in various fruits including apple, peach, blueberry and pineapple to create \"exotic fruit wines.\" Now, we don't mind old-fashioned wines made out of fruit (other than grapes). But why boost wines that naturally may have notes such as pineapple (riesling) or blueberries (merlot) with actual fruit? Or in the case of Seduction, a pinot noir with coffee, mocha, vanilla, cherries and chocolate. Are the wines themselves not enough? More of the head-scratching offerings here - Strawberry Shortcake Wine anyone? Speaking of cake, this wine definitely takes it: \"As seen on TV, its true (sic!), a 100% pure Chardonnay with Amish butter.\" No, we're not making this up. The name of the wine? Tear Drops. How a propos.

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

 A while back, we slapped Perbacco on the wrist for selling warm wine and placing candles in front of wine bottles. Unfortunately, new restaurant Sorella (95 Allen Street) is another offender. We slipped in for a glass of wine the other day and were impressed by the design and the attention to detail in everything from an interesting wine selection to the printed materials. Then we looked up to see wine everywhere.Folks, we can't stress enough that you store wine for customers properly. Having wine stored on shelves lit by candles is pretty but it's not wine we want to drink. Even worse, when the temperature control on the room's thermostat is set in the upper 70s, we get really concerned for the wine.The winelist is heavily skewed towards Northern Italy (good) but very pricey (bad). Since the cooking is skewed towards Piemontese, the region wines are well represented. Unfortunately, bottles under $50 are in short supply and the bulk of the reds from Piedmont were over $80. Wines by the glass tend towards the obscure, which is fine, but nothing we tried was really delicious. Prices by the glass, $10 to $17, would be fair if the pours were more generous. Right now they skimpy.

 We'd heard a lot of good things about Perbacco (234 E. 4th Street), so we popped in recently for dinner and ordered a bottle of red wine without a second thought. Then we noticed something odd - the wine was warm in the glass. It seemed the glasses themselves were warm so we had them replaced. New glasses arrived after several minutes and we were each poured wine - but the wine was still warm. Then we felt the bottle. Warm. Normally we'd ask for another bottle but in this particular situation it was not an option and the wine was quite drinkable, especially after it cooled off a bit. The culprit? Wine stored on shelves in the open - with votives in front of them keeping them nice and toasty. Message to restaurant owners - store your wine properly! If you do it for \"atmosphere,\" use those bottles as decor only - don't serve them to customers!As for the surprise two stars the restaurant received from the New York Times? Talk about a headscratcher of a review. Only the prices seemed to be at a two-star level. The cooking, mainly deconstructed Italian dishes, was okay but flavors and deliciousness were lost in the deconstruction process and the service was just average. We poured our own wine all night. There are plenty of better 1 star places.If you know of other crimes against wine, or any other booze, drop us a line or leave a comment.

Deal or No Deal? - Bar Blanc Bistro

***CONTENT
 With just two days left in the Bar Blanc Bistro (142 West 10th Street) opening week deal, we decided to pop in and see how they were doing. The bar was fairly busy but the restaurant mostly empty when we arrived. We grabbed a pair of empty seats at the bar and were handed the menus. The bartender clearly explained the half-off deal and the exclusions - no bottled beer, burger or oysters for half price. Fair enough, we thought, since the bar menu had a good bit of choice.The half-off special applied to draft beer, wine by the glass and carafe, and house cocktails. (The not-included bottled beer is your typical rip-off with $7 Stellas, Leffe and Hoegaarden). There were lots of choices among the cocktails, normally $12, generally classics or riffs on them including a caipiroska, sidecar (very popular) and a grapefruit martinis. We stuck to beer and wine. The Grimbergen ale was new to us but quite good (normally $7) if a bit sweet at the bottom of the glass while Blue Moon is... Blue Moon. Wines were interesting but suffered from being too warm and open for a while. A Pinot Noir from France was good but neither the mundane Tempranillo nor the White Bordeaux excited us.Food-wise, we enjoyed most everything - the chicken liver mousse was very good as were the beef croquettes, though the underlying mustard was way too hot. The burger was large and juicy while fries were perfectly crisped.Overall, the space looks the same from its previous incarnation (pre-bistro). It certainly doesn't read bistro and it's way too dark - reading menus was only possible by candlelight. Will this incarnation make it? Certainly the bar is comfortable but beer and wine are a bit too expensive for it to be a regular stop. The restaurant itself is a tougher sell and they have their work cut out for them. The previous restaurants struggled in the same space so you have to wonder if it is cursed. In the meantime, is it a deal? Heck yea! 50% off the entire check (tip on the whole amount fellow boozers). We suggest you hurry over before it expires tomorrow night at 8pm. Rumor has it they will have some type of happy hour after the deal is gone but it won't be nearly as good.

Tonight you can play out the classic Northern vs Southern Italy rivalry by trying four wines. On Saturday, you can try four more Italian wines as well as some Woodford Reserve Bourbon (the best bourbon there is in our humble opinion) in honor of Kentucky Derby day.Lastly, as much as we'd like to avoid it, Cinco de Mayo is coming up.

 A lot of time large scale tastings covering a certain region or country are not great ways to showcase wine - too much filler, too little interesting product. Thankfully, the Wines of Portugal event held this Tuesday intrigued us enough to overcome our skepticism, and thankfully we found lots of interesting wines - some available in the U.S. and some not.The wineries present represented all of Portugal's growing areas and specialized in whites, reds and ports along with a smattering of rose and sparkling wines. We stuck to the indigenous grapes such as Alvarinho, Arinto, Aragones and Touriga Nacional, avoiding the more international styles whenever possible.Here are some of the highlights, with a focus on wines that have distribution in place and thus possible to find in stores and restaurants:

 From half a block away you could hear the bagpipes. That meant just one thing - whiskey awaited. Over 100 of them in fact inside Chelsea Piers at the annual whiskey showcase \"Whisky Live\".The good stuff was distributed over 38 stations while around the corner various Scottish bands played fast and furious. Already familiar with the Highland Park, Oban and Macallan, we headed straight to the lesser known brands. The focus of the show is Scotch but there were also Bourbons, Rye, Blended Scotches and more. A lot of good stuff was being poured and we wasted no time exploring. Our favorites after the jump.

 Message to the media - please stop writing about PDT. It's in the name of the place for god's sake. Yes, it's a great bar. Yes, we like it very much. But enough's enough. The latest offender is Food & Wine. In their May 2009 issue featuring the best restaurants and bars around the world, they go for the obvious when it comes to NYC and highlight PDT - complete with photo. Yup, more tourists trying to figure out how to get through the phone booth. Just what we need.

 Few things go as well together as pizza and beer. Unfortunately, few things are as ripe for extreme mark-up as those two items. In the case of Co., or Company as you like, don't expect the recession to mean customer-friendly pricing.We'll come right out and say it - we were underwhelmed. The pizzas were small (about 11\") and the edges of the ballyhooed crust were almost reminiscent of Pizza Hut. The crust itself was pretty good, but the toppings deserved to be seasoned properly though, with salt definitely missing in action. And the pizzas seemed overloaded with cheese and bechamel, guess to explain the pricing - the majority of pizzas are $16 to $18 and appetizer up-selling is heavy.But this is a booze blog. And there is nothing more depressing than staring at a beer list where everything is $7. Really, $7 for Blue Moon, Sixpoint and Stella? While we're at it, could they come up with a more cliched list of beers? What possible justification can there be for marking up beer over 500% anyway?We here at Boozy are getting real tired of being ripped off for the privilege of drinking designer beers - not to mention the Belgian equivalent of Bud. If restaurateurs have so little respect for beer drinkers that they view them merely as a profit center, maybe they should just stop serving beer. On this particular day, we silently drank water. That is not our preferred dining mode.

 One of our readers has a bone to pick with the media, especially today's AM New York pizza article. \"Can everyone please stop calling Artichoke \"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery\"? The place is not a brewery! They have two beers - Bud and Bud Light available in 32 oz styrofoam cups for $5.50! Give me a break.\"We have to say he has a point. The media often just blindly repeats nonsense without doing even basic research. We don't care if the owners want it called by such a nonsensical moniker, the place is known as Artichoke to everyone and that's what we'll call it. Oh, and singling out Lombardi's as a \"legend\" is just wrong. The place is a tourist trap with overloaded crappy pizza. It's high time the media stop pushing that place as worth a visit.

 Time Out New York would seem to be a fan of our own Manhattan Project - why else would they advertise the \"Perfect Manhattan\" on the cover of this week's issue? Sure, the article delves into NYC themed drinks that the Manhattan has inspired, but why do they fumble so badly when highlighting where to have the original?Our guess is the writer was not aware of our own post about the Bemelman's experience - short version: dated room, overpriced drinks and a piss poor Manhattan made by someone who could have cared less. We'd actually be willing to bet that the writer did not set foot in Bemelman's for the story - since the default Manhattan when we were there was made with Makers, which is certainly not a rye as listed in the recipe on TONY's website. Not to mention that the recipe doesn't even include bitters. Huh?Among their picks for Manhattan-inspired cocktails, our favorite is the Little Italy at Pegu Club. Basically a somewhat bitter Manhattan, made with Cynar, it's one of our favorite drinks around town.

Other than the Bemelman's blunder, I think it's a pretty good list. I'm a big fan of the Greenpoint, and am happy to see that Max at Jack the Horse made the list--although am worried that all this exposure may mean the end of quiet nights at \"my\" bar...

 We popped into Bemelman's the other night for a quick drink and found the room surprisingly busy for a cold January weeknight. Whether this was due to the live music or the famed bar being bullet-proof in our recessionary times is unclear, but the welcome at the bar itself was hardly warm and inviting.Even before sitting, the bartender warned us there would be a $10 per person cover charge ($20 each at the tables, more on weekends). Then we looked at the menu - $19 for a cocktail. Sheesh. The list has fallen a ways since Audrey Saunders redid it and seemed tailored to the crowd. We were talked out of the famed \"punch of the day\" ($15) by the gruff bartender, who implied the punch is the same every day and predictably suggested the most expensive drink ($20). Instead, we got a barely stirred Manhattan made with Makers that was rough, to say the least. They do give you a sidecar and the nuts are good.The room itself has seen better days, even though it was renovated in 2002. The famed murals seemed dim and the large piano right in the middle of the room forces you to dodge musicians and tables to reach the bar. The bar itself is merely functional, and the footrail was partially dislodged and not a secure place for feet.I guess the joint is content to ride on its history and good will of the aged clientele. But who knows for how long at these prices?Bemelman's BarThe Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th Street (at Madison)

 We love eating at restaurant bars, in part because we prefer to chat up bartenders, but also because you have a lot more freedom in how and what you order. Unfortunately, something has started rubbing us the wrong way - restaurants charging wine prices for artisanal beers. OK folks, we know these beers are more expensive than your typical Bud or Coors Light but do they really cost you $3 each?New restaurants seem particularly egregious about jacking up beer prices. The John Dory has a tiny list of four beers, three for $8 and one for $9. I recall much better prices on the beers at sister restaurant The Spotted Pig. While they have only been open a few weeks, perhaps they'll see the light at the end of 10th Avenue and give beer drinkers a break.Irving Mill, a recent recipient of criticism for serving beer in less than pint size glasses, has a huge list of $7 and $8 tap beers. Ommegang from Cooperstown is $8? Brooklyn Pilsner is $7? That's pretty excessive in our opinion. Even worse, their list by the bottle has beers for $12 and $13.Perhaps restaurateurs are forced to raise beer prices because people will only pay so much for wine or food. But the approach is counter-productive. When faced with a list of over-priced artisanal beers, we now just tend to stop at one. What do you do?

 We noticed an odd sight outside FiDi's Gild Hall, a fancy Thompson Hotel venture complete with an upscale celeb chef resto - a whiteboard promoting happy hour. The joint, fancifully named the Libertine, opened with typical fanfare due to the name of its chef Todd English - English does English! - but failed to thrill both critics and diners.The beer-heavy ($4 Stellas, $5 Draughts) happy hour skews heavily towards guys with an appetite for oysters. The $1 - 1.50 oysters are a nice touch, but hey, how about something liquid for the ladies? Unlike Gild Hall, the trendy Thompson production, and Libertine, which was supposed to evoke London clubhouses circa 1970s (monied? plush?), the whiteboard sign is decidedly downscale and uninviting. Frankly, it looks to us like it was pulled from a back office (we hope the conference rooms' boards are cleaner than this!). Dear Management, this is the most passive-aggressive approach to promoting happy hour we've ever seen. Are you sure you want anyone coming in?The Libertine15 Gold StreetHappy Hour: 5pm - 7pm

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel. Juice oranges. Add OJ to sugar with peel. Pour boiling water and Arrack over the mix. Add hot (but not boiling) wine. Stir. Serve.

 You've seen the vougue cocktail ingredient \"Velvet Falernum\" around town, but just what exactly is it?Falernum is a mix of several spices (generally ginger, almond, clove) and lime, sometimes alcoholic and sometimes not. You'll find it in Tiki drinks, classic Caribbean drinks like the Mai Tai and Zombie and, of course, in cool cocktails around NYC. The poplular brand is John D. Taylor Velvet Falernum from Barbados, which is an infusion of spices, sugar cane syrup and rum. You can try it in the unfortunately named Lovee Long Time at the new hotspot Macao Trading Co. (311 Church Street, Tribeca)

 We've had sparkling sake, dessert sake, aged sake, sake in a can, and now... sake in a jar. Yup the latest craze (maybe) is sake in a 200ml jar, the perfect size to slip into your suit jacket for that long ride home. Long popular in Japan, especially among commuting businessmen, single serve sakes have slowly been making their way into the U.S. market. Wakatsuru in Toyama (Western Japan) makes one of the first to be offered in a jar, a full-bodied and flavorful Junmai Daiginjo. The sake was good but better with food than on its own. And not quite as good as our favorite single-serve sake, Funaguchi Kikusui.Available at Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street, website). $5.99 per bottle.

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

***CONTENT
 When is a beer too fancy? That question is a common one these days as restaurants continue to look for ways to jack up prices with obscure beers and importers bring in ever more product. Case in point, Kasteel Cru, a fairly new arrival on the scene from Alsace, France made with champagne yeast and now selling at Whole Foods for $4.99 a bottle.That's a fair amount of scratch in these times, even for a lifestyle beer which this clearly is. So we picked up a bottle to see what the hype is all about. The first taste is of a well made lager with a bit of an effervescent character. Sipping further, we found that the slight bitterness of the initial taste seemed to mellow into an almost bubbly quality. This actually counteracts the \"beerness\" of the beer and makes the taste less cohesive but certainly makes for a bit of lightness in the mouth feel.We were curious how the beer held up over, say a half hour or sipping. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite hold the effervescence and gets a bit out of balance with more bitterness evident. The beer was passable with food and seemed best suited to cheese.All in all, it's a good, not great beer, with a fancy pedigree and way-too-high price. Stick with the regular lagers unless you're showing off new found wealth for a friend.

***CONTENT
 Surprises and contentious moments abounded at last night's Community Board 2 meeting. Biggest of all was the curve ball thrown by the Martignetti brothers. Seems they want to split their liquor license and hold onto the basement club while giving over the ground floor to Cafe Noir... Except it's not Cafe Noir! Instead, Burak Karacam, managing partner of Pera, was before the board to apply for the license the Martignettis want to relinquish on the first floor - in addition to applying for a license for a new Pera at 54 Thompson. The folks from Cafe Noir were nowhere in sight and didn't answer the call, likely signaling the end of the road for that rumored takeover.Unfortunately for the attending brother, Tom Martignetti, the knives came out almost immediately. After several minutes explaining the idea of splitting a license and then bringing in someone else to run the restaurant independently, we witnessed a fascinating (not) discussion of ingress and egress. But lo the board was confused by this idea of two separate joints. Who's the other guy (Burak) and is this legal they asked. How did you get a license in the first place - did you apply as one entity, etc etc. Poor Tom stumbled along as they failed to grasp what he was saying - he didn't express the idea clearly enough to my mind but I still understood the point A vociferous board member signaled it would be a rough ride though, launching into a speech that there were too many liquor licenses in the area and that even if they rescinded one, they should not issue more than a beer & wine license. Then came the neighbors.

 World wine consumption went down almost 1% last year but the U.S. increased its consumption according to The International Organization of Vine and Wine. Europe was the main culprit for the drop, with France, Italy and Germany all drinking less wine than in the past. In fact, the U.S. passed Italy for the first time in wine consumption. Both Canada and Australia did their part, consuming more wine than the year before. And in another shift, Europe accounted for less than half the world's wine production for the first time. Brazil is a big up-and-coming producer with about 100,000 hectares now under production.

 A reader sent us a link to a Craigslist post entitled \"Opening a New Restaurant?\" featuring a sale of restaurant equipment at a familiar sounding address - 171 East Broadway - that made us curious. A quick Google search revealed the sale at none other than Broadway East. It's wrapping up this afternoon but you may be able to pick up pots, pans, toasters, knives and lots more. The listing is clearly written in a tone that worries it may signal impending doom - \"we bought too much\" - but it nonetheless strikes us as a bad sign for a place that can't be doing well in an off the beaten path location.

 The sad truth of this recession is no one and no thing is being spared. Even booze sales are now officially down. Conventional wisdom says that \"sins\" like booze and cigarettes survive well during recessions as people try to chemically cope with a depressing reality. But this recession is proving a lot of people wrong.Bloomberg reported yesterday that \"take-out sales of alcoholic beverages tumbled 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter\", the largest decline in fifty years of record keeping. The biggest bust? Surprisingly beer, down 14%. Wine was down 1.6% and liquor 0.9%. If you're into this sort of stuff, a handy chart at FiveThirtyEight.com shows the ups and downs of booze vis a vis GDP.

Seems the Dept of Homeland Security put the \"kabosh\" on the whole thing and even threatened seizure. Ouch.Lastly, we are somewhat intrigued that Dan Aykroyd is at Astor Wines today (12pm - 2pm) to shill for his vodka. Huh? Yup, you can get autographs but you can't taste the vodka.

 Ninth Avenue in the area around Port Authority has never been the pretty part of town, and the Holland Cocktail Lounge (532 9th Avenue) has always seemed to fit right in. There was nothing modern or sceney about the neighborhood dive but it did the job, until its recent closure that is, due to the landlord trying to sell the building. Given the state of the market, that effort went nowhere and so the bar is open again, per Grub Street, and ready to serve $4 beers. In this day and age, that's something.

 Crain's New York is reporting that liquor stores are up in arms over the proposal by Governor Paterson to expand sales of wine to grocery stores in an attempt to raise money for the state budget. 2,700 of them have banded together to form a coalition called \"The Last Store on Main Street\" to fight the proposal, which could lead to an additional 19,000+ licenses to sell wine.New York State has long been backwards in laws related to selling wine. Recall that only a few years ago, all liquor stores were closed on Sundays as if this were the deep South. Some of these same stores fought the change because they argued Sunday hours favored big liquor stores over mom & pop shops. They were wrong about that and they are wrong about this.Fewer than ten states limit wine sales to liquor stores. New Jersey has tons of liquor stores and you can buy wine in supermarkets. If you peruse the aisle of a Jersey supermarket, you'll find a good deal of plonck among the mostly pedestrian choices. If you want interesting or hard to find wine, you go to a liquor store. The same would happen in New York - not to mention that you would still have to buy liquor at a liquor store. Also, let's not forget that stores in New York City don't even have all that much room for wine due to high real estate costs - stuff is already stacked to the ceiling. Where are they going to put so much wine that it puts shops out of business? However, we do think wine shops should be able to sell more than alcohol - cheese, mixers and beer come to mind. We also support the proposal to allow shops to have multiple licenses - creating mini-chains that can then leverage distributors for better deals. Let's level the playing field and let capitalism take over, shall we?

 The New York Times reported yesterday that Long Island vintner Robert Palmer died last week, making him the second winemaker to pass away within weeks after the tragic accident took Christian Wolffer's life in South America over the New Year's holiday. Palmer, though a pioneer in Long Island winemaking, was an ad man by trade and, as befits all true \"Mad Men,\" professed to like a good martini. Yet this non wine drinker still managed to build Palmer Vineyards into a well respected winery and popular tourist attraction. His ingenuity will live on as Long Island grows in stature as a world class wine region.

But in these times, any excuse to booze up is good enough for us.In honor of the historic occasion, many DC bars already got permission to stay open 2 extra hours and Maryland bars also got an extended hour. Meanwhile in NYC, email inboxes have been flooded with inauguration day promotions and websites are falling all over themselves to provide you with spots to celebrate history. Here are just a handful of places with inauguration day specials:

 Opening today is the Japanese Culinary Center (JCC) at 711 3rd Avenue (E. 45th), which will be a showcase for Japanese cuisine and products. Operated by New York Mutual Trading, the center is open to both professionals and the public. A big draw will be the sake gallery - 130 sakes and 40 shochus will be available for sale. We'll keep our eyes peeled for the inevitable sake tastings and let you know.*Seems the press materials were misleading - sakes & shochus are available for order by restaurateurs and wine shop owners only.

 Stone Street quietly got a new drinking establishment on St. Patrick's Day - The Dubliner (45 Stone Street). This pub has taken over for the late Brouwers of Stone Street and comes to us from the same owners as Beckett's across the way. Early verdicts on Yelp are not proving too kind so far but it is early folks. Question is, do NYC need yet another faux Irish pub and does that particular street need yet another place that serves $7 beers? The jury is out but we just might know the verdict.The Dubliner45 Stone Street212-785-5400

Yet Another Speakeasy

 Thrillist, Eater, et al posted yesterday about a new speakeasy - yes, narrow space, downstairs, unmarked door, yada yada - called Raines Law Room (48 W. 17th Street) and immediately a couple of skeptics weighed in. Seems some people are tired of speakeasies and we can understand that - everything from tiny PDT, the world's most promoted speakeasy, to Woodson and Ford, the open but not basement joint on Bleecker Street, has started to grate on folks. These days, people want to drink and they kind of prefer places that a) they can get into and b) they can find.One of the bartenders hastily leapt to the spot's defense, promising \"it's not like any other bar in town.\" Now it's arguable that was even necessary since only two commenters initially posted their skepticism and it was hardly the usual Eater vitriol. Of course, the bartender's response opened him up for further criticism and a good bit of hole was dug, though he was certainly diligent and fair in his comments. However, it might serve folks working at speakeasies to be a little less sensitive to internet comments.From our perspective, the place actually sounds intriguing and we don't mind the concept - assuming they have a policy of actually letting people in. We'll let you know how that Old Fashioned tastes, it does sound like a delicious version. Raines Law Room48 W. 17th Street, downstairs, unmarked door

 We popped into the \"soft opening\" of City Winery last night not knowing what to expect. Eater and Grub Street had written it up, there were a bunch of good wine deals and there is a big PR machine behind it. What we found, was a bit of a surprise - a cavernous space (at most a third full around 8:30pm) and a big stage with a piano. There are cool looking barrels and bottles-as-decor, too. Granted it was the day before New Year's Eve and the location, two blocks north of the Holland Tunnel, is challenging, but we expected a much bigger turnout of oenophiles.The first thing that strikes you about City Winery is the sheer size of the place. All blond wood, we can only imagine the acoustics when it is full. The main floor is the restaurant/bar/performance space with a small private room downstairs. Designed for maximum sightlines in relation to the stage, this unfortunately means that when there is no performance, your eyes are drawn to the emptiness of the stage. And with a room that large, you have to wonder how they will fill it when there are no performances. The opening night was low key and all about the wines. And the deals were impressive: $5 Henriot champagne, $20 for a 1970 Francesco Rinaldi Barolo, $15 Lopez de Heredia 1987 Rioja, $10 Olga Riffaut's 1989 Chinon - all well worth the price, even though there was significant bottle variation. The glass pours were generous and tastes were provided as well. This was easily the best place to taste old vintages in New York last night - how often does one get a chance to taste 20 and 30 year old wines by the glass? And at these prices?!

 What is the best new bar you can't get into? How about a new speakeasy (name TBD) that opened in a Village basement. And no, you likely can't get in right now.Places slipping in under the radar are a rarity in NYC. An unmarked basement location certainly helps. Limited operating hours, mostly on weekends, do too. Right now it is only an event space.But if you do make it in - with the secret password (available via text) given to the doorman - an underground world suddenly unfolds. The space is warm and welcoming, with nooks and crannies on either side of a long old school bar. Above is the requisite stuffed animal - a wolf's head peering down at the revelry. The decor (and staff) will be familiar to anyone who's been to Apotheke, Tailor or Clover Club - lots of wood, plush sofas, old-fashioned light fixtures. And there is an impressive amount a space, a welcome change from great but tiny places like PDT or Milk and Honey that but fill up quickly.The cellar has a fascinating history. It was once Pfaff's Beer Cellar, circa the early 1800s, and hosted Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, among others. Later incarnations included a photo studio where Abe Lincoln's portrait was taken, a 1900s brothel, the infamous Infinity Disco where 21 people died in a fire in the 1970s, and the gay club Mr. Black Dance Den.So what about the drinks? They are well-priced ($12 for cocktails) and well-balanced. We very much liked the eponymous Woodson and Ford (applejack, zacapa 23, benedictine, sweet vermouth, Fee brothers' whiskey barrel bitters). The Woodrow Wilson, however, would best be categorized as \"interesting\" since the flavors and booze - rittenhouse rye, amaro averna, champagne, demerara and orange zest - did not quite mesh. The floating ice cubes eventually melted and mellowed out the drink.The bar also has a nice vittles menu. The mostly Spanish-skewing plates range from $7 to $17 (kumamotos are $3 a pop) and come from the Corner Shop Cafe upstairs. Patatas Bravas deep fried in duck fat and served with homemade ketchup, were scrumptious ($7) while Fabada, fava beans and spiced pork, was good but overpriced at $11. The cheese selection (a hefty $6 each) is commendable, with Mrs. Quickie's cheddar, Tuxford & Tebbutt Stilton and Uplands Pleasant Ridge.After the jump, a look at the full cocktail menu plus other boozy details. We'll keep you posted on door policies and hours - we hear they might be opening on Mondays and Tuesdays as early as this week.Woodson and Ford643 Broadway, Downstairs

As far as the space \"head bartender\" you will not receive any passwords. The unamed establishment is an event space. Clearly stealing our menus is frowned upon and since I would have seen you taking copious notes or taking photos I can only assume you vandalized our vintage books. I hope you enjoyed the event you attended but please fact check your blog. Woodson and ford is the zacapa cocktail name not the space.

The spot sounds cool and I'm looking forward to checking it out when it opens to the public. However, complaining about the positive coverage you're receiving as a result of this post doesn't make sense and is kinda lame. Having a bars status discussed on a NY blog is exactly where the conversation will play out. this blog just handed you the mic, and this is your oppertunity to clear up any misconceptions. Bashing the blogger for 'stealing' is not the message I would suggest. Social Media PR is tricky stuff, I would consider speaking with a firm that can help you navigate.

RQ, re: this whole password business--if you want to keep out the casual passerby/speakeasy stalker, why not just have a guest list like _every_ other private event in the city? I'd think that would be more effective, as then people can't just text their friends the password. And HB, I'm confused. Were you at a private party without realizing it?

It was a birthday party for 2 people in the liquor industry. Apparently HB was invited by one of the hosts or managed to get swept in by the crowd. He sat center bar and ate food which was not included in the complimentary special cocktails paid for by the host. We were 6 deep so no one noticed the camera phone.

Here's the thing - nobody said it was not open or had anyone sign a non-disclosure agreement or the like. The city is rife with speakeasy marketing gimmicks like passwords and \"secret\" spots. The staff told us the place had been open a couple of weeks. They gave us hours. And when we were there, people were paying for their drinks. These are the facts. As for the post - you asked us to change the it and we did so. We look forward to the day when you are open to the public. H.B.

Hi there! It's the team from franny's here! Just one correction to the recipe above, we actually DO NOT use Carpano Antica Formula in the Nardini Cocktail, it's just Bulldog Gin and Nardini Amaro!

That's odd, they wrote it out for us and it had Carpano Antica. Thanks for letting us know. We made a version with Cynar and Sweet Vermouth since we didn't have Nardini. It worked really well and was similar in taste to the Nardini. When we get some Nardini Amaro, I'll try it both ways and let the readers know.

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel. Juice oranges. Add OJ to sugar with peel. Pour boiling water and Arrack over the mix. Add hot (but not boiling) wine. Stir. Serve.

 We're not restaurant reviewers per se but we can't let things go unnoticed when we pop into places for drinks and a few bites. Case in point - Bar Artisanal, where we were subjected to amateurish service and underwhelming food.After being seated, we waited ten minutes for some attention from the staff. Then a particularly zealous manager appeared - and gave us the \"evening's menus\" and a brief overview of how they are designed. Huh? This is a casual place? Then he circled the table, calling everyone sir and answering every request with \"my pleasure.\" By the end of the circle, he had dispensed so much pleasure that we thought we'd need to book a room in the hotel upstairs.Next up, some crimes against wine.

***CONTENT
 Recently we found ourselves in Chelsea and close enough to Raines Law Room (48 West 17th Street) that we decided to pop in for a spot check. The room was busy as usual and Paul, the host, was deftly juggling the crowds as we settled into one of the snug booths. The first time around, we loved the space and some of the cocktails but found imprecise execution in certain drinks. Our recent visit showed a bit surer hand behind the bar but still some issues to work out. And we have now learned our lesson - ignore the specials, which can be hit or miss, but generally don't justify the $16 pricetag for \"premium ingredients.\" Heck $13 is a bit steep for drinks in this day and age.Right away we re-visited the Gold Rush and made sure the waitress knew we liked a good amount of bourbon in it. The version we got was as good as we remembered it (after it was fixed the last time). We also tried the Smoke and Mirrors again - this time it was sweeter than we liked and just okay. Seems like execution is still an issue with this drink and as much as we want to like it, we just can't recommend it. Other specials included the Frida (Don Julio tequila, aperol topped with moet chandon), which was okay, and the Sylvia (made with Tanqueray Ten and a touch of absinthe), which was pretty good.Back ordering off the menu, we enjoyed both the Archangel and Corpse Reviver #2. A Manhattan made with Bulleit was terrific but the revelation was a perfectly made Negroni. One thing that sets Raines Law Room apart is the service - the staff, from the busboys to the waitresses, is really accomodating and without a trace of attitude. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the drinks and also extremely nice. And as we walked out into the night, Paul was as gracious as ever.

 A tequila and mezcal cocktail bar? Just try keeping us away. Mayahuel is one sexy space, from the dark brown bar to the tiny tiled tables opposite to the plush lounge upstairs. With bar-master Phil Ward (Death & Co.) the brains behind it, expectations were high for the cocktails and we are happy to report we were not disappointed.The Lapsong Punch (lapsong suchong infused \"tea-killa,\" lemon, grapefruit and whiskey barrel bitters) is a great drink to start off, nicely balanced, light and citrusy-smoky. The Smoked Palomino (amontillado sherry, mezcal, grapefruit, lime, salted rim) was delicious, unique and a rare find: a good sherry drink. The Pequeno Cabeza (blanco, grapefruit infused vermouth, amaro and maraschino) was an inventive take on the Manhattan. The Slight Detour (jalapeno tequila, reposado and joven mezcal, agave nectar and Xocolati mole bitters) made for interesting drinking - both the chocolate and orange came through the booze, almost dessert-like. Like the Cabeza, it's a pretty potent concoction.El Jimadors Shifty didn't work as well - the pineapple-infused mezcal didn't cut through the Negra Modelo and was MIA until we drank through the beer and found it on the bottom.UrbanDaddy has a great slideshow that shows off the interiors.

***CONTENT
 Apotheke (9 Doyers Street) is an enigma - one of New York's sexiest spaces that is also often uncomfortable to be in coupled with one of the city's best known mixologists running a show that falls short on cocktails. The idea of a cocktail apothecary sets Apotheke apart, as does its focus on expensive house absinthe, but it's unclear whether people want a concept or just a good bar with great cocktails.Hidden away in Chinatown, the space is a knockout - much larger than your typical speakeasy - and if you can score a couch, quite comfortable. However, the long bar has no stools so you have to stand and staff can be overwhelmed. One busy night when we snagged a table, we experienced long waits while the lone waitress struggled to keep up with the busy bar. Apparently Apotheke was on Gossip Girl that week and it had brought a whole new crowd down to Chi-town. Another time, we stood near the bar and were taken care of by several bartenders, which meant the drinks came quickly (it was a pretty quiet night). We much prefer taking our cocktails sitting down, preferably at the bar, which they have made impossible. So what of the drinks?

 One cold night we found ourselves far off the beaten path - in East Williamsburg, a formerly unknown section of town - and in need of a good cocktail. We'd read a lot about Huckleberry Bar (588 Grand Street) so we decided to check it out.Perhaps too used to intimate Manhattan speakeasies, we found the amount of space in the bar a bit daunting. A long bar, two seating areas, a backyard and a DJ booth? We looked around and wondered if they could possibly pull this off. Happily, the DJ had the night off, the menu was long on classics and cocktails were just $10.The Juanhattan (old overholt rye, amaro averna, lillet blanc and angostura bitters) was quite good while the Article 57 (citrus infused vodka, young ginger juice, Q tonic) was more on the medicinal side and not entirely pleasant to drink - too much ginger. Better was the Tina Modotti, made with tequila, del maguey mezcal, spiced pear, orange bitters and chili salt.Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll size up the classics. It will be interesting to see how the bar does over the long haul on the wrong side of the BQE.

 No name on display, long narrow room, buzzer for admission, classic cocktails, yup, it's another speakeasy. But the Raines Law Room seems to be a speakeasy that's a little bit different - and the odd absence of an actual bar is only part of it. Part of it is the people involved - the mixologist and owners are not \"big\" names, though they have solid backgrounds in the industry. Thus, a cocktail list that is more classically-inspired than the more mixologist-driven places like PDT and Tailor. And then there Paul - a doorman, manager and chocolatier, who elevates the place all by himself. He is unfailingly polite, extremely gracious and...nice. When he apologizes that there will be a wait and takes your number, you know he is sincere and will call you as soon as he can. Even better, he makes his own chocolates by hand and sells them on site ($12 for a box of 6). They are creative, unusual and delicious - and most of them are vegan. But you wouldn't know it as even the vegan ones taste rich and decadent.But we digress - a cocktail bar is first and foremost about the cocktails. And on that front, they are doing well, though list is shorter than we had expected.

 Last year, the Denton brothers, owners of downtown favorites 'ino and 'inoteca, took their show to Gramercy with the opening of Bar Milano. The buzz was deafening but the result underwhelming, headscratching Frank Bruni two-star review notwithstanding, and within months the struggling spot was closing to be transformed into what it should have been from the get go: 'inoteca north. Regardless of history, we're here now and 'inoteca is a marked improvement in several ways - the room is less fussy, the menu downscaled and the drinks cheaper - the terrific cocktails are just $10 each. The winelist is thankfully still extensive, interesting and well priced as well.Already carousing nearby, we decided to pop in for a few drinks and nibbles. We were intrigued to see a category devoted to egg white fizzes. The Apple Blow (lairds applejack, fresh lemon juice, sugar, egg white, chilled seltzer water) was very good but the Dubonnet was even better (dubonnet, cherry heering, fresh lemon and orange juice, egg whites). Another delicious option was the Cotillion (old forrester bourbon, appleton estate rum, fresh lemon, orange juice, cointreau and lucid absinthe), a nicely balanced and eminently quaffable drink. A much better showing than last year when the hyped cocktail program struck us as both too precious and too expensive, not to mention too reliant on pricey sweet pink drinks that seemed to be aimed at the fairer sex.The dishes we sampled were a bit spotty but we are happy to report the delicious truffed egg toast has made the trip uptown unscathed. With a bit more work on the food, we can see 'inoteca 2 hitting its stride. The crowds are already there.'inoteca Liquori Bar323 Third Avenue, 212-683-3035

 The much praised Death & Co. took some time to win us over. The cocktails were good but the doormen annoying, and so were the crowds. There was the constant impending doom of potential closing surrounding the place. And it was just too uneven on the bartender front. Yet over time, we were drawn back again and again until we couldn't deny it - it's become a favorite cocktail spot. Today, Death & Co. is as close to a classic NYC bar as has opened in the new millennium. The drink list is impressively vast yet smartly broken down by category of booze. The bartenders are sure of their craft. And the room is as comfortable as it gets, save the cold blast of air near the door in wintertime.It's all about the drinks, of course. And on that account, D&Co excels, with top-notch ingredients, creativity and highly balanced recipes, some with close to 10 ingredients.

Great review, HB! I haven't been to D&C in probably close to a year, but have been thinking lately that I should give them another chance. Your descriptions of the cocktails are further convincing me that I should do so, if for no other reason than to try that Carroll Gardens--sounds excellent.

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 NYC diners know Restaurant Week is a bit of a crapshoot. Participants either take the promotion as an opportunity to introduce themselves to new diners - Danny Meyer's restaurants do this very well, so do restaurants such as Tocqueville and Cafe Boulud - or they do it for the volume or because they think they have to. We had hoped that Oceana's pedigree would put it firmly in the former category and their offer of 30% off the entire winelist during Restaurant Week was sufficient to lure us back, in spite of the mediocre food and wine service we had experienced there a few years ago. The chef had since changed, the Times' critic loved it (reaffirming its three stars just last July) and it seemed like a good opportunity to give it abother try.However, on our visit, it seemed like the kitchen wasn't even trying, just cranking out those menus and praying RW would soon be over soon. There was little imagination at work on the plates presented. Bland, boring, monotone presentation and flavors seemingly customized to a shabby room.

 We've been to Tailor at least half a dozen times since it opened and it remains an enigma to us. The subterranean bar, with adventurous drinks by mixologist Eben Freeman, remains a draw yet the place seems to still suffer a case of disjointedness. On the one hand, it has curry popcorn, as addictive as it gets for bar snacks, and a few seriously good drinks. On the other, it has sky high expectations, lots of hype and high prices to boot. Does it stand up to the the expectations? The answer is mainly yes, though it's not entirely successful from a barfly's point of view.

I visited Tailor for the first time before being aware of all the hype. And, even then, I found it disappointing. I have not dined upstairs, but the bar food was subpar. The cocktails on paper sounded fascinating, but simply did not fulfill the promise. I'd so much rather have a simple Old Fashioned than these creations which promise a lot, work hard to bring something new, but in the end, fall flat. I have since been back, and was as disappointed the second time around as the first. While I admire the efforts of Eben Freeman, the end result is a major disappointed. I have time and time again made tastier, more satisfying mixed drinks at home that lack the fuss and pretense. That said, I'll give it one more shot.

We don't disagree with you though we have found some good drinks there and the food is much improved. The thing that dismays us is the pricing, which has always been high in comparison to places like Death & Co or PDT.

***CONTENT
 You're probably not the only one confused by Ella and Elsa, two newish cocktail bars in the East Village that opened within weeks - and blocks - of each other. However, once you get past the names, there isn't a whole lot that the two places have in common.Ella is the slicker of the two joints, with Victoria's Secret-esque pink and black striped walls, a smoky underground performance space and velvet ropes out front. Assuming you can slip in past the doorman - they have a semi-strict door policy we bet gets dropped any minute- you'll find yourself in a glammed up space with a long bar and some banquettes up front. The drink list is impressively long - nine specialty cocktails, three champagne cocktails and eleven classic cocktails. We instinctively go for brown liquor so we tried the Clark Gable (maker's mark, lime, ginger-infused simple syrup) and it was the clear favorite. Finding another appealing drink was a bit of a challenge, however. The Mildred Pierce (bulldog gin, basil infused simple syrup, lime) was recommended by the bartender but highly acidic. Mommie Dearest (milagro tequila, lime, simple syrup, orange bitters) was also seriously out of balance and the Rye Smash (sazerac rye, muddled raspberries, lemon, simple syrup) was hardly a smashing success. In the meantime, a DJ bombarded us with some of the worst music this side of Jersey. Clearly Ella is for cool people. I guess they can hope to find a clientele too cool for taste buds.On to Elsa, over in Alphabet City. A former dive bar, the space was remade with a bespoke men's tailor in the front and a cocktail bar in the back. The room is kind of upstate antiques shop basic, with narrow booths up front across from a standing-only bar and rustic tables in the back. Mainly wood, the room is simple and bland (and way too bright), though we did like the barn-like effect of the bathroom ceiling. With the décor underwhelming, all we could hope for were some good cocktails. (There are also beers on tap, flowing through an old Singer sewing machine, and a few wines.) From the short list (4 signature concoctions and 4 classics), we tried The Jaszek (applejack, velvet falernum, lime, angostura, orange bitters) and the El Romero Borracho (souza blanco, grapefruit, campari, lime), coming away hopeful for the future. Both were balanced, complex and satisfying, showing skill on behalf of the resident mixologist. The Perfect Manhattan? Yes, please. When they get their feet wet, we'll be back for a second look.Ella9 Avenue A between 1st and 2nd streets, 212-777-2230Elsa217 E. 3rd Street between Avenue B and C, 917-882-7395

 In Japan sake is as everyday as soda pop, with cans of sake available from vending machines everywhere, including in railway stations for those long rides home. While you can't get it from a machine, you can still emulate those crafty Japanese with some great fresh-tasting sake out of a can right here in NYC.One of our favorites is Funaguchi Kikusui, a draft sake straight from the tank, unpasteurized with no additives. The can is perfect for preserving this fresh, easy drinking sake. Be careful though - these dynamite 200ml cans pack a punch since the sake is 19.8% alcohol. You can pick them up at Sakaya (324 E. 9th Street) for $6.99. Drink cold.Another sake available by the can, albeit in a larger 720ml version, is the delicious Narutotai Ginjo Nama Genshu. Let's break down the name -Narutotai is the name, ginjo is the type, nama means unpasteurized, and genshu means that no water was added at the end of the brewing process. This makes for a fresh, potent sake (18%+ alcohol) that is both rich and smooth. Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is selling the can right now for $32.99.

 Something just crossed our inbox that seemed enticing until we actually read it. TimeOut sent a sponsored promo invite to a March 4th event called \"Fabulously Frugal\" in... Yonkers. Yonkers? Yup, that \"city\" just up the Hudson River trying to revitalize itself as happening place. Seems a building called 66Main is trying to fill loft-style apartments and they've come up with an event they hope draws newly frugal New Yorkers to what is essentially an Open House. They promise food from area chefs, free \"spiked punch,\" giveaways and more!. As they put it, \"Westchester's hottest brands and hot new chefs will show you how as you mix and mingle at Yonkers' address for luxuriously affordable living.\"Apparently, after all the goodies, they had about $5 left in their budget for the graphic to the right. Anyway, if you're so inclined, here is the website. We would, however, like to remind those tempted by this fab offer that it is indeed YONKERS.

 Now that the dust has settled from the '08 elections, we can look at the effect the booze industry had on the race. And shocker of all shockers... it favored Democrats with donations this year. It's actually the first time since 1994 that the booze industry gave more to Democrats than Republicans - 52% - 48%, not too far off the popular vote of 53% - 46% for Pres Elect Obama. In all, the industry and individuals associated with it donated $12.997 million. Way to grease the rails of democracy! Out of 80 industries measured, the booze industry was #37 in terms of money donated. The numbers going back to the 1990 campaign are broken down at OpenSecrets.org.

 We hadn't been at Employees Only (510 Hudson Street) in a while - it's not in our top tier of NYC drinks places - but recently found ourselves just down the block and needing a drink. The cocktail menu had a few intriguing choices but we went straight for their version of the Manhattan ($14) - \"Rittenhouse Rye stirred with Italian Vermouth, Orange Curacao and Angostura bitters.\" The resulting drink is delicious - the orange curacao really rounded out the flavor. One of the best Manhattans we've tasted yet in this project.

 Subterranean bar PDT (113 St. Mark's Place) is one of the best drink spots in the city, so it's not often we partake in a classic cocktail while we're there. However, a recent night got late in a hurry and we needed our usual nightcap - the Manhattan.We didn't offer a liquor suggestion and we were not disappointed. The drink we were served was made with Rittenhouse Rye and Carpano Antica, purportedly \"the original\" sweet Italian vermouth. It was terrific, perfectly balanced and nicely presented with three small cherries on a skewer across the top. If only all Manhattans could be this delicious.

 Death + Company (433 East 6th Street) is undoubtedly one of New York's best cocktail bars, as well as one of its most controversial, due to its never-ending battle to stay open. We've spent some extended time there recently - look for a review later this week - and after much imbibing, decided to test the bartender's Manhattan chops. We left it up to him and his take ($13) was interesting and quite delicious - he used half Booker's Bourbon and half Rittenhouse Rye to create a rich, nicely balanced drink. It certainly sent us out into the cold night feeling no pain.

 Recent West Village wanderings took us into subterranean cocktail den Little Branch (22 Seventh Avenue South) in search of a good Manhattan. While we like the look of the space, the drinks themselves have never really impressed us. We slid into one of the tight booths and ordered a Manhattan. The waitress didn't ask for a booze preference but when it arrived, there was a familiar quality to it. Hmm, we thought. Could it be Old Overholt, our own house rye? Sure enough it was. Makes a nicely balanced Manhattan, though theirs was a tad drier than the Head Bartender version. At $12 a solid version of a classic cocktail.

 We get a lot of recipes from liquor companies, but few are any good. Most of their so-called signature drinks wind up being too heavy handed with the product they are pushing. A notable exception are the fine folks at St. Germain, who consistently craft good drinks made with the elderflower liqueur.Case in point is the Paris Manhattan, a twist on the classic made with St. Germain, which actually enhances the flavor of the bourbon. The 'Parisian' touch is light and flirty without being too frou frou.

 The bar at Gotham Bar and Grill (12 E. 12th Street) has long been one of the city's best dining bars thanks to their ingenious trays that rest on the rail running along the bar. While not a go-to spot for the drinks crowd these days, we figured it would have a solid Manhattan, so we popped in just before the holidays. The bartender asked our choice of booze and we chose rye. He recommended Michters, which is quite good but it turns out a bit pricey ($16). The resulting drink was a taste of classic New York - smooth yet potent. It almost made us forget the howling wind just outside the doors. Alas, if we could afford two, we might have really been protected from the elements.

 When asked our favorite libation, many potential answers present themselves depending on our mood. But when it comes to cocktails one drink stands above the rest - the Manhattan. This classic cocktail is the epitome of grown-up drinking: no juice, no shaking, no (plastic) monkeys. Just whiskey (usually rye or bourbon), vermouth and a few dashes of bitters, well stirred and served up. When well made, it's pure pleasure. When not, it's a boozy mess. Debuting in the Manhattan Club in the 1870s, the Manhattan is about a hundred years older than we are. In the intervening years, it has inspired many variations and knock-offs. In honor of the original's outsized influence, we decided to embark on a project to find the best Manhattans in Manhattan - and beyond. We will search far and wide, high end and low end, to identify the best and warn you about the worst. We'll let bartenders guide us when it comes to the booze and see where they take us. And we will also tell you about some of the city's best new creations inspired by the drink.But we can't drink the city by ourselves, hard as we try, so we'd like to hear from you about where to find the best Manhattan, who makes it or how you like to order it. Drop us an email or leave a comment.Our first stop was a natural, a New York institution with a great bar: Gramercy Tavern.

Tonight you can play out the classic Northern vs Southern Italy rivalry by trying four wines. On Saturday, you can try four more Italian wines as well as some Woodford Reserve Bourbon (the best bourbon there is in our humble opinion) in honor of Kentucky Derby day.Lastly, as much as we'd like to avoid it, Cinco de Mayo is coming up.

It's a smoker's paradise and you can even bring your drink out before 11pm or so says the sign on the door.

Raines Law Room Revisited

***DATE
2009-04-24 10:45:00
***CONTENT
 Recently we found ourselves in Chelsea and close enough to Raines Law Room (48 West 17th Street) that we decided to pop in for a spot check. The room was busy as usual and Paul, the host, was deftly juggling the crowds as we settled into one of the snug booths. The first time around, we loved the space and some of the cocktails but found imprecise execution in certain drinks. Our recent visit showed a bit surer hand behind the bar but still some issues to work out. And we have now learned our lesson - ignore the specials, which can be hit or miss, but generally don't justify the $16 pricetag for \"premium ingredients.\" Heck $13 is a bit steep for drinks in this day and age.Right away we re-visited the Gold Rush and made sure the waitress knew we liked a good amount of bourbon in it. The version we got was as good as we remembered it (after it was fixed the last time). We also tried the Smoke and Mirrors again - this time it was sweeter than we liked and just okay. Seems like execution is still an issue with this drink and as much as we want to like it, we just can't recommend it. Other specials included the Frida (Don Julio tequila, aperol topped with moet chandon), which was okay, and the Sylvia (made with Tanqueray Ten and a touch of absinthe), which was pretty good.Back ordering off the menu, we enjoyed both the Archangel and Corpse Reviver #2. A Manhattan made with Bulleit was terrific but the revelation was a perfectly made Negroni. One thing that sets Raines Law Room apart is the service - the staff, from the busboys to the waitresses, is really accomodating and without a trace of attitude. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the drinks and also extremely nice. And as we walked out into the night, Paul was as gracious as ever.

 A lot of time large scale tastings covering a certain region or country are not great ways to showcase wine - too much filler, too little interesting product. Thankfully, the Wines of Portugal event held this Tuesday intrigued us enough to overcome our skepticism, and thankfully we found lots of interesting wines - some available in the U.S. and some not.The wineries present represented all of Portugal's growing areas and specialized in whites, reds and ports along with a smattering of rose and sparkling wines. We stuck to the indigenous grapes such as Alvarinho, Arinto, Aragones and Touriga Nacional, avoiding the more international styles whenever possible.Here are some of the highlights, with a focus on wines that have distribution in place and thus possible to find in stores and restaurants:

The distillery plans to make both gin and whiskey, mainly from local and organic ingredients. It also plans to be open for tours that showcase the distilling and tasting process. Whether he can raise the $2 million is up for debate but it would be rather cool to have the city's first distillery since Prohibition.

 A tequila and mezcal cocktail bar? Just try keeping us away. Mayahuel is one sexy space, from the dark brown bar to the tiny tiled tables opposite to the plush lounge upstairs. With bar-master Phil Ward (Death & Co.) the brains behind it, expectations were high for the cocktails and we are happy to report we were not disappointed.The Lapsong Punch (lapsong suchong infused \"tea-killa,\" lemon, grapefruit and whiskey barrel bitters) is a great drink to start off, nicely balanced, light and citrusy-smoky. The Smoked Palomino (amontillado sherry, mezcal, grapefruit, lime, salted rim) was delicious, unique and a rare find: a good sherry drink. The Pequeno Cabeza (blanco, grapefruit infused vermouth, amaro and maraschino) was an inventive take on the Manhattan. The Slight Detour (jalapeno tequila, reposado and joven mezcal, agave nectar and Xocolati mole bitters) made for interesting drinking - both the chocolate and orange came through the booze, almost dessert-like. Like the Cabeza, it's a pretty potent concoction.El Jimadors Shifty didn't work as well - the pineapple-infused mezcal didn't cut through the Negra Modelo and was MIA until we drank through the beer and found it on the bottom.UrbanDaddy has a great slideshow that shows off the interiors.

CB2 Recap - Martignetti Gets Reamed, Cafe Noir a No-Show and a New Pera

***CONTENT
 Surprises and contentious moments abounded at last night's Community Board 2 meeting. Biggest of all was the curve ball thrown by the Martignetti brothers. Seems they want to split their liquor license and hold onto the basement club while giving over the ground floor to Cafe Noir... Except it's not Cafe Noir! Instead, Burak Karacam, managing partner of Pera, was before the board to apply for the license the Martignettis want to relinquish on the first floor - in addition to applying for a license for a new Pera at 54 Thompson. The folks from Cafe Noir were nowhere in sight and didn't answer the call, likely signaling the end of the road for that rumored takeover.Unfortunately for the attending brother, Tom Martignetti, the knives came out almost immediately. After several minutes explaining the idea of splitting a license and then bringing in someone else to run the restaurant independently, we witnessed a fascinating (not) discussion of ingress and egress. But lo the board was confused by this idea of two separate joints. Who's the other guy (Burak) and is this legal they asked. How did you get a license in the first place - did you apply as one entity, etc etc. Poor Tom stumbled along as they failed to grasp what he was saying - he didn't express the idea clearly enough to my mind but I still understood the point A vociferous board member signaled it would be a rough ride though, launching into a speech that there were too many liquor licenses in the area and that even if they rescinded one, they should not issue more than a beer & wine license. Then came the neighbors.

Deal or No Deal? - Bar Blanc Bistro

***CONTENT
 With just two days left in the Bar Blanc Bistro (142 West 10th Street) opening week deal, we decided to pop in and see how they were doing. The bar was fairly busy but the restaurant mostly empty when we arrived. We grabbed a pair of empty seats at the bar and were handed the menus. The bartender clearly explained the half-off deal and the exclusions - no bottled beer, burger or oysters for half price. Fair enough, we thought, since the bar menu had a good bit of choice.The half-off special applied to draft beer, wine by the glass and carafe, and house cocktails. (The not-included bottled beer is your typical rip-off with $7 Stellas, Leffe and Hoegaarden). There were lots of choices among the cocktails, normally $12, generally classics or riffs on them including a caipiroska, sidecar (very popular) and a grapefruit martinis. We stuck to beer and wine. The Grimbergen ale was new to us but quite good (normally $7) if a bit sweet at the bottom of the glass while Blue Moon is... Blue Moon. Wines were interesting but suffered from being too warm and open for a while. A Pinot Noir from France was good but neither the mundane Tempranillo nor the White Bordeaux excited us.Food-wise, we enjoyed most everything - the chicken liver mousse was very good as were the beef croquettes, though the underlying mustard was way too hot. The burger was large and juicy while fries were perfectly crisped.Overall, the space looks the same from its previous incarnation (pre-bistro). It certainly doesn't read bistro and it's way too dark - reading menus was only possible by candlelight. Will this incarnation make it? Certainly the bar is comfortable but beer and wine are a bit too expensive for it to be a regular stop. The restaurant itself is a tougher sell and they have their work cut out for them. The previous restaurants struggled in the same space so you have to wonder if it is cursed. In the meantime, is it a deal? Heck yea! 50% off the entire check (tip on the whole amount fellow boozers). We suggest you hurry over before it expires tomorrow night at 8pm. Rumor has it they will have some type of happy hour after the deal is gone but it won't be nearly as good.

 The SLA is diligently killing off the concept of BYOB for restaurants as evidenced by the latest report on Grub Street about Emporio's booze-less opening. Yup, no BYOB for them.As we've previously reported, the current laws are asinine - a restaurant can't be BYOB unless they have a liquor license (not even if you have applied and it is pending) but if they never intend to apply, they are not under the SLA's authority and thus they can't do anything to stop you. The cops could, theoretically, but we doubt they'll be raiding anyone over this.A much better idea would be to re-write the laws to allow any restaurant to be BYOB and to streamline the licensing procedure for restaurants. There was a movement to separate restaurants from bars and clubs but that seems to be up in the air. In the meantime, since it's clear people want booze with their dinner, shouldn't our state reps help foster a system that is a win-win for both customers and restaurant owners? Cause this cockamanie system is terrible for everyone and has damaged too many restaurants to count.

BYOB without a liquor license is always illegal, whether or not you're applying for license through the SLA. And even if you are, the SLA doesn't do anything to stop you. They'll just take note of the fact that you illegally allowed BYOB while your license was pending. It's true that cops probably aren't going to go door to door with no-license restaurants to enforce the law, but if, say, you have an upstairs neighbor that you've pissed off, they can call the cops on you, and then they'll HAVE to investigate.

 We've never been to any incarnation of the Russian Tea Room (150 W. 57th Street) so we have no qualms with it. However, their newest deal, coming to us via Eater's Dealfeed, seems a bit suspect. For the month of April, if you order the \"Business Express Lunch\" for $35 they will give you a free vodka martini to wash it down. Strikes us as an odd promotion - how many people want a vodka martini in the middle of the day? Especially when they are ordering an express lunch?

 We hadn't been at Employees Only (510 Hudson Street) in a while - it's not in our top tier of NYC drinks places - but recently found ourselves just down the block and needing a drink. The cocktail menu had a few intriguing choices but we went straight for their version of the Manhattan ($14) - \"Rittenhouse Rye stirred with Italian Vermouth, Orange Curacao and Angostura bitters.\" The resulting drink is delicious - the orange curacao really rounded out the flavor. One of the best Manhattans we've tasted yet in this project.

 World wine consumption went down almost 1% last year but the U.S. increased its consumption according to The International Organization of Vine and Wine. Europe was the main culprit for the drop, with France, Italy and Germany all drinking less wine than in the past. In fact, the U.S. passed Italy for the first time in wine consumption. Both Canada and Australia did their part, consuming more wine than the year before. And in another shift, Europe accounted for less than half the world's wine production for the first time. Brazil is a big up-and-coming producer with about 100,000 hectares now under production.

 Apotheke (9 Doyers Street) is an enigma - one of New York's sexiest spaces that is also often uncomfortable to be in coupled with one of the city's best known mixologists running a show that falls short on cocktails. The idea of a cocktail apothecary sets Apotheke apart, as does its focus on expensive house absinthe, but it's unclear whether people want a concept or just a good bar with great cocktails.Hidden away in Chinatown, the space is a knockout - much larger than your typical speakeasy - and if you can score a couch, quite comfortable. However, the long bar has no stools so you have to stand and staff can be overwhelmed. One busy night when we snagged a table, we experienced long waits while the lone waitress struggled to keep up with the busy bar. Apparently Apotheke was on Gossip Girl that week and it had brought a whole new crowd down to Chi-town. Another time, we stood near the bar and were taken care of by several bartenders, which meant the drinks came quickly (it was a pretty quiet night). We much prefer taking our cocktails sitting down, preferably at the bar, which they have made impossible. So what of the drinks?

That's odd, they wrote it out for us and it had Carpano Antica. Thanks for letting us know. We made a version with Cynar and Sweet Vermouth since we didn't have Nardini. It worked really well and was similar in taste to the Nardini. When we get some Nardini Amaro, I'll try it both ways and let the readers know.

 One cold night we found ourselves far off the beaten path - in East Williamsburg, a formerly unknown section of town - and in need of a good cocktail. We'd read a lot about Huckleberry Bar (588 Grand Street) so we decided to check it out.Perhaps too used to intimate Manhattan speakeasies, we found the amount of space in the bar a bit daunting. A long bar, two seating areas, a backyard and a DJ booth? We looked around and wondered if they could possibly pull this off. Happily, the DJ had the night off, the menu was long on classics and cocktails were just $10.The Juanhattan (old overholt rye, amaro averna, lillet blanc and angostura bitters) was quite good while the Article 57 (citrus infused vodka, young ginger juice, Q tonic) was more on the medicinal side and not entirely pleasant to drink - too much ginger. Better was the Tina Modotti, made with tequila, del maguey mezcal, spiced pear, orange bitters and chili salt.Next time we're in the neighborhood, we'll size up the classics. It will be interesting to see how the bar does over the long haul on the wrong side of the BQE.

 Few things go as well together as pizza and beer. Unfortunately, few things are as ripe for extreme mark-up as those two items. In the case of Co., or Company as you like, don't expect the recession to mean customer-friendly pricing.We'll come right out and say it - we were underwhelmed. The pizzas were small (about 11\") and the edges of the ballyhooed crust were almost reminiscent of Pizza Hut. The crust itself was pretty good, but the toppings deserved to be seasoned properly though, with salt definitely missing in action. And the pizzas seemed overloaded with cheese and bechamel, guess to explain the pricing - the majority of pizzas are $16 to $18 and appetizer up-selling is heavy.But this is a booze blog. And there is nothing more depressing than staring at a beer list where everything is $7. Really, $7 for Blue Moon, Sixpoint and Stella? While we're at it, could they come up with a more cliched list of beers? What possible justification can there be for marking up beer over 500% anyway?We here at Boozy are getting real tired of being ripped off for the privilege of drinking designer beers - not to mention the Belgian equivalent of Bud. If restaurateurs have so little respect for beer drinkers that they view them merely as a profit center, maybe they should just stop serving beer. On this particular day, we silently drank water. That is not our preferred dining mode.

 We've had sparkling sake, dessert sake, aged sake, sake in a can, and now... sake in a jar. Yup the latest craze (maybe) is sake in a 200ml jar, the perfect size to slip into your suit jacket for that long ride home. Long popular in Japan, especially among commuting businessmen, single serve sakes have slowly been making their way into the U.S. market. Wakatsuru in Toyama (Western Japan) makes one of the first to be offered in a jar, a full-bodied and flavorful Junmai Daiginjo. The sake was good but better with food than on its own. And not quite as good as our favorite single-serve sake, Funaguchi Kikusui.Available at Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street, website). $5.99 per bottle.

 Disturbing news for New Yorkers - most BYO restaurants are breaking the law according to a story in Crains New York. As we previously reported, restaurants need to have a liquor license to allow BYO - unless they are under 20 seats. If they open and are applying for a license, they may jeopardize the application's status by allowing BYO. It's unclear what the consequences are since the SLA (State Liquor Authority) only has jurisdiction if an application for a license is underway - no application, no SLA authority. Then enforcement fall on the police.

 No name on display, long narrow room, buzzer for admission, classic cocktails, yup, it's another speakeasy. But the Raines Law Room seems to be a speakeasy that's a little bit different - and the odd absence of an actual bar is only part of it. Part of it is the people involved - the mixologist and owners are not \"big\" names, though they have solid backgrounds in the industry. Thus, a cocktail list that is more classically-inspired than the more mixologist-driven places like PDT and Tailor. And then there Paul - a doorman, manager and chocolatier, who elevates the place all by himself. He is unfailingly polite, extremely gracious and...nice. When he apologizes that there will be a wait and takes your number, you know he is sincere and will call you as soon as he can. Even better, he makes his own chocolates by hand and sells them on site ($12 for a box of 6). They are creative, unusual and delicious - and most of them are vegan. But you wouldn't know it as even the vegan ones taste rich and decadent.But we digress - a cocktail bar is first and foremost about the cocktails. And on that front, they are doing well, though list is shorter than we had expected.

 Gran Centenario produces some fine tequila - we're especially fans of the anejo - and now they've introduced a hibiscus-infused version called Rosangel. This unique tequila is made with Gran Centenario reposado that is rested in port barrels for two months (after the initial aging process) and then infused with Mexican hibiscus flowers.The resulting tequila is aromatic and intriguing to the taste. We first tried Rosangel straight and appreciated the fragrant nose but found the flavor, while appealing, a natural for mixed drinks. Our next step was to make a margarita with it. We followed our preferred recipe - 3 parts tequila, 2 parts triple sec, 1 part fresh lime juice and served it up (no salt). The result had an appealing hue and was quite delicious.For another, more involved option, Julie Reiner (Flatiron Lounge, Clover Club) has created a new cocktail:

 Last year, the Denton brothers, owners of downtown favorites 'ino and 'inoteca, took their show to Gramercy with the opening of Bar Milano. The buzz was deafening but the result underwhelming, headscratching Frank Bruni two-star review notwithstanding, and within months the struggling spot was closing to be transformed into what it should have been from the get go: 'inoteca north. Regardless of history, we're here now and 'inoteca is a marked improvement in several ways - the room is less fussy, the menu downscaled and the drinks cheaper - the terrific cocktails are just $10 each. The winelist is thankfully still extensive, interesting and well priced as well.Already carousing nearby, we decided to pop in for a few drinks and nibbles. We were intrigued to see a category devoted to egg white fizzes. The Apple Blow (lairds applejack, fresh lemon juice, sugar, egg white, chilled seltzer water) was very good but the Dubonnet was even better (dubonnet, cherry heering, fresh lemon and orange juice, egg whites). Another delicious option was the Cotillion (old forrester bourbon, appleton estate rum, fresh lemon, orange juice, cointreau and lucid absinthe), a nicely balanced and eminently quaffable drink. A much better showing than last year when the hyped cocktail program struck us as both too precious and too expensive, not to mention too reliant on pricey sweet pink drinks that seemed to be aimed at the fairer sex.The dishes we sampled were a bit spotty but we are happy to report the delicious truffed egg toast has made the trip uptown unscathed. With a bit more work on the food, we can see 'inoteca 2 hitting its stride. The crowds are already there.'inoteca Liquori Bar323 Third Avenue, 212-683-3035

 Is that a big beer on your table or are you just happy to see me? Apparently Metromix has uncovered a trend no one previously knew - or cared about. Big beer. Yup, liters of beer, beer towers and, wait for it, a beer bong! Some of these are good for groups, some are a good deal and some are just rip-offs. Click through if you care to investigate.

In addition to whiskey, they will be pouring their vodka.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) celebrates the upcoming return of daylight savings time with \"London Lemonade\" made with Bulldog gin. They'll also be tasting a white burgundy, a red from Lirac, an organic white Bordeaux and a red Bordeaux.Both tastings are tonight from 6pm to 8pm.

 One of our readers has a bone to pick with the media, especially today's AM New York pizza article. \"Can everyone please stop calling Artichoke \"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery\"? The place is not a brewery! They have two beers - Bud and Bud Light available in 32 oz styrofoam cups for $5.50! Give me a break.\"We have to say he has a point. The media often just blindly repeats nonsense without doing even basic research. We don't care if the owners want it called by such a nonsensical moniker, the place is known as Artichoke to everyone and that's what we'll call it. Oh, and singling out Lombardi's as a \"legend\" is just wrong. The place is a tourist trap with overloaded crappy pizza. It's high time the media stop pushing that place as worth a visit.

 The much praised Death & Co. took some time to win us over. The cocktails were good but the doormen annoying, and so were the crowds. There was the constant impending doom of potential closing surrounding the place. And it was just too uneven on the bartender front. Yet over time, we were drawn back again and again until we couldn't deny it - it's become a favorite cocktail spot. Today, Death & Co. is as close to a classic NYC bar as has opened in the new millennium. The drink list is impressively vast yet smartly broken down by category of booze. The bartenders are sure of their craft. And the room is as comfortable as it gets, save the cold blast of air near the door in wintertime.It's all about the drinks, of course. And on that account, D&Co excels, with top-notch ingredients, creativity and highly balanced recipes, some with close to 10 ingredients.

Great review, HB! I haven't been to D&C in probably close to a year, but have been thinking lately that I should give them another chance. Your descriptions of the cocktails are further convincing me that I should do so, if for no other reason than to try that Carroll Gardens--sounds excellent.

 Why, we wonder, can't people just leave wine the way it is? First they added sugar-free sweetener to it. Now we have a \"new wine craze\" straight out of Cherry Valley, Ohio: Fruiteasers. Emerine Estates Winery has created a line of wine that uses a base such as chardonnay, riesling or merlot then adds in various fruits including apple, peach, blueberry and pineapple to create \"exotic fruit wines.\" Now, we don't mind old-fashioned wines made out of fruit (other than grapes). But why boost wines that naturally may have notes such as pineapple (riesling) or blueberries (merlot) with actual fruit? Or in the case of Seduction, a pinot noir with coffee, mocha, vanilla, cherries and chocolate. Are the wines themselves not enough? More of the head-scratching offerings here - Strawberry Shortcake Wine anyone? Speaking of cake, this wine definitely takes it: \"As seen on TV, its true (sic!), a 100% pure Chardonnay with Amish butter.\" No, we're not making this up. The name of the wine? Tear Drops. How a propos.

 A reader sent us a link to a Craigslist post entitled \"Opening a New Restaurant?\" featuring a sale of restaurant equipment at a familiar sounding address - 171 East Broadway - that made us curious. A quick Google search revealed the sale at none other than Broadway East. It's wrapping up this afternoon but you may be able to pick up pots, pans, toasters, knives and lots more. The listing is clearly written in a tone that worries it may signal impending doom - \"we bought too much\" - but it nonetheless strikes us as a bad sign for a place that can't be doing well in an off the beaten path location.

 Something just crossed our inbox that seemed enticing until we actually read it. TimeOut sent a sponsored promo invite to a March 4th event called \"Fabulously Frugal\" in... Yonkers. Yonkers? Yup, that \"city\" just up the Hudson River trying to revitalize itself as happening place. Seems a building called 66Main is trying to fill loft-style apartments and they've come up with an event they hope draws newly frugal New Yorkers to what is essentially an Open House. They promise food from area chefs, free \"spiked punch,\" giveaways and more!. As they put it, \"Westchester's hottest brands and hot new chefs will show you how as you mix and mingle at Yonkers' address for luxuriously affordable living.\"Apparently, after all the goodies, they had about $5 left in their budget for the graphic to the right. Anyway, if you're so inclined, here is the website. We would, however, like to remind those tempted by this fab offer that it is indeed YONKERS.

 The sad truth of this recession is no one and no thing is being spared. Even booze sales are now officially down. Conventional wisdom says that \"sins\" like booze and cigarettes survive well during recessions as people try to chemically cope with a depressing reality. But this recession is proving a lot of people wrong.Bloomberg reported yesterday that \"take-out sales of alcoholic beverages tumbled 9.3 percent in the fourth quarter\", the largest decline in fifty years of record keeping. The biggest bust? Surprisingly beer, down 14%. Wine was down 1.6% and liquor 0.9%. If you're into this sort of stuff, a handy chart at FiveThirtyEight.com shows the ups and downs of booze vis a vis GDP.

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

 A while back, we slapped Perbacco on the wrist for selling warm wine and placing candles in front of wine bottles. Unfortunately, new restaurant Sorella (95 Allen Street) is another offender. We slipped in for a glass of wine the other day and were impressed by the design and the attention to detail in everything from an interesting wine selection to the printed materials. Then we looked up to see wine everywhere.Folks, we can't stress enough that you store wine for customers properly. Having wine stored on shelves lit by candles is pretty but it's not wine we want to drink. Even worse, when the temperature control on the room's thermostat is set in the upper 70s, we get really concerned for the wine.The winelist is heavily skewed towards Northern Italy (good) but very pricey (bad). Since the cooking is skewed towards Piemontese, the region wines are well represented. Unfortunately, bottles under $50 are in short supply and the bulk of the reds from Piedmont were over $80. Wines by the glass tend towards the obscure, which is fine, but nothing we tried was really delicious. Prices by the glass, $10 to $17, would be fair if the pours were more generous. Right now they skimpy.

The drink we were served was made with Rittenhouse Rye and Carpano Antica, purportedly \"the original\" sweet Italian vermouth. It was terrific, perfectly balanced and nicely presented with three small cherries on a skewer across the top. If only all Manhattans could be this delicious.

***CONTENT
 When is a beer too fancy? That question is a common one these days as restaurants continue to look for ways to jack up prices with obscure beers and importers bring in ever more product. Case in point, Kasteel Cru, a fairly new arrival on the scene from Alsace, France made with champagne yeast and now selling at Whole Foods for $4.99 a bottle.That's a fair amount of scratch in these times, even for a lifestyle beer which this clearly is. So we picked up a bottle to see what the hype is all about. The first taste is of a well made lager with a bit of an effervescent character. Sipping further, we found that the slight bitterness of the initial taste seemed to mellow into an almost bubbly quality. This actually counteracts the \"beerness\" of the beer and makes the taste less cohesive but certainly makes for a bit of lightness in the mouth feel.We were curious how the beer held up over, say a half hour or sipping. Unfortunately, it doesn't quite hold the effervescence and gets a bit out of balance with more bitterness evident. The beer was passable with food and seemed best suited to cheese.All in all, it's a good, not great beer, with a fancy pedigree and way-too-high price. Stick with the regular lagers unless you're showing off new found wealth for a friend.

However, we will honor Eater's standing request to not publish the number, even if Ben Leventhal - a former UD consultant - had self-serving motives in writing the post. We get it, we like to get in too.Update: Seems the info is very public now - thanks to a Grub Street reader for pointing us in the right direction. For their website go here.

This of course is due to the dreaded \"lease issues\" and we can only wonder what kind of crack their landlord is smoking.Eater is on the scene with a report of how the Feds quashed Six Point Ale's \"Hop Obama\" brew. Seems the Dept of Homeland Security put the \"kabosh\" on the whole thing and even threatened seizure. Ouch.Lastly, we are somewhat intrigued that Dan Aykroyd is at Astor Wines today (12pm - 2pm) to shill for his vodka. Huh? Yup, you can get autographs but you can't taste the vodka. Guess you'll have to fork over $50 and let us know how if it's worth it.

 We noticed an odd sight outside FiDi's Gild Hall, a fancy Thompson Hotel venture complete with an upscale celeb chef resto - a whiteboard promoting happy hour. The joint, fancifully named the Libertine, opened with typical fanfare due to the name of its chef Todd English - English does English! - but failed to thrill both critics and diners.The beer-heavy ($4 Stellas, $5 Draughts) happy hour skews heavily towards guys with an appetite for oysters. The $1 - 1.50 oysters are a nice touch, but hey, how about something liquid for the ladies? Unlike Gild Hall, the trendy Thompson production, and Libertine, which was supposed to evoke London clubhouses circa 1970s (monied? plush?), the whiteboard sign is decidedly downscale and uninviting. Frankly, it looks to us like it was pulled from a back office (we hope the conference rooms' boards are cleaner than this!). Dear Management, this is the most passive-aggressive approach to promoting happy hour we've ever seen. Are you sure you want anyone coming in?The Libertine15 Gold StreetHappy Hour: 5pm - 7pm

 Today, Eric Asimov wrote a piece in The New York Times about little known Italian wines that are a good value. Unfortunately, the paper didn't include the most helpful information - where to buy them! That's right folks, the paper decided to only list importers since it insists on having a national food section. Too bad that isn't much help to New Yorkers.Here are a couple of our favorite places to pick up Italian wines from $10 to $20:Smith & Vine (268 Smith Street, Brooklyn) has a great selection - 50 different bottles in that price range.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is even more impressive, with over 90 wines in this price range.Enoteca DiPalo (200 Grand Street) opened in November two doors down from the original DiPalo, featuring wine from each of Italy's 20 regions. While the prices are generally higher than the Times range, more like $15 - $29 for most bottles, the selection includes some hard to find wines and is chosen with the usual DiPalo family care.Let us know where you like to pick up Italian (or any other) wines.

There you can partake in the Bruichladdich Malt Whiskey Academy's one week course in all things single malt. Writer Sarah Doyle Lacamoire wrote about her week at the distillery and she clearly had a blast, experiencing the entire distilling and bottling process before \"graduating,\" presumably with honors.If this sounds like a great way to spend a week, drop an email to ella@bruichladdich.com.The academy is only open May through November.

 Ninth Avenue in the area around Port Authority has never been the pretty part of town, and the Holland Cocktail Lounge (532 9th Avenue) has always seemed to fit right in. There was nothing modern or sceney about the neighborhood dive but it did the job, until its recent closure that is, due to the landlord trying to sell the building. Given the state of the market, that effort went nowhere and so the bar is open again, per Grub Street, and ready to serve $4 beers. In this day and age, that's something.

***CONTENT
 Thrillist, Eater, et al posted yesterday about a new speakeasy - yes, narrow space, downstairs, unmarked door, yada yada - called Raines Law Room (48 W. 17th Street) and immediately a couple of skeptics weighed in. Seems some people are tired of speakeasies and we can understand that - everything from tiny PDT, the world's most promoted speakeasy, to Woodson and Ford, the open but not basement joint on Bleecker Street, has started to grate on folks. These days, people want to drink and they kind of prefer places that a) they can get into and b) they can find.One of the bartenders hastily leapt to the spot's defense, promising \"it's not like any other bar in town.\" Now it's arguable that was even necessary since only two commenters initially posted their skepticism and it was hardly the usual Eater vitriol. Of course, the bartender's response opened him up for further criticism and a good bit of hole was dug, though he was certainly diligent and fair in his comments. However, it might serve folks working at speakeasies to be a little less sensitive to internet comments.From our perspective, the place actually sounds intriguing and we don't mind the concept - assuming they have a policy of actually letting people in. We'll let you know how that Old Fashioned tastes, it does sound like a delicious version. Raines Law Room48 W. 17th Street, downstairs, unmarked door

 Death + Company (433 East 6th Street) is undoubtedly one of New York's best cocktail bars, as well as one of its most controversial, due to its never-ending battle to stay open. We've spent some extended time there recently - look for a review later this week - and after much imbibing, decided to test the bartender's Manhattan chops. We left it up to him and his take ($13) was interesting and quite delicious - he used half Booker's Bourbon and half Rittenhouse Rye to create a rich, nicely balanced drink. It certainly sent us out into the cold night feeling no pain.

 We passed by respected Japanese kaiseki spot Rosanjin this weekend and came across this disturbing, misspelled sign signaling a \"temporary\" closure. We peered over the screens covering up the windows and saw an empty room, save a ladder in the center. Was their transformation from set menu to a la carte not enough to keep the restaurant afloat? Or is there a problem with the space that needed fixing? The outgoing message on the restaurant's machine gives no hint of closure and Open Table has tables available from Wednesday on (Mon and Tues not available).UPDATE 2/2/09 12:30pm - A call to the restaurant confirms the closure is temporary due to unspecified problems and they hope to be open Thursday or Friday.

***CONTENT
 Crain's New York is reporting that liquor stores are up in arms over the proposal by Governor Paterson to expand sales of wine to grocery stores in an attempt to raise money for the state budget. 2,700 of them have banded together to form a coalition called \"The Last Store on Main Street\" to fight the proposal, which could lead to an additional 19,000+ licenses to sell wine.New York State has long been backwards in laws related to selling wine. Recall that only a few years ago, all liquor stores were closed on Sundays as if this were the deep South. Some of these same stores fought the change because they argued Sunday hours favored big liquor stores over mom & pop shops. They were wrong about that and they are wrong about this.Fewer than ten states limit wine sales to liquor stores. New Jersey has tons of liquor stores and you can buy wine in supermarkets. If you peruse the aisle of a Jersey supermarket, you'll find a good deal of plonck among the mostly pedestrian choices. If you want interesting or hard to find wine, you go to a liquor store. The same would happen in New York - not to mention that you would still have to buy liquor at a liquor store. Also, let's not forget that stores in New York City don't even have all that much room for wine due to high real estate costs - stuff is already stacked to the ceiling. Where are they going to put so much wine that it puts shops out of business? However, we do think wine shops should be able to sell more than alcohol - cheese, mixers and beer come to mind. We also support the proposal to allow shops to have multiple licenses - creating mini-chains that can then leverage distributors for better deals. Let's level the playing field and let capitalism take over, shall we?

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 Time Out New York would seem to be a fan of our own Manhattan Project - why else would they advertise the \"Perfect Manhattan\" on the cover of this week's issue? Sure, the article delves into NYC themed drinks that the Manhattan has inspired, but why do they fumble so badly when highlighting where to have the original?Our guess is the writer was not aware of our own post about the Bemelman's experience - short version: dated room, overpriced drinks and a piss poor Manhattan made by someone who could have cared less. We'd actually be willing to bet that the writer did not set foot in Bemelman's for the story - since the default Manhattan when we were there was made with Makers, which is certainly not a rye as listed in the recipe on TONY's website. Not to mention that the recipe doesn't even include bitters. Huh?Among their picks for Manhattan-inspired cocktails, our favorite is the Little Italy at Pegu Club. Basically a somewhat bitter Manhattan, made with Cynar, it's one of our favorite drinks around town.

 Recent West Village wanderings took us into subterranean cocktail den Little Branch (22 Seventh Avenue South) in search of a good Manhattan. While we like the look of the space, the drinks themselves have never really impressed us. We slid into one of the tight booths and ordered a Manhattan. The waitress didn't ask for a booze preference but when it arrived, there was a familiar quality to it. Hmm, we thought. Could it be Old Overholt, our own house rye? Sure enough it was. Makes a nicely balanced Manhattan, though theirs was a tad drier than the Head Bartender version. At $12 a solid version of a classic cocktail.

 NYC diners know Restaurant Week is a bit of a crapshoot. Participants either take the promotion as an opportunity to introduce themselves to new diners - Danny Meyer's restaurants do this very well, so do restaurants such as Tocqueville and Cafe Boulud - or they do it for the volume or because they think they have to. We had hoped that Oceana's pedigree would put it firmly in the former category and their offer of 30% off the entire winelist during Restaurant Week was sufficient to lure us back, in spite of the mediocre food and wine service we had experienced there a few years ago. The chef had since changed, the Times' critic loved it (reaffirming its three stars just last July) and it seemed like a good opportunity to give it abother try.However, on our visit, it seemed like the kitchen wasn't even trying, just cranking out those menus and praying RW would soon be over soon. There was little imagination at work on the plates presented. Bland, boring, monotone presentation and flavors seemingly customized to a shabby room.

 The New York Times reported yesterday that Long Island vintner Robert Palmer died last week, making him the second winemaker to pass away within weeks after the tragic accident took Christian Wolffer's life in South America over the New Year's holiday. Palmer, though a pioneer in Long Island winemaking, was an ad man by trade and, as befits all true \"Mad Men,\" professed to like a good martini. Yet this non wine drinker still managed to build Palmer Vineyards into a well respected winery and popular tourist attraction. His ingenuity will live on as Long Island grows in stature as a world class wine region.

However, if the size of their events ever seemed too much, you'll be happy to know they do hold more intimate Joy of Sake Aftertaste events centered on particular themes throughout the year.On Monday night January 26, Sumile (154 W. 13th Street) will be the venue for the latest Aftertaste - and the theme is aroma, or how do you get such a variety of aromas such as apple and banana from something made from water, yeast and rice. These events tend to be quite a steal and this is no exception - two hours of sake drinking plus appetizers by the restaurant. It's 37 sakes for $37, all inclusive.Buy tickets online or call the restaurant and speak with Karen (212-989-7699).

 It seems like the inauguration of the 44th President of the United States on Tuesday has suddenly become a reason to get sloshed. How ironic then that the new president replaces a reformed drunk. But in these times, any excuse to booze up is good enough for us.In honor of the historic occasion, many DC bars already got permission to stay open 2 extra hours and Maryland bars also got an extended hour. Meanwhile in NYC, email inboxes have been flooded with inauguration day promotions and websites are falling all over themselves to provide you with spots to celebrate history. Here are just a handful of places with inauguration day specials:

 Our misadventure at Bemelman's the other night got us thinking about punches- no, not those awful concoctions we tried to slip booze into during high school dances - but the predecessor to the modern day cocktail. Death & Company features four punches on its menu and last year Clover Club got a lot of play when it opened with a menu featuring punch. But somehow it remains a group or party option. Yesterday, an intriguing punch recipe popped into our inbox courtesy of snazzy downtown wineshop Pasanella & Son (115 South Street). Using Batavia Arrack, a Javanese spirit made from sugar cane and fermented red rice, the Nuremburg Punch has the added benefit of being warm, thus perfect for a mid-winter party.The Nuremburg Punch1 pound sugar2 or 3 large oranges1 qt boiling water1/3 qt Batavia Arrack1 bottle inexpensive red winePare off a thin orange peel. Juice oranges. Add OJ to sugar with peel. Pour boiling water and Arrack over the mix. Add hot (but not boiling) wine. Stir. Serve.

 We popped into Bemelman's the other night for a quick drink and found the room surprisingly busy for a cold January weeknight. Whether this was due to the live music or the famed bar being bullet-proof in our recessionary times is unclear, but the welcome at the bar itself was hardly warm and inviting.Even before sitting, the bartender warned us there would be a $10 per person cover charge ($20 each at the tables, more on weekends). Then we looked at the menu - $19 for a cocktail. Sheesh. The list has fallen a ways since Audrey Saunders redid it and seemed tailored to the crowd. We were talked out of the famed \"punch of the day\" ($15) by the gruff bartender, who implied the punch is the same every day and predictably suggested the most expensive drink ($20). Instead, we got a barely stirred Manhattan made with Makers that was rough, to say the least. They do give you a sidecar and the nuts are good.The room itself has seen better days, even though it was renovated in 2002. The famed murals seemed dim and the large piano right in the middle of the room forces you to dodge musicians and tables to reach the bar. The bar itself is merely functional, and the footrail was partially dislodged and not a secure place for feet.I guess the joint is content to ride on its history and good will of the aged clientele. But who knows for how long at these prices?Bemelman's BarThe Carlyle Hotel, 35 E. 76th Street (at Madison)

 Urban Daddy breaks the news today that Sasha Petraske's White Star has adjusted its concept and is now serving proper cocktails. Prior, it only served liquor, notably absinthe, and beer. Thankfully, you can now get an Old Fashioned, Caipirinha or Manhattan, among others, for $10. We can only surmise that they succumbed to the pressure to serve cocktails due to the concept not quite clicking and a nowhere location (21 Essex near Hester St). For a look at their expanded menu, visit Urban Daddy. Expect a review, not to mention a visit from the Manhattan Project, soonish.

Actually, I broke the news several weeks ago: http://www.yelp.com/biz/white-star-new-york#hrid:xMjBLThnyZRnhkjPLcSjdQ :) It's a real improvement for WS--I went back this past Monday and had a really nice drink that the bartender called a Fancy Free--bourbon, sugar, maraschino and orange bitters--a tasty twist on an Old Fashioned. Also--apparently during Milk & Honey's renovations, anyone with a key can drink at WS for $9.

 We get a lot of recipes from liquor companies, but few are any good. Most of their so-called signature drinks wind up being too heavy handed with the product they are pushing. A notable exception are the fine folks at St. Germain, who consistently craft good drinks made with the elderflower liqueur.Case in point is the Paris Manhattan, a twist on the classic made with St. Germain, which actually enhances the flavor of the bourbon. The 'Parisian' touch is light and flirty without being too frou frou. We'd raise a glass to the creator of the drink, if we knew who he or she is...Paris Manhattanmakes one2oz Bourbon1oz St. Germain1/2oz Dry Vermouth2 dashes Angostura BittersPour ingredients into an ice filled shaker and stir until cold, strain into a martini glass.

 The bar at Gotham Bar and Grill (12 E. 12th Street) has long been one of the city's best dining bars thanks to their ingenious trays that rest on the rail running along the bar. While not a go-to spot for the drinks crowd these days, we figured it would have a solid Manhattan, so we popped in just before the holidays. The bartender asked our choice of booze and we chose rye. He recommended Michters, which is quite good but it turns out a bit pricey ($16). The resulting drink was a taste of classic New York - smooth yet potent. It almost made us forget the howling wind just outside the doors. Alas, if we could afford two, we might have really been protected from the elements.

***CONTENT
 Always on the cutting edge of a trend, The New York Times looks at the effect absinthe is having on the NYC booze world. The resulting article is pretty silly and yet more evidence of the paper's cluelessness when it comes to popular trends - down to the decidedly un-glamorous \"ptooey\" in the article's title.The author is Eric Konigsberg, apparently best known for his revealing insights into such topics as cloned pets and the need for supernannies. His take is basically that absinthe is a scam, something with silly rituals and dubious marketing, not to mention a pretty vile tasting liquor. At the outset of the piece, he visits Chinatown hotspot Apotheke - one of only two spots serving absinthe mentioned in a piece purportedly about an uber hot NYC trend - and makes little effort to temper his derision of the owner, the atmosphere and the crowd. Then he heads uptown to L'Absinthe, a \"polished and perfectly highly-regarded French restaurant\" run by \"a perfectly charming fellow,\" where he was lured by the restaurant's PR materials and a PR girl named Alice, then proceeds to partake in four different absinthes and talk to a few fans. What follows is \"perfectly\" predictable...

The founder of Wolffer Estate and a key figure in the growth of Long Island as a world-class winemaking region, Wolffer was an outsized figure in the industry. A native of Hamburg, Germany, it is rumored that he invested $15 million in the creation of the successful winery also known for hosting the annual James Beard Chefs & Champagne event each summer.

 We popped into the \"soft opening\" of City Winery last night not knowing what to expect. Eater and Grub Street had written it up, there were a bunch of good wine deals and there is a big PR machine behind it. What we found, was a bit of a surprise - a cavernous space (at most a third full around 8:30pm) and a big stage with a piano. There are cool looking barrels and bottles-as-decor, too. Granted it was the day before New Year's Eve and the location, two blocks north of the Holland Tunnel, is challenging, but we expected a much bigger turnout of oenophiles.The first thing that strikes you about City Winery is the sheer size of the place. All blond wood, we can only imagine the acoustics when it is full. The main floor is the restaurant/bar/performance space with a small private room downstairs. Designed for maximum sightlines in relation to the stage, this unfortunately means that when there is no performance, your eyes are drawn to the emptiness of the stage. And with a room that large, you have to wonder how they will fill it when there are no performances. The opening night was low key and all about the wines. And the deals were impressive: $5 Henriot champagne, $20 for a 1970 Francesco Rinaldi Barolo, $15 Lopez de Heredia 1987 Rioja, $10 Olga Riffaut's 1989 Chinon - all well worth the price, even though there was significant bottle variation. The glass pours were generous and tastes were provided as well. This was easily the best place to taste old vintages in New York last night - how often does one get a chance to taste 20 and 30 year old wines by the glass? And at these prices?!

 We've been to Tailor at least half a dozen times since it opened and it remains an enigma to us. The subterranean bar, with adventurous drinks by mixologist Eben Freeman, remains a draw yet the place seems to still suffer a case of disjointedness. On the one hand, it has curry popcorn, as addictive as it gets for bar snacks, and a few seriously good drinks. On the other, it has sky high expectations, lots of hype and high prices to boot. Does it stand up to the the expectations? The answer is mainly yes, though it's not entirely successful from a barfly's point of view.

I visited Tailor for the first time before being aware of all the hype. And, even then, I found it disappointing. I have not dined upstairs, but the bar food was subpar. The cocktails on paper sounded fascinating, but simply did not fulfill the promise. I'd so much rather have a simple Old Fashioned than these creations which promise a lot, work hard to bring something new, but in the end, fall flat. I have since been back, and was as disappointed the second time around as the first. While I admire the efforts of Eben Freeman, the end result is a major disappointed. I have time and time again made tastier, more satisfying mixed drinks at home that lack the fuss and pretense. That said, I'll give it one more shot.

We don't disagree with you though we have found some good drinks there and the food is much improved. The thing that dismays us is the pricing, which has always been high in comparison to places like Death & Co or PDT.

Kind of a working man's stiff drink, perfect for the blue collar crowd. The booze? McCormick's, the house rye. The price? $7.

But if you are looking for something different, try a fragrant dry muscat such as Ecker's Gelber Muskateller ($20.39 with the discount), which makes a great aperitif, or Weissburger (pinot blanc) from one of our favorite Austrian winemakers Heidi Schrock ($21.24 today).

But we liked Tilth and Vessel, so we'll let it slide.Much more fun is Metromix's what if you only had one \"last drink\" article. Our favorite response is of course the reference to PDT's highly potent Staggerac (a sazerac made with George T. Stagg Bourbon) though demerits must be issued since it was suggested by a PDT bartender. We'll be by later to pick them up...Is it us or was that NY Times article on the move of P & G restaurant/bar a total snooze? Half way through, it turns its focus to Sirio Maccioni, subject of a documentary tonight on HBO. Guess P & G wasn't much of a story. Either that or an editor took a hacksaw to the piece.

 When asked our favorite libation, many potential answers present themselves depending on our mood. But when it comes to cocktails one drink stands above the rest - the Manhattan. This classic cocktail is the epitome of grown-up drinking: no juice, no shaking, no (plastic) monkeys. Just whiskey (usually rye or bourbon), vermouth and a few dashes of bitters, well stirred and served up. When well made, it's pure pleasure. When not, it's a boozy mess. Debuting in the Manhattan Club in the 1870s, the Manhattan is about a hundred years older than we are. In the intervening years, it has inspired many variations and knock-offs. In honor of the original's outsized influence, we decided to embark on a project to find the best Manhattans in Manhattan - and beyond. We will search far and wide, high end and low end, to identify the best and warn you about the worst. We'll let bartenders guide us when it comes to the booze and see where they take us. And we will also tell you about some of the city's best new creations inspired by the drink.But we can't drink the city by ourselves, hard as we try, so we'd like to hear from you about where to find the best Manhattan, who makes it or how you like to order it. Drop us an email or leave a comment.Our first stop was a natural, a New York institution with a great bar: Gramercy Tavern.

 We'd heard a lot of good things about Perbacco (234 E. 4th Street), so we popped in recently for dinner and ordered a bottle of red wine without a second thought. Then we noticed something odd - the wine was warm in the glass. It seemed the glasses themselves were warm so we had them replaced. New glasses arrived after several minutes and we were each poured wine - but the wine was still warm. Then we felt the bottle. Warm. Normally we'd ask for another bottle but in this particular situation it was not an option and the wine was quite drinkable, especially after it cooled off a bit. The culprit? Wine stored on shelves in the open - with votives in front of them keeping them nice and toasty. Message to restaurant owners - store your wine properly! If you do it for \"atmosphere,\" use those bottles as decor only - don't serve them to customers!As for the surprise two stars the restaurant received from the New York Times? Talk about a headscratcher of a review. Only the prices seemed to be at a two-star level. The cooking, mainly deconstructed Italian dishes, was okay but flavors and deliciousness were lost in the deconstruction process and the service was just average. We poured our own wine all night. There are plenty of better 1 star places.If you know of other crimes against wine, or any other booze, drop us a line or leave a comment.

 If you want to give the perfect gift to a rocker pal or club kid, how about a three-story music venue? That's right, the Knitting Factory space is up for sale. The original spot was a landmark but there are plenty of online gripes about how the new location at 74 Leonard Street was a drag on the joint's legacy. The venue is still running shows so it's unclear how long the owners plan to hang on at that location but they are entertaining offers. If you got the dough - over $500K a year just for rent - you can pick up a rare Tribeca triplex with 3 liquor licenses and a cabaret license. Give Steven Kamali a buzz -if you're interested.

Tastings from 3pm to 5pm.On Sunday, Appellation Wine & Spirits (156 10th Avenue) is celebrating the Winter Solstice with a food pairing event. While we don't tend to celebrate this particular celestial occurrence, having healthy nibbles from Mary Cleaver will help make the official arrival of winter palatable. Try wines paired with bruschetta, spiced almonds, curried pumpkin dip and more.

 A reader asked us whether it was legal to charge corkage when you are BYOB and a quick call to the SLA (State Liquor Authority) clears up a few common misconceptions.Restaurants cannot be BYOB unless they have a license to sell alcohol. There is no separate BYOB permit. That means they have to go through the process, get the liquor license and have at least a temporary license on hand. If they choose to let you bring in booze and not sell their own, that is their call. So to answer the reader's question - licensed establishments can charge corkage. That is completely legal and outside the SLA's jurisdiction.

 Somewhat under the radar but worthy of a visit is the snug bar at Yerba Buena (23 Avenue A), overseen by the talented Artemio Vasquez, who learned a trick or two from his former employer, the doyenne of New York cocktails herself, Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club. The house cocktails we sampled ($12) were very good: the Jamaica 107 (left, hibiscus tea infused bernheim wheat whiskey + organic egg white + fresh lemon juice) was a hit with grown men, despite its pretty hibiscus color, and the Boludo \"Yerba Mate\" (yerba mate infused pisco + grapefruit & lime cordials + fresh lemon juice) was deliciously refreshing. We hear those mojitos go down real smooth too.And if you stop in by December 30, you can partake in their ongoing celebration of the repeal of prohibition. Classic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2 and Vieux Carre are $10.Perhaps best of all, plunk down $11 for a brunch cocktail and they will keep sending them until you beg them to stop. Yup, unlimited mimosas, bellinis, French 75 or the Peruvian Kiss, which has trouble written all over it.Yerba Buena23 Avenue A (bet Houston & 2nd Street)212-529-2919

 Next year, booze may well cost more. Gov. Paterson is proposing hikes in taxes on a whole assortment of goods, including beer and wine. Booze taxes are levied per gallon, and wine is currently taxed at the rate of 19 cents per gallon in New York. The proposal will raise that to about 51 cents, still below the national median tax rate.But there is some potential good news - the governor also wants to allow supermarkets to sell wine.

 The champagne bubble seems to have burst this year, but thankfully there are plenty of good, affordable sparkling wines you can serve at parties, bring along or give as gifts with no shame. For bubbly on the budget (or a splurge), we usually head to Astor Wines & Spirits, which has the most extensive selection of sparklers by country and region - and the best prices. For $20 or less, here are a few recently tasted winesProsecco is often the go-to sparkler for people since it's affordable and highly drinkable. Prosecco di Valdobbiadene Col Vetoraz is a very good option: clean, crisp and smooth with depth and complexity and refreshing citrus notes. While available at Vestry Wines and Italian Wine Merchants, Astor has the best price at $15.99.Made by a French champagne family in New Mexico, Gruet offers excellent quality for the price. Rich and creamy with a toasty finish, the Brut is nicely balanced. The Gruet Blanc de Noirs is even richer and both are $12.99 at Astor. A great value and a hands-down favorite under $15.Should you chance bubbly under $10? Delacroix Brut Blanc de Blancs is a French sparkler that's fairly simple but a great find for its price - $7.99 at Astor. A blend of chardonnay, chenin blanc and ugni blanc (used in cognac making), it is fresh, easy drinking and has good fizz - perfect for big parties.The elegant Parigot & Richard Crémant De Bourgogne Brut Blanc de Blancs is the closest to champagne in this group. Dry and polished, this delicious wine will easily stand up to higher priced champagnes. It's made with chardonnay and aligoté - and excellent with smoked salmon and crème fraiche. $19.99 at Astor.

 Liquor license woes are legendary in New York these days. All too often restaurants have to open without one. It gets reported in the media at opening time but then we are left to wonder - did they ever get that license? Heck, do they even want one? Here's an update on the status at some local favorites. Each restaurant has its charms and fans will attest to the food, but saving a few bucks on booze is an additional plus, especially these days.Motorino, East Williamsburg pizza hotspot (319 Graham Ave), is still without a liquor license. They welcome you to bring in beer or wine. Another Brooklyn pizza mecca, Lucali (575 Henry Street, Carroll Gardens), has also remained sans liquor license so pack your own. (Photo - Motorino pie)Petite self-professed \"neo-Korean\" East Villager Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street) is still going strong in the wake of summer critical praise and the Times review. Their website cryptically says they are \"BYOB again,\" so go ahead.Kuma Inn (113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor) continues to wow them on the LES. They are BYO for the time being but they do have corkage fees, depending on your booze of choice: $5 for 750ml wine, $1 per 12oz beer, $3 for 300ml of sake, $4 for 720ml of sake and $10 for 1.5L. No hard liquor allowed.

Please clarify, if the place doesn't have a liquor license, by law you can't charge customers even for services related to alcohol ie \"corkage\" I have no problem tipping the server for the extra service, just giving more money to an undeserving proprietor.

 In Japan sake is as everyday as soda pop, with cans of sake available from vending machines everywhere, including in railway stations for those long rides home. While you can't get it from a machine, you can still emulate those crafty Japanese with some great fresh-tasting sake out of a can right here in NYC.One of our favorites is Funaguchi Kikusui, a draft sake straight from the tank, unpasteurized with no additives. The can is perfect for preserving this fresh, easy drinking sake. Be careful though - these dynamite 200ml cans pack a punch since the sake is 19.8% alcohol. You can pick them up at Sakaya (324 E. 9th Street) for $6.99. Drink cold.Another sake available by the can, albeit in a larger 720ml version, is the delicious Narutotai Ginjo Nama Genshu. Let's break down the name -Narutotai is the name, ginjo is the type, nama means unpasteurized, and genshu means that no water was added at the end of the brewing process. This makes for a fresh, potent sake (18%+ alcohol) that is both rich and smooth. Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is selling the can right now for $32.99.

 What is the best new bar you can't get into? How about a new speakeasy (name TBD) that opened in a Village basement. And no, you likely can't get in right now.Places slipping in under the radar are a rarity in NYC. An unmarked basement location certainly helps. Limited operating hours, mostly on weekends, do too. Right now it is only an event space.But if you do make it in - with the secret password (available via text) given to the doorman - an underground world suddenly unfolds. The space is warm and welcoming, with nooks and crannies on either side of a long old school bar. Above is the requisite stuffed animal - a wolf's head peering down at the revelry. The decor (and staff) will be familiar to anyone who's been to Apotheke, Tailor or Clover Club - lots of wood, plush sofas, old-fashioned light fixtures. And there is an impressive amount a space, a welcome change from great but tiny places like PDT or Milk and Honey that but fill up quickly.The cellar has a fascinating history. It was once Pfaff's Beer Cellar, circa the early 1800s, and hosted Mark Twain and Walt Whitman, among others. Later incarnations included a photo studio where Abe Lincoln's portrait was taken, a 1900s brothel, the infamous Infinity Disco where 21 people died in a fire in the 1970s, and the gay club Mr. Black Dance Den.So what about the drinks? They are well-priced ($12 for cocktails) and well-balanced. We very much liked the eponymous Woodson and Ford (applejack, zacapa 23, benedictine, sweet vermouth, Fee brothers' whiskey barrel bitters). The Woodrow Wilson, however, would best be categorized as \"interesting\" since the flavors and booze - rittenhouse rye, amaro averna, champagne, demerara and orange zest - did not quite mesh. The floating ice cubes eventually melted and mellowed out the drink.The bar also has a nice vittles menu. The mostly Spanish-skewing plates range from $7 to $17 (kumamotos are $3 a pop) and come from the Corner Shop Cafe upstairs. Patatas Bravas deep fried in duck fat and served with homemade ketchup, were scrumptious ($7) while Fabada, fava beans and spiced pork, was good but overpriced at $11. The cheese selection (a hefty $6 each) is commendable, with Mrs. Quickie's cheddar, Tuxford & Tebbutt Stilton and Uplands Pleasant Ridge.After the jump, a look at the full cocktail menu plus other boozy details. We'll keep you posted on door policies and hours - we hear they might be opening on Mondays and Tuesdays as early as this week.Woodson and Ford643 Broadway, Downstairs

The spot sounds cool and I'm looking forward to checking it out when it opens to the public. However, complaining about the positive coverage you're receiving as a result of this post doesn't make sense and is kinda lame. Having a bars status discussed on a NY blog is exactly where the conversation will play out. this blog just handed you the mic, and this is your oppertunity to clear up any misconceptions. Bashing the blogger for 'stealing' is not the message I would suggest. Social Media PR is tricky stuff, I would consider speaking with a firm that can help you navigate.

RQ, re: this whole password business--if you want to keep out the casual passerby/speakeasy stalker, why not just have a guest list like _every_ other private event in the city? I'd think that would be more effective, as then people can't just text their friends the password. And HB, I'm confused. Were you at a private party without realizing it?
rumqueen
2008-12-17 17:59:00
It was a birthday party for 2 people in the liquor industry. Apparently HB was invited by one of the hosts or managed to get swept in by the crowd. He sat center bar and ate food which was not included in the complimentary special cocktails paid for by the host. We were 6 deep so no one noticed the camera phone.

Here's the thing - nobody said it was not open or had anyone sign a non-disclosure agreement or the like. The city is rife with speakeasy marketing gimmicks like passwords and \"secret\" spots. The staff told us the place had been open a couple of weeks. They gave us hours. And when we were there, people were paying for their drinks. These are the facts. As for the post - you asked us to change the it and we did so. We look forward to the day when you are open to the public. H.B.

 The boozy season is upon us so here is our guide to surviving it - assuming your company still has the dough for a holiday party. The Head Bartender knows there's an equal chance you'll be naughty or nice, so here are some ways to make sure you keep your job and don't wind up making out with the boss at the end of the night:Keep in mind, holiday parties are extensions of work. Merry is good but don't make an ass of yourself.If you don't want to be seen on YouTube in it, don't wear it.Bring a partner or significant other to keep you in line. (This works as long as they don't imbibe as much or more than you.)Eat before drinking. Hit the carbs or the carving station - they'll give you good padding for a night of open bar.Go 1 for 1 water to booze to mitigate the effects. The last thing you want to do is call off the next day and be the endless butt of jokes. Leave one-half hour before the party is over. This way, you won't wind up drunk and uninhibited when the lights go out.The goal of attending an office party is to have a good time and survive with your dignity intact, not to get bombed. You'll thank us in the morning.

 Now that the dust has settled from the '08 elections, we can look at the effect the booze industry had on the race. And shocker of all shockers... it favored Democrats with donations this year. It's actually the first time since 1994 that the booze industry gave more to Democrats than Republicans - 52% - 48%, not too far off the popular vote of 53% - 46% for Pres Elect Obama. In all, the industry and individuals associated with it donated $12.997 million. Way to grease the rails of democracy! Out of 80 industries measured, the booze industry was #37 in terms of money donated. The numbers going back to the 1990 campaign are broken down at OpenSecrets.org.

***CONTENT
 You're probably not the only one confused by Ella and Elsa, two newish cocktail bars in the East Village that opened within weeks - and blocks - of each other. However, once you get past the names, there isn't a whole lot that the two places have in common.Ella is the slicker of the two joints, with Victoria's Secret-esque pink and black striped walls, a smoky underground performance space and velvet ropes out front. Assuming you can slip in past the doorman - they have a semi-strict door policy we bet gets dropped any minute- you'll find yourself in a glammed up space with a long bar and some banquettes up front. The drink list is impressively long - nine specialty cocktails, three champagne cocktails and eleven classic cocktails. We instinctively go for brown liquor so we tried the Clark Gable (maker's mark, lime, ginger-infused simple syrup) and it was the clear favorite. Finding another appealing drink was a bit of a challenge, however. The Mildred Pierce (bulldog gin, basil infused simple syrup, lime) was recommended by the bartender but highly acidic. Mommie Dearest (milagro tequila, lime, simple syrup, orange bitters) was also seriously out of balance and the Rye Smash (sazerac rye, muddled raspberries, lemon, simple syrup) was hardly a smashing success. In the meantime, a DJ bombarded us with some of the worst music this side of Jersey. Clearly Ella is for cool people. I guess they can hope to find a clientele too cool for taste buds.On to Elsa, over in Alphabet City. A former dive bar, the space was remade with a bespoke men's tailor in the front and a cocktail bar in the back. The room is kind of upstate antiques shop basic, with narrow booths up front across from a standing-only bar and rustic tables in the back. Mainly wood, the room is simple and bland (and way too bright), though we did like the barn-like effect of the bathroom ceiling. With the décor underwhelming, all we could hope for were some good cocktails. (There are also beers on tap, flowing through an old Singer sewing machine, and a few wines.) From the short list (4 signature concoctions and 4 classics), we tried The Jaszek (applejack, velvet falernum, lime, angostura, orange bitters) and the El Romero Borracho (souza blanco, grapefruit, campari, lime), coming away hopeful for the future. Both were balanced, complex and satisfying, showing skill on behalf of the resident mixologist. The Perfect Manhattan? Yes, please. When they get their feet wet, we'll be back for a second look.Ella9 Avenue A between 1st and 2nd streets, 212-777-2230Elsa217 E. 3rd Street between Avenue B and C, 917-882-7395

 We love eating at restaurant bars, in part because we prefer to chat up bartenders, but also because you have a lot more freedom in how and what you order. Unfortunately, something has started rubbing us the wrong way - restaurants charging wine prices for artisanal beers. OK folks, we know these beers are more expensive than your typical Bud or Coors Light but do they really cost you $3 each?New restaurants seem particularly egregious about jacking up beer prices. The John Dory has a tiny list of four beers, three for $8 and one for $9. I recall much better prices on the beers at sister restaurant The Spotted Pig. While they have only been open a few weeks, perhaps they'll see the light at the end of 10th Avenue and give beer drinkers a break.Irving Mill, a recent recipient of criticism for serving beer in less than pint size glasses, has a huge list of $7 and $8 tap beers. Ommegang from Cooperstown is $8? Brooklyn Pilsner is $7? That's pretty excessive in our opinion. Even worse, their list by the bottle has beers for $12 and $13.Perhaps restaurateurs are forced to raise beer prices because people will only pay so much for wine or food. But the approach is counter-productive. When faced with a list of over-priced artisanal beers, we now just tend to stop at one. What do you do?

 You've seen the vougue cocktail ingredient \"Velvet Falernum\" around town, but just what exactly is it?Falernum is a mix of several spices (generally ginger, almond, clove) and lime, sometimes alcoholic and sometimes not. You'll find it in Tiki drinks, classic Caribbean drinks like the Mai Tai and Zombie and, of course, in cool cocktails around NYC. The poplular brand is John D. Taylor Velvet Falernum from Barbados, which is an infusion of spices, sugar cane syrup and rum. You can try it in the unfortunately named Lovee Long Time at the new hotspot Macao Trading Co.

 Est Arrivee! Or something. Beaujolais Nouveau is the king of wine promotions - legally it cannot be served until the third Thursday of November and that means marketing up the wazoo to announce its somewhat dubious arrival. Here is where you can get your grapes off, so to speak:The king of promotions goes to producer Georges Duboeuf, which has an annual chef-biker ride to deliver Beaujolais. It's the middle of the day and involves no wine, so we say skip it.The FIAF (French Institute Alliance Francaise) has an event starting at 6:30pm. You can get all the BN you can drink plus food and entertainment. 22 East 60th Street, $55 for non-members. More infoJules Bistro (65 St. Marks) will be serving Antonin Rodet Beaujolais, which is a step up from Duboeuf. Jules has the added bonus of free bites at the bar, if you can get close enough, plus cool jazz. As an added bonus, you can pop in to register to win a free trip to France on Open Skies airline.

 Danny Meyer sure knows how to do Restaurant Week. We've tried his restaurants in the past and they are some of the hardest reservations during RW. So when we sidled up to the packed bar at The Modern's Bar Room last week for just a drink and found out they were serving the menu at the bar, it was no surprise that we were tempted into ordering.At his restaurants, the restaurant week menu is all they serve. Choices are plentiful and interesting, usually drawn from the regular menu. It seems like they want you to have a good time and truly want to show off the restaurants to those who may not have had the chance - or the means - to try it otherwise. At the Bar Room, the menu had around 10 choices in each category (fewer for dessert) and from what we sampled, you couldn't go wrong.

 Somewhat under the radar but worthy of a visit is the snug bar at Yerba Buena (23 Avenue A), overseen by the talented Artemio Vasquez, who learned a trick or two from his former employer, the doyenne of New York cocktails herself, Audrey Saunders of Pegu Club. The house cocktails we sampled ($12) were very good: the Jamaica 107 (left, hibiscus tea infused bernheim wheat whiskey + organic egg white + fresh lemon juice) was a hit with grown men, despite its pretty hibiscus color, and the Boludo \"Yerba Mate\" (yerba mate infused pisco + grapefruit & lime cordials + fresh lemon juice) was deliciously refreshing. We hear those mojitos go down real smooth too.And if you stop in by December 30, you can partake in their ongoing celebration of the repeal of prohibition. Classic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, Corpse Reviver #2 and Vieux Carre are $10.Perhaps best of all, plunk down $11 for a brunch cocktail and they will keep sending them until you beg them to stop. Yup, unlimited mimosas, bellinis, French 75 or the Peruvian Kiss, which has trouble written all over it.Yerba Buena23 Avenue A (bet Houston & 2nd Street)212-529-2919

 The SLA is diligently killing off the concept of BYOB for restaurants as evidenced by the latest report on Grub Street about Emporio's booze-less opening. Yup, no BYOB for them.As we've previously reported, the current laws are asinine - a restaurant can't be BYOB unless they have a liquor license (not even if you have applied and it is pending) but if they never intend to apply, they are not under the SLA's authority and thus they can't do anything to stop you. The cops could, theoretically, but we doubt they'll be raiding anyone over this.A much better idea would be to re-write the laws to allow any restaurant to be BYOB and to streamline the licensing procedure for restaurants. There was a movement to separate restaurants from bars and clubs but that seems to be up in the air. In the meantime, since it's clear people want booze with their dinner, shouldn't our state reps help foster a system that is a win-win for both customers and restaurant owners? Cause this cockamanie system is terrible for everyone and has damaged too many restaurants to count.

BYOB without a liquor license is always illegal, whether or not you're applying for license through the SLA. And even if you are, the SLA doesn't do anything to stop you. They'll just take note of the fact that you illegally allowed BYOB while your license was pending. It's true that cops probably aren't going to go door to door with no-license restaurants to enforce the law, but if, say, you have an upstairs neighbor that you've pissed off, they can call the cops on you, and then they'll HAVE to investigate.

 Disturbing news for New Yorkers - most BYO restaurants are breaking the law according to a story in Crains New York. As we previously reported, restaurants need to have a liquor license to allow BYO - unless they are under 20 seats. If they open and are applying for a license, they may jeopardize the application's status by allowing BYO. It's unclear what the consequences are since the SLA (State Liquor Authority) only has jurisdiction if an application for a license is underway - no application, no SLA authority. Then enforcement fall on the police.

 Liquor license woes are legendary in New York these days. All too often restaurants have to open without one. It gets reported in the media at opening time but then we are left to wonder - did they ever get that license? Heck, do they even want one? Here's an update on the status at some local favorites. Each restaurant has its charms and fans will attest to the food, but saving a few bucks on booze is an additional plus, especially these days.Motorino, East Williamsburg pizza hotspot (319 Graham Ave), is still without a liquor license. They welcome you to bring in beer or wine. Another Brooklyn pizza mecca, Lucali (575 Henry Street, Carroll Gardens), has also remained sans liquor license so pack your own. (Photo - Motorino pie)Petite self-professed \"neo-Korean\" East Villager Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street) is still going strong in the wake of summer critical praise and the Times review. Their website cryptically says they are \"BYOB again,\" so go ahead.Kuma Inn (113 Ludlow Street, 2nd Floor) continues to wow them on the LES. They are BYO for the time being but they do have corkage fees, depending on your booze of choice: $5 for 750ml wine, $1 per 12oz beer, $3 for 300ml of sake, $4 for 720ml of sake and $10 for 1.5L. No hard liquor allowed.

Please clarify, if the place doesn't have a liquor license, by law you can't charge customers even for services related to alcohol ie \"corkage\" I have no problem tipping the server for the extra service, just giving more money to an undeserving proprietor.

 We've never been to any incarnation of the Russian Tea Room (150 W. 57th Street) so we have no qualms with it. However, their newest deal, coming to us via Eater's Dealfeed, seems a bit suspect. For the month of April, if you order the \"Business Express Lunch\" for $35 they will give you a free vodka martini to wash it down. Strikes us as an odd promotion - how many people want a vodka martini in the middle of the day? Especially when they are ordering an express lunch?

 Today, Eric Asimov wrote a piece in The New York Times about little known Italian wines that are a good value. Unfortunately, the paper didn't include the most helpful information - where to buy them! That's right folks, the paper decided to only list importers since it insists on having a national food section. Too bad that isn't much help to New Yorkers.Here are a couple of our favorite places to pick up Italian wines from $10 to $20:Smith & Vine (268 Smith Street, Brooklyn) has a great selection - 50 different bottles in that price range.Astor Wines & Spirits (399 Lafayette Street) is even more impressive, with over 90 wines in this price range.Enoteca DiPalo (200 Grand Street) opened in November two doors down from the original DiPalo, featuring wine from each of Italy's 20 regions. While the prices are generally higher than the Times range, more like $15 - $29 for most bottles, the selection includes some hard to find wines and is chosen with the usual DiPalo family care.Let us know where you like to pick up Italian (or any other) wines.

 We passed by respected Japanese kaiseki spot Rosanjin this weekend and came across this disturbing, misspelled sign signaling a \"temporary\" closure. We peered over the screens covering up the windows and saw an empty room, save a ladder in the center. Was their transformation from set menu to a la carte not enough to keep the restaurant afloat? Or is there a problem with the space that needed fixing? The outgoing message on the restaurant's machine gives no hint of closure and Open Table has tables available from Wednesday on (Mon and Tues not available).UPDATE 2/2/09 12:30pm - A call to the restaurant confirms the closure is temporary due to unspecified problems and they hope to be open Thursday or Friday.

***CONTENT
 Why, we wonder, can't people just leave wine the way it is? First they added sugar-free sweetener to it. Now we have a \"new wine craze\" straight out of Cherry Valley, Ohio: Fruiteasers. Emerine Estates Winery has created a line of wine that uses a base such as chardonnay, riesling or merlot then adds in various fruits including apple, peach, blueberry and pineapple to create \"exotic fruit wines.\" Now, we don't mind old-fashioned wines made out of fruit (other than grapes). But why boost wines that naturally may have notes such as pineapple (riesling) or blueberries (merlot) with actual fruit? Or in the case of Seduction, a pinot noir with coffee, mocha, vanilla, cherries and chocolate. Are the wines themselves not enough? More of the head-scratching offerings here - Strawberry Shortcake Wine anyone? Speaking of cake, this wine definitely takes it: \"As seen on TV, its true (sic!), a 100% pure Chardonnay with Amish butter.\" No, we're not making this up. The name of the wine? Tear Drops. How a propos.

 Sometimes things are wrong on so many levels, it's hard to figure out where to begin. Case in point - Slender Wine. Apparently, some folks in Indiana thought it would be a good idea to make \"Sweetened Wine\" with a sugar substitute called Zerose. And if that isn't bizarre enough, there's this - the wine will be in the gift bags at the Oscars!The wine comes in three varieties - white, blush and red - and is produced by a winery called Chateau Thomas outside Indianapolis. Apparently, the winery itself has been around for 24 years but after 2 years of \"research and experimentation,\" Slender Wines were born. And how did that happen? Well, check out the most surreal winery video ever...From the website: Sweetened with Zerose® , a natural sweetener which has zero calories, a zero glycemic index, no carbs, no fats. The world's only naturally sweetened wines. A wine for those who don't want or can't have sugar... No Sugar No Carbs No Fats No After-taste No Kidding! Our question is why would anyone want \"naturally sweetened wine\" in the first place?

***CONTENT
 A while back, we slapped Perbacco on the wrist for selling warm wine and placing candles in front of wine bottles. Unfortunately, new restaurant Sorella (95 Allen Street) is another offender. We slipped in for a glass of wine the other day and were impressed by the design and the attention to detail in everything from an interesting wine selection to the printed materials. Then we looked up to see wine everywhere.Folks, we can't stress enough that you store wine for customers properly. Having wine stored on shelves lit by candles is pretty but it's not wine we want to drink. Even worse, when the temperature control on the room's thermostat is set in the upper 70s, we get really concerned for the wine.The winelist is heavily skewed towards Northern Italy (good) but very pricey (bad). Since the cooking is skewed towards Piemontese, the region wines are well represented. Unfortunately, bottles under $50 are in short supply and the bulk of the reds from Piedmont were over $80. Wines by the glass tend towards the obscure, which is fine, but nothing we tried was really delicious. Prices by the glass, $10 to $17, would be fair if the pours were more generous. Right now they skimpy.

 We'd heard a lot of good things about Perbacco (234 E. 4th Street), so we popped in recently for dinner and ordered a bottle of red wine without a second thought. Then we noticed something odd - the wine was warm in the glass. It seemed the glasses themselves were warm so we had them replaced. New glasses arrived after several minutes and we were each poured wine - but the wine was still warm. Then we felt the bottle. Warm. Normally we'd ask for another bottle but in this particular situation it was not an option and the wine was quite drinkable, especially after it cooled off a bit. The culprit? Wine stored on shelves in the open - with votives in front of them keeping them nice and toasty. Message to restaurant owners - store your wine properly! If you do it for \"atmosphere,\" use those bottles as decor only - don't serve them to customers!As for the surprise two stars the restaurant received from the New York Times? Talk about a headscratcher of a review. Only the prices seemed to be at a two-star level. The cooking, mainly deconstructed Italian dishes, was okay but flavors and deliciousness were lost in the deconstruction process and the service was just average. We poured our own wine all night. There are plenty of better 1 star places.If you know of other crimes against wine, or any other booze, drop us a line or leave a comment.

Deal or No Deal? - Bar Blanc Bistro

***CONTENT
 With just two days left in the Bar Blanc Bistro (142 West 10th Street) opening week deal, we decided to pop in and see how they were doing. The bar was fairly busy but the restaurant mostly empty when we arrived. We grabbed a pair of empty seats at the bar and were handed the menus. The bartender clearly explained the half-off deal and the exclusions - no bottled beer, burger or oysters for half price. Fair enough, we thought, since the bar menu had a good bit of choice.The half-off special applied to draft beer, wine by the glass and carafe, and house cocktails. (The not-included bottled beer is your typical rip-off with $7 Stellas, Leffe and Hoegaarden). There were lots of choices among the cocktails, normally $12, generally classics or riffs on them including a caipiroska, sidecar (very popular) and a grapefruit martinis. We stuck to beer and wine. The Grimbergen ale was new to us but quite good (normally $7) if a bit sweet at the bottom of the glass while Blue Moon is... Blue Moon. Wines were interesting but suffered from being too warm and open for a while. A Pinot Noir from France was good but neither the mundane Tempranillo nor the White Bordeaux excited us.Food-wise, we enjoyed most everything - the chicken liver mousse was very good as were the beef croquettes, though the underlying mustard was way too hot. The burger was large and juicy while fries were perfectly crisped.Overall, the space looks the same from its previous incarnation (pre-bistro). It certainly doesn't read bistro and it's way too dark - reading menus was only possible by candlelight. Will this incarnation make it? Certainly the bar is comfortable but beer and wine are a bit too expensive for it to be a regular stop. The restaurant itself is a tougher sell and they have their work cut out for them. The previous restaurants struggled in the same space so you have to wonder if it is cursed. In the meantime, is it a deal? Heck yea! 50% off the entire check (tip on the whole amount fellow boozers). We suggest you hurry over before it expires tomorrow night at 8pm. Rumor has it they will have some type of happy hour after the deal is gone but it won't be nearly as good.

Mercadito (the original at 179 Ave B) will have a 4 course menu for $30 and live music. Mercadito Grove (100 Seventh Ave South) has $6 Herradura shots and Mercadito Cantina (172 Avenue B) will have shots of Tric-quila, their ingenious sake based tequila style concoction, for $5.We're not sure why America celebrates this particular Mexican victory but we'll take any opportunity we can get to booze up!

 Here are some events to whet your whistle for the next few days:Sake is big this weekend - Friday Sakaya (324 E. 9th Street) is hosting a tasting of spring namazake (unpasteurized sakes), one of which is brand new to the U.S. Acker & Merrill (160 W. 72nd) is holding two sake tastings - one on Thursday and one on Saturday featuring different sakes.The Greene Grape is holding two \"introduction to sake tastings\" - Friday in Manhattan and Saturday in Brooklyn. Five sakes will be tasted in Manhattan, four in Brooklyn and the list is online.ScheduleSakaya: Friday 5/1 6pm - 8pmGreene Grape: Friday 5pm - 7pm (55 Liberty Street, Manhattan), Saturday 5pm - 7pm (765 Fulton Street, Fort Greene)Acker & Merrill: Thursday 5:30 - 7:30pm and Saturday 5/2 2pm - 5pmIf you're looking for something other than sake, Astor Wines and Spririts (399 Lafayette Street) has multiple tastings. Tonight you can play out the classic Northern vs Southern Italy rivalry by trying four wines. On Saturday, you can try four more Italian wines as well as some Woodford Reserve Bourbon (the best bourbon there is in our humble opinion) in honor of Kentucky Derby day.Lastly, as much as we'd like to avoid it, Cinco de Mayo is coming up. Garnet Wines & Liquors (929 Lexington Avenue) is having a blow-out with live music, tequila and margarita tastings and more. Saturday 5/2 from 12pm - 3pm.

 A lot of time large scale tastings covering a certain region or country are not great ways to showcase wine - too much filler, too little interesting product. Thankfully, the Wines of Portugal event held this Tuesday intrigued us enough to overcome our skepticism, and thankfully we found lots of interesting wines - some available in the U.S. and some not.The wineries present represented all of Portugal's growing areas and specialized in whites, reds and ports along with a smattering of rose and sparkling wines. We stuck to the indigenous grapes such as Alvarinho, Arinto, Aragones and Touriga Nacional, avoiding the more international styles whenever possible.Here are some of the highlights, with a focus on wines that have distribution in place and thus possible to find in stores and restaurants:

 For those of you not feeling the bite of the recession, here are a couple of intriguing but pricey dinners:Friday 4/17 at LES Whole Foods (95 E. Houston) - The Brewmaster's Table with Garrett Oliver. Sample six dishes, including Lobster Fettuccine, paired with beers from Brooklyn Brewery. Mr. Oliver will be doing the cooking and talk about how to pair beer with food. The price is a bit steep though at $95 (all inclusive). Reserve online.Another option is the winemaker dinner at Convivio on Monday April 27th, which features the wines of five Italian producers paired with Chef Michael White's food. Maccheroni alla Carbonara... mmm! The wines are all made without pesticides and were arranged by Chambers Street Wines. Cost is $85 plus tax and tip. For reservations call Convivio at 212-599-5045.

 From half a block away you could hear the bagpipes. That meant just one thing - whiskey awaited. Over 100 of them in fact inside Chelsea Piers at the annual whiskey showcase \"Whisky Live\".The good stuff was distributed over 38 stations while around the corner various Scottish bands played fast and furious. Already familiar with the Highland Park, Oban and Macallan, we headed straight to the lesser known brands. The focus of the show is Scotch but there were also Bourbons, Rye, Blended Scotches and more. A lot of good stuff was being poured and we wasted no time exploring. Our favorites after the jump.

 Message to the media - please stop writing about PDT. It's in the name of the place for god's sake. Yes, it's a great bar. Yes, we like it very much. But enough's enough. The latest offender is Food & Wine. In their May 2009 issue featuring the best restaurants and bars around the world, they go for the obvious when it comes to NYC and highlight PDT - complete with photo. Yup, more tourists trying to figure out how to get through the phone booth. Just what we need.

 Few things go as well together as pizza and beer. Unfortunately, few things are as ripe for extreme mark-up as those two items. In the case of Co., or Company as you like, don't expect the recession to mean customer-friendly pricing.We'll come right out and say it - we were underwhelmed. The pizzas were small (about 11\") and the edges of the ballyhooed crust were almost reminiscent of Pizza Hut. The crust itself was pretty good, but the toppings deserved to be seasoned properly though, with salt definitely missing in action. And the pizzas seemed overloaded with cheese and bechamel, guess to explain the pricing - the majority of pizzas are $16 to $18 and appetizer up-selling is heavy.But this is a booze blog. And there is nothing more depressing than staring at a beer list where everything is $7. Really, $7 for Blue Moon, Sixpoint and Stella? While we're at it, could they come up with a more cliched list of beers? What possible justification can there be for marking up beer over 500% anyway?We here at Boozy are getting real tired of being ripped off for the privilege of drinking designer beers - not to mention the Belgian equivalent of Bud. If restaurateurs have so little respect for beer drinkers that they view them merely as a profit center, maybe they should just stop serving beer. On this particular day, we silently drank water. That is not our preferred dining mode.

 One of our readers has a bone to pick with the media, especially today's AM New York pizza article. \"Can everyone please stop calling Artichoke \"Artichoke Basille's Pizza & Brewery\"? The place is not a brewery! They have two beers - Bud and Bud Light available in 32 oz styrofoam cups for $5.50! Give me a break.\"We have to say he has a point. The media often just blindly repeats nonsense without doing even basic research. We don't care if the owners want it called by such a nonsensical moniker, the place is known as Artichoke to everyone and that's what we'll call it. Oh, and singling out Lombardi's as a \"legend\" is just wrong. The place is a tourist trap with overloaded crappy pizza. It's high time the media stop pushing that place as worth a visit.

 Time Out New York would seem to be a fan of our own Manhattan Project - why else would they advertise the \"Perfect Manhattan\" on the cover of this week's issue? Sure, the article delves into NYC themed drinks that the Manhattan has inspired, but why do they fumble so badly when highlighting where to have the original?Our guess is the writer was not aware of our own post about the Bemelman's experience - short version: dated room, overpriced drinks and a piss poor Manhattan made by someone who could have cared less. We'd actually be willing to bet that the writer did not set foot in Bemelman's for the story - since the default Manhattan when we were there was made with Makers, which is certainly not a rye as listed in the recipe on TONY's website. Not to mention that the recipe doesn't even include bitters. Huh?Among their picks for Manhattan-inspired cocktails, our favorite is the Little Italy at Pegu Club. Basically a somewhat bitter Manhattan, made with Cynar, it's one of our favorite drinks around town.

Other than the Bemelman's blunder, I think it's a pretty good list. I'm a big fan of the Greenpoint, and am happy to see that Max at Jack the Horse made the list--although am worried that all this exposure may mean the end of quiet nights at \"my\" bar...

I think it's a decent list too, though why two entries for Little Branch/ White Star? Haven't been to Jack the Horse - will check it out.
