There was a moment when I was making this that my heart sank, \"Oh, no. I can't deal with a baking failure today. I'll blow it all out of proportion.\" Because I am not on an even keel today, and I know it. I thought baking something might make me feel more relaxed, but I forgot that things can go wrong. But the emotional funhouse was all worth it when I opened the oven door and this browned beauty smiled back at me. I had set out to make Mark Bittman's blueberry cobbler, substituting 4 cups of peaches for the blueberries and using cornmeal for half the flour. What I ended up with was like a peach upside down cornmeal cake that was light on the cake and super-heavy on the fruit. The cornmeal topping covered the fruit and had a crust crunchy with cornmeal and sugar. Four cups peeled, diced peaches (I used UFOs) tossed with 1/4 cup sugar in the baking dish. Mix 1/4 cup each flour and cornmeal in a bowl, add 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and a pinch of salt. Cut in 1 stick (1/2 cup) cold, unsalted butter. Then mix in 1/2 cup sugar because you forgot to add it with the flour. Use a spoon to mix in 1 egg and a dash of vanilla. (This is the point at which I panicked. It did not look like biscuit dough, but rather a spotty, lumpy yellow mush.) Drop over the fruit in tablespoonfuls and don't spread it. The baking will do that, 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven.

So this is my appeal. Andrea has proposed a grow-your-own-athon and invited her readers to cook something that uses homegrown ingredients and write about it before August 29th. She's given those of us with brown thumbs a loophole, too, saying that if we don't grow anything, we can get something from a friend. So now I have to find a friend out there who grows something. Not easy to do when we're all apartment-bound, but I have hopes that Kelly's growing some herbs or Terry still has a few figs. Anyone? Anyone in the area have something to offer? I've been getting stuff from the CSA every week, so I feel like an entry would embrace the spirit of the law if not the letter. But it is a fun challenge to try to track down something.

What happens to your zucchini muffins when you halve a recipe that calls for 3 eggs, but instead of 1 1/2 you use 2? Nothing too terrible, if you're lucky. I thought that extra half-egg might do something wonky to my muffins, but they turned out just fine, moist and fluffy. \"They\" always warn against messing with baking recipes, and I do believe that you do so at your own peril. But it can turn out just fine. I've also become a very cavalier flour measurer since finding out how varied the actual weight of flour can be when you use a volume (like a cup) measure. I figure, if there's variation built into the system, I can be less careful, not more. Does that make sense? These were made from this recipe over at 101 Cookbooks. She does some very funky things with hers, and I tried out one of them, the poppy seeds, with great success. The gentle crunch was at first a mystery, until I remembered I added them. I omitted the ginger, lemon peel and curry powder, so ended up with a zucchini-walnut-poppy seed muffin. (Oh, and clearly I used a 12-cup muffin tin instead of 2 loaf pans and halved the recipe.) I just love 101 Cookbooks because she makes it clear how much you can fiddle with a recipe. Now, the egg thing was a risk, but things like spices and add-ons like nuts or chocolate chips (which I have also used in this recipe) are fair game.

I do have a few things I want to write about, a great new (to me) restaurant, a defense of Eddie's ice cream, a couple of dessert recipes. But I have to get through the whole second season of Gray's Anatomy first. And keep up with an entry every weekday at the Woman's Day web site.

I've just finished reading a collection of essays about what we feed ourselves when there's no one around, Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant. I admit I devoured it once I got my hands on it; it's almost voyeuristic to read about these private dining moments (in front of the TV? At the kitchen or dining room table? With some reading material or the computer?) It's so stripped-down; I feel like you could extrapolate a lot about a person by how he or she eats when alone. For instance, Todd orders takeout or forgets to eat altogether if I'm not around to feed him. It's just not that important to him; he is far too passionate about other things to bother much with food. I, on the other hand, relish the free reign I have when the only one I have to please is myself. Every once and a while August is so exhausted, or so full from a big snack, that he takes his nap before we have a chance to eat lunch (we usually eat together). Then I make mushrooms or greens, combine Cheddar and apple butter, goat cheese and fig jam. A pumpkin muffin loaded with sunflower seeds, raisins and cream cheese. A baked egg sprinkled with fresh herbs. It's usually very easy to prepare, because that's one gift I give myself, rarely includes meat or fish, almost always has cheese and some kind of bread. Todd would never consider it a meal; I guess it's girly food. This picture is a perfect example. Sauteed beet greens on toast with thin slices of cheese broiled over the top. I usually do have a magazine, book or the computer to read. Lately I watch old episodes of The Office or Grey's Anatomy on iTunes. I'm curious. What do you do when you have no one to feed but yourself?

I got kind of depressed this week as I wrote my Dinner Diary entries. There's just not much there. I know we can't eat exciting food all the time, but now I feel some obligation to make things that someone might have one little inkling of desire to replicate. By the end of the week I gave up and ordered a pizza. Here's the rundown: Daddy Wins Noodle and Carrot Soup (with Chicken) An Ambivalent Fish Pasta Even My Husband Can Love Break Out the Takeout So now I'm trying to plan menus for next week and I'm experiencing performance anxiety. I guess also because I'm working in a vacuum, with little idea of who's reading and what they want. Well, on to Week 4. Wish me luck.

***CONTENT
I've been reading Andrea's Recipes for only a couple of months, but I find so much of interest on it that I'm already a fan. She's a mom of young ones, too, so I love to read those little hints about what life's like for her. She was recently part of kind of a backward meme; it's an \"interview,\" and if you read the meme on someone else's blog you can request that they \"interview\" you. So I asked her. And here's what she wanted to know: 1. You've been blogging for several years now. Have you ever had trouble finding your muse and what do you do to keep things fresh on your blog? The time I had the most trouble finding the impetus to write was when I was pregnant and terribly nauseated basically all the time. Then I had a baby, so I felt like I never cooked. But now that he eats what we eat, it's kind of brand new. I'm cooking a lot more now, but it's kind of mundane stuff. I feel challenged to not fall into a rut, to try to maintain some of my standards about how we eat. 2. How did you get started writing the Dinner Diary for Women's Day? I worked there as a copy editor for almost 5 years, and during that time I always gravitated toward the food department. My experience in the kitchen (which is not extensive, but is more than a lot of my Manhattan-living coworkers) helped me to mentally walk through the recipes, which I think made me better at that aspect of my job. So I've been doing a little freelance for them since I left to stay home with my son. The editor of the web site has been reading my personal blog all along, so she approached me with the idea of a daily dinner blog. It's still a little daunting. I feel like I have to edit what I make for dinner even more now. For example, I'd like to make a big pot of chicken soup with some leftover chicken tonight, but it's not really chicken soup weather. Do I do it anyway? I think I might, but there's more to the angst now than just serving my family hot soup on a hot day. 3. I think everyone has an emergency meal, that meal that you can whip on a busy weeknight knowing that you'll almost always have all the ingredients on hand. What's yours? Pasta with broccoli florets from the freezer (always Cascadian Farms; they're the right size and cook up just mushy enough for August to eat), good olive oil and grated Parmesan or locatelli. 4. Describe your favorite comfort food. Toast, but always with some kind of topping and some kind of cheese. So any variation on an open-faced grilled cheese; for example, today it was sauteed beet greens and Cheddar (because that's what I had on hand). Or, of course, ice cream. I'll only eat one serving at a time, but I'll keep a whole pint to myself and finish it in exactly four days. 5. Name three of your favorite restaurants. This is so pathetic, but things change when you have a kid, if you let them. Nick's Pizza in Forest Hills: charred, thin crust, fresh mozzarella, gruff familiarity that makes every regular feel special. Market Cafe near Port Authority: looks like a diner, but the food's a couple notches up. Cucumber slices in the water carafe they leave at your table, small dishes like one fat seared scallop on mashed potatoes, terrific (really) chocolate cake. I might have to stop there. No other places are quite so obvious to me as favorites. Oh, maybe Eddie's Ice Cream Shoppe. Maybe. So if you'd like me to send you some interview questions, send me an e-mail with your name and blog url.

While Todd's out of town, I hate to make a whole pot of coffee in the morning for myself. And one of the best things I picked up the last time I was at Whole Foods was a recipe for cold-brewed iced coffee. It takes 8 hours of sitting around, so plan ahead. But then you just have coffee in the fridge all the time. I ground 1/4 pound coffee in my little coffee grinder in a few batches, very course grind, then put it in a big bowl with a quart of cold, filtered water. Let it sit on the counter 8 to 12 hours, then strain through a coffee filter set in a strainer. Pretty potent stuff. I like mine half coffee, half milk, with a little bit of sugar.

I've started writing a DAILY blog for The Daily WD . So I'm going to be posting there every weekday at 4, and I'm going to need some good ideas. The blog will be pretty similar to this one, except it's almost exclusively what I've cooked for dinner the night before (or the weekend before) and I'll have to include more pictures (which for me, besides coming up with something to make for dinner every night, is going to be the hardest part). I hope you'll stop by.

I have my usual way of making oatmeal, but I never realized that it was the best way (for the Walkers, anyway). My husband likes my oatmeal although he kind of hates oatmeal in general. The way I discovered this is that I made our morning oatmeal a different way this morning and Todd could hardly hide his disgust; it was sticky, mushy stuff. My usual technique, which I picked up from Todd's aunt, results in pleasantly chewy oatmeal with firm, loose oats. You can taste the toastiness of them. And I just use regular (not 1-minute) Quaker Oats. You bring the water to a boil, add the oats (amounts according to the box), boil for 1 minute, then turn it off. Then you let it sit for about 5 minutes. I usually have to use a slotted spoon to remove the oats from a slight excess of cooking liquid (which is probably why they stay so firm; they haven't absorbed all the water), so I guess it's a little like cooking pasta (although not that much excess water is involved). Chopped walnuts add even more texture, and my son usually likes raisins in his. Maple syrup, honey or brown sugar.

When my son was born, I was going to keep him away from sweets. Then his first birthday hit, and he had to have cake. I was even kind of proud of the ginger way he nibbled at his first sweet, unsure whether he liked it. Then I decided if it was homemade, he could have some (especially if he helped me make it). Then we let him try salty licorice, and, incredibly, it was a hit. Then Altoids (I think we we so struck by the strong, bizarre flavors he was willing to eat that we couldn't deny it - it's hilarious to hear an almost-2 asking for salmiakki). Now it's the mints every time we get in the car, fruit snacks to get him to put his clothes on, jelly beans because Daddy's have a handful. It's a slippery slope, people. You've been warned. And he's got a little bit of a cold now, so he's striking. He won't eat anything BUT the aforementioned junk. In fact, he turned his little nose up at my banana-chocolate snack cakes, too. And I've tried ALL his usual favorites. Yesterday I made a quesadilla with diced ham, shredded Cheddar and broccoli florets. Nope. Onto the floor. I poached a couple of eggs in a herbes de provence-seasoned mixture of sauteed onions and diced tomatoes (it was really good, especially with some bread to soak up the juices).

When my son was born, I was going to keep him away from sweets. Then his first birthday hit, and he had to have cake. I was even kind of proud of the ginger way he nibbled at his first sweet, unsure whether he liked it. Then I decided if it was homemade, he could have some (especially if he helped me make it). Then we let him try salty licorice, and, incredibly, it was a hit. Then Altoids (I think we we so struck by the strong, bizarre flavors he was willing to eat that we couldn't deny it - it's hilarious to hear an almost-2 asking for salmiakki). Now it's the mints every time we get in the car, fruit snacks to get him to put his clothes on, jelly beans because Daddy's have a handful. It's a slippery slope, people. You've been warned. And he's got a little bit of a cold now, so he's striking. He won't eat anything BUT the aforementioned junk. In fact, he turned his little nose up at my banana-chocolate snack cakes, too. And I've tried ALL his usual favorites. Yesterday I made a quesadilla with diced ham, shredded Cheddar and broccoli florets. Nope. Onto the floor. I poached a couple of eggs in a herbes de provence-seasoned mixture of sauteed onions and diced tomatoes (it was really good, especially with some bread to soak up the juices). He took some bites of the eggs, then the tomatoes, when I spoon-fed it to him. But before that he cried. Today we ordered doughy, not-very-good (but he loves them) vegetable dumplings. He made me scrape the vegetables out and ate the doughy wrapper. Turkey meatballs. \"I don't like it.\" Almond butter sandwich. \"What's that funny stuff?\" (the crust).

Roasted Tomatoes and Pesto Croutons

***CONTENT
You would expect Nancy Silverton, of the La Brea Bakery, to know what to do with day-old bread. And the pesto croutons that accompany the Roasted Tomato and Red Pepper Soup I assembled today were the best part. To make them, you're supposed to tear, not cut, 1-inch pieces from the center, not the crust, of a round loaf of sourdough, then toss them in olive oil and bake for 30 minutes in a 350 degree oven (shaking them occasionally). Then you drizzle a mixture of equal parts pesto and olive oil over them and toss. August got to them before lunch today and I couldn't keep him out of the bowl. I think I undercooked them, so they had all these crispy little edges but were still kind of soft in the center, and the pesto flavor was refreshing, not that salty, fake flavor that boxed croutons often have. Not to say the other component of the recipe, roasted tomatoes, weren't good; they just didn't make it into the soup. You toss halved grape tomatoes with olive oil, a tiny pinch of sugar and some salt then broil them for about 7 minutes. The sweet, intense little bites of tomato were good on our tacos of chicken thighs with yucatan spices, in our pasta salad with chickpeas and vinaigrette, and in our cheese quesadillas. Frankly, the red pepper soup (a carton) I bought was pretty sweet, and I can't imagine the sweet, sweet tomatoes offering the foil the soup needed. The pesto was a nice contrast; maybe some swirled in would be good. The cookbook this comes from, A Twist of the Wrist, makes me giddy, though. Of course, the success of all these recipes, which rely on opening cans, jars, boxes and bottles, depend on the quality of the purchased prepackaged ingredients. That's why she offers so many brand suggestions throughout the book. What she's doing really reminds me of some of the simplest tapas, which involve some good-quality ingredient simply drizzled with oil or fried up and skewered.

We're 10 minutes away from the arrival of some friends, and August says, \"Want pumpkin muffins.\" These were so easy to make a few days ago, and August and I had such a nice time making them, that I almost said, \"OK, let's go make more.\" But then I pictured our friends arriving to find us covered in flour, egg all over the counter, the boy's mouth rimmed with the sugar he sneaked, and I said no. But during his nap I found 10 minutes to mix this up, so now we'll have an out-of-season snack this afternoon. I think I decided to make pumpkin muffins in the middle of spring because I had a tub of cream cheese in the fridge and these muffins are an awesome cream-cheese-carrier. For 12 muffins, you mix 2/3 cup sugar, 1 egg, 3 tablespoons each water and oil, and 1/2 cup pumpkin. In another bowl, 1 cup flour (I do 2/3 white and 1/3 wheat), 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon each baking soda, cinnamon and salt, 1/8 teaspoon each ground cloves and nutmeg. Once I have them in the paper baking cups I top them with some walnuts (chopped or halves). Bake in 400 degree oven about 13 minutes.

I'm always just on the verge of not ordering from Fresh Direct any more (the packaging alone could get me kicked out of the food co-op), then I try something I really like that I can't get anywhere else. Unless I go to Rosa Mexicano, in this instance. FD has just introduced a line of heat-and-eat and ready-to-cook dishes, and I signed up for the chicken thighs with Yucatan spices. I broiled the heck out of these (because I'm paranoid about undercooked poultry and 2-year-olds) and they were still moist. Not spicy-hot, but richly spiced with that hint of (is it sweetness?) cinnamon (cloves? allspice?). We ate them with rice last night, then I shredded the remainder for tacos tonight. I broiled some halved grape tomatoes that I had tossed with oil, salt and pepper, shredded some cheese and lettuce, and warmed some flour tortillas. Not authentic, but very much the kind of meal that makes all three of us happy.

I really didn't think this would coalesce into anything: a good balsamic from O & Co, yogurt cheese made from a grocery-brand yogurt, cracked black pepper and OK, big, red strawberries. I cut up the strawberries, tossed them with some sugar and let them sit, then I topped it with a dollop of yogurt that I had strained overnight so that it thickened, drizzled the vinegar over that and added some black pepper. Now I'm not entirely sure the pepper added anything, but this was much better than the sum of its parts. The juice from those so-so berries, the sugar and that sweet, thick balsamic would be good on anything. Imagine if I had some good fruit. And the yogurt cheese, which was my contribution to a Bittman recipe, added its creamy, mellow tanginess and enough substance to make it a substantial snack or a light, light meal. Except for the sugar, this was pretty healthy, too.

It feeds my soul. It's my favorite part of the day. August and I are morning people (and Todd indulges us), so we sit around the table, eating, chatting. August stands on his chair and tells us stories, and so he paces all of us. It's the only time consistently we are all together as a family, and it's the fantasy I have when I think about what my perfect life would be. Usually breakfast is cereal or oatmeal, or sometimes toasted bread or English muffins. This morning, because Todd's been complaining about the usual routine, I made scrambled eggs. I'm in the fluffy curds camp, not the flat, one-piece omelet-type camp, so I add a little water to the mixed-up eggs, maybe with some grated cheese or fresh herbs and definitely salt and pepper. Then I stir them in the skillet until they're almost cooked, and I turn off the heat toward the end so the carry-over heat can finish them off. I guess the fact that breakfast such a brief moment in our daily lives is what makes the time we spend together at holidays, vacations, even weekends feel special. All of August's grandparents live a plane-ride away, and every once in a while I can be philosophical about it. August appreciates the time he has with them so much because they're not around all the time. I can't say whether it's more than if they were here every day, since that arrangement is just a dream for me, but I do think that every day grandma and grandpa are around is a holiday.

I did pick up one of their award-winning chocolate cupcakes and the best reason to pop by for a quick chocolate fix: the mini miso choko cake. The size of a mini muffin, these little cakes have sunken centers and a moist, fudgy texture. At $2 it's a perfect sweet bite. The cupcake was good, too, with a crunchy outside and a moist, tender crumb.

Easter Dinner

***CONTENT
Today I used my two best go-to books to prepare a traditional Walker family Easter dinner, which is remarkably like the family dinner of my own childhood, only without the scallop potatoes from the box. My scalloped potatoes came from Julia Childs' Julia's Kitchen Wisdom, and they were the most successful scalloped potatoes I have ever made. It shocked the heck out of me since all that's in them is 1 percent milk, salt, pepper, butter, a bit of thyme, a bit of smeared garlic clove and some potatoes (I think it's key to use \"boiling\" potatoes). So easy, crisp on top and creamy underneath. Good flavor, too. I smashed the garlic clove and then rubbed the bottom and sides of my casserole dish with it. Julia calls for peeled potatoes sliced 1/4 inch thick, but I was having a hard time peeling them because they had pretty thin skins, so I skipped the peeling part. I made two layers of overlapping slices in the dish, then sprinkled fresh thyme leaves on top (my own touch). Heated a cup of milk, then stirred in a lot of salt and pepper (maybe a couple teaspoons of salt and one of pepper?). Poured that over the potatoes, then put the casserole over a high flame on my stovetop and brought the milk to a boil. Dotted the top with cut-up butter, then baked it for 25 minutes in a 425 degree oven, until the potatoes were pretty tender and the top was brown and bubbly. We also had ham; my other go-to cookbook is Bittman's How to Cook Everything and he recommends a glaze of heated apricot jam and mustard and a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes per pound of ham. (Since my potatoes baked at 425, that's the temp at which I finished up my ham, to fine results.) I also steamed asparagus in the microwave, and discovered through Bittman the revelation of peeling thick stalks before cooking. These were wonderfully sweet and tender, and I'll never eat thick, bitter, tough asparagus skins again (the thin ones, however, can keep their skins).

I just opened up a can of olive oil that Todd's parents brought from Spain and this is the first thing I made with it. This cake is super-easy, not too sweet and kind of sophisticated. I almost threw a little fresh thyme in the batter; I think some kind of herb would make it even more of a grown-up dessert (not to say that my kid didn't like it). I found the recipe on Simply Recipes (she got it from Everyday Food). I did not add the sugar topping. August helped me make it and we had a really good time cracking eggs and stirring it up. No yelling this time. First you whisk 1/2 cup olive oil with 2 eggs, 1/2 cup orange juice and a cup of sugar. Mix in 1 1/4 cups flour, 1/2 cup cornmeal, 2 teaspoons baking powder, 1 teaspoon salt and the zest of 1 orange. I baked it in a greased 8-inch springform pan (just because that's the only pan of that size I have) in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes. I had checked it after 40, and it sunk in the middle at that point (I think because I took it out of the oven to test it). I actually liked the sunk-in part the best, because it was a little more dense, but the whole cake was good, crunchy but moist, subtly flavored with the oil and orange.

Unfortunately, it's not in my neighborhood. It's a couple blocks south of Port Authority, on 9th Avenue. Near Todd's office. Every aspect of a meal at Market Cafe is right on, with little touches that make it kind of wonderful. It's kind of a diner-looking place inside, with small, cramped tables. They give you a carafe of water with a long, thin slice of cucumber. The menu is divided into small and large dishes, but they're all significant enough to make a meal. Last night there I had 3 fat seared scallops covered with a tangle of mache and perched atop mashed potatoes in a deep bowl. Todd's fries were crispy and nicely seasoned. The best part, though, was the lemon pound cake topped with a compote made from tiny blueberries and fresh ginger (I could see the ginger hairs throughout). It was not at all liquidy, and the sharp bite of the ginger kind of echoed the lemon of the cake, which was actually a wedge of a two-layer round cake with a layer of lemon cream, not a slice of loaf cake. I love the enormous slice of chocolate layer cake they have at Market Cafe, too.

It didn't sound good to me. Jean-Georges Vongerichten and quick-fix food didn't seem like a realistic combination. But I was trying to get my mind off something else, so I clicked over to it. I don't know if I'm on a hormone ride or what, but what I found made me kind of giddy. I think I actually giggled when I thought about making one of Vongerichten's Ovaltine or green tea popsicles or apple confit.

I thought I had a great idea: Turn the pecan-raisin rolls that were getting a little dry into a breakfast bread-pudding type casserole. But I tried to fudge the recipe and I ended up with something that wasn't pretty, with curdled-looking custard and bread that was mushy in some place and completely crusty in others. It was just that the bread didn't absorb enough of the custard; it sat all night in the fridge, so I can't help but think the bread was just too dense and maybe not dried out enough. Also, I think scrambling the eggs a bit before you mix them in with the milk, which maybe should have been something higher fat than 1 percent. The flavor was good, with just a couple teaspoons of brown sugar and a dash of cinnamon. We ate some of it. So I may try it again with a few tweaks, and maybe I'll have something.

New American - Good Old Chocolate Chip

Grab a glass of milk for this one. I always had a sense that chocolate chip cookies of a certain type were all the same. But the chocolate chip cookies August and I just made, from New American Cooking cookbook, were just over-the-top rich. Insanely, overwhelming rich. Making it possible for me to stop at one. Wise, even. Todd said he thought it might be the best chocolate chip cookie ever. I've tried many, many chocolate chip cookie recipes, and I always fall in love with them. (Clearly not enough to be faithful, but still.) And I have rarely enjoyed a purchased chocolate chip cookie as much as the ones I make myself, regardless of the recipe I use. I do prefer the soft, chewy variety, with a good edge of salt and a reasonable amount of chocolate chips. I made a half-recipe, 12 big cookies: Cream 1/2 cup softened butter with 6 tablespoons each white and brown sugar (other recipes I've used use all brown, and these were lighter in color and flavor), then add one egg and 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla. Mix in 1 1/4 cup flour, then a generous 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and a generous 1/4 teaspoon salt. I stirred in 6 ounces of chopped chocolate from an 8-ounce bar of Nestle Chocolatier chocolate (they had sent coupons for free samples, but I couldn't find the higher percentage, only the 53%, in our grocery store). I liked the big chunks, which when warm were smooth and rich pockets of melty chocolate. Yum. I used a 1/4 cup measuring cup, scantly filled, to measure out the cookies, then baked them in a 350 degree oven for 18 minutes. A side note for the grandmas: August loves to taste, so I'm wary of letting him help with the dough after the egg's been added. This time he tasted the sugar-butter mixture, then I gave him the spatula I had used for that and instructed him that was his and the dough would now be off-limits, because of the egg. It worked. When I was chopping the chocolate, he was eating almost to keep up with me, so I had to move away from him to finish the chopping. I left a few chunks behind, accidentally, and he, as though he was mimicking me, said, \"You can have those little pieces on the table, August.\"

August and I both had a thoroughly enjoyable time making pizza together tonight. It's the perfect project for a 2-year-old: the tactile dough, the spreading, the sprinkling, the tasting of everything (since everything but the dough has already been cooked). He loves pizza, so he'll even eat vegetables on it. He spent a lot of the assembling time picking the larger pieces of tomato out of the sauce and eating them. I use a frozen pizza dough, and we just patted and poked the dough into shape right on the pan we baked it on. Spread on sauce, sprinkle on cheese, put on toppings, then add more cheese and grate some Romano. Bake on a lower rack, 450 degrees or so, 15 minutes or so. Slice. Eat.

My friend and I took a trip to Soho and the West Village this weekend, and we swung wide on our walk so we could visit Jacques Torres's chocolate shop on Hudson street. She was disappointed it wasn't more sophisticated; I was disappointed that I hadn't brought August along. This would be a perfect destination for a little kid with a sweet tooth. You can see a large chocolate-making operation going on around the perimeter of the retail shop; on Saturday bunnies, chickens and sheep were in the works, some the size of a mid-sized dog. There's a lot of floor space, a coffee-bar type counter, and even a kiddie table. Torres's offers some whimsical, kid-friendly chocolates, too, like chocolate-covered Cheerios, cornflakes and graham crackers, hot chocolate and chocolate lollipops. But I just think August would be tickled to see the works.

This soup is not really sweet, but the two main vegetables are parsnips and carrots, which did lend a vegetable sweetness that I found pleasant. Once the pasta soaked up a good portion of the broth, August and I were enjoying slick, soupy egg noodles dotted with pieces of chicken and veggies. This afternoon I'm adding rice to the rest of the soup base for a little variety. It's not a real chicken soup recipe, because I don't start with a carcas. I started with one small finely diced onion, and sauteed it in oil until soft. Then I added a minced garlic clove, stirred it a little bit, then added 6 cups water and a heaping tablespoon of Better Than Bouillon. About 10 sliced baby carrots and 2 parsnips cut lengthwise in half and then in half-moons. The dark meat from a rotisserie chicken. Let that simmer for a while, about 30 minutes, then tasted it and added salt and pepper. At this point I put a lot of it into storage containers and refrigerated it, then added a couple handfuls of noodles to the rest. I found the broth got very concentrated, so I ended up adding water to taste. That stretches the soup even further.

Saturday was Todd's birthday, and I really wanted to come up with something that would make him pleased. August has decided that cupcakes and birthdays go hand in hand (every time we have cake we have to sing the birthday song), so I knew we needed some. And Todd likes toffee, so these cupcakes, from 125 Best Cupcake Recipes, were perfect. They're made with brown sugar and buttermilk and have pieces of chocolate with toffee bits throughout. Fortunately the cake's not too sweet; the toffee bits melt a bit for a burst of toasty, buttery sweetness. They're super-tender with a fine crumb, maybe from the buttermilk, and epitomize \"cupcake\" vs. \"muffin.\" Mix 1 cup flour with 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and a pinch of salt. Then beat 3/4 cup packed brown sugar and 1/4 cup softened butter until well combined. Add 2 egg whites, 1 at a time, then alternately add the flour mixture (3 additions) and 2/3 cup buttermilk (2 additions). When it's smooth, mix in 2/3 cup toffee bits (I used a Lindt milk chocolate bar with toffee bits that I had chopped up). Bake in a 12-cup muffin tin in paper liners in a preheated 350 degree oven 20 to 25 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes. I made a whipped chocolate ganache for the frosting, but it was so intense that I prefered the cupcakes without. This would be good for a plain vanilla, though. It's from Baking Illustrated. Heat 1/2 cup heavy cream to boiling, then pour over 4 ounces chopped chocolate or chocolate chips (I used Nestle Chocolatier and found the chocolate really benefitted from the richness of the cream) and stir until melted. Chill in fridge for 45 minutes, no more or less, then whip until fluffy. Frost right away, because if you re-refrigerate you end up with chocolate truffle filling. (Not a bad thing, but not what you're going for.)

I have actually had some requests for this strata recipe, so I better get on the ball with it. I skipped some steps because I threw it together while watching the Oscars, and since I don't have a TV in my kitchen that meant running into the kitchen during breaks to get done what I could. Still, it was easy to make, and no one missed the things I left out. You need 8 cups of 1-inch bread cubes. The recipe I was using said 1/2 pound, but my 1/2 pound Italian loaf was no where near enough, and this is kind of horrifying: all I had besides sandwich loaf was a whole wheat bagel, so that's what I used to supplement my bread. No one noticed. I scattered half of the cubes in my 9 x 13-inch pan (you could use a deeper 3-quart casserole dish and make 3 layers instead of 2). Then I scattered over it half of a 10-oz box of frozen spinach that I had thawed and squeezed dry (the recipe I used directed me to saute an onion, then add the spinach, salt, pepper and nutmeg - I skipped this step and added the seasonings to the custard). Then I sprinkled 1 cup grated gruyere and 1/2 cup parmesan over the bread and spinach. Repeat bread, spinach and cheese layers. Mix together 2 3/4 cup milk, 9 eggs, a teaspoon of Dijon mustard and some salt, pepper and nutmeg, then pour it over the bread. Cover and refrigerate overnight (up to 24 hours). In the morning, take the strata out of the fridge to let it come to room temperature, about 30 minutes, then bake in a 350 degree oven for around 50 minutes. Let sit for a few minutes, the cut and serve.

I was so sure I was going to love this that I started composing this entry in my head before I had even scooped the yogurt into my cup. And I think the level of my expectations may have sabatoged the experiment. This is good, it's a natural, and I like it. Not really sweet enough to compete with a good honey-yogurt combo, not rich enough to make me swoon (my fault for choosing the nonfat instead of the full-fat yogurt, which were my only two options). This was the first time I opened up the June Taylor fig, port and lemon thyme conserve, and it's . . . interesting. Every flavor is there, so it's kind of a complex taste. I almost think the stuff would be good with some roasted pork, chicken, maybe even lamb. It's not really sweet enough to definitely be dessert. Or a good cheese accompaniment--I almost think something nutty and sharp would be good with it--you know, like the quince paste and manchego combo. I think gorgonzola or goat cheese are common fig partners. Oooh, I like the cheese idea . . . and there they go again, those expectations, higher, higher, higher.

Every once in a while I get on a meal-planning kick. I figure out what I'm going to make each day for lunch and dinner and then buy all the groceries at once. Often I fizzle out on my plans before I reach the end of the week and have a bunch of food left over that taunts me with its impending bad-ness. Or the grocery store (or delivery service) throws a wrench in the works by not having something in stock or sending me the wrong thing. Or I make too much of one thing and don't have a chance to eat leftovers because I have all these plans for other meals. You just have to be really flexible and ready to adapt and eventually it just seems like too much effort. When the weather's nice I don't mind shopping every day and just making meals on the fly. But with slushy snow on the ground and a stroller that doesn't always fit into the six-inch-wide paths of cleared sidewalk, I'm trying again. First I got messed up because Fresh Direct sent me parsnips instead of tomatillos for my chili. Can you imagine a turkey-parsnip chili? (Hmmm. Maybe I should've tried that one out.) I just used the canned tomatoes I was going to use for the fennel tomato soup. So now I have 4 parsnips and a whole bunch of fennel that I don't know what to do with. I did make a pork tenderloin, broccoli and mashed potatoes. The pork went into tacos the next night, the broccoli will go into homemade calzones tomorrow, and I'm starting to think the potatoes would be good in a parsnip soup. On top of all that, last night during the breaks in the Oscars I assembled a strata for some brunch guests I was expecting today. It sits in the refrigerator all night, bread soaking up custard, then bakes in the morning, until it's this beautiful, golden, puffy thing. But only one person would brave the weather, so now I have a big pan of the stuff and a son and husband unwilling to eat it. Maybe I'll post the recipe later. It was good.

Sorry to do this here. It has nothing to do with what I'm cooking. But I just finished watching the new episode of The Office, and I'm struggling to find the word for the emotion the show often leaves me with. I'm not good at talking about TV or movies. I tend to watch Grey's Anatomy after The Office is over, and I think the differences between the two magnify the quality of The Office. GA is huge, melodramatic, with grand romances, big emergencies, fast talking, rousing monologues. I think the titular character, Meredith Grey, has almost died 3 or 4 times in the one season I've watched. But Office does more with less. It's mundane, everyday, banal, but the nuances of the characters' words and actions are honest, maybe because their experiences are more like our everyday experiences. And the character who reveals the most and who draws the most out of his coworkers is the one I hated in the beginng, the boss, Michael. He makes me squirm with embarrassment every single episode, but then he responds with unfeigned shocked anger and sorrow at an employee's lack of faith in the business, or genuinely admires Pam's awkward attempts at painting, and for me he redeems all of humanity. I'm done, I think. Just so glad to find something that can move me without making me feel like I've been manipulated. Do I belittle what The Office is trying to do by saying it moves me? I'm not sure that's the goal of the British version, at least. Hmm. On related note, I've found that I have a lot less tolerance for violence, grief, pain in TV shows or movies since my son was born. I don't mean it makes me mad. It makes me feel sick and tense, even if it's Hollywood over-the-top. More than ever before. Huh.

I was on a roll last week, cooking up a storm. I wanted to be seasonal and soothing and make something Todd likes. This cauliflower, from All About Braising, was earthy and nutty and so essentially cauliflowery, with just the right hint of cabbage-ness. I tossed it with pasta and grated cheese over the top. You start by sauteeing 1 1/2-inch florets in 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon olive oil until they're \"speckled all over with nice bits of brown,\" about 8 minutes. Then you put in a couple tablespoons of rinsed capers and cook a bit more. Next, 1/2 cup water (the recipe calls for stock), salt and pepper, then simmer covered about 15 to 20 minutes, until the cauliflower is tender. If you're going to eat it as a side, you boil away the liquid, then add lemon and toasted breadcrumbs. I didn't boil down the liquid, but added some cooked penne, the breadcrumbs and some parmesan. As a side note for those of you who are not squeamish, it breaks my heart when I finally coax August into putting something new and delicious into his mouth and, instead of squealing, \"More! More!\" he thrusts the chewed-up once-lovely food out of his wide-open mouth. Usually he aims for the plate, and I can't decide whether that's better or worse than his other options.

Not that I have anything against Jacques Torres*, but I find myself completely unable to haul myself, my 2-year-old, and the stroller into his store to try these chocolate-covered Cheerios that I keep reading so much about. But then August sees the picture of them in New York magazine and starts squealing. Out come the chocolate chips, a quick zap in the microwave, a couple of fistfuls of Cheerios stirred in and we had it. The tedious part is fishing them out of the melted chocolate, which I did with a skewer while the boy stuffed 1 in his chocolate-smeared mouth for every 2 I laid out on my silpat. It is kind of tricky to melt chocolate in the microwave; I did it for 2 minutes on 50 percent power. The trick is to take them out far before they look finished, while they're still whole; those chips hold a lot of heat, which finishes the job. But what a genius idea. They are remarkable. And I'm sure Torres' are even better, made as they are by a master chocolatier. *Actually, I kind of do, but it's a small, personal thing; I was writing a short, short piece on fondue and wanted to get a recipe from him, but his people made so many demands about wording and about touting Torres' own chocolate that I couldn't use it - there simply wasn't enough room for all that verbiage and the recipe. Chocolate Bar was much more accommodating.

My 2-year-old and I have been staying indoors in the afternoons, so I've made an effort to include him in our dinner preparation. That included using a food mill to puree a split pea soup I cooked up from a recipe I got on Fresh Direct's web site. It doesn't have any meat in it (it does have stock), and a russet potato makes it so thick that I've added about 1/4 cup water to each serving when reheating. It's still silky smooth with a mild, but not bland, flavor. August likes his more soupy, so I just added more water to his. The recipe directs you to bring 4 cups beef broth (I used chicken-it's what I always have) to a boil, then add 1 1/2 cup split peas and 2 medium potatoes (I used 1 because mine was a russet and seemed big), diced into 1/2-inch pieces. Then, while that's boiling, you saute a diced onion in 4 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons olive oil. Add 1/4 teaspoon fennel seeds, then cook until onion is soft and beginning to brown. Set aside until peas and potatoes are soft, about 45 minutes, then add onion mixture and puree. Put back in pot, then add a medium diced carrot and more stock to thin the mixture; simmer until the carrots are soft, about 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste. The recipe includes a topping of finely minced red onion, parsley and lemon juice, which sounded good to me but not to my cautious eaters, so I didn't bother. Let me know if you try it. The recipe's here.

If you know any dutiful churchgoers, you've probably at least heard of that experience when they (or you) walk into church, sit down, and hear a sermon that speaks exactly to some struggle they (or you) are having. And so it goes with me today with that not-really-a-religion-but-feels-like-it-sometimes, food: I'm laying on the sofa at 6:30 this morning thinking that I really don't want to eat any of the usual suspects for breakfast. I want something savory, but not eggs. Something warm and satisfying. \"What if I make grits with lots of butter and cheese?\" Silence. So I'm not going to do it; I'm not hauling myself up to prepare food that my son and husband won't eat. Did I mention it's 6:30? Then later, thank you, the Times suggests the very thing. It doesn't make my family any more willing to eat it, but it gives me a little vindication in the face of their disdain. And maybe tomorrow morning I'll make them go hungry as a sunny-colored bowl of grits slowly cools in front of them.

I got a big, beautiful pottery cookie jar for my birthday, so August and I were both anxious to get something in it. Because I've been trying to cut back on the sweets, I chose cornmeal-almond biscotti from the Once Upon a Tart cookbook. I'm kind of reluctant to call them biscotti, though. The cornmeal made them more sandy than usual biscotti. Not unpleasant. Just different. I added poppyseeds because I didn't hae the chopped almonds, so that added to that coarse-grained crunchiness. The recipe was funny. It seemed pretty clear to me, from measurements like 1 tablespoon plus 1 1/2 teaspoons, that the recipe was increased by 50 percent. So I made 20 cookies, which was 2/3 of the recipe. It was easy to split that way: I creamed 8 tablespoons butter with 1 cup sugar, then beat in 2 eggs, one at a time, and 1 tablespoon almond extract. In a separate bowl, I mixed 2 cups flour with 1/2 cup cornmeal, 2 tablespoons poppyseeds, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder (the only measurement that didn't break down too well by 2/3; it should be 1 1/3 teaspoon, but who has 1/3 teaspoon measuring spoon?) and a pinch of salt. Stir the dry into the wet, then, using floured hands, form into a 4-inch-circumference log. I did it on my silpat, then brushed off the excess flour before baking it in a 350 oven for 40 minutes. Let it cool completely, then cut into 20 slices. Lay biscotti on their cut sides and bake for another 30 minutes.

You know, Todd and I often resorted to this traditional \"peasant food\" back when we were both on starter salaries, and I have forgotten how much he loves it. It's really a soul-satisfying soup, especially when you have thick gruyere toasts soaking up about half a bowlful. August follows in his dad's footsteps, upending the bowl into his mouth when the spoon proved inefficient. It took a bit of convincing that the soggy bread in his bowl was cheese \"toast,\" but soon he figured out that it tasted much better, and was easier to eat, than the crispy stuff. Start with a couple of tablespoons of butter and 2 thinly sliced onions (I used 1 yellow, 1 vidalia, but I don't know if that makes a difference). Saute the onions over medium heat along with a chopped garlic clove, a bay leaf, a sprinkling of dried thyme (the recipe called for fresh, but I didn't have it), salt and pepper for almost half an hour, until the onions are soft and brown. Add 1/2 cup of wine and let it cook until it's gone. Then stir in a generous tablespoon of flour and cook on lowered heat for about 10 minutes to brown, but not burn, the flour. Add 4 cups stock (I used chicken, but the recipe calls for beef and I'm sure it would've made a lovelier-colored soup and maybe a better flavor - but this is peasant food, so I say use what you have). Simmer that for 10 minutes, then top with toasts (sliced baguette topped with shredded gruyere and popped in the toaster oven). The toasts get soggy so you can eat them with a spoon. Yum.

We swung by City Bakery today for the Banana Peel hot chocolate. I had never had their hot chocolate, although I tried the frozen hot chocolate a couple summers ago. This was thick stuff, and really rich. I didn't make it through. I actually find the creaminess of the drink a distraction from the chocolate; especially with the banana flavor I think it needed more of an edge, some bitterness or acidity from the chocolate. I think I like my hot chocolate made partially with water, or lowfat milk, so the chocolate flavor can shine. That said, City Bakery offers a lot of flavors this year that might be a good foil for the richness of the basic chocolate: bourbon, lemon, ginger. Beer even seems like it might be a good idea now that I know what I'm dealing with. Another word: share. It's decadent and yummy, but has the potential to give you a stomachache.

August and I shared a salmon fillet one night while Todd was in London, then the next day I made a salmon salad out of the leftovers. I just flaked up the fish, then mixed it with mayo, peas and capers. Ate it in a pita. It was so satisfying, so domestic. It made me feel like I was home. I am weirdly obsessed with comfort foods lately, but it's not the typical comfort food. It's what I ate growing up. Mayo-based tuna salad. Chicken soup. Hot dogs. For four days now, I've been pursuing this elusive warm, yummy glow that I felt was just beyond my reach. Then tonight I sat down with my son and my husband for August's first fish sticks, served with baked fries from the freezer and microwaved veggies. And there it was. It didn't have anything to do with good cooking, or even, in this case, homemade food. No chocolate was involved, or lemon zest, or balsamic vinegar. The only salt that made it sparkle wasn't fleur de sel, but regular kosher that my 2-year-old had sprinkled too liberally over the cauliflower, carrots and broccoli.

Unless, of course, you burn it. And use too high of an oil-honey to oats-nuts ratio. I ended up with something resembling oatmeal brittle, and I tried this morning to convince myself that the toasty, bitter burnt sugar flavor I ended up with would be the new taste sensation in granola. Only got a couple bites down before I felt too sick to continue. It makes me even more sick to throw out all this granola. Really, literally, I am going to have to make Todd do it. I will try again. August had fun with it, plus I decided to use diced dried pears, and I think it'll be a really great granola. Far better than burnt-sugar oatmeal brittle granola. You know, I wrote this yesterday, then last night I found myself dipping into my failed granola again. Its bitterness is powerful and the sweetness is kind of over-the-top, but I feel like there has to be a place for it somewhere. An embellishment to ice cream or rice pudding? A little could go a long way. And the crunch of burned sugar is a nice contrast to the chewiness of the oatmeal.

I made these muffins again and this time I said, \"What was I thinking?\" They were chewy, kind of rubbery, flat and light brown. I was trying to figure out how to redeem them, maybe toast them and then spread on some butter . . . wait . . . butter? Then I realized I forgot to drizzle in 1/4 cup melted butter before putting them in the muffin tin. Wow. Now I'm amazed they are as good as they are. They really do have the texture of a low-fat muffin.

Last night I made very good polenta with the best hands-off method: low and slow, in the oven, from the recipe in The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen by Paula Wolfert. I thought it was awesome, creamy and buttery and corny. August, who's a little under the weather, declared he didn't like it before he even put a spoonful in his mouth. After tons of cajoling, and finally calling it cornmeal, he did try it and said it was good. I guess to some polenta sounds more sophisticated than cornmeal porridge, but not to my 2-year-old. He helped me make it, so that helped in getting him to try it: We buttered a casserole dish, then put in 1 cup cornmeal, 4 cups water, 1 tablespoon cut-up butter and 1 teaspoon salt. Stirring it with a fork didn't mix it all, but it did get the lumps out of the cornmeal. Then we put it in a 350 degree oven for an hour and 20 minutes. During the latter half of this time the mixture comes together, and it starts to bubble a bit. I got a little nervous that it would splatter all over the inside of the oven. It didn't, but when I make this again I'm using a container that's a little bigger than it needs to be. Took the polenta out of the oven, stirred it and added more salt, then baked it for another 10 minutes. I stirred Parmesan and more butter into the finished product, about 1/2 cup of the cheese and another tablespoon of butter. Ate it with an eggplant and tomato casserole I poached from the Wednesday Chef, who poached it from Marian Burrows in the NYT, who poached it from Jamie Oliver.

My mother came from the north of Italy and polenta was part of their staple diet. As a result she hated it as she had so much of it. Consequently I have always thought of it in the same way so haven't eaten much of it. But this recipe sounds like it might be worth trying. I love parmesan so I think I will like this one.

I put this cookbook on my Amazon wish list a looong time ago, so I had completely forgotten about it. When I opened it up on Christmas morning, I started praising the giver for making such an appropriate selection when she cut me short by pointing out that I had picked it out for myself. Who said, \"Know thyself?\" Wasn't it in one of Shakespeare's satirical monologues? Anyway, it was an excellent selection, and I've made two things from it in the last week that I would definitely make again. One was pasta with ricotta and peas, and the other was chicken thighs braised in tomatoes. When I think about it, I modified both recipes, but the original recipes did have some unusual techniques that gave me good results. You start the pasta the usual way, boiling a huge amount of water and cooking the pasta; I used orecchiette. (Although who decided that a pound of pasta feeds 4 people? Maybe over the course of a week.) While that's working, you mix 1 cup ricotta with 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons cut-up butter, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper in a bowl large enough to hold the finished pasta. Then you saute some onions and garlic. We were feeding vegetarians, so I left out the pancetta or whatever it was that you're supposed to render first, and just used olive oil. 1 medium onion, diced, then a couple of minced garlic cloves go in after the onion is translucent. Cook that a minute or two, then pour the onion mixture in with the cheese. When the pasta's basically done, maybe a little too al dente, add a couple cups of frozen peas to the boiling water. Heat until the pasta's done, then scoop out a cup of the water and whisk half of it into the cheese with 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice. Drain pasta, then mix with the cheese, adding more pasta water if needed.

I have a perfectly good technique for making quesadillas. In fact, my quesadillas are crispy and gooey in just the right proportion and very versatile. I just toast them up in a dry skillet, for a couple of minutes on each side. If I'm really lazy or August is so hungry he's cranky, I'll microwave them for 30 seconds, but that is only a passable job. So why did I follow a recipe in a magazine that recommended broiling them? Hidden away in the oven, they ended up burned after a couple of minutes, and very unevenly so, without the cheese melting much at all. And mozzarella? Not an ideal cheese for quesadillas. If broiling works for you, go for it. I just often try a new technique just for the sake of doing something new, even if I have a tried-and-true way already.

A Baker's Field Guide to Christmas Cookies

I don't blame this cookbook for the troubles I had getting my cookie press to work. (Any tips? I still have half a batch of dough in the fridge, but I can't bring myself to fiddle with the press again.) And I love the format of the pages, the lie-flat binding, the scope (everything from German springerle to peanut butter blossoms, an important tradition in my parents' house). There are field notes, which discuss the history of the cookie, and lots of variation suggestions, called \"related species.\" Everything about this book entices you to open it up, pick out a couple (there are icons that indicate which recipes are good for freezing, baking with kids, mailing) and start baking. One of my friends even went through it while she was at my house and told me which ones she needed me to make for her. To make the dough for the spritz cookies, mix 12 1/2 ounces flour with 1/4 teaspoon salt. Then cream 1 cup softened butter with a mixer. Add 1/2 cup granulated and 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar, then mix until fluffy. Beat in 1 teaspoon each almond and vanilla extract and 1 large egg. Then gradually, on low speed, mix in the flour. I found I needed to chill the dough for about 15 minutes before the cookie press would work, which was a suggestion in my press instructions, not in the book (the cookbook kind of glosses over the cookie press usage, just saying follow the press instructions. Loaded up the press, held it flat on a silpat-lined cookie sheet, clicked the handle twice, then pulled the press up. First batch worked fine, but with the second batch I had to pry the cookie from the bottom of the press. Bake in 375 degree oven for about 10 minutes.

I'm a sucker for jams, so I always end up with about 5 open in my refrigerator and another couple unopened in my cupboard. So when I read all the lovely-sounding flavor combinations at June Taylor Jams I was smitten. Blackberry and Lemon Verbena? Pluot and Lavender? Pears in Cassis? Candied Bergamot Peel? I ended up with Spiced Pear Butter, Tomato Ketchup and Fig, Port and Lemon Thyme Conserve. The spice in the pear butter is pretty mild, but that just allows the fruit's flavor to dominate. All three of us were happy with it on top of our whole-wheat waffles this morning. My husband is a die-hard maple syrup fan, so that's saying a lot. There's a pear-vanilla combo that might be a little more exotic (vanilla exotic? what?) for a hostess gift. The ketchup overwhelmed me with a fresh tomato flavor. I chose this one to find an alternative to grocery store ketchup with all the corn syrup, but that wasn't really the right role for June Taylor's ketchup. It's a much simpler flavor, sweet and tomatoey and a lot less acidic than mass market. I haven't dug into the fig jam yet, mainly because I expect it to be my favorite. I've been trying to teach my 2-year-old how much fun it is to anticipate something fun or yummy. I know he's too young right now, but I want to share all my favorite things, like the delicious joy of waiting, with him.

Of all those catalogs that clog our mailboxes and make recycling a daily activity this time of year, I find Dean and DeLuca is the best one for getting me in the right mood to spend some holiday money. It's all these great pastries and cookies they offer from traditions all over the world. This year I was sorely tempted to order a North African gift collection (with rose water, harissa and preserved lemons), a selection of Japanese sweets, panforte, lebkuchen (three types of gingerbread from Austria), tea-flavored butter cookies and cinnamon licorice reindeer. I ended up with some honey bread and Christmas preserves (a French tradition, according to the web site), and a couple boxes of German Christmas cookies. The first box contained thin, crisp, Moravian-ginger-type cookies that were printed with intricate woodcut designs, figures and animals. The second box had a very pretty variety of the cakey, dried fruit and ground nut type cookies. P.S. I forgot to mention that they have free shipping until the 14th!

Good for those who received D&D Christmas deliveries on time.  For us, a wrong package was delivered and excuses were given from the warehouse re the delivery.  At the end after much wasted time on phone calls, a compensatory delivery was made on a rainy Christmas day.  The soaked package with the food was totally defrosted and uneatable.  We had never encountered such mishaps from D&D.  What a pity that this company is not keeping its customer services in good shape.  We wrote to the HQs and did not receive any feedback.  I guess D&D do not care who is buying from them.

I love the packaging on Fresh Direct's new line of chocolates, and the varieties, like this dark chocolate bark with fig, pine nuts and cinnamon, are enticing. But I'm withholding judgment; I learned from Target's choxie that pretty packaging and yummy sounding flavors do not a good chocolate make. I have opened up the PB & J bar and it's pretty good. I'm not swooning, but the raspberry puree is a tart hit. The peanut butter, though, is all texture: smooth, bland peanut butter with crunchy little bites of toasted rice throughout. No, wait. Yummm. Chocolate. Peanut butter. Raspberry.

Poor boy, whose birthday falls on Thanksgiving every few years. His cake this year was from an apple-spice cake recipe that I found in the November issue of Real Simple. Someday he'll be old enough to know that doesn't count and we'll be eating chocolate cake after our turkey dinner, but he's only two right now. Warm, then topped with ice cream and drizzled with apple saba I bought at Zingerman's, the spice cake was a very grown-up treat with a deep, musky apple flavor. The saba reminded me of an aged balsamic, thick and syrupy with sweetness and bite. I've been looking for a good ways to use it, and this was it. It's amazing how a little condiment can elevate something as simple as spice cake and ice cream. August ate the ice cream and pecked at the spice cake, then ran off with his two little friends for a raucous race around the apartment.

It's become high praise when Todd turns to me after trying what I've made for dinner and saying, \"Are you going to write about this?\" And finally, finally, one of Fresh Direct's one-click recipes has worked out for me. While browsing the FD web site, I decided I wanted to make a lamb stew, but didn't have a recipe. Yes! One-click had it. I did cut down on the amount of stew I made, and I used antibiotic-free lamb. You start by dredging the cubed lamb in a mixture of flour, oregano, salt and pepper, then browning it in oil in a large dutch-oven. Removed it from the pot, then sauted 1 sliced onion, 4 carrots that I peeled and cut into 1-inch pieces and 4 crushed garlic cloves. The moisture from the veggies softens the browned bits on the bottom of the pot, then you add half a bottle of red wine, bring it to a simmer, add the stew meat, then bake in a 350 degree oven for 2 hours.

***CONTENT
I've made two different types of pumpkin baked goods in the last couple of weeks, but I'm not sure that the pumpkin contributes much to either in the way of flavor. They were both nice and moist, though, and a very autumny shade of orange, and after a couple days they develop a nice bit of spice from cinnamon, allspice and family. The cookies are like little round cakes, and August and I had a bit of adventure making them. We discovered we didn't have much flour and sugar, so we went for a half-batch. And August dumped half of my baking soda into the sugar, so that gave the final cookies a metallic taste. But I've made these before, using the correct proportions, and have been really happy with the results. This is the full-size recipe; should make between three dozen and four dozen cookies. Mix 2 1/2 cups flour with 1 teaspoon each baking soda and baking powder, 2 teaspoons cinnamon, and 1/2 teaspoon each nutmeg, cloves and salt. Beat 1/2 cup softened butter with 1 1/2 cups sugar; add 1 cup pumpkin, 1 egg and 1 teaspoon vanilla and mix. Mix in dry ingredients, then drop tablespoons batter onto cookie sheet. Bake at 350 degrees for about 15 minutes. The recipe called for a drizzle of powdered sugar glaze, but I think a swipe of cream cheese frosting would be better. We ate them without any adornment, which was a little austere but less messy for a 2-year-old.

I cannot decide whether to go to the NYC chocolate show this year (it's this weekend). $25 to get in, and I'd have to go on Saturday (which is the only day Todd's home) and face the mad crush, or go on Friday and risk someone tripping over my 2-year-old in the stroller on the way to a free sample and either crushing the toddler or suing me for damages (also not sure August would sit well this year; he was a sleeping angel last year). What's happened to me? Am I not as hard-core as I used to be? I found a lot of great stuff at last year's show and made a few friends; I also have a very vivid memory of other showgoers taking half-eaten Payard macaroons off my plate every time I set it down to take notes.

Sour Cream Coffee Cake

***CONTENT
I have a funny way of backing into my cooking and baking plans. I tend to have something in the kitchen I need to use up, so I find a recipe that requires a large amount of that ingredient. This time it was sour cream. Fresh Direct has these one-click recipes, where you choose a recipe and just click a button to make all the ingredients end up in your order. My problem is that I choose a recipe, like maple mashed sweet potatoes, then don't feel it's worth the effort to make. I just throw the sweet potatoes in the oven and then I have the other ingredients left over, with no use. For the sweet potatoes, I had a pint-size container of full-fat sour cream. So of course it's time for coffee cake. I made it from a recipe in Baking Illustrated, which is my new favorite baking cookbook. Everything I've made from it has been pretty good, and a couple things, like this cake and the snickerdoodles, have been \"ultimate\" recipes that, to my mind, have no need for improvement. It's a mammoth cake, so it's good to share around, but we managed to eat most of it between the three of us in about 4 days. I used up all my cinnamon and just about every mixing bowl I own. You start by making the streusel: 3/4 cup all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup white sugar, 1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar and 2 tablespoons cinnamon mixed together. Then you remove 1 1/4 cup of that mixture and add 1/4 cup more brown sugar to it (this is the inside streusel); add 2 tablespoons cold, cut-up butter to what's left in the bowl and squish it with your fingers until the butter's in small pieces (this is the topping streusel, with the addition of 1 cup pecans, chopped, which I didn't add because I didn't have it). For the cake, mix 4 large eggs with 1 cup sour cream and 1 tablespoon vanilla (also used up all my vanilla). Then, in another bowl, mix 2 1/4 cups (11.5 ounces) flour with 1 1/4 cup white sugar, 1 tablespoon baking powder, 3/4 teaspoon baking soda and 3/4 teaspoon salt. Add 12 tablespoons cut-up and softened butter and 1/2 cup sour cream and mix on low to moisten, then on medium for 30 seconds. Gradually add egg mixture in 3 additions, then beat on medium-high for 1 more minute. Layer 2 cups batter in a greased bundt pan, then half the inside streusel, 2 more cups batter, rest of inside streusel, rest of batter and all of the butter-pecan (topping) streusel. Bake about 50 to 60 minutes in a preheated 350 degree oven, until a skewer comes out mostly clean (some stressel might stick to it if you hit a vein). Cool in pan for 30 minutes, then remove and cool completely (or at least 2 hours before cutting it). I have kind of a hard time getting it out, but I ran the skewer along the sides of the pan and it eventually popped right out. Now I can't imagine actually following the above directions as written, so if you're really into baking and are looking for a place to get good basic recipes, I wholeheartedly recommend this book. Sometimes the recipes get a little labor-intensive for the sake of perfection, but more often than not they balance ease and good results.

I've been making a lot of food from First Meals, which focuses on recipes for infants and children. The sandwich spirals was a suggestion from the book, and the butternut squash risotto I made for some friends for dinner last Friday was from the chapter for 3 to 7 year olds. The kid was not very excited about it (neither was his father), but my friends both liked it, and so did I. I made it during August's afternoon nap and warmed it up on the stovetop with some extra stock. 1 cup arborio rice, 3 cups warm stock, etc. It's a pretty typical risotto recipe, really. Saute 1 finely chopped onion and 1 minced garlic clove in butter and oil. Stir in the rice and coat with the butter and oil, then start adding the stock a ladleful at a time, stirring the rice until it has absorbed the stock. Keep adding ladlefuls of stock until the rice is done, al dente in the center but creamy. My rice was a little old, so it took more stock than the recipe called for. For the last 10 minutes of cooking, add grated Parmesan, minced sage and steamed, cubed butternut squash (I used half a small squash, steamed in the microwave for a few minutes).

August has entered the phase where food novelty takes a visual turn. Today I made sandwiches with avocado/cheddar and hummus/red pepper, and August at least tried them (and actually liked the avocado). He no longer eats avocado or hummus, so I'm sure the form the sandwiches took were key. I cut the crusts off two slices of whole-wheat sandwich bread (I used Vermont Bread Company's soft whole wheat) and laid them end-to-end, overlapping a bit. Then I rolled them flat with the rolling pin, which also sticks them together, then spread them with avocado mashed with salt and lime juice and sprinkled it with shredded Cheddar cheese. Rolled it up, then sliced it into spirals. August really liked these. I also did hummus and chopped roasted red pepper; I actually used Rick's Picks Pepi Pep Peps, pickled red peppers I bought at the Unions Square farmers' market that have a ginger flavor and aren't too vinegary (I like all the pickles I've tried from this guy), and August just picked out the pickled peppers and ate them.

I'm cooking some bacon in the oven, and it's the most gorgeous smell we've had in the house for a while. Sweet, salty, almost like a woodstove but not enough so to be off-putting. It's raining and dark outside and I fully expect Todd to walk in the door and feel like he's back in Durango, where he had to chop the wood for the stove that heated his childhood home. Anyway, after 10 minutes, the bacon's pink; it kind of looks like ham. Turns out that moment, smelling the bacon cooking, was the apex of my dining enjoyment that night. Bacon's like doughnuts to me; the smell always holds more promise than the taste can deliver. I know I feel that way about bacon, yet I keep eating it. I know that the book Mindless Eating is about more complex ways we're manipulated when making decisions about what to eat, and I'm excited to get started on it. It seems like it's going to be the research BEFORE the diet gurus get ahold of it and twist it into some magical way to lose weight. Maybe you could use it to the opposite effect, to heighten your dining experience. (My last dining out experience, at Cookshop, makes me think that type of manipulation is sorely needed and in short supply.) Or to persuade a finicky 2-year-old to eat his squash.

Man, chicken soup can be so good. I've borrowed a cookbook for toddlers, First Foods, from a friend, and I've been cooking from it quite a bit. Yesterday I made chicken soup, and I did find the method's a bit messy and awkward (especially without a strainer). But the soup was very, very good. I covered 3 bone-in chicken thighs with water and boiled them for 20 minutes, skimming the stuff that floated to the top. Then I added 6 peeled and halved carrots, a onion chopped in big pieces, two stalks of celery, chopped, and some of the celery tops from the middle, a handful of parsley from my sad little pot on the windowsill and two lanky vines of fresh thyme, a couple heaping teaspoons of Better Than Bouillon, some peppercorns and a bay leaf. More water. Simmered that for about 3 hours, then strained the soup through a colander into a bowl. Picked the chicken and carrots out of the colander, then cut and shredded, respectively. Tried to cut up some celery, too, but that was just a soggy mess. Added the chicken and carrots to the broth, then put some of the soup, sans-noodles, in the fridge. Brought the rest to a boil, then added some egg noodles and cooked them 8 minutes. (My friend recommended that; the egg noodles get soggy if they sit as leftovers in the soup.) I accidentally bought the flat egg noodles and I really liked them, just like grandma's. The recipe included refrigerating the soup overnight and skimming the fat from the top, but I didn't do that and didn't notice it being too rich.

I know there are better ways to do this, but I doubt if there are any that are easier. I cut butternut squash into 1-inch cubes, then got a big pot of salted water boiling. Boiled the squash for about 5 minutes, then added the rotini and boiled for another 8 minutes. Drained, then dressed it with my good, slightly bitter olive oil and some grated locatelli. August picked through it to eat just the pasta, and he wanted to drink the olive oil, but he was only willing to eat the squash after much coaxing and if I fed it to him. I'm going to use the rest of the squash to make a risotto, I think.

A couple of weeks ago I found this recipe on the Food Network recipe, and while the baby and Todd were at the playground I bought all the ingredients and prepared it. (It was so nice to be alone in the kitchen, making dinner, then have them come home, pink-cheeked and hungry.) I've discovered that both of my boys will eat fennel, especially with tomatoes, and that you can do everything wrong and still have it turn out all right. I bought two pork chops, probably about an inch thick, then salted and peppered them and browned them on both sides. Then I took them out of the pan and added one sliced fennel bulb and a diced shallot. Once they started to soften, I added a 1/4 cup chicken stock and a 14-ounce can of diced tomatoes. Nestled the pok chops back in the pan and simmered them for about 12 minutes to cook them through. Then I added chopped fresh parsley, lemon zest and capers to the sauce and served the pork with the tomatoes and fennel spooned over the top. The funny thing is, a couple days later I caught the episode of Everyday Italian when she was cooking this, and she really emphasized how you had to use 2-inch pork chops or they'd dry out and how important white wine (not chicken stock) was to the final flavor of the dish. So I did a whole bunch of things wrong (didn't use fennel fronds, either), and still ended up with something that we all really liked. Most cooking really is so forgiving.

I've been trying to convince myself that the oatmeal cookies we made from the recipe on top of the Quaker Oats canister are a healthy snack. After all, the ratio of oats to white flour is 2:1 (3 cups oats, 1 1/2 cup flour), the same as the ratio of oats to the brown and white sugars combined. Add to that a generous cup of raisins and dried cranberries, and you have quality entries from at least two food groups. Sure, there are some empty calories in there. But cookies are good for the soul, too, right? I made mine double the size the recipe called for. I just can't imagine that a bite-sized oatmeal cookie is as satisfying as a big, dense, chewy one you can sink your teeth into. August has gotten big enough that when he sees them on the counter he clamours, \"cookie, I wanna cookie.\" I think it's time to invest in a solid, can't-see-through cookie jar, because he's in the out-of-sight-out-of-mind phase.

No butter, no eggs, no milk. Just flour, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, water, cider vinegar and oil (I used olive) for a perfectly moist, simple chocolate cake. It kind of has a reddish hue, which I thought might be a result of the vinegar/baking soda reaction, sort of like a red-velvet cake. I read about this on Words to Eat By. Thank goodness she got to baking this cake before she went and had that baby! Mix 1 1/2 cups flour with 1 cup sugar, 1/3 cup cocoa powder, 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt. In another bowl, whisk 5 tablespoons of oil with 1 cup cold water, 1 tablespoon cider vinegar and 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (oops, forget to mention vanilla above). Pour liquids into flour mixture, then pour into a greased 9-inch pan. Bake 30 minutes-ish in a 350 oven until the top springs back when pressed in the middle.

In the last three days I have seen my baby boy twice take a bite of simply prepared but very tasty zucchini (once sauteed with garlic, once served in pasta with fresh basil, olive oil and parmesan), then thrust his tongue, and the offending vegetable, out of his mouth. Today I shredded the very same veggie and baked it in a frittata and he gobbled it up. Thus my training in vegetable concealment begins.

Its always to start vegetable concealment while they are young, I have found if you keep it up until they are quite a bit older kids tend to eat vegetables more. Unfortunately it doesnt work for everyone though.
Great Blog keep it up.

Good Dumplings

My baby boy almost made it through the first two years of his life without having a good dumpling. And he LOVES dumplings, so that is a very sad statement. I decided almost as soon as I moved to New York that the best judge of a Chinese restaurant is its dumplings. And most of them are just awful, too thick, doughy and sticky or soggy or cheater dumplings, made with those transparent papers (is it rice papers or some kind of wonton wrapper?). But Rickshaw Dumpling Bar, on 23rd in Chelsea, has good dumplings. We tried the pork and chive and the duck with hoisin sauce. Both were juicy little meatballs in pasta-like steamed wrappers that were the perfect thickness, the perfect texture. We took them on-the-go, in the car, and they were perfect portable food, too. We also had the chocolate soup dumplings, which is a molten chocolate filling wrapped in a doughy, chewy pastry that's coated with sesame seeds. Todd thought the flavor was off-putting (maybe from the sesame seeds?) and it's definitely too chewy to eat in one mouthful, but I loved the burst of melty chocolate in my mouth. The baby clamored for more, too.

It's funny how, with food, you can feel like you've just discovered something fabulous even though you're simply eating something people have been eating for a long time. This combo works so much better than I thought it would; it's never enticed me before. The fennel I had was baby fennel, ordered on impulse from Fresh Direct. I sliced it thin, then tossed it with salt, orange-infused olive oil and chopped orange segments. The fennel was very celery-like, with that telltale hint of anise. The salt was key to keeping it from being too sweet. But it was crunchy, salty and sweet, and refreshing. No one else in my house would even try it, though.

This How to Cook Everything is a damn good cookbook. This time Bittman's advice on cooking chicken breast cutlets produced juicy, flavorful meat. You just marinate the chicken in 1 tablespoon olive oil, 1/2 cup chopped basil, 2 tablespoons lemon juice, and salt and pepper to taste for at least an hour. Then just broil it for 3 or 4 minutes on each side. The recipe says to boil the marinade for a minute, then brush the chicken with it while it's broiling, but I skipped those two steps and the chicken was still great, topped with chopped tomato and basil and drizzled with good olive oil.

My husband just bought me Baking Illustrated as a gift; I've always loved reading Cook's Illustrated but have been reluctant to actually make anything from the resulting recipes. You'd think having all that information would give you confidence; I find it daunting, knowing everything that could go wrong if I use the wrong ratio of butter to shortening or measure the flour by volume instead of weight. But my 2-year-old and I made the snickerdoodles last week and they were fantastic. The cookie didn't have a huge amount of flavor, but the spicy cinnamon-sugar on the outside compensated nicely. And the texture was perfect: slightly crunchy on the bottom and around the edges with a chewy center. I think it was the combination of shortening and butter. August's job was to roll the cookies in the cinnamon sugar and put them on the cookie sheet. (But really the job he does best is to coat everything in the kitchen with flour.) First you whisk 11.25 ounces unbleached, all-purpose flour with 2 teaspoons cream of tartar, 1 teaspoon baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Then you cream 12 tablespoons room-temperature butter, 1/4 cup vegetable shortening and 1 1/2 cups sugar. Add 2 eggs and mix to combine. Mix in the dry ingredients, then roll into balls using a heaping tablespoon of dough. Roll in a mixture of 1 tablespoon cinnamon and 3 tablespoons sugar. Bake in a 400 degree oven for about 10 minutes (9-11 minutes), until the edges are set and the centers are puffy. We made sugar cookies from the same cookbook and they weren't nearly as good. But the snickerdoodles I'll make again.

This was a stew of eggplant, onions, chickpeas, tomatoes and spinach, and it's the second recipe I've made from Six O'Clock Scramble that I'd make again, although I think I'd add more seasoning to it. I was amazed to see August go to town on it, not discriminating at all between the eggplant and the ingredients in it that he actually likes. My dad tasted the eggplant and didn't say a thing, which means he didn't like it. But I do like the taste of this eggplant. First you saute a chopped onion in 1/4 cup olive oil until it's softened, then you add a medium eggplant that's you've cut in 1-inch cubes. Cook that for 5 minutes, then add a drained can of chickpeas, a 28-ounce can diced tomatoes, a teaspoon (or much more) cumin, 15 chopped mint leaves and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Simmer until the eggplant is soft (the recipe said 15 minutes, but mine took more like 30), then add some spinach (the recipe called for 2 to 3 cups fresh baby spinach, but I had frozen chopped spinach that I didn't use in the lasagne so I used that instead - wouldn't it be nice if a menu-based cookbook took that kind of thing into consideration?). Eat over couscous. I think it'd be good with plain yogurt on top, but we didn't have any so I can't be sure. Overall, this is the kind of recipe the Scrambler in me loves: lots of veggies, a good bit of unattended cooking time to prep other things, lots of flavor and flexibility. Cooked tomatoes, which is almost a guaranteed hit with the boy. I just have to convince his father to try eggplant.

I skipped a couple of recipes from the week I chose and decided to make the Zesty Pasta Salad for dinner last night. It was good, but there was far to much pasta compared to the other ingredients (even the vinaigrette seemed skimpy). I'd make this again with twice as much kielbasa and cheese. The recipe included a pound of spiral pasta (we used Barilla's pasta Plus, which had fiber, protein and omega-3s, because my dad's diabetic; it's pretty tasty), 8 ounces browned smoked turkey sausage, 4 ounces cubed Cheddar cheese, 2 diced seeded tomatoes and a vinaigrette of 2 1/2 tablespoons each balsamic vinegar and olive oil, salt, pepper, dried thyme, dried basil and garlic powder. One of the other problems with this recipe was the tomatoes, which my brother doesn't like. My mom was hovering and insisted I pull out a bowl of pasta for him before I added the tomatoes. Easy enough to do, but I it just shows how difficult it can be to please everyone with menus planned by someone else. Maybe these work for Aviva Goldfarb's family, but they're full of ingredients mine won't eat. (Not Aviva's fault, of course. I think my family needs to get less picky. I'll eat just about anything, but I'm surrounded by people who have what borders on food phobias of certain things.)

I selected a week of menus to try from The Six O'Clock Scramble, and the second recipe from the week was a Honey-Glazed Salmon. Not so great. I don't know if I crowded the pan too much or what, but the fish ended up pink and watery-looking, not nice and browned. You mix butter and honey, brush it on fillets arranged in a baking pan, then bake for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven. I also think that salmon is such a fatty fish that it needs some spice or acid to cut through it. I like a mustard coating, or a dry rub of Indian spices.

When I worked at Woman's Day we had a feature called month of menus: a calendar that had a menu suggestion and sometimes a bried recipe for every day in the month. We squeezed all this information into those little boxes, and it was a bear to copy edit. So we weren't too unhappy when it was phased out. Unfortunately, the readers were. There was such an outcry that the menus were brought back. Because, as I now realize, sometimes the biggest burden with dinner involves coming up with what to make. So I was excited to receive the Six O'Clock Scramble in the mail. It's organized by season, with five recipes for each week (one for each weeknight). There's tons of great, down-to-earth advice, like incorporating fish into your kids' diets without exposing them to too much mercury or what types of fresh fruits and veggies are lowest in pesticides. Last night we had the Chinese Lasagne, which was really regular lasagna that uses egg roll wrappers instead of pasta. They don't need to be precooked and you end up with a lasagne that's heavy on the meat, cheese and vegetables and a bit lighter on the pasta. The layers: 1 cup pasta sauce, 4 egg roll wrappers, 1 pound browned ground turkey, 1 cup pasta sauce, about 2/3 cup shredded mozzarella, 4 egg roll wrappers, 1 cup pasta sauce, a ricotta-spinach mixture (16 ounces ricotta, 1 egg, 10 ounces frozen chopped spinach, 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan), 2/3 cup shredded mozzarella, 4 egg roll wrappers, 1 cup pasta sauce and, finally, 2/3 cup shredded mozzarella. I guess some additional info is needed: 9 x 13-inch pan, 30 minutes, 375 degree oven. It was amazingly good, although I felt the ricotta layer was a bit thick. August loved it (so did my folks), so I got some spinach and tomatoes into them. There were plenty for leftovers the next day, too.

Orange-Scented Pancakes

I have a very specific technique for pancake-making, with my tried-and-true recipe (from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook) and specific tools. I do vary the ingredients occasionally though, substituting whole wheat flour for half of the flour and using yogurt in a buttermilk variation (which uses less baking powder and adds baking soda). This time I used my orange-infused olive oil for the 2 tablespoons of cooking oil in the recipe, and it was a really nice, subtle change. I always end up snacking on one of the leftover pancakes later in the day, just out of hand, and this change made it even better. First you whisk 1 cup flour, 1 tablespoon sugar, 2 teaspoons baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a big bowl, then measure 1 cup milk into a 2-cup measure and add 1 egg and 2 tablespoons of the orange-infused olive oil. Whisk, then pour into the flour and, using a spoon, mix until combined but still lumpy. I have a favorite spoon that I use for this and also for spooning the batter onto the griddle. It's just a white plastic cooking spoon with a medium-size bowl; I think it came in a carousel spice rack I got as a wedding present. I served the pancakes with a peach-nectarine compote: just cut up a peach and a couple white nectarines (whatever sized pieces you like), tossed them with some sugar and cooked them down until they were soft. It was a good match with the orange pancakes.

As a native (albeit now former) New Yorker, realized one of my childhood dreams opening up the Fish Creek House Bed and Breakfast in Montana.  

So pancakes are a subject near and dear to my heart  Here's one of our guests favorites especially since we use butter made in Montana by the local Amish  and grow blueberries in our onsite greenhouse.

Buttermilk Pancakes w/Blueberries
Yield: 20 pancakes (5 to 6 servings)
All-purpose flour     2 cups
Baking soda     1 1/2 tsp.
Baking powder     1 1/2 tsp.
Salt     1/2 tsp.
Large eggs     2
Buttermilk     2 1/2 cups
Butter, melted     1/4 cup
Fresh blueberries, rinsed, drained     1 cup
Oil     as needed
1. In bowl mix flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. In small bowl, whisk eggs, buttermilk, and butter until blended. Stir egg mixture into flour mixture. Gently stir in blueberries.

2. Heat griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Coat griddle with oil. Spoon batter (1/3-cup portions) onto griddle. Cook until pancakes are browned on bottom and edges look firm, about 2 minutes. Flip with spatula and cook 11/2 minutes longer. Repeat procedure and re-oil griddle as necessary.

3. Serve pancakes immediately with butter and maple syrup. Garnish, if desired, with additional berries.

Back from Canada (Montreal and Quebec City), and I tried a couple of new things there. One was called a beaver tail, and it seems like it's the funnel cake of the north. It's a flat, oval-ish (beaver-tail-shaped) piece of fried dough that was spread with chocolate and layered with banana slices. Easy to eat out-of-hand while strolling the cobblestone streets of Vieux Montreal. In Quebec City we stopped by Erico Choco-Museum, which was basically a chocolate shop with the owners' chocolate memorabilia and some information on how chocolate is made in a back room. We tasted pure crushed cocoa beans and were surprised about how nut-like they were. I expected a lot more bitterness, like cocoa powder or baking chocolate. I got some truffles, and the sesame one, which had tahini in the filling, knocked my socks off. I picked up a pink peppercorn and a ginger dark chocolate bars, and I also really loved the l'Amazonian ice cream (not sure I have the name right), which was a spicy chocolate ice cream. I had to try poutine before I left Quebec, so we stopped at McDonald's near the border. Now, you may think I didn't give it a fair chance, trying it at a fast-food restaurant. But it was exactly how it sounds: a gooey mess of french fries, curd cheese (Todd calls it squeaky cheese) and gravy. If you like gravy, french fries and curd cheese apart, you'll like them together. I'm not so big on gravy, so I wasn't that impressed.

I moved to Canada last summer and gave poutine (which my Canadian husband loves) a try  shortly thereafter.  Even keeping in mind that I love french fries, I love cheese, and I like gravy, I just did not, could not, like poutine.

I find poutine to be just like a philly cheesesteak, in that the more drunk you are the better it tastes. Theres a greasy, little burger joint in St Jovite (near the Mont Tremblant Ski resort)that has the hands-down best cheeseburger and poutine Ive had in my life.  Wish I could remember the name.

We just got back from the Penzey's at Grand Central and I have to confess a degree of disappointment.

I didn't really expect THAT, but the rows of little glass jars was just too, uh?, sanitary? It is fabulous to be able to buy Penzey's spices without having to pay those shipping charges. I picked up some oregano and almond extract, and now I can think of about three other things I wish I had gotten (pink peppercorns, candied ginger, dried chilis). We also had a snack at the Little Pie Company downstairs. Couldn't turn down the sour cream-walnut apple pie, which is my favorite. And my coffee came with warmed, frothed milk.

I bought the dried tortellini, mini ravioli and penne the last time I was in Trader Joe's, and I'm kind of disappointed. The tortellini was nice for a quick soup with broth and baby spinach, but I cooked that mini ravioli 5 minutes longer than the directions said and the filling was still crunchy. And every time I've used the penne it has stuck together. I usually buy Barilla pasta, which I like quite a lot. I never fully appreciate how much I like it until I try a different brand. The firm bite of the texture is its main appeal, but it also actually tastes really good. You know the difference in smell between cooking a nice jasmine rice and a plain, medium grain? It's like that.

Today I was lamenting to Todd that my blog is dead; it's been almost two months since my last post, and the time has flown by without an impulse on my part to write about any of the cooking or baking I've done. (It's too bad, too, because I have baked some yummy things from Once Upon a Tart and come up with some recipes that August really liked.) I told him the only time I feel like posting is when I have a passionate reaction to some product I've tried: the Cascadian Farms broccoli florets (not the cuts) that are the perfect degree of tenderness for August without being too mushy for me, the loaf of pecan-raisin bread I picked up on impulse from Natural, almost everything from Bonelle pastry shop near my apartment. I wanted to write to complain that Trader Joe's individually quick-frozen baby spinach was literally 50 percent spinach stems; I decided that picking out the actual leaves was faster. The vinho verde I picked up from the Trader Joe's wine shop, however, introduced me to a whole new school of summery wines (although I did NOT like the single vinho verde offered by Fresh Direct). I've become more of a shopper than a cook, and when I do cook it's often something I've made before. He told me to go ahead and do it; the whole point of writing your own blog is making it whatever you want it to be. So here it is. The posts may seem kind of mundane sometimes, but I hope there'll be a useful tip every once in a while. And maybe my family will still manage to get a little picture of what's going on in my life (and what the baby's up to).

Today I'm in the process of making my second loaf of bread, but here's my first one. I have to admit that while I was watching it bake it looked kind of funny, too round and ball-like and kind of shiney. It also seemed to be getting too dark too fast, but the crust wasn't really crusty. And when I cut into it the crumb was really fine and sort of dense, more like a sandwich bread. I realized it was because I used unbleached all-purpose flour instead of bread flour (which my store didn't have), but also the recipe I used, from The Bread Bible, was for a finer crumb and a softer crust (due, I assume, to the moisture in the oven while baking). After I got over my initial disappointment, I really enjoyed this bread for what it was, and decided that maybe the whole crusty-crust, big-holed bread thing was overrated. It was so nice to toast this up and spread butter and jam on it, or make an open-face sandwich with it. That's why I'm making it again. I'm baking it in a loaf pan this time, though, just to change things up a bit. It turned out to be pretty easy, spread out over a few hours but only requiring a couple minutes of attention at a time. I used the kitchen scale for all the measurements except the honey, yeast and salt, and I think that helped, too. Maybe if I get ambitious I'll post the recipe, but now my next loaf calls.

I mentioned this recipe a while back and promised to write about it but never did. Someone's reminded me of my promise, so here it is: It's from New American Cooking by Joan Nathan, which I've really grown to like. I made it for my in-laws one morning while they were helping me pack up the apartment to move. The four of us (in-laws, me and August) devoured the whole pan (the recipe below is for half a recipe, which is what I made). We needed the sustenance for all that packing! Melt half a stick of butter with 6 tablespoons brown sugar and 1 tablespoon maple syrup in a pan. You're supposed to bring it to a boil and let it boil for 2 minutes without stirring but I have to admit that frightened me so I may have fiddled with it with a wooden spoon a little (or a lot). Pour into a 8 x 8 inch pan and coat the bottom with it. Then arrange 2 sliced bananas over the top, then layer on three 1 1/2-inch-thick slices challah. Mix 3/4 cup half-and-half with 3 large eggs and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and pour that over the top. Refrigerate overnight. In the morning, take the casserole out of the refrigerator and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. When it's heated, pop in the casserole and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, then cool 10 minutes and eat. I unmolded it onto a platter so the pretty banana layer was on top.

The last time a taste of ice cream hit me with such a unique, clean flavor I was at the Biltmore Room and my mouth was tingling from their ginger ice cream. This time it was the grassy taste of fresh mint, nothing like that sharp, peppermint stick flavor that other ice creams pass off as mint. I almost expected to find rough, chewy mint leaves in the ice cream (I didn't, of course). I've been picking up Ciao Bella's gelatos at my local natural food store, and I have to admit I was kind of disappointed by the ingredients list, but the texture is so nice, really creamy and thick. We had a chocolate hazelnut that wasn't quite chocolaty enough for me, but Todd really liked it. This one, called fresh mint\" on the package, has dark chocolate chunks in this great mint ice cream. Hello new favorite.

If you ate some of the chocolate cookies Todd took to the office on Monday you may want to look away. This is the baby \"helping.\" We started by mixing dry ingredients in a bowl: 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon cocoa powder, and 1/4 teaspoon each baking soda and salt. This picture is him tasting that mixture. He would put the spoonful in his mouth, make a horrible face, then go back to it. Then we beat 6 tablespoons room-temperature butter, then mixed in 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons white sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Mixed in 3 tablespoons milk, then the flour mixture. Now that was the goods. The boy got ahold of that dough-covered beater and would not let it go. I rolled the dough into a log, wrapped it in wax paper, stuck it in the fridge, then hauled him off to the laundry room to strip him down and throw his cocoa-covered clothes in. I've been slicing and baking off a few at a time since. 350 degrees for about 11 minutes. Cookies fresh from the oven - yum.

Eggs are my favorite fallback food for August. Unless he's feeling really low (which he was last week) he'll eat them all up, and they're so good for him. But I don't like cooking for him in my nonstick pans (another neurotic mommy taboo of mine), so I've been kind of stuck. In the stainless steel pans the eggs make a big mess unless I use huge quantities of oil, which is my new favored technique. But I can't make a frittata or omelette in a straight-sided pan, so yesterday I used my Pyrex pie plate. I stuck the plate, with about a teaspoon of butter in it, in the oven, then heated the oven to 350 degrees. While that was heating up I mixed four eggs with about 2 cups of stuff: diced Swiss cheese, diced cooked asparagus and fingerling potatoes, salt and pepper. When the oven was heated, I poured in the egg mixture and cooked it until the center was set, about 25 minutes. August was sleeping when it was done so we ate it at room temperature later. I liked the firm texture, like a Spanish tortilla.

Last time I ordered from Penzey’s I picked out some broken-up pieces of cassia cinnamon, but I’ve had some trouble finding a use for them. Until now. It kind of has some heat, and I found it was the perfect thing to use in a recipe for chai I found in The New American Cooking by Joan Nathan (which I was not so excited about when I first started leafing through it, but now I’ve found a few recipes in it I love, including this one and a recipe for banana overnight French toast that I’ll write up eventually). This recipe is from Teaism in D.C. It’s all about the technique. You start by bringing 2 ½ cups cold water to a boil, then add 1 broken-up cinnamon stick (or the equivalent in cinnamon pieces), 5 crushed cardamom pods and 5 whole cloves. Let that boil for 2 minutes, then sprinkle 2 teaspoons of loose tea over the top and add ½ cup milk and 1 ½ teaspoon sugar (or less, if you don’t like it so sweet). Bring it back up to a boil, then strain and serve.

We've been moving into a new apartment over the last two weeks and that's why I've been missing for so long. Now we're finally getting settled in, but my only Internet access is dial-up, so it's kind of painful getting on. And cooking isn't really happening, what with all the boxes. I do have a bigger and better kitchen, which I hope you'll be seeing some of soon. Meanwhile, I did make a Italian meatball and escarole soup that August absolutely devoured. Got some chicken stock boiling, then formed some sweet Italian sausage into marble-sized meatballs (which I cut in fourths for the baby) and dropped them in the broth. Boiled that for about 20 minutes, then added some diced tomatoes (from a can) and chopped fresh escarole. Tore up a day-old ficelle and threw that in, too, and let it get soft. I topped the bowls with shredded hard cheese. It was easy and good. (And popular. August kept signing \"more\" so I ended up giving him about half of Todd's portion, too.)

Todd, August and I have been nomads for the last week, having sold our previous apartment and not into our new one yet. The last few nights we were fortunate to stay with some friends who have a daughter who's a little more than a year older than August. So the last night we made some Roman gnocchi because we thought the little ones would like it. We cut it into little star, fish and heart shapes, and August just ate it up. It's a lot like fried polenta, only much easier and tastier, with crispy edges. First you bring 2 1/2 cups milk (seasoned with salt, pepper and nutmeg, to a boil, then you gradually whisk in 1 cup of farina and stir over low heat up to 20 minutes, until the mixture is so thick that the spoon stands up in it. Then stir in 1/2 cup grated Parmesan, a couple tablespoons butter and a well-beaten egg. Spread it out in an oiled pan and allow to cool, then cut into shapes and arrange, overlapping, in a buttered baking pan. Dot with more butter and top with more grated Parmesan, then bake in a 425 degree oven for 15 to 20 minutes.

For V-Day August and I made some cheesecake bars that turned out a little humdrum. So I whipped up an easy, easy chocolate sauce that I have been eating by the spoonful since. It would be truly glorious with some good chocolate, but all I have in the house are Nestle semisweet chocolate chips, and a couple generous pinches of salt made the sauce very, very tolerable. (Licking-the-bowl tolerable, of course.) In a 2-cup measure, microwave 1/2 cup cream and 1/4 cup light corn syrup until it's steaming, then pour it over 4 ounces of chocolate chips (about 1/2 cup?) in a metal bowl. Whisk until the chocolate has melted. I thought it tasted kind of drab at this point so I added some salt and that perked it right up. It thickens as it cools. I think I'll also make a cherry preserves and Grand Marnier topping for the bars. Choices.

Why does the-ubiquitous-coffee-shop-that-shall-not-be-named tease me with seasonal offerings and then snatch them away once I'm addicted? My drink of choice had become a steamed milk with peppermint syrup (which is not as cloyingly sweet as some of the others), but apparently that was a holiday flavor that they no longer offer. How now to get my peppermint fix? Then I found these peppermint marshmallows by Tiny Trapeze at Whole Foods. Melting over the top of a mug of heated, sweetened milk, it satisfies my craving. I'm not a big marshmallow fan, but these are pillowy-soft with a nice bite of mint to cut the sweetness. Todd and I started fantasizing about peppermint s'mores or a nice chocolate fondue dipper. But at $5.99 for a bag of about a dozen medium-sized marshmallows that my husband has been popping all day like potato chips, they're not long for this house and not likely to make another appearance soon. That would involve braving the forbidding land of the shops at Columbus Circle with a stroller. I'll have to decide if it's worth enduring the stern looks. It might be.

When I first started cooking, which was at the beginning of my marriage almost 10 years ago, I had a few recipes that I had found online that I just rotated through. One was a breaded pork chop with tomato sauce. Another was a pasta dish similar to the one I made tonight, with spinach, onions, broth and beans. When I found myself in the middle of a blizzard with those very ingredients in the apartment, I realized it was something the baby might like (I already knew Todd liked it). August is a pretty good spinach eater, but he's still very wary of beans (which I think is OK at this point). First I sauteed a diced onion, then kept cooking it over medium-low heat until it was soft and brown. Stirred some garlic in there for a minute or two, then added a little bit of vegetable stock, a rinsed, drained can of white beans and some thawed frozen chopped spinach (I prefer fresh baby spinach, but this is what I had). Seasoned with salt and pepper, then added cooked pasta wheels and let it sit on the heat for a few minutes to get everything working together. It used to be farfalle always, but I thought August would have an easier time with the wheels.

I was all up in arms because of a bad experience I just had with the baby at the Time Warner Center (apparently, Time Warner Center does not want your stinky little children grubbing up their pristine environment). Then I came home and comforted myself with some chocolate shortbread he and I made yesterday and realized there's benefits and drawbacks to my new life with August. I may not be welcome at a few of the places I used to frequent, but I now have an eager baking partner who loves to smear whatever we're making all over his already sweet little face. The chocolate shortbread turned out a bit more crumbly than I think it was supposed to, which I'm sure was a result of less-than-accurate flour measuring. But this was sooo easy. And I'm thinking that most shortbread recipes (although not this one) would be good to bake with a baby who likes to taste the batter because they're eggless. August's desire to taste at every stage of the process makes me think I should try to track down pasteurized eggs rather than try to keep him away at the end of the process. We creamed a stick of room-temperature butter with 1/2 cup sugar, 3/4 cup cocoa and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Then we added an egg yolk and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla. Mix in 1 cup flour, then pat into a greased 9-inch round springform pan and bake in a 350 degree oven 25 minutes. Let cool, then cut into wedges. These weren't very sweet, but deeply chocolately and kind of salty. We didn't add the glaze because that'd make them kind of messy. These might be a chocolate overdose with fondue, but I think regular shortbread (or biscotti or, my favorite, macaroons) would make a decadent fondue.

I've had a lot of success getting August to eat soups. There was the tofu-veggie soup, the chicken chili and also a minestrone I made with diced carrots, peas, ditalini, diced tomatoes from a can and onion. I stirred pesto into mine and August liked that, too. He doesn't really have any of the broth; it's just a good way to get the veggies soft enough and add a little flavor. He also loves pasta, so I made mini shells and mixed in some roasted zucchini and peppers I had diced into tiny pieces and some ricotta and pesto. I tried giving it to him without the pesto and he definitely preferred it with. I made some oven-baked risotto, which turned out sticky and gummy, but since August didn't know what he was missing he ate it up. I owe the poor boy some real risotto sometime, though. It had diced parsnips, carrots and peas in it, which he ate up, along with lots of grated Romano.

Thanks for your concern, TJ. I think my pediatrician was the first to suggest I give August some cheese. Only cheese made with pasturized milk for now though. 

Citymama, I guess I didn't confess on here that I ordered a rotisserie chicken from FD a while back and made dinner for a week from it. I find, too, though, that I am getting in kind of a rut. Eggs, pasta, soup. Sometimes you just don't have the time, or energy, to come up with something new.

August and I made a gingerbread cake yesterday, ostesibly from The New American Cooking, and I think I need to call it my miracle cake. This is what happens when you don't gather all your ingredients ahead of time. I'm not going to record the actual recipe because I'm sure the results aren't reproducable. First I had August measure out the flour. He's just over 1 year old, so really I had him hold the cup while I poured flour in, then he dumped it into the bowl, or rather in the general vicinity of the bowl. So (1) the flour wasn't measured accurately. Then I discovered I had no ground ginger for my GINGERbread cake, so I (2) subbed pumpkin pie spice for all the spices called for. Added the other dry ingredients, which August then mixed together with his hands and then spread all over the front of his shirt. Then the wet ingredients. I found I only had 1/2 cup white sugar, so I (3) substituted brown for the rest. Only had 1/3 cup molasses when the recipe called for 1 cup, so (4) that's all I used. Mixed everything together, put it in a pan and then into the oven. I turned on the oven light and August and I watched, fully expecting the whole thing to explode or cave into a goey mess. I thought we were going to get something when bubbles started forming at the top. I thought at least the cake would have a metallic taste because there wasn't enough molasses to react with the baking soda. I felt sure I must've made the baking gods mad, breaking all the rules about using the right ratios and following baking recipes exactly. But they must have a thing for little kids covered in flour, because the cake was pretty good, if a little bland. Definitely edible, and not the kitchen disaster I was expecting. Nice warm topped with vanilla ice cream and sprinkled with freshly grated nutmeg.

So let's see if I can remember how I made this; I think it was more than a week ago. I chopped up onions, cubanelle peppers and tomatillos and cooked them in olive oil until they were starting to get soft. I had never made a chili with tomatillos before, so I just treated them like regular tomatoes. Then I mixed in a lot of cumin, a little bit of ancho chile powder (I wanted August to eat some so I didn't want it too hot; ancho's pretty mild), salt, pepper and oregano. Cooked that a little, then added the shredded dark meat from the rotisserie chicken, some white beans and some chicken stock that I made from the chicken carcass (I was always really skeptical about making stock but it really is as easy as you always hear; I just covered the carcass with water and added a bay leaf and chunks of carrot and onion, which was what I had, then seasoned it at the end). It was a big hit with Todd and August. I don't know if it was the peppers or the tomatillos that gave the chili a fresher taste than my usual chili.

Condemn me if you must, but Fresh Direct's rotisserie chicken is better than any roasted chicken I can make myself; mine always comes out kind of flabby with bits that never look like they're done. At $10 it's not really an economical option, but it's worth it to me to not have to deal with a raw chicken (Todd always tells me it's not radioactive, so that gives you a picture of how I act when there's raw chicken in the kitchen). It's their raised right chickens, which don't have antibiotics (so they say; I can't say I've done a lot of research). But it's tasty, with crispy skin, lots of slightly bland but not off-putting white meat, and a little, tiny bit of dark meat (so they can't be too free-rangey, can they?). Anyway, enough apologia. It lasts us, a family of 2 1/2, three meals, so it's not that extravagant. And it was terrific in these Greek-inspired sandwiches. I didn't give August any of the tzatziki but think he would've liked it if I had: plain yogurt with about a teaspoon of dried mint (I bought this from Penzey's and never could find a use for it), a crushed garlic clove (so I could take it out later), salt and a couple inches of cucumber, diced. I made it the day ahead then drained off the excess liquid and took out the garlic clove before assembling the sandwiches: warm whole-wheat pita with slices of the rotisserie chicken breast, tzatziki and halved grape tomatoes. We had some lemon-rosemary roasted potatoes and orange slices on the side. I made a green chili with the dark meat, which August did eat, but that's another entry.

MOMA's Cafe 2

We went to MOMA one Saturday morning, right when they opened, thinking we'd miss the crowds. We didn't. We found ourselves at the end of a very long line that wasn't even going to start moving for another half an hour. So Todd proposed a membership; at $75 it would pay for itself after just two visits. He went off to investigate while I got all excited about being able to spend cold winter afternoons at the museum instead of in my tiny apartment, so when he came back with a higher figure we decided to go for it anyway. So we basically paid $120 so we wouldn't have to stand in line one Saturday morning (which makes us sound extravagant, but when you consider what we pay for Gymboree classes . . .). I've already been once more so I don't think it was a bad move. And the cafe turns out to be very baby-friendly, especially during off times. The menu, as far as I remember, is mainly panini and soups, and all we've had so far are the sandwiches (and a really yummy, puffy pear tart). It's not too difficult to maneuver with a baby and they have those fancy high chairs that pull right up to the communal tables. They only let in people if there's seating available, then you go to the cashier and place your order. They give you a card with a number that you put up wherever you end up sitting. Then they bring you cutlery, napkins, drinks (except water, which is self-serve) and your food. If you decide you want dessert or more food, there's another cashier. When I went there alone during off-hours the hostess and some of the waitstaff got the chair for me and played with August while I finished his mozzarella panini and apple slices (which he did eat a bit of, but melted fresh mozzarella has kind of a weird, rubbery texture so he wasn't sure it was really food). The first time we went I had the bruscetta trio: a white bean and fennel topping; fresh ricotta and roasted bell pepper; and proscuitto (if I remember right) with an apple mostarda (kind of an applesauce with spicy mustard seeds), which I really liked, although I thought it had a little too much of the mostarda (I just scraped some off). The also have some pastas, but next time I think I'll try the soup; I've seen other people enjoying it.

A few days ago, as I dished up Annie's shells and cheese (from a box) with added broccoli tops (from a frozen box), I thought, \"I can do better, and in the same amount of time, too.\" I could cook dried pasta shells, or any easy-to-pick-up shape, then toss it with either cubed cheese or some ricotta, parmesan and pasta water and diced tomatoes, cooked veggies or cooked meat. The New York Times magazine's food column addresses the issue this week, kind of. Why do parents who like good food give their kids prepackaged foods? I simply don't want to make two meals every night for dinner, so I want August to eat what we eat. Or rather, it seems like I want to be able to eat what I make for him. Without sacrificing my eating habits in the process. He's doing a pretty good job with adult food so far, but I've been steering clear of any kind of spice and any kind of nut.

One of my friends trekked to Flushing last weekend to buy some very fresh tofu, and she brought some home for me, too. I'm a bit of a tofu virgin, but I made this simple soup that August really loved. It has lots of vegetables diced up just the right size for him to pick up (so he had a bowl of the soup, and used his spoon to pick up a couple of pieces, but then he just mashed his hands right in). I started with a small carton of vegetable broth (about 2 cups) then added a diced carrot and a couple of slices of fresh ginger. Boiled that for 5 minutes, then added a diced small zucchini. After 5 more minutes I added about 3/4 cup diced tofu (regular) and a couple handfuls of frozen peas (which August has an amazing ability of leaving uneaten). Heated that through and ate. I liked it, too. Now what do I do with the rest of the tofu?

You could simply cut up the tofu into little squares and microwave!  then, give it to your little one with something fun to dip in, like organic ketchup or applesauce.  tofu is a great protein source and super easy to chew and digest.  easy to keep around, too, in a container in the fridge. hack off a few ieces whenever you need to give him a bit of protein. you can also scramble it up like eggwhites (the silken type, not the firm) and you can the firm kind in things like chile instead of ground beef - just prepare the same way.

One of my favorite restaurants in college was a vegetarian place called \"The Grit.\" They have a great cookbook, and we like to make this recipe. I am not really a tofu person, but I love it. I usually serve it over brown rice, with melted cheese on top.

\"Golden Bowl\"

1 15-oz. Block firm tofu
Vegetable oil
Soy sauce
Nutritional yeast

Cut tofu into cubes slightly smaller than playing dice. Lightly oil a non-stick skillet and place over high heat. Allow oil to heat slightly and add tofu. Sauté, tossing with a non-metal spatula until evenly and lightly golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with soy sauce. Sauté briefly to further brown tofu. Remove from skillet, draining and discarding any excess fluid.

Rinse and wipe skillet dry. Lightly oil and place it over high heat. Allow oil to become very hot and add tofu. Sauté tofu, tossing with a non-metal spatula almost constantly until very well browned. Sprinkle with soy sauce to taste. Sprinkle with nutritional yeast to coat tofu cubes and, tossing vigorously, sauté for a few seconds and remove from heat. Serve immediately.

Will He Eat Sausage?

***CONTENT
Should he eat sausage? This was chicken-apple sausage without all those preservatives, so I don't think there's anything wrong with it. We gave him ham yesterday, too, which probably wasn't the greatest idea, with all that sodium. But man, do I have to eat only whole foods when I'm cooking for him? Maybe so. I made it with pasta, one of his favorite things in the whole world. I actually used a whole-wheat penne because I've grown to want that texture, sometimes. It's just a completely different animal from regular pasta, the same way fresh pasta is just different from dried, a different beast. So while the pasta water was coming to a boil I diced and sauteed two sausages, then I added a sliced onion to that and sauteed it until all the slices were soft and brown. By then the pasta was in the water and I scooped a bit of the pasta cooking water into the pan with the sausage and onion, then put the lid on it to try to get the onions cooked even further. When the pasta was done I fished it out of the water with my slotted spoon and added it (and any water clinging to it) to the sausage and onions. Cooked a bit to meld the flavors. Todd and I ate ours with grated cheese on top. August had a hard time chewing the sausage, but part of the reason for that was he liked it so much he was getting his mouth too full of the sausage to actually chew - so out it comes. It's amazing what doesn't gross you out once you're a parent. I made chocolate pudding for dessert. August would have a bite, scrunch up his face and kind of smack his tongue against the roof of his mouth, like he was mulling it over, then open his mouth for more.

I'm a terrible googler. I've just spent an hour looking for a good food blog by a parent of a toddler; I want some recipe ideas. Right now my main challenge with August is to keep him from choking even though he only has four teeth (so chewing's not entirely natural for him). I'm also suddenly obsessed with things I've never thought much about before: pesticides on produce, hormones and antibiotics in meat, poultry, milk. Strong flavors are not necessarily out, but I'm pretty sure spicy foods are. If I spend more than 6 minutes at a time on something in the kitchen August starts to grab onto my knees. I love to find things he loves, though. I get this canned low-mercury tuna from FD, and he devours it (even though tuna's kind of a strong flavor). He likes medium-flavored cheese (I haven't tried stinky cheese, but the mild stuff isn't so interesting to him). He loved the pumpkin spice cookies I made and the marbled butter cookie from the local bakery, hated packaged zweiback. Doesn't like mashed potatoes, but likes sweet potatoes and the potato croquettes friends brought for Thanksgiving dinner. Full-fat yogurt. I've had success with frittatas, finger-friendly pastas (the one with tuna, peas and a little grated hard cheese was popular), meatballs. Simple baked white fish. Faux pho from The New American Cooking.

Hi, Kim, if you really want to go natural with baby food, next time you're cookingrice, try skimming the liquid just before it burbles over, then add some honey and your baby's choice of mashed fruit. And hey, tuna sounds good too. Just make sure it's dolphin-safe brand. But I digress here. 

Since you mentioned teeth, i should probably tell you my youngest was born with hers already out. 
Say Hi to August for me!

Good Food in Windsor, CO

I have Windsor-specific food memories from growing up there: krautburgers (baked dough pockets filled with cabbage and ground beef) during the harvest festival parade, the sharp vinegar soaking into the mild, sweet white buns of the Italian subs we always got from the local pizza place, the green chile from The Border. But it was a tiny town; there wasn't anyplace to go in Windsor on date night. We'd go over to Fort Collins for that. But now Windsor has at least two places to go for a date meal. One's a Hawaiian restaurant, if you can imagine: Okole Maluna Hawaiian Grill. When I heard that I imagined Spam and pineapple. But this was almost like a Japanese restaurant, with spare, elegant dishes. Todd started with the black bean soup, which was actually a broth-based soup with a couple of red beans and small disks of a Portugese sausage that gave the whole bowl with a sweet, meaty flavor. I had a soba salad with shredded romaine, and Todd went for the barbecued pork. Believe it or not, this was elegant, too. Two domes of sticky rice and a pile of smokey, shredded meat. He was disappointed because he was hoping for something from his childhood, a barbecued pork he got from a Hawaiian that came in chunks in a \"dry-ish sauce\" (I don't know). But he loved the soup and the Haupia, a coconut cream dessert that was like a flan or panna cotta with pulverized coconut. At the other place, Chimney Park Bistro, they go so far to serve local, seasonal ingredients that they actually had a couple of Colorado wines on the menu. I tried a Reisling from the Delta area, and it was citrusy and sweet, good for one glass but maybe a bit too sweet for more. Local also meant smoked trout on a deconstructed Waldorf with endive and buffalo instead of beef in the hamburger. The other highlight was the trio of creme brulees. The flavors change every few days and if you can guess all three, the dessert's on them. We didn't even come close: the first one tasted like eggnog, so we guessed nutmeg (the server said it was cinnamon, but I still don't believe it); the second one was chai. The third one was ethereal and familiar, kind of tart but with these crazy nuances I couldn't pin down. Lots of people had been guessing lemon, which was Todd's guess, but it was pink peppercorn. Had I ever had pink peppercorn? It was so familiar.

I first saw these on Chocolate and Zucchini; someone had bought her some in a store. Then I saw that Harry and David was selling them for the holidays, as I think a Scottish treat. So when the recipe popped up as one of Allrecipe's top Chirstmas cookies and they looked really easy to do, I tried them. And my family hoarded them. You make the shortbread layer first: Cut 2/3 cup butter up into small cubes, then put it in a bowl and let it come to room temperature. Add 1/4 cup sugar and 1 1/4 cup flour and mix, then press into the bottom of a 9-inch-square pan (I coated mine with cooking spray) and bake at 350 degrees for 20 minutes. While that bakes, make the caramel layer: Combine 1/2 cup each brown sugar, sweetened condensed milk and butter with 2 tablespoons light corn syrup. Bring to a boil and boil 5 minutes (I was nervous at this point and kept stirring it, and would stir up really brown parts, but that didn't hurt anything - I think the stirring off the heat gets everything even and fully incorporated), then remove from heat and stir vigorously for 3 minutes. Pour over baked shortbread and let it get firm. The last layer is just chocolate chips: melt 1 1/2 cup chocolate chips (I used bittersweet) and spread over the caramel. Refrigerate to set then cut into teeny-tiny squares.

So here I am again. I'm back from a 2-week-plus visit with my parents, when I clearly neglected my blog (even though I had plenty to write about, holidays and all). Now I'm home and feeling kind of lonely and that draws me back to the computer. It makes me wonder if this whole blogging thing is some sort of substitute for having family nearby. Could be. I know one of the reasons I started writing was to give faraway family and friends a little glimpse into my life, at least one part of it. Nothing wrong with that, right? Part of the reason I'm sad, though, is that August is such a social little guy and seems to love having lots of people around. I don't think I'm imagining that he's a little bit grumpy now that we're back. It's good that he loves visiting his grandparents, though, and it's good that it's special when it happens. I can't wait until he's old enough to enjoy anticipating the next visit. I am going to write about food coming up, particularly some caramel shortbread cookies I made for Christmas, a couple of great restaurants in the small town where my parents live, and a hoarde of new cookbooks I got for Christmas. Plus we've got to get rid of this design, right? Bear with me. I'm kind of slow about getting back to it.

This is a seed cluster from Vere: dark chocolate with poppy, sesame, sunflower and pumpkin seeds. It could go either way, interesting and nutty or just kind of weird. But definitely worth a try. Fiber, good fats, antioxidants: Vere chocolate has taken the news that dark chocolate can be beneficial to your health and run with it. They use sustainably-grown, pesticide-free ingredients and as little natural sugar as possible to emphasize the dark chocolate flavor. I can think of two people who might enjoy this: one friend who finds most desserts too sweet and my father, who is a sweet tooth who was diagnosed with a sweet tooth's challenge: diabetes. I liked it, too. Oh, and their web site just opened to take orders, just in time for Christmas or Chanukah orders (by December 21). Chocolate doesn't need a ton of sugar to be satisfying. In fact, I tried a Galler dark chocolate with walnuts that I really loved: The deep, earthy, slightly bitter nuts echoed the flavors of the chocolate. So good.

I've realized that \"drinking chocolate\" is a lot like a milkshake: They allow you to consume huge quantities of chocolate or ice cream, respectively, without even realizing you're doing it. They're like one of those girl drinks you get in a bar, where before you know it you're totally wasted. I can nibble on a dark chocolate bar, one square at a time, for a week. Or I can chop it all up, melt it down with some water and milk, and drink it in one sitting. And the recipes I've tried have ruined the more wholesome types of hot chocolate for me. The most recent recipe I tried was from Chocolove: Chop up one of their 3.2-ounce bars (they recommend 65 percent dark), combine it with 3/4 cup water and 2 tablespoons milk, then bring it to a boil and let it froth up. Serve in two demitasse cups. I've tried a lot of mint cocoas this year, too, and the Williams-Sonoma and Schokinag were very good. But I think Michael Chiarello had the best idea: adding peppermint schnapps. So a couple of dark chocolate bars, some demitasse cups, some candy can stirrers and a bottle of peppermint schnapps. Let it snow.

I had sticky toffee pudding during my one little trip to London a few years ago. This year I was determined to have it again for the holidays. I found a place online, the English Pudding Company and found that the Amish Market is supposed to carry it. But they didn’t, so I’ve been planning to order one online. Dean and Deluca sells the same one on their site. But then I bought the December issue of Bon Appetit, and they have a recipe for sticky toffee pudding. It’s very similar to the date cake with a broiled caramel topping my mom’s mother used to make (and I made once, with great success). So why order it if it’s so easy to make? But I never got around to making it either. I still have time, but I figured I’d share the recipe, and the order info, so you’d have time to do it, too. This is the recipe from Bon Appetit, but there are some variations on the Epicurious web site, too. Make the sauce by combining 1 3/4 cups brown sugar, 1 1/2 cups heavy cream, 6 tablespoons butter and 3 tablespoons light corn syrup in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil for about 8 minutes, until the sauce is reduced to about 2 cups. To make the cake, combine 2 cups chopped dates and 1 cup hot water in a saucepan and simmer about 5 minutes, until dates are soft. Cool, then stir in 1/4 teaspoon baking soda (in my grandma's recipe, you soak the dates in hot water). Sift 1 3/4 cups flour and 1/2 teaspoon each baking soda and salt together (I do it onto wax paper, which makes it easier to get into the bowl of the stand mixer later), then beat a cup of brown sugar with 3/4 cup softened butter in a large bowl to blend well. Add 3 eggs, one at a time, then 2 teaspoons vanilla. Stir in flour mixture, then dates (with liquid). Bake in a 13 x 9 inch pan lined with foil, then greased and floured, in a 350 oven for 30 minutes (or until a tester comes out clean). Then poke the cake full of holes with a toothpick and pour a cup of the caramel sauce over the top; bake until the topping bubbles, about 5 more minutes. Let cool to lukewarm, then serve with the rest of the sauce, reheated.

Bittman's Suggestion

Mark Bittman, last Wednesday morning, convinced me that I must have a cast-iron pan. As a new mom in the age of parental neurosis (it’s a miracle any of my generation is still around, what with the stomach sleeping and solid foods at three months), I dread making August a scrambled egg, because it means either making it in my regular pots and losing half the egg as it sticks to the surface or using my nonstick skillet, which (rumor has it) can release chemical fumes. Apparently a well-seasoned cast-iron pan is as good as nonstick. All along I’ve been thinking I need a cast-iron pan, if only to make good cornbread with crusty edges. I guess I never realized its versatility. It’s nonstick, but it browns. It holds heat evenly and for a long time, which I knew (I’ve been using mine as the top part of a MacGyvered sandwich press). Apparently Lodge has the market cornered and sells pre-seasoned pans (and they’re relatively cheap - around $20).

Loved this entry, Kim! I love my cast-iron pans, and they're definitely well seasoned. Lucky for me, my parents a few years ago went from a normal electric range to one of those glass-top ones, and my mother's ancient cast iron pans all had warped a bit over time and no longer worked well and she was forced to buy a new set. She then brought the old ones down to me in NYC, where I have a gas stovetop, so the slight warp doesn't really matter. They work like a charm. And they remind me of what my mom used to make in them.

I love giving magazines subscriptions as gifts. There's something out there for just about every interest (August is entering a phase where the 14 different dog magazines have him mesmerized for a relatively long time - about 30 seconds). It's easy to shop for them. And if the magazine's right on, the recipient gets a delicious anticipation when he or she checks the mail (except right after the magazine arrives). I learned how to cook, from almost no knowledge, by reading Cooking Light. I remember going to Barnes and Noble and grabbing a bunch of magazines off the rack and critiquing them all until I had narrowed them down to that title. Accessible, healthy, clear, with recipes at different skill levels and from all over the world. I liked the column that taught a new skill, with recipes, each month, and the column that explored a new cuisine. The fast recipe feature was also useful. A couple of the dessert recipes were duds, but most of the savory entries turned out well and had a lot of flavor. My first supper club met through the Cooking Light web site. It's been years since I've subscribed to this magazine, but I still think it's a good one for anyone who doesn't spend a lot of time in the kitchen but would like to do more cooking, especially if it's to eat healthier.

I know that O Olive Oil with Meyer Lemon is old news, but I finally had the opportunity to try it and it has inspired me. I have a olive-oil cake that I'm dying to make with it, but that's only one of endless ideas. I found out this Thanksgiving that it's great on vegetables. Fish is a given. I've heard of a pie crust recipe made with oil that you pat into the plate and I'm thinking it might be a good addition to that. Bean salads. Bruscetta or just as a dipping oil. Drizzled over tuna for a salad nicoise. Toss with couscous or roasted potatoes. But move over green bean casserole - I used this on our green beans for Thanksgiving this year, and at least half the people who ate them said something to me about them (even Todd, who hates green beans). It was a recipe from Epicurious for green beans with pine nuts, parsley and lemon zest. First trim 1 1/2 pounds (I would halve the recipe next time) fresh green beans and cut into 1/2-inch pieces. Blanch for 5 minutes, then drain and toss with 2 tablespoons chopped parsley, the zest of one lemon, 1/4 cup olive oil (I used the lemon olive oil) and salt and pepper to taste. I did this in the pan where I blanched the beans then, because we like our beans more tender than crisp, I put the lid back on and let them sort of steam with the carryover heat. They ended up perfect. I also ordered a gift box from O with their new blood orange olive oil, ginger rice wine vinegar and soy vinegar, but they sent the wrong box so I haven't had the chance to try it yet. Really smooth with the returns/sending a new package, though.

Food gifts are the perfect things to tuck into a stocking for Christmas morning, and jars of spices could be a nice surprise for the right recipient. Some spices are so beautiful they wouldn't need to be wrapped. A glass vial of vanilla beans from Penzey's wouldn't even need a bow; neither would a packet of nutmeg, cinnamon sticks and star anise. Or you could go with a theme, like hot cocoa, and include a jar of natural cocoa powder (my preference for drinking cocoa, although others prefer dutched, which Penzey's also carries), vanilla sugar and Vietnamese cassia cinnamon, crystallized ginger or cayenne pepper for an extra kick. Their vanilla extracts include a whole vanilla bean in the bottle, which could be the centerpiece for a set of extracts that also includes almond, orange and lemon. A vial of saffron would be another pretty surprise, or a jar of Hungarian paprika with a recipe for goulash enclosed (Todd had a fantastic goulash that was almost chalky with paprika at Cafe Sabarsky last weekend). A selection of chile powders and peppers, a peppercorn mix and fleur de sel, or some garam masala and rogan josh seasoning are other options.

These stemless wineglasses, from Reidel's O series, are everywhere lately, and they're so cool-looking I had to mention them. This photo is from Sur La Table's web site. They also sell cute little tapas plates that set on top of wineglasses, which might be a fun addition. A pair of Reidel O glasses, some tapas plates, maybe some marcona almonds or really nice canned tuna or anchovies.

My father-in-law is a big eater. But I think even he was cowed by the 4 1/2 pound loaf of bread I sent to him from Zingerman's. The folks there claim bigger bread is better, and their bread is pretty hearty, with a thick, strong crust that stands up well to freezing. I just imagine it's so much fun to get this big, beautiful wheel of bread in the mail. It'd be even better with one of Zingerman's olive oils. They break their selection down into light and elegant, buttery and smooth, assertive but smooth, and, my favorite, rustic and fruity. I liked the San Vito I bought; it made great mashed potatoes for Thanksgiving: Just cover six big, peeled russets that have been cut in thirds in cold water and cook for 40 minutes, then save 1 1/2 cups of the cooking water and drain the rest. Put potatoes back in hot pot to get rid of excess moisture, then mash, adding 6 tablespoons of flavorful olive oil, salt, pepper and as much of the cooking water as you need to get the right texture. A sweet alternative to their olive oils would be a loaf of their bread with one of their varietal honeys. The most interesting ones were sold out when I placed my order, but maybe they'll get some of them back in stock in time. Meanwhile I bought some tupelo honey but haven't sampled it yet. I've been in love with Zingerman's since Todd bought me an Italian-food gift box from them a couple years back, but in planning to write gift suggestions from the site I've realized my experience with them has been hit or miss. I loved the pasta, Zingerman's balsamic vinegar, vodka sauce, bread and olive oil I received, but he also ordered me a package of drinking chocolate that contained cornstarch and ended up the consistency of pudding and a subscription to the newsletter, which I only received once (I'm sure they'd rectify the error if I contacted them; once they sent the wrong type of vinegar and promptly sent out the right one, letting me keep their mistake). The stollen was tempting but ultimately $30 seemed like too much to pay. The chocolate-stuffed figs weren't figgy enough, the big tin of oatmeal was more like Cream of Wheat, without that heartier, fuller texture I wanted. So choose with caution. Or leave the choosing to the folks at Zingerman's. One of my fantasy gifts (fantasy because prices go up to $600 for four shipments) is a subscription to the Z Club. They send a big box of rare, seasonal or exclusive food with lots of information about its origins and how to use it. Decadent.

Pretty little cakes are the perfect thing to package up, maybe with some coffee or tea, to give to a coworker or friend. Todd gave me a mini-bundt pan one year, and it's an easy way to make any quick bread recipe pretty cute. A couple years ago I made lemon-rosemary cakes out of Woman's Day. This time I made orange-scented cranberry-pecan cakes. The quick breads with fruit or nuts in them don't turn out quite as neat in the mini bundts, but they didn't look too bad. I made one fruit-and-nut-free for August, too. The recipe called for 1 1/2 cups fresh cranberries, but I had dried, so I used 1 cup and soaked them in orange liquer overnight. Then I sifted together 2 cups flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt and the zest of one orange. Tossed the drained, patted-dry cranberries and 1/2 cup pecans with a couple tablespoons of the flour mixture. Then mixed 1/4 cup softened butter with 1 cup sugar and 1 egg. Stirred in 3/4 cup orange juice, then the remaining flour mixture. Made one bundt for August, then stirred the nuts and cranberries into the rest. Baked in 350 degree oven for half an hour.

I never thought I was much of a tea drinker until Todd brought home some loose tea from London. I don't know; it just tastes more complex, smells deeper and fuller. It could be the more visceral experience of brewing loose tea has me fooled, but I like it. And then Adagio offered samples of some of their teas. I chose decaf teas in flavors that true tea drinkers would probably avoid, but Adagio pulls it off really well, using quality teas as a base for their flavored tea. The citron tea had an earthy, green tea base (and made great iced tea), and the spice and vanilla flavors were black teas with real ingredients, such as bits of cinnamon stick and dried citrus peel. Especially for the holidays they have some yummy-sounding flavors: candy cane (a black tea with pieces of peppermint candy in it; the above photo is this tea, from their web site), gingerbread, pumpkin spice, chestnut (with roasted chestnuts in a black tea), candy apple and cranberry. They also offer a one-cup tea infuser called IngenuiTea. It's a clear-plastic cup in which you combine enough tea and hot water for one person. When the tea reaches your preferred strength (which you can see easily because the infuser is clear), place the contraption over a cup and just the brewed tea dispenses. I like this better than those tea balls because it's easier to get the tea out at the end. It's pretty utilitarian, though, so if you want something pretty they have a nice selection of teapots, too. Just add a couple varieties of tea (and maybe some tea cakes) and you have a really nice gift for someone who enjoys a cuppa.

When I wrote the title for this it reminded me of that Seinfeld episode when Elaine eats an antique slice of wedding cake that her boss had won in an auction. I think she ended up violently sick. That really has nothing to do with Chocolove's Chocolador box of vintage, single-origin chocolates, but it tells you a little bit more about me, doesn't it? Chocolove's theory is that good chocolate, particularly single-origin chocolates, which seem to be the chocolate trend of the day (although I haven't been paying much attention; it could've been going on for years), change (hopefully improve) with age, like wine or cheese. So this nice-looking box contains two different vintages, 1999 and 2004, of the company's three single-origin chocolates: a 33 percent from Java, a 60 percent from Grenada and a 70 percent from Sao Tome. It also contains their basic milk and dark chocolate bars. Big bars. I tried the milk chocolate, which I normally don't like, at the Chocolate Show and fell in love with its buttery flavor. So this is a chocolate-tasting party in a box. At least that's what I'm hoping to do with the sample they sent to me. Or it's a perfect introduction to different chocolate varietals for the chocolate-lover on your list.

I know it's fruitcake, but let's call it retro. I didn't really like the look of the Collin Street Bakery fruitcakes when they arrived, but the pecan-apricot cake grew on me to the extent that it vanished pretty quickly (I convinced myself that fruitcake was a perfectly appropriate breakfast food one morning). The first ingredient listed is pecans, next the fruit. There's barely enough cake to hold the whole thing together, and no booze. My mother-in-law, Linda, and I discovered that if you eat it in a big, thick piece it's overwhelming and kind of cloying, but thin slices give you a cross-section of nuts, fruit and cake that's rich and dense, like a panforte. Since dried fruits and nuts are a favorite snack of mine, it was hard to keep out of these. Three pecan cakes (pineapple, apricot and traditional fruitcake) cost $40, but shipping is free and they last up to 3 months in the fridge.

Heather's grandfather gives us a fruitcake from Colin Street every year (4 years & counting; I expect no less this Christmas). I think he used to drive out there to get it, but lately he's let the USPS do the legwork. I can handle about 3 really thin slices over the course of a week or so, and I'm good until the next Christmas.

Underneath the dust jacket of the new Woman's Day cookbook is a cover that perfectly reflects what's inside: straightforward, useful, but with a little flair that keeps it from being boring. I used to work at the magazine and after I left I proofread this freelance, and in the process I found lots of recipes to try: bulgur meatballs in tomato sauce, mocha-hazelnut granita, chickpea and sweet potato stew, nana's spoon bread. It has a well-rounded selection of about 20 slow-cooker recipes that don't all sound like the same jumble. The last chapter contains menus for different special occasions, but throughout the book there's also meatloaf, mac and cheese (which I made for August on his birthday and he loved), cheesecake, spaghetti and meatballs, chili. There's a turkey roasting time chart and a Thanksgiving planner. Of course only time will tell, but I think I'll end up reaching for this book a lot.

It takes an amazing amount of willpower for me to give someone a sweater, a candle, a DVD for Christmas. The word \"gift\" to me is synonymous with \"food.\" Everyone eats, right? And as an apartment dweller I can appreciate the value of receiving a consumable that won't take up space indefinitely. Plus people gather in large groups during the holidays, so there are plenty of opportunities for your recipient to put out something tasty. I wanted to try everything I put on this list, which I will dole out one item a day until it's too late to sneak something else under the tree, but limited finances and time meant that some things still just sound good to me (and I'll point out which ones those are). Before a glut of Christmas cookies makes the whole idea stale (harhar), here are a couple traditional gems that have had the opportunity to make me pretty popular this time of year. Jam Thumbprints I made these for a cookie exchange at work, then the editor-in-chief got the recipe from me so she could make them for the whole staff the following year. Cream 1 1/2 cups softened butter with 1 1/2 cups white sugar and 8 ounces of softened cream cheese. Beat in 2 eggs, one at a time, then 2 tablespoons of lemon juice and 1 1/2 teaspoons of lemon zest. Mix together 4 1/2 cups flour and 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, then stir into the butter mixture. Cover and chill to firm up, about 1 hour. Roll into tablespoon-sized balls, then make an indention in them and put a 1/2 teaspoon of apricot preserve in each one (you'll need about a cup of preserve). Bake at 350 degrees about 15 minutes, until they're starting to get golden. Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons I entered these in the only cookie contest I've ever entered and they did not win, but the test kitchen made a variation of them for their cookie cookbook the following year. In a saucepan stir 4 egg whites, 1 1/3 cups sugar, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 2 1/2 cups coconut, then sift in 1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons flour and stir the mixture to combine. Cook over moderate heat, stirring constantly, for 5 minutes; increase the heat to moderately high and cook the mixture, stirring constantly, for 3 to 5 minutes more, or until it is thickened and begins to pull away from the bottom and side of the pan. Transfer the mixture to a bowl, let it cool slightly, and chill it, its surface covered with plastic wrap, until it is just cold. Bake heaping teaspoons of the dough in a 300°F. oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they are pale golden. Cool on a rack, then melt 8 ounces chopped chocolate and dip bottoms of macaroons in chocolate. Place on wax paper to set. I refrigerated mine to keep the chocolate from melting again.

I've had a fantasy about August's first birthday since maybe even before he was born. A giddy baby smashing into his birthday cake, crumbs flying everywhere. Well, it turns out my boy is too demure for that. He delicately picked up his cake and took a bite out of it, then picked pieces off of it and put them in his mouth. Fortunately he smeared chocolate frosting all over his face in the process, so my fantasy was somewhat fulfilled. What he really dug into with gusto was the baked mac and cheese I made for lunch that day. A pretty simple recipe, made with a pound of rotini and a basic bechamel with Cheddar, Monterey Jack (I wanted to make it mild-flavored for August) and locatelli. I tore up the breadcrumbs by hand because I didn't want to get out the food processor. The chocolate frosting was actually pretty good, just a recipe off the back of the Hershey's cocoa powder container. 1/2 cup melted butter mixed with 2/3 cup cocoa powder, then 1/3 cup of milk alternately with 3 cups powdered sugar. Add powdered sugar or milk to get desired consistency, then add 1 teaspoon vanilla.

They signal to the consumer that this is serious business by taking away all the choices that Starbucks is usually known (and mocked) for. It comes in one size (in a espresso-size cup) and there's no low-foam, decaf, no-fat or flavor shots (although that could have some potential, right?). The best thing about this was the texture, kind of chalky, like a high-cocoa-percentage chocolate. It fills your mouth in a really satisfying way. I like my cocoa less sweet, though, in most cases, and it was more milky than the two recipes I've tried at home.

So I'm standing in the Metropolitan Pavilion, hoardes of chocolate fans coursing around me (baby on one arm, chocolate-covered potato sticks in another). And more than half of these hurried New Yorkers are smiling at me, cooing at the baby. I'm handing over lavender-scented milk chocolate to junior chocoholics who can't get to the booth because of my overhung and overflowing stroller, and there's a smile on my face, too. It's chocolate euphoria. And it has convinced me that the world would indeed be a better place if we all had our daily dose of chocolate, right along with the vitamins (instead of the vitamins?). Maybe it's because this is where I was looking, but I noticed three things going on all over the place at the show: low-sugar, no-sugar (works because people love their bittersweet these days) and theraputic chocolates, drinking chocolate and single-origin chocolates. What I bought: NewTree's lavender-infused milk chocolate (part of their \"mood-enhancing\" line of dark and milk chocolates with botanical extracts; this was my favorite, even though I think of myself as more of a dark-chocoholic). Chocolats Pralus tower of single-origin chocolates, since my palate was so chocolate-fatigued that I couldn't taste the difference between most of these varietals and I wanted to do a proper chocolate tasting. E. Guittard had a nice collection of single-origin chocolates, too, that I could not taste the difference between. Chocolove had a collection of single-origin, 2004 vintage chocolates in three different cacao concentrations: 70 percent, from Sao Tome; 60 percent, from Grenada; and 33 percent, from Java. The last chocolate had a smooth, buttery flavor that surprised me. The woman working the booth said that the flavors of the various varietals will develop and change with time, like wine (the bitterness of the 70 percent smoothing out, the 33 percent developing more coconut flavor). I was already a fan of Chocolove's Ginger chocolate so it was fun to try some other flavors. A Michel Cluizel bittersweet chocolate round with different nuts and dried fruit on it (pictured). What I wish I had bought: Schokinag's mint and Dagoba's Xocolatl hot chocolate with chiles and cinnamon (it's one of their new line of hot chocolates; I've used this flavor chocolate bar, with chilies and cocoa nibs, to make hot chocolate, and it's fantastic). Schokinag also had a Moroccan spice that wasn't quite spicy enough for me (maybe it was the milk to mix ratio they used when they made it). Galler's no-sugar dark chocolate with toasted walnuts. The warm, toasty nut taste mellowed the bitterness of the chocolate so you didn't miss the sugar at all. Vere's collection of stacks, particularly to try the seed stack: dark-chocolate covered toasted pumpkin, poppy and sesame seeds. This is a new company with a factory in Manhattan that sources milk from a local dairy (Ronnybrook) and beans from Equador, then processes them in a way to double the antioxidents and mellow the bitterness so less sugar is needed. Their chocolates are unofficially diabetics-friendly and officially gluten-free (the dense, rich brownie I sampled was made with almond flour), and their packaging is simple and modern.

Hey Kim, just found your blog off of GINY's blog. Great post about the chocolates you bought, and the ones you let get away :) 
Glad to have found a new NY blog to visit.

I made the Cook's Illustrated version of hot cocoa, but I feel like I need to do it again, not because it didn't turn out well, but because I was missing a couple of ingredients so I made some substitutions. While some authors might approve of my tinkering, that's not really of the whole Cook's Illustrated spirit. The Cook's Illustrated recipe called for Dutched cocoa and I used regular. After reading the Zingerman's description of the differences between the two (the dutching process smooths out the acidity of the cocoa and results in a less-strong flavor) I feel like maybe I'll like the natural cocoa powder better anyway. Only one way to find out. I also omitted the shot of half-and-half the Cook's Illustrated takes at the end, only because I didn't have any. I liked what I ended up with, though. It's very similar in process to the recipe from Bittersweet and the results are about the same (maybe a bit less rich and a bit more bite), plus it's a little bit easier because there's no chocolate to chop. Whisk together 3 tablespoons of natural cocoa, 2 tablespoons of sugar and a pinch of salt. Whisk in 1/2 cup water and simmer, whisking, for a couple of minutes (they say this cooks the cocoa and allows it to bloom, releasing the fruit, chocolate and coffee flavors and giving it a toasty undertone). Add 1 1/2 cups low-fat milk and heat until bubbles form around the edge (do not boil). Stir in a dash of vanilla extract.

I made quiche today, a very ladies-luncheon thing to serve one of my mom-friends who's expecting her second. Spinach for folic acid, an aged jack cheese for a salty sharpness, omega-3-fortified eggs for that little developing brain. I used a mixture of milk and half-and-half to get some richness without too much fat and a prepared refrigerated crust and frozen chopped spinach because my baby boy is teething and not the most reliable napper lately (timesavers). I parbaked the crust in a 9-inch pie plate in a 450 degree oven, under foil and pie weights (rice, because I love the toasty rice smell it makes) for 9 minutes and 4 minutes without. Then I turned the oven down to 325 degrees. Meanwhile I mixed 3/4 cup each milk and half-and-half with 3 eggs, salt, nutmeg and thawed frozen chopped spinach I had squeezed dry. Added about a cup of shredded cheese that I had tossed with about a tablespoon of flour. Poured that into the still-warm crust and baked it at the lower temperature for almost an hour. I had to cover the edge of the crust with foil to keep it from burning (starting to think a pie shield would be a good idea). It turned out pretty good, kind of a soft set custard with lots of spinach.

I really got in the mood for a spinach quiche the other day because of your entry here. So I made one that I make sometimes, from the Enchanted Broccoli Forest cookbook. (Sounds like yours but I use all milk (no half-and-half), swiss cheese (not jack) and some whole wheat flour in my crust.) Eric and I both enjoyed it a lot, even though he kept reminding me that \"real men\" should probably eat something else for dinner. :) Thanks for the suggestion!

So Todd brings me food from exotic locales when he goes on business trips, which is often fun. This time he brought back a set of preserves: lingonberry, cloudberry and cranberry. Turns out the cranberry fits in perfectly with the other two. Lingonberries are tiny little reddish berries that are really, really tart. Todd said he was serves lingonberry preserves and a traditional Lapland restaurant alongside a meat dish, like turkey and cranberries. I remembered Marcus Samuelsson's recipes for whipped lingonberry cream with his Swedish pancakes, so I used some of my preserves in a pale approximation, over good-old U.S. pancakes with sweetened whipped cream. it was OK but I think I want to try some more authentic uses for them, like meatballs with lingonberries or Samuelsson's more crepelike pancakes with a mixed cream.

Hi Kim,
Can't get into copydesk. We've been down a few hours so I thought I'd check your blog. I was raised with lingonberries prepared as a condiment and used the way cranberries are here. Don't recall having them in whipped cream, but rather with roast meats or poultry. I think especially with duck to cut the fattiness. 
How are you? August has a birthday coming up as I recall. What a big boy he must be. All iis well here. Not much changed. George pretty OK. He'll have hernia surgery early December. Hopefully it can wait until after Thanksgiving. We plan to go to Claudia's in VA and would hate to have to cancel.
I'll go back to your blog now and see what you've written before the berry piece. Best to Todd.

I picked up a copy of Weekend, a new magazine that seems geared toward a kind of casually upscale lifestyle (everyone in it seems to have a second home). The brownies have malt powder and malt balls (not sure I liked these in there, either - the candy kind of melted and got really crunchy, and the chocolate coating was kind of waxy after baking). The brownie part was rich and intensely chocolate, though, and worth a second try. I made a half-recipe. Sifted together 1/2 cup each flour and malted milk powder (I used chocolate malt Ovaltine, which may have added to the rich chocolate flavor but kept me from tasting the malt), 2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 1/8 teaspoon baking powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Melt 1/2 cup butter and 4 ounces unsweetened chocolate in a large saucepan, then add 1/2 cup each dark brown sugar and regular sugar. Add 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 2 eggs. Stir in flour then 3/4 cup maltballs. Bake in 9-inch square pan in 300 degree oven for 45 minutes.

Last winter I really wanted to get to City Bakery for their weekly hot chocolate flavors, but I was homebound with a newborn so I didn't get into town once. This winter I have a 1-year-old, so we are going to spend some time at City Bakery. I'm also going to experiment with different hot chocolate and hot cocoa recipes to see what I think. This first recipe I tried, in honor of Lovescool's Sugar High Friday dark chocolate theme, was Alice Medrich's recipe from Bittersweet, which I made with a 73 percent dark chocolate that had chiles and cocoa nibs in it. I had made her recipe before and added a pinch of chile powder and I loved the two kinds of heat compounding one another: Is it the temperature heat or the spice heat that has me wanting to rip off my turtleneck? I like this recipe because Medrich uses a combination of water and milk to let the chocolate flavor shine through without creating something too milky and rich. Chop 3 ounces of dark chocolate and put it in a small saucepan, then pour over it about half of a 3/4 cup of boiling water. Stir to melt the chocolate, then add the rest of the boiling water and 3/4 cup milk. Bring just under a boil; serves 2.

Tuesday I went over to a friend's and we made an orange-glazed apple pie that was really good. Rebecca is one of those people who can throw together a fabulous, flakey crust and make it look easy. Which is why I felt the need to try it at home yesterday. It was raining and I thought a baking project was a good idea. I also cooked dinner and did a couple loads of laundry (even though I had to take the stairs - with baby, laundry and detergent in hand - because the elevator is not working). It actually went pretty well, considering, and I think I've gotten enough pie crusts under my belt that I'm getting better at it. While the process went well, this crust didn't turn out that great, kind of crumbly, maybe because I overworked it or because I used unbleached flour (which I've read has more gluten than bleached). I used six cups of four different kinds of apples: ginger gold, gala, granny smith and macintosh. I tossed the slices with a couple tablespoons of flour, a big teaspoon of cinnamon, some fresh nutmeg gratings and a couple handfuls of sugar. I made a crumb topping because I didn't have enough butter for a second crust (1/2 cup each flour and brown sugar and 3 tablespoons butter worked together with my fingers). I liked this filling/crumb combo, even though I think they both needed more flavor, maybe some ginger, orange or more cinnamon. I usually go for oatmeal and nuts in the topping but I enjoyed the straightforward simplicity and crunchiness of this topping. The filling held together perfectly for a very neat slice.

I thought of making this when we had some leftover flat beer from a big bottle Todd bought Cooperstown. We made chili instead, but I still think this would be good with some beer in it, maybe subbed in for some of the water. This starts with 1/4 cup butter melted in a Dutch oven (auspicious beginning, no?). Then you sprinkle 1/2 cup flour over it and stir that together until all the butter is absorbed and you have a paste. Take that out and set aside, then add 5 cups water, a head's worth of broccoli florets (I don't have time to cut up broccoli anymore so I bought mine this way), bouillon for 5 cups of stock, salt and pepper. Simmer than for about 1/2 hour, then whisk the flour mixture back in a little bit at a time and simmer for a few minutes to thicken. Then stir in some half-and-half, a couple cups of shredded Cheddar and a few gratings of nutmeg.

Yesterday was such a beautiful fall day that I had to pull out my corduroys, mull some cider and bake a spice cake. I've been racing against time to use up a backlog of dairy products that are nearing expiration, so this was a recipe off the Dannon web site that used plain yogurt. It got that weird, shiny, craterish top, but the cake underneath was moist and cakey. I think I'd add more spice, though. Maybe a little dry mustard or some pepper. The cinnamon I bought from Zingerman's has a subtle undercurrent of heat that would've added some zing in a higher dose, too. I creamed a stick of butter (1/2 cup), then added a cup of packed brown sugar and creamed it until it was fluffy. Then added an egg and a teaspoon of vanilla, mixed, then a cup of plain yogurt. Mixed again, then stirred in a combination of 2 1/2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon each cinnamon, freshly grated nutmeg and baking soda and 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves. The recipe called for a cup of raisins, but all I had were mixed dried fruit bits (dates, raisins, dried cranberries, dried apples, etc) so I substituted that, which was a popular choice for my raisin-hating husband (I think I liked it better, too). Baked in a 350 degree oven for almost 50 minutes. I've been examining my relationship to food a little too much lately, I think. What does it mean that it gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling to return from a bundled-up walk to the spicy smell of baked goods or to sip hot cider while giving my baby a taste of his first cake?

Although I've been writing this blog for a (relatively) long time, this is the first time I've been tagged for a meme, by The Wednesday Chef. I'm to go back to my 23rd entry (May 7, 2003) and rerecord my 5th line. Unfortunately it's not a very interesting one: I also sauteed some bulk turkey sausage and then added sliced garlic (which burned while I wasn't paying attention so I picked it all out and threw it away) and some broccoli. Three things struck me when I read this over. First, I have a tendancy to try to fit the whole recipe in one sentence. I guess I imagine it gets across how easy whatever I'm making is to do (but probably just muddies the whole recipe). Second, that I burned garlic in the pan and didn't throw the entire pan out. I wish I could remember how it tasted; I just wonder if my standards have changed since 2003. Third, the entry was labeled Comfort Food and polenta was the star of the dish, so I'm just struck by how \"comfort food\" always means carbs to me and now I know there's a scientific reason behind it. When I wrote this my life was so different. I didn't have to chop furtively while the baby naps. I worked in an office with a test kitchen. My zeal for cooking was fresh, and every technique and ingredient was new. (Not that I'm an old hand at it now, but 2 1/2 years does make a difference.) I still turn to food for comfort, though. In fact, I've been wondering lately if I do it too much, but reading my old entry give me some reassurance, because it's not a new development, and I think it's just fine. I realized that I'll never post this if I have to come up with 5 folks who would appreciate being tagged, so I'll just list out the 2 I think would like it, and if anyone else wants to give it a go you can e-mail me to let me know. Julie's blog, Juggling in My Kitchen, is so new that she might have to alter the rules to come up with something (maybe 23rd line, 5th word?). And the Crash Test Kitchen folks (www.crashtestkitchen.com) seem so game, I think they might like to give it a go (if they haven't been tagged already).

Eating Out Around the Lakes

***CONTENT
Eating out during our visit to the Finger Lakes was an extremely frustrating experience. August goes to bed around 7, 8 at the latest, so dinner out wasn't really an option (I also feel weird about taking him to a nice place for dinner). I had picked out a few restaurants, most of them at wineries, but found out that during the off season most of them don't serve lunch, and many of them aren't open early in the week, which was when we were there. Most of the time I found this out in advance, but we had one very frustrating day where we showed up and the place was closed, so we ended up at Denny's. I did have a few good meals, even if it wasn't fine dining. Market Street in Corning was destroyed by flooding a couple decades back and was rebuilt as a nice, pedestrian-friendly shopping district. I can't help but feel it caters mainly to those who work for the glass company Corning, which has offices nearby; it almost felt like it was part of a Corning \"campus,\" especially since most of the shops were closed on Sunday and it was really a ghost town. But we managed to find a good pizza place that was open and seemed to attract lots of locals. We also went to Old World Cafe for lunch one day and topped off the meal with some Purity ice cream, which is a \"crunchy\" (in a Moosewood sort of way) Ithaca brand. I tried the pumpkin, which seemed a little crumbly, but Todd's over-the-top combo of all sorts of nuts and caramel and fudge was creamy and good (I think pumpkin ice cream just tends to be a little bit crumbly, I guess because a lot of the cream is replaced with the squash). In Skaneateles (which is the place to stay if you like upper-scale touristy little lakefront villages) we had a memorable meal at Doug's Fish Fry, where they get fish from Boston 5 times a week and have placards on their posted menu that say when the different seafood came in. Also fantastic soft-serve custard, which we ate in a fresh peach sundae. I gave August a little bit of the creamy, mild fish, which he didn't seem to mind. It has a fantastic thick crust that almost seems to seal the fish in and steam it. In Rochester we tracked down the original Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, and though I haven't been to the NY one I am sure they haven't been able to reproduce the \"genuine honkey-tonk\" vibe of the place. First, it's in Rochester, which overall seems to be an armpit of a city (we could've missed the beautiful areas of the city, but if so they're hiding them pretty well). It's right next to a river, which it has views of, but it's a skanky looking, spider infested river. One of the waitresses came over to coo at August and said, \"Are you flirting with the hot Dino girls?\" So I had to have a beer and some ribs, which were really good, with decent coleslaw and dirty corn. Todd had a gumbo side that was fantastic, rich and gumbo-ey. It made me wonder what that gumbo flavor is. Is it a dark roux? What is file? Is that in there? Because a couple days later he had gumbo at Doug's that was basically minestrone with shrimp and okra. I wasn't impressed by Todd's brisket and pulled pork, but I gather from the menu that the chicken's the thing there. Key lime pie was good, but sweet potato was teeth-achingly sweet.

We spent last week in the Finger Lakes, and I made it into a gigantic shopping trip, so we came home with a huge load of food: Red Jacket Orchard turned out to be a farmstand on an ugly stretch of commercial highway, but I did pick up some apples, maple syrup and a New Hope Mills whole wheat pancake mix. It was our first stop and these items were my priority. Arbor Hill Grapery was pretty touristy and commercial, but we tasted some things we liked there, including their classic traminette, a wine grape developed, I think, at Cornell specifically for the region (which is temperate because of all the lakes) from the Gewurztraminer grape. To me this seems even more drinkable than the Alsatian wine (which I like), spicy and fruity and really easy going down. We also got some Gewurtz jelly and balsamic-style vinegar. One of my favorite stops was at Bellwether (hard cider), where the proprieter apologized for not being dressed up because they were bottling on the day I visited and then told me about Johnny Appleseed, who was basically a bootlegger, planting apple seeds for hard cider (since apples from seeds are unreliable and rarely edible). We brought home a bottle of his Liberty Spy Hard Cider and some peach-tamarind chutney. Maybe part of the reason I enjoyed Bellwether so much was because the day before we stopped at Belhurst castle and tried some of their wines. The woman doing the tasting rushed me to choose what I wanted to try, and when she left mid-tasting the man who took over gave me the same spiel, verbatim. Just employees, and it felt like it. I bought a bottle there anyway; meant to get a cabernet franc and picked up a merlot by mistake, which I hadn't even tried. Todd took a tour of the Ommegang brewery (while I sat in the car with the sleeping baby) and bought a giant bottle of the Abby Ale, which he had tried in a restaurant the night before and loved. Really smooth (it didn't give me that bitter beer shiver I usually get). The New Hope Mills factory shop isn't much to look at, and after hunting it down we felt like fools until I went inside. Dollar bags of oatmeal, ground almonds, steel-cut oats and other flours. I also got cornmeal and, because we needed a snack, s'mores snack mix, maltballs and dried fruit. We missed the grape festival in Naples by just a few days, so I had to pick up some grape cookies (Todd says they're like fig newtons, but I thought they were more like soft sugar cookies folded in half over a grape filling), peaches and gourds at Joseph's Wayside Stand. At the Cooperstown farmers' market I rounded out my shopping with a tomato, zucchini, eggplant, buttercup squash and an English tea cakes sampler, which included a Welsh cookie, which looked like a scone but crumbled like a cookie, and three tarts: lemon, pecan and almond-cake. Also got a sunshine squash (or something like that) at the farmers' market in Ithaca.

Kim,
That is AMAZING!  We went to Bellwether,too!  We bought 3 bottles there.  There were 2 Cornell college students doing the tasting that day and they were wonderful.  We stopped at a few other wineries but didn't even try anything because it was so incredibly busy.  It was a Saturday morning and a bus was bringing these people from winery to winery- I think by the time we got there they were pretty tipsy.  I wouldn't mind going on one of those tours by bus sometime!

Fascinating to read about the Finger Lakes from the point of view of a visitor, having lived here for years. I recommend hitting the wineries in the summer NOT ON A SATURDAY or SUNDAY. The service is better, the traffic is safer, and the food is still just as good.

Whenever I have an ingredient left over from a recipe I feel a lot of pressure to use it up before it goes bad. Dairy is particularly stressful, so some buttermilk I had in the fridge was making me crazy. Since buttermilk is about the same thing as yogurt, I decided to make a lassi, and it was really great, cool and refreshing (yes, refreshing; must be the tartness that keeps it from being dairy overkill). I thought strawberry and buttermilk were a traditional combo, but then I've been wanting to make a cardamom lassi. It was so easy to just throw into the blender a couple of green cardamom pods, a few frozen strawberries, sugar to taste and about 1 1/2 cups buttermilk. I let it sit in the fridge for a while to marry the flavors and get it nice and cool.

I ate this combo for lunch yesterday and for dinner tonight, in two different guises. Tonight I dressed mixed greens with a balsamic-style cider vinaigrette, then tossed them with cubed cantal, diced apple and toasted walnuts. It was a great combo, the crisp, tart, sweet apple and bitterness from the greens and walnuts balancing the richness of the cheese and olive oil in the dressing. Yesterday for lunch I split a roll, layered on shredded cantal, a slice of ham, thinly sliced apple, another layer of cheese and some mustard, then wrapped it in foil and baked it for 10 minutes.

Fresh Direct has introduced a lot more prepared foods, now organized as full meals for two or four (with two different categories, Fast Meals and Sunday Dinners, which are basically Cheap and Expensive, respectively). So I ordered the meatball dinner for four and stretched it into a week of meals for Todd and I (August is still on the pureed stuff). It came with spaghetti (which heated up amazingly well and was really quite good), meatballs, ciabatta rolls and salad. Night 1 was the spaghetti and meatballs with some of the salad. Night 2, open-faced meatball sandwiches on the ciabatta rolls with provolone melted over the top. Night 3 I started adding other ingredients, a couple slices each turkey, ham and Swiss, sliced hard-boiled egg and dressing for a chef's salad. Night 4, the rest of the pasta tossed with some homemade pesto. We still have a couple of rolls left, but that pretty much used up the whole meal. At $22 and maybe another $5 for other ingredients, it was still cheaper than takeout. And the convenience was worth it to me.

Fresh Direct has introduced a lot more prepared foods, now organized as full meals for two or four (with two different categories, Fast Meals and Sunday Dinners, which are basically Cheap and Expensive, respectively). So I ordered the meatball dinner for four and stretched it into a week of meals for Todd and I (August is still on the pureed stuff). It came with spaghetti (which heated up amazingly well and was really quite good), meatballs, ciabatta rolls and salad. Night 1 was the spaghetti and meatballs with some of the salad.

My friend Lisa gets a garden plot during the summer where she works, and this year she had a bumper crop of colorful tomatoes, which I plundered to make this tart. (I shared with her, so I don't think she minds.) It was so easy to do, too, that I'm tempted to go out and get more 'maters to make another one for a mom-friend on Tuesday. I just rolled out a sheet of puff pastry dough a bit (to 1/8-of-an-inch-ish) and poked it all over with a fork to keep it from puffing up, leaving 1-inch edges unmarked. Then I baked it at 425 degrees for 5 minutes to get it kind of brown. The fork trick hadn't worked, so I just poked the center of the tart back down before spreading on some mustard and about 1/4 pound of grated gruyere. Overlapped sliced tomatoes on top, then sprinkled with salt, pepper and some chopped herbs from Lisa's garden (rosemary and oregano). Baked that for another 12 minutes, then allowed it to cool and cut into squares. (I had chopped up some basil and put it in some olive oil to drizzle over the top, then forgot to do it.) We ate it in the park with a lot of other picnic food (chicken fingers, corn and bean salsa with homemade chips, a tomato and mozzarella salad with pesto, mint tea and blueberry-nectarine cobbler with homemade ice cream for dessert).

I've been meaning to email you for a while. My husband Sam Walker and I live in the village and we have a baby named August Samuel Walker. Right before he was born, I googled August Walker and saw the pictures of your baby and it felt like I had a crystal ball. I think I was half expecting to see your baby when mine was born. Anyway, just a strange coincidence since I think we're about the same age and live in the same city. Our son goes by Gus though...

These, the last two ice creams on Eddie's list, got the best of me. They were sorbets, so they failed to have that satisfying, rich, creamy feeling. They left me a little bit sad, and I almost didn't finish them. I think the orange might make a nice creamsicle-ish combo with some vanilla ice cream, but both were too sweet, either bright orange or bright purple. The raspberry had a bit of a tart finish, but not enough to redeem it. It was the same color, almost, as the raspberry ice cream, but it's amazing what some heavy cream can do for the flavor. The raspberry ice cream was one of my favorites; the sorbet is undoubtedly my least favorite. Which brings me to the fun task of ranking, or classifying, the flavors for future visits. Loved It--These can stand alone, although I think the coffee would be decadent in a hot-fudge sundae Vanilla Fudge Rum Raisin Coffee Cherry Vanilla Mint Chip Liked It--I actually think these might make the best components to a banana split or sundae Walnut Vanilla Raspberry Banana Chocolate Would Eat but Wouldn't Order--I like these fine, but why eat them when there are so many better options? Tutti Fruitti Vanilla Chip Strawberry Pistachio Pineapple Coffee Chip Butter Pecan Orange Sorbet (but only as part of a creamsicle-ish concoction) Wouldn't Eat Again Raspberry Sorbet

Looks like we have a lot in common as far as our passion for food goes. I'm excited to try your risotto recipe. I'm always scared to try it though-seems like a hard thing to master...

This is from Everyday Italian, and I like it because it's not loaded with a ton of different ingredients (most antipasto salads seem to have ingredients lists that are a page long!). In fact, with a few substitutions I had everything I needed in my kitchen. I made a vinaigrette out of red wine vinegar, mustard, salt, pepper and olive oil, and tossed that with bibb lettuce I had torn bite-sized. Then I added white beans, a cut-up tomato, strips of hot coppa and small cubes of a really sharp but still creamy aged provolone. Gave that a gentle toss (so all the heavy stuff would be incorporated but not end up on the bottom), then served. It was pretty, too.

I think I may have butchered the spelling of this, but anyway. I've been dreading this flavor, which is almost at the very bottom of the list, expecting a bubble-gum flavored confection that's too sweet to choke down. It is bubble-gum pink, but it wasn't too bad. Creamy. Sweet but not too. Pink flavored, like the strawberry. It had bits of cherries and pineapple in it. Can't say I'll get it again, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be.

Todd loves this flavor, and I'm not against it. I thought I'd feel the same as I do about butter pecan, too sickly sweet, but the walnuts have a slightly bitter flavor that balances nicely against the maple-y ice cream. I think Todd may be willing to walk to Eddie's with me more often now that he knows about the walnut ice cream.

We drove out to Long Island this weekend specifically to get vegetables from a farmstand. I think, though, the baby hates Long Island. Hates. It. He has a meltdown every time we go out there. In the restaurant he wouldn't eat his food, got peas everywhere (including all over my white tank top), grabbed at everything, cried, whined. It's not the first time this has happened on LI, either. So the peaches, corn, baby eggplants and various other veggies were hard won, and while the ratatouille was good I can't say it was worth it. The corn might've pushed it over the edge if August hadn't wailed the whole car ride home. He's much better about the trip into Union Square, and there's much more selection there, anyway. So the ratatouille. I made mine like a stew, cooking it much longer than the recipe called for. Otherwise it's just sauteed vegetables, right? First sauteed a thinly sliced onion, then added 3 baby eggplants cut into chunks (the recipe said to peel but I didn't and I didn't really notice the skins as obtrusive). Added 1 zucchini cut into chunks and then 1 tomato with thyme, oregano, ground coriander, salt and pepper. Put the lid on it and let it stew for a while (I'm not sure how long, maybe 20 minutes?). Ate it over couscous to catch the juices.

This started out as a recipe from Bill's Open Kitchen, off Leite's Culinaria, but I got lazy about sauteeing the shrimp and discovered I didn't have the chiles or garlic to flavor it, so I just threw it into the risotto with the last batch of stock. It turned out good, with creamy, lemony risotto and sweet shrimp. I like my risotto kind of loose so that's how far I took it. Can't say it was a good idea to make something that requires constant stirring on a day like today. It's another slighty hot, very muggy one here. But citrus risotto sounded refreshing (can't say that it is, though). Get 3 cups chicken broth simmering in a small saucepan over low heat. Saute half a minced onion in a tablespoon each butter and olive oil in a wide pan until it's translucent, then add 3/4 cup arborio rice. Stir that for a couple of minutes, then start adding the broth, about 3/4 cup at a time. Stir until the liquid's mostly absorbed, then add more until you only have one addition left. Add that with 1/2 pound medium shrimp, another tablespoon of butter, salt, pepper, the zest of a lemon and the juice of half the lemon. Stir and cook over low until the shrimp are pink and the risotto's the way you like it.

Have you ever seen a jicama? Brown, hairy, sort of shaped like a squat rutabaga. My family eyed it warily yesterday when I took it over to my brother and sister-in-law's for dinner last night. She was making enchiladas so I decided to make a jicama salad. I only used half of the jicama. (It was a 2-pounder; I almost wonder, if I could have found a smaller one, would it have been sweeter?) I peeled off the brown skin and cut it into sticks. It's kind of a cross between an apple and a potato, with a kind of starchy potato texture and crunch, but a little bit of sweetness and juiciness. I tossed the sticks with lime juice, salt and chile powder and added some cucumber sticks (peeled, seeded and cut in sticks). It's a nice, fresh side for something as rich as enchiladas. I also made some guacamole; so easy! Avocado, lime juice, cilantro, tomato, salt, chile powder. Now that I know how easy it is, I'll do it more often.

When I was a child my parents drank Postum. It's a beverage, supposedly a coffee substitute, made from chicory and roasted grains, and so I took a pass on the early morning hot beverage habit. Then I met my future husband during my first week of college. He was a senior and his coffee-guzzling habit was one of the things that added to his aura of maturity. We were friends first, would go with a big group to the local coffee shop to argue about the kinds of things you argue about in college. Then we moved on to just the two of us, at Perkins late at night, where they set a big pot of coffee right on the table (saving the waitstaff all that time dispensing refills). Those nights I'd lay in bed, my heart racing -- was it love or the pints of coffee coursing through my veins? So coffee has always been more about relationships than beverages to me. Now it's my relationship with my son, who from the moment his presence was known in my womb has had me drinking decaf (and still he doesn't sleep at night). Decaf can make you an outcast, though. The guests with the coffee habit who have to have regular in the morning. The restaurant that doesn't have decaf or, even worse, only has instant. The sacrifices in taste and price. Being one of those people who \"can't have\" something, the bane of their hosts. So lately it's an ambivalent relationship. But I'm still in love. That's why I'm making these brownies, which like my husband get their maturity from coffee, for about the 400th time. So I can share them with a new friend (a new-mommy friend) who's husband is doing me a favor. And so I can share them, again, with you. Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Then beat 1 cup sugar and 2 eggs with a mixer on high until it's pale and thick (about 5 minutes). Add 2 teaspoons espresso powder dissolved into a tablespoon of water, 1/4 cup melted butter and 1 teaspoon vanilla and mix. Next mix 1 cup flour, 2/3 cup cocoa powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Add to sugar mixture and spread it in a 9-inch square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for about 25 minutes, checking at 20 minutes to see if it's cooked through. They're fudgy, so moist crumbs should be attached when they're done.

This was just chunks of tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil tossed with a little bit of salt, but the tomatoes and basil came from a cool, fresh morning at the farmers' market so they tasted great. (We also got blueberries, peaches and what I can only assume will be the last of the strawberries, plus zucchini and white baby eggplant.) We took it on a picnic to Storm King Art Center, which is a big natural park with sculptures scattered throughout. It would've been a perfect day had it been 10 degrees cooler (but it was still really nice). We also had sandwiches (either pepperoni or ham with provolone and arugula), cantaloupe, strawberries and some cookies for dessert. Pretty basic. I sopped up the juices from the salad with some bread: so tomatoey, more so even than the salad itself. Storm King's a great day trip, a fun place for a picnic with a few really interesting sculptures (and a lot of stuff that seems like nonsense to me). It's just past West Point in the Hudson River Valley.

This has the nostalgic taste of chocolate syrup to me. It's Eddie's perfectly decent vanilla with ribbons of icy chocolate throughout. I ordered a pint of this to go, scrounging through my change to come up with enough quarters to pay for the $5 pint. But they pack the ice cream in there, so it's one of the biggest \"pints\" I've gotten. I'd take this one again. (I probably will, along with coffee, raspberry and mint chip. Maybe rum raisin, too.) Only the sorbets and two more flavors to go.

This was exactly what I expected: Eddie's good vanilla ice cream with those annoying little brittle chocolate chips. I still don't know why anyone would bother when you can get it plain or, even better, vanilla fudge. I ran in and got a pint of this, then it was a race home in the car with a paper bag of ice cream before it melted. The ice cream was that perfect, almost soft-serve-like texture.

I really like the Wittard Afternoon blend of tea Todd brought back from London once, so when the IMBB theme for this round turned out to be tea, I saw a chance to try it a different way. I'd been thinking about making a panna cotta, but the ice cream maker has been sitting on top of the fridge all summer, forlorn and unloved, so I took it down for these tea-flavored ice cream sandwiches. I used Alton Brown's recipe for vanilla ice cream and substituted 3 teaspoons of tea leaves for the scraped vanilla bean. It's an OK recipe but I find all the cold fat in it leaves a greasy coating on the spoon. Maybe it's my machine (I have one of the hand-crank ones) or maybe I should use a custard-based recipe next time. The flavor's pretty cool, though. Bring 2 cups half-and-half, 1 cup heavy cream, 3/4 cup sugar, 3 teaspoons loose black tea and a couple good pinches of salt just below a bubble (the edges will start to bubble a bit), then let it sit for about an hour to steep the tea. Pour through a strainer and chill overnight, then freeze it in an ice cream machine the next day. It gets to the texture of soft serve in the machine, then you transfer it to a lidded container to freeze it more solid. I made a couple of tea ice cream sandwiches (using shortbread cookies, of course), but most of the cookies were broken when I opened the package so I also just mixed crumbs into the ice cream.

I made a couple of tea ice cream sandwiches (using shortbread cookies, of course), but most of the cookies were broken when I opened the package so I also just mixed crumbs into the ice cream.

Thursday I made a quick trip into Manhattan just to try Lassi, the Indian snack-food shop, and I found something there worth hauling 31 pounds of stroller and infant up and down subway stairs for. DO NOT order a small lassi, unless you're planning to try one of every flavor. I had the cardamom, and I have to figure out how to make it here at home. How do they make it sweet? I think they use ground-up whole cardamom pods because there were chewy, tiny fibrous pieces at the bottom. I slurped them right up less than a block from the store. I also had a cauliflower paratha, which was not quite what I was expecting. It was kind of chewy, doughy and moist. But spicy (not hot) and yummy. Thinking back on it I'd like another. It came with a yogurt sauce with what seemed like tiny chickpeas in it.

I live in France, but read about it online in the Voice when researching restaurants for our Thanksgiving trip. We went there on Sunday. It was great to eat food that leaves your mouth feeling clean, not as if you need to go and brush your teeth!

Half a leftover baguette had me looking for an easy baked French toast recipe, and I found one. The brown sugar-butter mixture makes a chewy coating on the underside of the toasts, so you don't need any syrup. We get up so early with the baby that I was able to make this on a Sunday night and we had it for breakfast Monday morning. Mixed 1/4 cup brown sugar with 1/4 cup butter in the bottom of baking dish, then topped it with 1-inch-thick slices of very stale baguette, then poured over it 3/4 cup milk mixed with 2 eggs, a pinch of salt and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract. Left it in the refrigerator overnight, then baked it for 45 minutes in a 350 degree oven.

As I was eating this I was trying to remember what strawberries taste like. Eddie's strawberry ice cream tastes sweet and pink, if you know what I mean. (Unlike their raspberry, which was nice and tart.) I'm thinking the traditional sundae trio of chocolate, strawberry and vanilla at Eddie's doesn't really punch you in the face with their respective flavors because Eddie's is such a great sundae shop, and you need a milder base for all those great toppings. (I've mentioned the fresh whipped cream, right? In the giant pyrex bowls?) They're all decent on their own, creamy and rich, but not so if you want a deep, dark chocolate fix or the fresh taste of strawberries (I think there's strawberries in there, because I had a few seeds, but no big chunks). So don't be afraid to load the toppings on this one. You won't be missing much.

I ordered one of those Fresh Direct rotisserie chicken meals and am getting quite a lot of mileage out of it, so I wanted to record just how far I'm making it go. My version included sour cream mashed potatoes and broccolini with garlic chips. The first night of leftovers we ate chicken bratwurst with carmelized onions and mustard over the mashed potatoes. I liked to have my potatoes with a bite of the onions, a nice sweet addition to the tangy but also kind of bland potatoes. Then lunch the next day. I diced up part of the remaining chicken breast and mixed it with one chopped scallion, salt, pepper, mayonnaise and a ground hot curry mix from Penzey's, and we ate it in top-split hot dog buns with mini carrots on the side. I know it's not exciting cooking, but it was still really tasty. Supper last night was the leftover broccolini with pasta. I warmed some oil with some chili flakes in a skillet, then when the pasta was about halfway cooked I added the broccolini to the oil. Tossed it until warm, then added the nearly cooked pasta and a little of the water. Bubbled that a bit, then served the pasta with copious amounts of grated grana padano. I think I'm cooking the leftover pasta and broccolini (leftover leftovers!) in a frittata for lunch, but I have to figure out what to cook it in that's small enough for one serving.

I've been looking for a reason to use my new stick blender, so when some friends came over for lunch and cheap blueberries started showing up everywhere I decided to make a dessert soup. As a jumping off point I used Rachael Ray's recipe for blackberries in star anise syrup over lemon sorbet, but I did a lot different. I boiled 1/4 cup sugar in 3/4 cup water with a couple pieces of broken star anise, then added a pint of blueberries and cooked for a little while longer, about a minute, until some of the blueberries had burst. Let that sit to cool, removed the star anise, then blended it all up with my immersion blender. It tasted really flat at this point and I didn't have any lemon juice so I drizzled in some balsamic vinegar and added a couple pinches of salt. Stuck it in the fridge until we were ready for it, then served it with a dollop of lemon sorbet.

It seems like these days I either have time to cook something good or write about it (which would you choose if you were me?). But I made a couple of easy, versatile things this week that were worth mentioning. The first was a small batch of crumble topping so I could make individual crumbles for myself while Todd was out of town. I used as a base the recipe from Once Upon a Tart and added some almond paste I had left over from some other baking. Also quartered the recipe so I didn't have too much: 2 tablespoons each flour, brown sugar, walnuts and almond paste, and 1 tablespoon each oats and cold butter cut small. I mixed it all together with my fingers, mushing up the butter and almond paste until they were just small pieces. Used some of it to make an individual peach crumble by cutting up a ripe peach, tossing it with a bit of sugar and flour, then putting that in a ramekin and topping it with some of the topping mixture. Baked at 375, I think, for about half an hour. I have more topping in the fridge for the next time I want one. I think next time I may substitute almonds for the walnuts. Also bought some golden beets that I cleaned off, trimmed and put in a baking dish with about a cup of water (as recommended in my Chez Panisse Cooking cookbook). Covered it with foil and baked for an hour (they were medium sized) in a 350 degree oven (I think). Let them cool a bit, then peeled and sliced. I tossed some with some mesclun and mustard vinaigrette, then topped it all with some fresh goat cheese. Also marinated some in vinaigrette for dinner tonight. Think they'd be good in a goat-cheese sandwich, too. I also had a couple of fantastic sandwiches on the parbaked ciabatta I got from Fresh Direct: Smoked turkey, Cheddar and mango chutney with mesclun, a toasted sandwich with melted chocolate, and one with goat cheese, marinated sundried tomatoes and mesclun.

I know, I've got to stop complaining about all the great places Todd gets to go, but this time it was London and the free time he had was totally wasted on him. He still picks up my treats at the airport, which has worked out great for me so far, but I need to start researching things for him to bring me from London. (Any ideas?) He always goes for the cool packaging. This time it was so-so chocolate-covered hazelnuts but really fantastic candied orange slices dipped in dark chocolate. Also a dark chocolate bar with orange and cardamom that I haven't tried yet, all from a Glasgow shop (with a London satellite) that specializes in Belgian chocolate, Kshocolat.

Todd's been doing a lot of client-entertaining lately, which means he gets to go out to eat at all the places I'm missing out on. It was particularly depressing last Monday, when August first came down with an ailment that I'm only willing to talk to other new parents about. Todd took his clients to Stella, which is just a block away from where I used to work and one of those places that gives you a thousand little treats with your drinks. (Sob.) But he brought home a little dessert just for me, a fruit tart with so-so strawberries but the best blackberries I've tasted. Sitting on the floor in the living room, watching my baby boy hold his unsteady balance over his activity table and enjoying my treat, I felt lucky again. But I think there should be a law that spouses who get to go out for great meals for business while their beloveds sit at home should get a little something for them. It could be a new restaraunt trend -- they could provide something that will make the trip home intact and be cozy as a midnight snack or maybe even taste better warmed up the next day. (I know a few restaurants were doing this, but it certainly needs to become more widespread.)

I had a friend who always said what an old man he was, and this was his favorite kind of ice cream. For me it occupies the same space as butter pecan, although I order rum raisin from time to time and I never like butter pecan. I think it's the booze-soaked raisins that keep it from being cloyingly sweet. Because I'm pretty sure Eddie's doesn't use a basic vanilla as their base for this. It's sweeter than vanilla and doesn't have the vanilla flavor. Maybe it's a brown-sugar or caramel ice cream. Something richer, less fresh, than vanilla. Maybe it's simply those boozy raisins adding to the flavor just from sitting in the ice cream. You wouldn't think squishy little dried fruits would work, texture-wise, in ice cream, but they do. (Unless you ask my friend Julie, whose aversion to rum raisin is so strong that she wouldn't go with me to get it.)

My mom was not afraid to help Mother Nature along a bit in the fruit department: salted canteloupe slices, sugar on berries or stone fruit. Today as I sprinkled my somewhat-tart peach slices with a little bit of sugar and topped them with some ricotta I remembered the peach slices we used to eat as children, sprinkled with sugar and swimming in whole milk or cream. The milk would get sweet with the sugar and peach juices, somewhat similar to drinking the chocolate milk left after cocoa puffs, only much better. I've decided that it's because of my mom's tendancy to do this that I have a sweet tooth, something for which I'd like to seriously and without any irony whatsoever thank her. Why wish that one of my great pleasures in life be taken away?

Todd and I ate this for dinner on Sunday night with spaghettini and seared scallops, and today I had it in a roll with melty fresh mozzarella and basil (a terrific combo of crunchy bread, chewy tomatoes and smooth cheese). It's from Bistro Cooking at Home. First you make the garlic oil: put 10 peeled garlic cloves in your smallest saucepan and add olive oil to cover, then simmer for 10 minutes until the garlic is soft. Mine was browing by this time, so I pulled them out of the oil immediately. Allow the oil and garlic to cool, then add 1/3 cup of the oil and the garlic to 1/2 cup chopped sundried tomatoes, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, 1/4 cup chopped kalamata olives and a splash of balsamic vinegar. The leftover oil is good to cook other things in, like fried rice or sauteed vegetables. Anything, really. (Anything you want to add a garlic flavor to.)

I've had a lot of time to think about this flavor and I still don't get it. It sounds kind of tropical, maybe if it had macadamias instead of pistachios. Green ice cream with flecks of darker green pineapple in it, but I never detected a strong flavor of either one. Of course it's Eddie's ice cream, so it tastes good, but the combo doesn't add anything to it.

Fried rice is one of those kitchen-sink type dishes to me, like pasta, sandwiches, frittatas or soup, a way to use up ingredients in my fridge. This was a particularly nice combo, especially since the sugar snaps were so plump, fresh and sweet. I sauteed half a small, diced onion, then added some minced garlic and ginger. Stirred in the snap peas and cooked for a minute or two, then added diced pork from dinner the night before and some red pepper flakes for heat. Last I mixed in the cooked rice (I use jasmine rice for everything because the smell of it cooking is so heavenly, but I'm sure that offends someone somewhere), some soy sauce and a drizzle of sesame oil.

I like Eddie's coffee ice cream a lot. This is the coffee ice cream with those mini, brittle chocolate chips in it, which I don't like so much. To me there's no reason to order this when you can get the coffee ice cream plain. Or with a load of whipped cream on top, like having a latte.

I bought some sour cherries at the farmers market last week and made a compote with it this weekend. We ate it over ice cream yesterday, and I think I'll mix it with some ricotta for a snack when I get hungry later this morning. Pitted the cherries over a saucepan to catch the juices, then mixed 3 tablespoons of sugar with 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch and whisked that into the juices with a little bit of water. Boiled that for five minutes, then added the cherries and cooked them for another couple of minutes. Poured into a bowl and chilled it.

I LOVE sour cherries. I'm very jealous that you can buy them fresh. I've never seen them fresh, but I do go through a large jar of bottled ones every few weeks. I eat them with vanilla yogurt for breakfast. What a great idea to have them with ricotta though. I'll have to make some ricotta just to try it!

I made this a couple of weeks ago and it has stayed good and served me well. I started out eating it on bruschetta, but since then I've put it on a sandwich and eaten it with chicken paillard. I think it'd also be good tossed with pasta, which may be lunch tomorrow. Or in an omelet or over eggs? It's a pretty green color, too. I used picholine olives, already pitted. About 2 cups in the food processor with capers, parsley, lemon zest and juice. Processed until it was finely chopped, then drizzled in olive oil until it was holding together.

So Saturday we happened to arrive at Eddie's just as last year's ice cream eating champion was out-eating the competition yet again. Last year he ate five pounds of ice cream; I didn't catch the tally this year. I did indulge in the next flavor on their list, coffee. I love coffee ice cream, but I'm still nursing so I've been avoiding caffeine. But coffee ice cream is one of those flavors that isn't too sweet, that has a nice edge to it, and Eddie's is a good, creamy specimen of this favored flavor. They also have coffee chip, which I'll have to try next. One of the most impressive things at Eddie's are the huge bowls of freshly whipped cream that they pull out of the icebox when someone orders one of their big, messy sundaes. It's almost a perfect sphere, the round mound of whipped cream completing the circle of the colorful pyrex bowl.

Laura Brody says that without eggs, dessert would be fruit. But what would we eat for breakfast? I know there are tons of yummy recipes where eggs star, shining figuratively as a mile-high souffle or literally in a gorgeous meringue, but I love eggs for their dutifullness behind the scenes. An egg theme for IMBB instantly had me thinking of mornings when I was a kid, when even the Bisquick mix my dad used to make pancakes required the addition of an egg. So when we had buttermilk pancakes for brunch yesterday Todd snapped a photo. We ate them with whole-berry preserves my father-in-law had made and fresh whipped cream. I love the tender, fluffy texture that the buttermilk and eggs gave these. It's a basic recipe, really. Whisk together 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon baking soda, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons sugar. Then in a 4-cup measure whisk 2 cups buttermilk with 2 tablespoons melted butter and 2 large eggs. Mix the two together just to combine, then cook 'em up.

I don't think this turned out quite right (not as high as the picture), but it was so doggone good that I have to write it up anyway. It's like a giant, round almond croissant that you can serve for dessert. And not too difficult, either. The other thing I like about it is it calls for 1/4 cup almond paste, not a whole tube, but it's very marzipan-y. Roll out two puff pastry sheets so you have space on each to cut out a 10-inch round (the recipe called for 11-inch rounds, used all the almond cream and took longer to bake than my version). Cut the rounds with a knife then stick them in the fridge. Mix together (I used the mixer) 1/4 cup each almond paste and sugar and 3 tablespoons softened butter. When that's smoothish, add 1 egg and 1/4 teaspoon each almond and vanilla extract. Mix to combine, then mix in 2 tablespoons flour. Place one round on a baking sheet, then spread the almond cream on it, leaving the edge all the way around uncovered. Cut vents in the other sheet and brush it with an egg wash. Brush the egg wash around the edge of the bottom pastry, too, then place the other round, egg wash side up, on top, and press on the edges with a fork to close. Bake until burnished brown on top in a 450 degree oven (mine took 15 minutes) then dust with confectioners' sugar. Serve warm.

I went to a new place here in Forest Hills today, and it should have been a nice lunch with the in-laws. But the place was Cami's, which apparently doesn't keep the ingredients stocked for about half the stuff on their somewhat-limited lunch menu. When my father-in-law tried to order a Cuban sandwich, he was told, \"We don't have Cubans.\" The way the waitress said it it almost sounded like he was demanding something they didn't offer on the menu. Then my sandwich, a roasted vegetable sandwich with smoked gouda and eggplant spread, came with no cheese and drizzled with pesto. When I asked about the cheese the hostess (owner?) came over and told me that it was a spread of gouda and eggplant. Then why is it green? Thin? Oily? No sign that it is made of eggplant, which is not green, and cheese, which is also not green? I can't help but feel that I was being lied to in a very bald-faced and offensive way. If I wasn't being lied to, though, I have to say that a smoked gouda and eggplant spread, which may be kind of a good idea in abstract, does not work at all in practice at Cami's, where it is not thick and brown and smokey but much too much like pesto. So disappointing, because I was looking for a nice place to spend my lunchtimes.

Warning: Lamb fat is a tricky one to wash off. I made these patties under my broiler this weekend and have washed the broiler pan three times and it still feels sticky. But I've grown to love the taste of lamb; I guess a little extra dishwashing is the price to pay. I mixed these up and formed them into patties early in the day, then refrigerated them until we were ready to make dinner: about three minced scallions, a couple tablespoons minced mint, a large minced clove of garlic and a pound of ground lamb. Season the outside of the patties with salt an pepper, broil on each side about 5 minutes (I made them into three big patties) and serve with yogurt, chutney and warm flatbread.

What can you say about cherry vanilla? Eddie's has big pieces of cherries and is pink. I've had it in the past because it's one of the flavors I go for when I feel like having fruit ice cream. A warning to my in-laws, who are coming to visit next week and want to go to Eddie's: The place looks like it has a split personality. To the left when you walk in is an old-fashioned soda-shop counter, with stools, a marble countertop and a board with a menu and all the flavors. There are tables in the back and ceiling fans spin lazily above. To the right, though, are dusty cases full of Beanie Babies, birthday dolls and other knicknacks, looking like they've been there since the early '90s. This flotsam gives the place a vaguely run-down, junky feel. But if it were purely a charming soda shop, it wouldn't feel like such a find, I think. You don't want it to feel like you're at Disney World, do you?

My first all-by-myself crust success! I actually had to fudge the recipe, which was from The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen, a bit. But it was great with the rhubarb custard - just sweet enough to counter that tart-tart rhubarb. This is for today's Sugar High Friday, theme tarts. When making the crust, I turned on the food processor to \"grate\" 9 tablespoons of butter that I had cut up small then frozen and August flipped out. So I dumped the butter into a bowl, added 1/3 cup sugar, a pinch of salt and 8 ounces of flour (so great to be able to weigh my flour instead of measuring). I used a pastry blender to cut the butter in, then tossed in an egg I had beaten a bit. Dumped it into a plastic bag, sealed it and formed the dough into a ball. Refrigerated for an hour, then formed it into a disk and stuck it back in the fridge. The next morning I rolled it out, froze it for a while to make it easier to work with, then put it in my 10-inch tart pan. The recipe actually much more dough than you need (about 1/4 more), which is great for a novice roller-outer. (I used the scraps to make mini tarts with the leftover custard I had.) Pricked the bottom, refrigerated it for about an hour (at least 20 minutes), then baked it lined with foil and rice for 10 minutes in a 375 degree oven, then removed the foil and rice and baked it for another 5 minutes. Yesterday after making the crust dough I cut up the rhubarb, removing the strings, and tossed it with 1/3 cup of sugar to macerate. Today I drained off the liquid and reduced it, then tossed it, with some grated orange rind and a splash of Cointreau, with the rhubarb. Spread the rhubarb in the par-baked crust, then poured the custard in (3/4 cup heavy cream, 3 whole eggs and 1 yolk, 1/3 cup sugar whisked together - I also added some of the liquid that was left from the rhubarb). I didn't want to overflow it so I didn't use all the custard, either. Baked it for 30 minutes in a 400 degree oven, until the custard was starting to brown around the edge and was firm in the center.

Another winner from the Once Upon a Tart cookbook: a moist, soft cake under jammy strawberries and a sugary topping (I might make the topping with almonds next time). It's their berry coffecake, which I halved, just used strawberries and baked in an 8-inch pan. (The original recipe was for a 13 x 9-inch pan.) The dough was really thick, which kept the strawberries from sinking too far into the cake, and it has a nice almond flavor from extract in the cake and almond paste in the topping. The cake base is 4 tablespoons of softened butter creamed with 6 tablespoons sugar. Mix in 1 egg, 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon almond extract. Then alternate between adding 1/4 cup buttermilk and 1 cup flour mixed with 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/8 teaspoon each baking soda, ground ginger and salt and 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon. (I made this in the stand mixer, but just put it on stir and added the last of the flour mixture with a spoon by hand to avoid the dreaded rubbery texture. Worked.) Spread that in the pan, then sprinkle with 1 1/2 cups quartered strawberries, then add the topping: 1/2 tablespoon flour, 1 tablespoon cut-up cold butter, 2 tablespoons torn-up almond paste, 1/4 cup chopped walnuts and 1/4 cup brown sugar (I just mushed the topping together with my fingers).

This was a fast, easy dinner that I made when we got home from New Paltz. I had bought smoked mozzarella for another dish I want to make later this week, and I was kind of worried that it wouldn't taste very good with the pepperoni - too many strong flavors. But it turned out great. The only problem was the FD flatbread I used as a crust never got crispy - I think if I had cooked it on the floor of the oven it might have remedied that. I just thawed the frozen pre-grilled flatbread and spread it with tomato sauce (a Barilla garlic and onion pasta sauce that, dare I risk the wrath of cooks everywhere?, I like), then sprinkled chopped pepperoni and shredded smoked mozzarella on top. Baked in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes, to warm everything through.

We went to New Paltz for the weekend to see a photography exhibit at SUNY's new gallery. It's a gorgeous gallery, huge, and the photography exhibit, which is primarily from the school's collection and is around the theme of materiality, is worth the trip. Especially if strawberries are in season and you stop by Dressel Farms on 208 and buy some that were just picked, then sit in your hot car in front of the stand eating the warm, red-red berries. I bought extra to do some baking and some heavy cream to accompany them tonight, too. We also stayed at a B&B, Country Meadows, and I had some great French toast on Sunday morning. The owner, Judy, crusted the toast with some cranberry-almond flake cereal that had taken a ride in a food processor. She grated a bit of whole orange (rind and all) into some heavy cream with an egg mixed in, soaked Italian bread slices briefly in it, then patted the slices in the cereal crumbs. Cooked it in butter like regular French toast. It didn't even need any adornment, and was really good, with the crunchy crust a nice contrast to the creamy center. Todd's scrambled eggs had chives and herbs cut that morning from pots out front. It really was a great place to visit. With all the farms and wineries around the food available is so fresh and thoughful. We ate at The Village Tearoom, and I had an arugula salad with local cheddar cheese and mustard vinaigrette. We went there to have their afternoon tea but decided it was just too hot for that (so now we have to go back). We did take some cookies (checkerboard, pecan tassie and gingersnap) with us for a nighttime snack after August had gone to bed. We also did a bit of wine tasting and bought some bottles. And Todd took some great photos. Whew! And it's only June, so the fantastic parade of flavors is just beginning.

I wasn't really looking forward to this one. I always find butter pecan ice cream, like dulce de leche, too sweet, and this one was no exception. Didn't keep me from polishing it all off, though. On June 25 Eddie's is having an ice cream eating contest. Who can eat the most ice cream in 15 minutes, which seems like a particularly dangerous thing to try with ice cream. (Ever experienced that searing pain in the head when you eat something cold too fast? I'm embarrassed to say it's not an uncommon sensation for me.) I guess the guy last year ate 5 pounds of ice cream. Anyway, you have to raise $50 to enter, for St. Jude's, the woman behind the counter thought.

I made rhubarb muffins yesterday, but when I gave one to Todd this morning he said they were weird, a combination of too chewy and dry. I know exactly what happened, too. I used the stand mixer to mix the dough and I mixed it too much after I added the flour, which worked the gluten so I ended up with something craggy and bread-like, instead of cupcake-like muffins. Will try the recipe again sometime, though, because I really like the tart rhubarb in them and I'm sure if I just stir the flour in they'll be better.

I too find that it is very easy to use/abuse the stand mixer.  It sort of gives you permission to do so.  It seems to take longer to clean it and its components than it does to actually use it.  I try to be mindful of that when I use my Kitchen aid mixer and not over-mix.  You really must stand over it and be careful.

This is so unrelated to the topic- but Kim, have you ever tried \"grilled\" lettuce?  I saw it done on the Food Network and ever since I'm so curious.  She grilled romaine lettuce whole and then split it in half lengthwise and added a vinegrette dressing.  It sounds so interesting- I intend to try it this summer!

I never use my stand mixer when I'm making quick breads (not even when I'm making a huge batch of, say, banana bread). It's too easy to make a tough quick bread in a stand mixer. Over mixing causes tunneling in the bread which is why it's tough and often dense. Although, I've never had an overmixed muffin/bread turn out dry--maybe you forgot to add the fat or maybe the recipe is flawed and there is not enough fat for the recipe? or not enough liquid?

You know, Nicole, that we're grill-deprived out here. But I have sauteed endive and I have a head of radiccio in the fridge that I want to sautee, too. I think I saw that on the Food Network. Was it Giada, or maybe Rachael Ray? Sounds good to me. I always find romaine too tough for a salad (unless it's hearts in a Ceasar), so I bet it'd be good kind of wilty and grilled.

I like the stand mixer for creaming the butter, but I think I'll mix the flour in by hand in the future. I don't think the muffins were actually dry; Todd just didn't know how to describe the weird rubbery texture. The way you describe it, Roxanne, is exactly what it was like. So bizarre. But I guess the stand mixer makes great yeast breads. Have you done that?

I've decided to add a new category because I'm making so many sandwiches these days. This one was inspired by a Sarah Moulton recipe that was way too complex for me right now. Who has time to slice and blanch carrots, make tapenade, clean the processor, etc? So I just had goat cheese, chopped green olives and carrot strips made with the peeler. I'm sure it wasn't as good as the original, but it was a nice weekday lunch.

I would never have thought of putting olives and raw carrot together. It sounds so intriguing I'll have to try it out.

The Food Network recipe calls for a blanched-carrot salad, so that might make more sense, but I liked the texture the raw carrots gave the sandwich.

I felt like I was Emeril when I was making this cornmeal cake. August was watching, first from the front carrier and then from the high chair, and he was really exited about everything I did. Cream a softened stick of butter with a cup of sugar? He watches, rapt. Add a mixture of 1 cup cornmeal, 3/4 cup flour, 1 teaspoon baking powder and 3/4 teaspoon salt? A shriek and some arm waving, then more rapt watching as the paddle turns. Some coos of delight as I pour in 2/3 cup of milk, 2 eggs and one yolk and mix until lighter in color and texture, about 3 minutes. Then from the high chair he burbled and babbled as I poured the mixture into an 8-inch springform pan (the only kind of 8-inch pan I have) and put it in a 400 degree oven for 40 minutes. (Since no one mentioned baking troubles in the comments on Epicurious I can only assume that it was my own oven's fault that I had to bake it for an hour and 10 minutes instead of the recommended 40.) Let it cool for 10 minutes, then brushed it with 1/3 cup of a rosemary sugar syrup I had made ahead (boil 3/4 cup each sugar and water with 1/3 cup coarsely chopped fresh rosemary, steep for 30 minutes, then strain). I liked this cake a lot: dense, coarse texture and an interesting flavor from the cornmeal and the rosemary. Epicurious says to serve it with whipped cream and blackberries, but I think it can stand alone, too.

I had leftover Italian sausage I needed to use and I was sick of pan-browning them: We did it with the casing off this weekend for a pasta sauce, and whenever I try to brown them whole I'm always worried they're not getting cooked through. So last night I roasted them in a 400 degree oven (thanks to the modern miracle of air conditioning) over white beans. I mixed a 19-ounce can of white beans with salt, pepper, Italian seasoning mix from Penzey's (oregano, rosemary, marjoram, etc), olive oil and diced tomato in a small casserole, then stabbed four sweet Italian sausages in a few places with a knife and laid them on top. Roasted for 40 minutes in a 400 degree oven. At that point some of the beans had dried out, but the bottom of the sausages were not browned so I turned them and roasted for another 10 minutes. I think I could've turned them halfway and skipped the last 10 minutes, but I don't know how to keep the beans from drying out, except to stir them halfway through, which I guess you could do when you turn the sausage. The beans end up really good, though, because they soak up all that fat from the pork sausages. Don't want to let that go to waste! We had a rosemary-syrup-soaked cornmeal cake for dessert, which I thought was fantastic, an odd flavor that really works. The cake ends up dense and polenta-ish from all the syrup, with a nice rough texture and a corny flavor. I'll write it up next.

Don't you love it when the signage at a place makes you feel welcome? We drove up to Cold Spring today (mostly just for the drive) and ate at Foundry Cafe on the main downtown drag. At least three \"no cell phone\" signs. Restrooms for customers only. A number of tables with \"This table is for parties of 3 or 4 only.\" A drawing of a crying baby with a no screaming sign. A sign near the self-serve coffee sternly instructing that only to-go customers should use the paper cups. Signs that the tables are for table service and the counter is only for to-go customers. In case you were homesick for New York, I guess (maybe someone who works there is). The food was basic: I had a cucumber, sprout, tomato, Swiss and lettuce on whole wheat with jalapeno mayo and Todd had curried chicken salad on rye (no nuts or raisins, which he liked but I was disappointed in). The rusty-looking coleslaw had sesame seeds and the prices were Manhattan-like. The cheesecake, which they make there, was creamy and fluffy (not dense enough for Todd) with a great, thick chocolate cookie crust and just the right amount of coffee flavor (it was a cappuccino cheesecake). Maybe the attitude's the charm, or maybe they're sick of cityfolk like us coming up there and messing everything up because we don't understand how their system works. (The staff were not particularly mean or nice, too.)

I think you are right about \"maybe they're sick of cityfolk like us coming up there and messing everything up because we don't understand how their system works\". I have noticed this type of atmosphere in quite a few places that I thought would be inviting(seems to disipate when you get out of day trip driving distance from The City).

We have been finding it very difficult to stick to our budget lately, and part of the problem is that I go on these \"errands\" every morning (an excuse to take August for a walk) and I always encounter something I must buy: a wonderful shortbread, caramel, chocolate and pecan confection from Bonelle bakery, cheap avocados at the fruit stand, some redolent grating cheese, banana ice cream at Eddie's. Well, I've done it again. I had $7 in my pocket to last today and tomorrow and instead of buying the milk and butter we needed I sprang for some first peaches and fragrant strawberries. Now instead of the cornmeal cake I've been putting off (not enough butter), I think I'll make a peach-apricot crumble.

It seems to me banana flavor was created to be part of a sundae, maybe even in a banana split, which Eddie's makes in a messy, gooey glory of overspilling hot fudge, real whipped cream and lots of napkins. But I think it stand best alone, or adorned with some fresh whipped cream and, the best complement to banana, some chocolate sauce. I cheated today. I had banana, skipped right over butter pecan (which I'll come back to next time) and added a scoop of chocolate. It's just a flavor combination I can't pass up. I'm trying to decide if it counts, or if I need to make another trip for the chocolate. (I think it does count, though. Is the point that I walk over there 18 times or is it the Herculean task of bringing spoon to mouth through 18 scoops?) I noticed today, as I ate my Eddie's banana ice cream, that the first bites tasted more banana-y than the later ones. I think as my mouth got cold I was less able to taste the flavor of the ice cream (fortunately ice cream has a luscious texture or there would be no point in taking more than a couple bites at any sitting). Eddie's chocolate is more of a milk chocolate than a dark chocolate, but it's not insipidly bland. There's a little bit of alkaline cocoa flavor that keeps it from just being sweet. It's a mild chocolate, though, good for a big scoop or as a base for a whole hoarde of Eddie's toppings.

The Met has revamped their dining options and we ate in their new cafeteria this weekend: What a relief to finally have someplace to eat when we go to there! The immediate vicinity is kind of a wasteland, so even though the cafeteria has \"we know we have a captive audience\" prices ($30 for two, including drinks and desserts), the thoughtful food selections make it a good choice. (We're determined to try Cafe Sabarsky at the Neue Museum sometime, but we nervous about taking August today--he hadn't napped all day.) They have fresh-squeezed juices and smoothies, a grill that today was serving reubens (which Todd had), entrees like salmon with mango salsa, an antipasto bar and a salad bar, a sandwich bar with pressed sandwiches and interesting choices (the turkey, pear and St. Andre caught my eye). I went for a selection from the two bars, which cost 60 cents an ounce (which translates to $9.60 a pound, which is why they describe it in ounces). Good choices though. I had mixed greens with cold salmon, roasted yellow peppers, marinated mixed mushrooms with pearl onions, a blue potato salad with calamari and curried couscous with golden raisins, figs and dried apricots. Only the potato salad was bad, with rubbery calamari and mushy potatoes. The couscous was actually really good. And Todd liked his fries, too. Good drink selection, with fancy-pants beverages like imported lemonade, Izze fruit drinks and Boyle's sodas. The desserts, though, are what had me running around the place like a puppy whose family all arrived home at once: mini coconut and chocolate cakes, berry and apricot-frangipane tarts, gorgeous cupcakes from Crumbs, giant cookies from another local baker, Krispie Kreme doughnuts for the tourists. We had an almond-macaroon sandwich made in their bakery, which was two almond paste-dense macaroons sandwiching chocolate ganache. So good. So good. Then at the cashier they have all these impulse buys: Cote d'Or chocolates, mints in fancy silver credit-card shaped packages, Joseph Schmidt chocolate bars. I grabbed one with dark chocolate and lemom, but the biscotti ones sounded good, too. Am I a sucker? Perhaps. But I had fun and it tasted good. Plus my low expectations resulted in a pleasurable surprise.

Don't make the mistake I did. The rose flavored chocolate chip cookie sounded so enticing I had to go overboard and get the rose ice cream sandwich: rose petal ice cream from Il Laboratorio gelato between two of Ruby et Violette's rose cookies. The problem was that it had to be cold, which my companions and I decided dulled the rose taste. It certainly was more pronounced by time I reached the end of the sandwich, and what an odd and ethereal taste it was. The cookies themselves are medium circumference, thick, soft and chewy (too soft in Todd's opinion) with big, soft chunks of chocolate. We tried three other chocolate-chip cookie flavors: Todd got Champagne and strawberries, which contained big, chewy dried strawberries, and espresso, which was flatter than all the rest and had chips of espresso bean and the most overpowering, wake-me-up aroma. The one I liked the best was dulce du leche; each bite melts into caramel in your mouth. I'd haul August in the stroller all the way over to (almost) 10th Avenue again to get another one of those.

When I told my mother-in-law that rhubarb costs $5.99 a pound on Fresh Direct, she was shocked. Apparently rhubarb grows like a weed. Todd and I hate the idea of having to tend a yard (we're apartment-dwellers) but then the idea of all these wonderful foods and herbs growing like weeds in my yard makes me want one so badly. My parents used to grow tomatoes and zucchini (or else a neighbor did) and I have fond memories. By the time I came around to ordering some rhubarb it was down to $2.99 a pound (better). I wanted to really get a taste for what rhubarb is like, so I chopped it and cooked about a pound with 1/2 cup sugar stovetop in a saucepan. Stirred it until the rhubarb had given off enough liquid to keep the sugar from burning, then let it simmer for about 20 minutes. Last night we layered it with crushed graham crackers and barely sweetened whipped cream. (The new mixer's great. I put the chilled cream in the chilled bowl with the whisk attachment, put it on 6, then went to dress the baby. When I came back, whipped cream!) Todd really liked it; it's nice and tart even through all that sugar, and some of the bigger bits kept a little texture to them.

I had a success in the kitchen yesterday. I made myself an omelet for lunch and it turned out beautiful! I think they key really was the nonstick pan and the butter; I usually skimp on the fat I cook my omelets in. Filled it with some of the mushrooms I roasted on Wednesday with salt, pepper, olive oil and a few sprigs of the neverending suppy of rosemary. (400 degrees, about 30 minutes.) I made a 2-egg omelet in my 10-inch skillet, and I liked the thinner results. Whisked the eggs with salt and pepper, then heated about a tablespoon of butter in the pan until it just stopped foaming. Poured in the eggs and stirred them around a bit then let them get mostly set, then topped them with the mushrooms. I fudged the method Julia Child used to fold it, jerking the pan toward me to get the omelet together on the far side of the skillet, then using a fork to guide it into submission. Tilted the pan over the plate to roll the omelet seamless-side up out of the skillet.

I had buttermilk left over from making panna cotta, so naturally it was time for pancakes for dinner. This recipe got four forks from the reviewers on Epicurious, and I can see why. The textures alone are fantastic: tender pancakes, melting banana pieces that would be too much were it not for the rich, toothy crunch of the nuts. I ate them simply adorned with butter, but I think the orange butter that was part of the recipe (but I didn't make) would be even better. Whisk together 3/4 cup flour, 1 1/2 tablespoon sugar, 3/4 teaspoon baking powder, 1/4 teaspoon baking soda and a pinch of salt. Then melt 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and whisk in 3/4 cup buttermilk, 1 egg and a dash of vanilla. Mix the wet into the dry, then add 1/4 cup chopped macadamias and 1 small diced banana. Cook like regular pancakes. I bet the basic recipe would be good with lots of different variations, but why do I insist on messing with a good thing?

Thanks for the great recipe Kim.  I enjoy pancakes with blueberries and other fruit but I have not tried adding nuts yet.  You did not mention adding any syrup and it sounds like it is not necessary.  I think people add too much syrup to enjoy the tastes and textures of pancakes.  This recipe sounds like it has an array of tastes and textures to enjoy by itself

I am going to try this out for sure.

So here's the second use I found for all that rosemary: crisp breadsticks for a snack for the moms in our playgroup (I'm hosting tomorrow, which means I need to vacuum the floor!). I used the dough hook on my new mixer for the first time and wasn't 100 percent happy with the results (a lot of the flour just didn't get incorporated until I dumped everything out and kneaded it by hand). But OK. 2 cups of bread flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon active dry yeast, 1 teaspoon sugar, 1 3/4 teaspoon salt. Mix that together, then add 2 tablespoons minced rosemary, a teaspoon of olive oil and warm water to bring it all together (about 3/4 cup). Knead a couple of minutes, then form into a ball, oil it and place it in a warm spot for an hour, to double in size (mine needed an hour and a half to double in size; I never add hot enough water to the yeast, I think). Cut into 16 pieces and roll the pieces out into thin, foot-long strands. Let rise on oiled baking sheets for 30 minutes, then bake in 325 degree oven about 40 minutes. The breadsticks that I baked on my dark-colored pan got a little too brown on the bottom so some adjustment might be necessary.

I ordered a 99 cent bunch of rosemary from Fresh Direct this weekend and this is what I got. So now I'm on the hunt for lots of rosemary recipes. Last night I marinated a pork tenderloin with balsamic and cider vinegar, olive oil, rosemary, garlic, mustard and maple syrup. Today I'm going to try to make crisp rosemary breadsticks. I also want to make a rosemary dessert: maybe a cornmeal cake with rosemary syrup or a custard-type dish like pot de creme. What I feel like I should do is slaughter a lamb and dig a roasting pit out in the middle of Yellowstone Blvd.

Hi there: a really easy and absolutely delicious recipe is just to cut several yukon golds up into very large dice, toss them with lots of the fresh rosemary and sea salt and a few large glugs of olive oil on a baking sheet and stick in a 400 (or so) degree oven for a while until they're brown and crusty and your home is fragrant with herbs and roasting potatoes (around 45 minutes, but check this as oven temps vary). You might need to shake the pan or run a spatula through the spuds halfway through. You won't be able to stop eating them! And they're good the next day, too, although hot they're really superior. Don't skimp on the herbs, salt and olive oil...the liberal lashings of the flavors really work wonders on the final dish.

The new IMBB theme, hosted by Elise at Simply Recipes, was gelatin, and since I'm not a big fan of Jell-O there was really one option for me: panna cotta. (Actually, Alton Brown makes a mousse using gelatin, but I wanted to go back to the panna cotta recipe because I liked it so much.) I tried a couple variations on the recipe I used before, to mixed effect. First, I used half a vanilla bean instead of extract, which gave it almost a subtler flavor and those beautiful black speckles. I also thought if I put something, strawberries and cherries, in the bottom of the molds they'd be there on top when I unmolded the dish. That didn't really work, as you can see, because the berries just floated to the top. Which made me think I could make the panna cottas in wine or dessert glasses and not unmold them, and have berries, candied citrus peel, edible flowers, whatever, on top. Pretty. <img alt=\"minipanna.jpg\" src=\"http://www.walkernewyork.com/eats/archives/minipanna.jpg\" width=\"250\" height=\"188\" / class=\"entryimage\">I also made mini panna cottas in my mini muffin pan, which are cute and would be a nice cocktail party dessert if you could figure out an easy way to serve them (they aren't finger food; I placed one on a puddle of Sarabeth's strawberry-raspberry preserves for this photo). Here's the recipe. Sprinkle one packet of gelatin over 2 tablespoons water and let it sit for 10 minutes. Meanwhile heat 1 cup heavy cream and half a split and scraped vanilla bean in a medium saucepan and dissolve 7 tablespoons of sugar in it. Then whisk in the gelatin until the lumps are gone. Let that cool for a while, then add 2 cups buttermilk. Strain from saucepan into a bowl or measuring cup with a pour spout, then pour into molds and refrigerate at least 6 hours. Unmold by dipping in hot water and then running a thin spatula or knife around the edges. I served it with strawberries macerated in sugar and balsamic.

Hi Kim. Ah, using a tiny spatula is a great idea. I love the idea of using a mini muffin tin, but I have a hard enough time unmolding my panna cotta as it is. Looks lovely. Also, to bridge the gap between vanilla extract and vanilla bean, I'll use vanilla paste, which gives me the speckles with with ease of extract.

Once again, I found out about the citrus-themed Sugar High Friday on the due date, so I had to scramble for something to make. Todd brought me some marmalade from London last time he was there, so I decided that counted as citrus and set to work. I made something simple, crostini with Cointreau-sweetened ricotta and marmalade, and then since it's raining I decided to bake some bar cookies. I toasted little bread rounds brushed with olive oil, slathered on ricotta, then sprinkled with salt and Cointreau. Then spread on a tawny, bitter marmalade. The cheese took some, but not all, of the bite out of that topping. The bar cookies came out totally crumbly and dry, but I liked the combination of the orange peel in the marmalade with all the warm spices in the cake, so I thought I'd still mention it. Also think the dry, crumbly portion could be vastly improved by using butter instead of shortening. Like a cakey spiced shortbread topped with a marmalade glaze. And the dryness can easily be remedied with a cup of tea. I like Whittards Afternoon blend. The recipe sandwiches the marmalade between two layers of dough, but one reviewer on AllRecipes mentioned he had to double the dough part to get that to work and I was using a 9-inch pan instead of an 8-inch pan so I decided to use the whole recipe for a bottom layer and just put the marmalade on top. Cream 1/2 cup shortening with 1/2 cup sugar and 1/2 teaspoon each almond and vanilla extract. Add one egg, then 1 1/2 cups flour sifted with 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, ground cloves and salt. Press into bottom of pan, spread with a cup of marmalade, then bake at 400 degrees for 25 minutes. Mine burnt a bit around the edges so you could probably decrease the baking time or temp, too.

This summer I have one goal. If I achieve this one thing, I will be satisfied that the summer was not wasted. I am going to try every flavor of ice cream Eddie's Sweet Shop, which is about a 30 minute walk from my home in Forest Hills, makes. I will push my borrowed Graco tank-stroller to Metropolitan Avenue 18 times this summer, come blazing heat, summer thunderstorms, biting insects. I know, 18? That's hardly a challenge. But it'll be fun. I started at the top of the list and will work my way down so all I have to keep track of is what I had last (plus the store's hours; I've already trekked there twice only to find they're closed on Mondays and before 1). This visit I had mint chip, mint ice cream with chocolate chips, a good classic flavor combo. The ice cream was bright neon green (none of that classy white mint ice cream at Eddie's) and had brittle (from being frozen) mini chips. Good mint flavor but not Altoids-painful, and not at odds with the creaminess of Eddie's ice cream. They serve their scoops, which are $2.25 for a single, in those metal ice cream cups that make the ice cream seem even colder, especially since I'm usually melting from the walk there.

I've been doing a lot of cooking in the last couple of days (more than usual, anyway). Friday jambalaya, yesterday tomato, cucumber and feta salad, and last night asparagus and bacon with pasta. I kind of made up my own jambalaya recipe using what I had on hand: the last of the fresh kielbasa, chicken cubes, wilty celery, jasmine rice. Browned slices of the kielbasa, then removed it from the pan and sauteed the necessary trinity of diced green pepper, onion and celery (I should've used more; I think I had about 1/2 to 3/4 cup of each). Pushed that to the side of the pan and browned the chicken. Then I added 2 cups of water, 1 1/2 cup rice and a 14.5-ounce can of diced tomatoes. Salt, pepper and some ancho chile powder. Stirred, then brought to a boil and dropped to a simmer for 20 minutes. Served with parsley, green onion and hot sauce on top. Next time it definitely needs smoked sausage, but Todd was pretty happy with these results, anyway. I ordered some Father Sam's mini wheat pitas, and they're good. I heated one in the oven to eat with a salad I made from chunks of peeled cucumber, quartered cherry tomatoes, crumbled feta, vinaigrette, oregano, salt and pepper. Todd doesn't like feta so it was good for lunch and good made in advance while August took his morning nap. Dinner last night was good, too. While I cooked some short, twisted pasta I also sauteed about 1 1/2 slices thick-cut bacon, then took that from the skillet and drained some of the fat. I discovered that I didn't have an onion, so I sliced up four pearl onions and sauteed those in the bacon fat. Then added asparagus cut in 1/2-inch pieces and sauteed to what I considered done (Todd likes his cooked a little more than me and I knew it would get more cooking at the next stage). Then added some pasta water (quite a bit, like 1/2 cup) and the almost-done pasta and boiled a bit to get the flavors off the bottom of the pan into the pasta, then added the bacon back in with a huge pile of grated pecorino-romano. This was pretty, too. I should've taken a picture.

The 9th Avenue International Food Fair sounded a lot more interesting than it turned out to be, but there was some good stuff there. Sullivan Street Bakery has a new location on 47th Street, and they were giving out free bread. (We also tried their rosemary-potato pizza.) Mitchel London was selling mini burgers, quiches, etc. Todd had chicken fingers with spicy honey-mustard sauce and I went for a mini tart with olive tapenade, carmelized onions, zucchini and tomato. We also popped into Little Pie Company to buy a small apple, sour cream and walnut pie. There were seafood stands, sweet potato and key lime pie, pierogies, piles of turkey drumsticks, Colombian barbecue, desserts from Amy's Bread and all the usual suspects (fruit shakes, zeppoles, gyros, etc.). And Saturday was beautiful. Then we stopped in Bryant Park on the way home. That park is in desperate need of an ice cream stand!

I feel like one of those housewives in the frilly aprons who would moan that the roast had dried out because hubby was late from work, because that's what happened to me last night. It wasn't a roast, it was fresh sausage with carmelized onions and pierogies, but it was a whole lot better when I ate it at 8 than when Todd ate it at 9. At least I didn't wait for him, because I ended up burning the bottom of the pan the sausage and onions were in, which didn't actually burn the food but gave it a burned taste. I'll have to try this recipe again for him, though, because it really was good. I cut the sausage (fresh kielbasa -- is that an oxymoron?) in 3-inch lengths, then browned it in a deep skillet. Threw in a small sliced onion and browned that, then added some water and braised the whole thing for an hour. Then I added 3 frozen pierogies to the skillet and put the lid back on. Eight minutes later they were done, and I ate them topped with onion. When I cut the sausage in half, though, it was still pink, so I left that in to cook longer (I actually think, now, that something in the sausage made it stay pink and that it was cooked through). Would've been good all together, I think.

If it was actually fresh kielbasa it should have been grey and not pink.  It sounds as though you had smoked kielbasa.

Have you ever been in the middle of a recipe and find yourself with a growing sense of rage because things aren't working out? (I have to think of Julie/Julia at these moments.) I was making Lora Brody's Little Guy Cheesecake on Monday and suddenly wanted Ms. Brody to reimburse me the money I spent for the ingredients. The ironic thing is I've been on the other side of this equation, when I worked at the magazine. We actually did get a letter from a reader demanding reimbursement when a recipe didn't work out. I don't think she got it. My problem started after the cheesecake was almost through baking and it was time to put the sour cream topping on it. My gut told me, when I took the cheesecake out, that it was still too wet. But the recipe just said \"Bake 25 minutes.\" (It's a very small cheesecake.) Nothing about the state of the cheesecake after 25 minutes. And that's what irritated me. When I ignored my gut (which can't usually be trusted when it comes to cheesecakes -- mine always crack) and put the topping on, it broke through the thin baked part on top of the cake and down into the center of the cake. So I stopped topping it and put it back in for 5 more minutes (not wanting to overbake the thing). Topped the cheesecake, baked it for the additional 5 minutes, then left it in the oven as the oven cooled (because it still didn't look baked). The resulting cheesecake was a mess but edible, I think (no food poisoning yet). After cooling further in the fridge it seemed to set up. But argh! All she had to say was, \"until the sides have set but the cake still jiggles a bit in the middle.\" (Only in a more polished way.) Must not have been too much of a disaster because I haven't had dinner yet and all I'm thinking is, \"Must have cheesecake now!\"

Fresh Direct gets apples from Red Jacket Orchard, but since all the orchard has are mushy old apples from last year (I presume), they're offering good apple butter. I'm on my second jar. It's great with almond butter on a sandwich, but I also had it with ham and Cheddar. Last night I wanted to finish up some brie we had and figured, Why not? What's better with brie than a nice, crisp Granny Smith? Turns out it's a thick coat of apple butter. This took the form of a baguette sandwich with a generous wad of brie, apple butter and Boston lettuce. The classic pairing of apples and brie was really nice with the crunchy bread and buttery lettuce.

Another fast, fast, fast one. Todd wasn't too thrilled, but I liked it. And it made three tons so I better like it because I'll be eating it for a while. I realized too late that the pasta in the leftovers would swell if I left the soup as it was, so I drained it and stored the solids and the liquid in the fridge separately. It works fine, but now I'm out of liquid and still have about 1 1/2 tons of beans, pasta and vegetables left. I sauteed a chopped onion in oil until soft, then added a big can of Italian-seasoned diced tomatoes, 2 cups chicken stock, half a box of frozen peas and carrots and half a box of frozen string beans. Heated that through, then just before Todd got home I added a cup of ditalini and a 15-ounce can of rinsed kidney beans, seasoned liberally, then cooked until the pasta was done.

Today is Kim's first Mother's Day and there simply was no way she wasn't going to get breakfast in bed. Now, with a flaky husband like me, that's going to take some planning - on her part. Closely examine the picture to the left. See those little orange squares on the left-side place setting? Those are Kim's instructions to me on how to put it together. Orange juice in the glass. A croissant or roll on the plate (\"ask in the morning\"). A certain yogurt in the ramekin. Notice no notes on my side of the tray. Now, before anyone start thinking this reflects a certain mania in Kim, let me set the record straight that it's actually a reflection of a certain mania, or short attention span, in me. After almost nine years of marriage we understand what makes each other tick. And that I need all the help I can get to put breakfast on the bedspread. Happy mother's day, Kim. August and I love you a bunch!

I've been harping on Todd about Mother's Day (I'm doing him a favor; it really is very important to me this first time, and Todd can sometimes drop the ball on birthdays, anniversaries and holidays). So when a gigantic box arrived from Cooking.com, I knew it could only be one thing. The much coveted KitchenAid mixer. So I starting a subtle campaign of hints, \"I want to make muffins, but it's so hard with the baby,\" etc., until he caved and let me open it early, with the understanding that it means nothing on Sunday. You can see from the photo what my focus here really is. The mixer is a revelation, like when I got my new stove. It's like having another set of hands. (Even though we don't have room for it, which was always my way of talking myself out of getting one.) Woohoo for motherhood. So August and I took it on its maiden voyage to make some lemon poppyseed muffins for Todd's return from London, which for some reason I have this idea Todd likes. First we sifted dry ingredients (1 1/2 cups flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon salt) onto a sheet of wax paper. Then we got to fire up the mixer, to beat an egg with 1/2 cup sugar. Added to that a 6-ounce container vanilla yogurt and a spoonful of plain (it was supposed to be 8 ounces of lemon, but the convenience store didn't have that), a few drips of lemon extract, 1/4 cup lemon juice and the zest of one lemon and mixed that together, then put the mixer on stir to add 1/4 cup poppyseeds and the dry ingredients. Baked at 400 degrees F for 15 minutes, the brushed liberally (like 5 times) with a mixture of 1/2 cup sugar dissolved into 1/4 cup lemon juice and the zest of one lemon (I heated it in the microwave to dissolve).

I think the next time (if there is one) I make bananas and chocolate wrapped in phyllo I'll use firmer bananas. Last night I cut a banana crosswise in four pieces, the wrapped each piece in a sheet of buttered phyllo with a few chocolate chips. Baked for 10 minutes in a 425 degree oven. The banana didn't hold its shape at all (I haven't decided if that's bad or not, but it reminds me a bit of the baby's bananas). I like the flavor combo, though, and this was a really easy recipe for a quick chocolate-banana fix. Of course, I could just dip a banana in melted chocolate, but I like the flakey crunch of the phyllo, too. Or make a napoleon with baked phyllo sheets, sliced bananas and melted chocolate. That sounds promising.

We made banana fritters the other night using a recipe from an Asian cookbook. We took it one step further by subbing coconut milk for milk, and some cornflour instead of rice flour. The batter was really thick and plastic. It worked really well and turned out to be delicious.

Maybe use bananas a bit on the greener side to get them to hold their shape? I slice them lengthways before peeling them, the idea being that they won't break as easily during slicing with the peel on, but results are mixed and inconclusive.

Next time, give plantains a try. They're perfect for cooking (you have to cook them in order to eat them anyway). They hold up well under intense heat (grilling, roasting, baking), and the flavor pairs well with chocolate and anything tropical.

The banana didn't hold its shape at all (I haven't decided if that's bad or not, but it reminds me a bit of the baby's bananas). I like the flavor combo, though, and this was a really easy recipe for a quick chocolate-banana fix. Of course, I could just dip a banana in melted chocolate, but I like the flakey crunch of the phyllo, too. Or make a napoleon with baked phyllo sheets, sliced bananas and melted chocolate. That sounds promising.

We made banana fritters the other night using a recipe from an Asian cookbook. We took it one step further by subbing coconut milk for milk, and some cornflour instead of rice flour. The batter was really thick and plastic. It worked really well and turned out to be delicious.

Maybe use bananas a bit on the greener side to get them to hold their shape? I slice them lengthways before peeling them, the idea being that they won't break as easily during slicing with the peel on, but results are mixed and inconclusive.

Next time, give plantains a try. They're perfect for cooking (you have to cook them in order to eat them anyway). They hold up well under intense heat (grilling, roasting, baking), and the flavor pairs well with chocolate and anything tropical.

I'd forgotten what it's like to go out on a Friday night. Thursday night was always date night for Todd and me pre-baby, so much so that while I was riding in to meet Todd for dinner last night I wondered if I we would show up and not have a reservation because I'd made it for Thursday. Anyway, we had to wait about 10 minutes for a table at The Red Cat, with frequent assurances from the hostess that it would only be a couple of minutes. So nice. And that set the tone for the whole evening. I thought the waiter would be snooty, but he was nice, too. I took a big risk here and ordered the liver, which I had never had. I figured if I was going to like liver, it would be liver prepared at a place like this, so I went for it. The waiter told me if I didn't like it they'd bring me something else, but you know what? I'm all about appetizers, desserts and sides. Usually the main dish is the most boring part of the meal. So I wasn't too nervous. And even though the unctuous, silky-sweet liver was too much (I liked the crisp edges, though), I really enjoyed the meal. It helped that it started with a hearty dish, their salad of bitter greens. I know it sounds light, but their salad is served on top of a pool of gruyere fondue, with wonderful wedges of salty potato, diced apples and bacon. I could've stopped there. I saw one table sharing it. The liver came with broccoli rabe and tomatoes with olives and capers. The bitter greens actually didn't seem to go very well with the sweet liver, but it was yummy. Todd had the most boring-sounding dish, roast chicken, but they literally spice it up with some Thai chiles. I don't know how they did it, but the skin was crispy and the meat was flavorful. They have some fancy desserts and some wonderfully homey ones. We ended with the rocky road sundae, caramel ice cream with hot fudge, candied walnuts and homemade marshmallows. I wanted the cookie plate, which is served with a mini milkshake. There was also an almond panna cotta that sounded good, but the rhubarb dessert, their special, was rhubarb-raspberry ice cream sandwich, with the bread part made of pistachio meringue. Sounded a little froofy, so we went the comfort-food route.

We ventured out with the baby in his new stroller last weekend, to the Dahesh museum near the IBM atrium in midtown. They have an exhibit of early photography right now, more sociological than artistic, although there were a couple of great photographs by unknown photographers. The permanent collection at the museum is really small and even on a Saturday afternoon there weren't a lot of people there, which made it good for a couple with a stroller child. On the second floor overlooking Madison Avenue is Cafe Opaline, which serves an afternoon tea as well as sandwiches, pizzas and salads. Some of the dishes seem to have a Mediterranean bent, then there's basic dishes, like my crab salad, which was undressed crab meat arranged on a plate with avocado cubes, capers and mixed greens in radicchio cups. Sounded much better than it ended up being, mainly because there was no seasoning or dressing on the crab or avocado. Looking around the table at others' plates gave me the impression that's common. The banana bread pudding I had, with ice cream, was mushy but delicious, if only the baby had let me enjoy it fully (2 hours in a museum plus 2 hours at lunch was too much to ask of him). But the setting was beautiful and the teas were fragrant and wonderful. I think I'd like to try their tea service sometime. And off hours there was plenty of space for our stroller, although the service was pretty bad in the late afternoon, too.

Remember the lamb pitas I made with my dad? The other night I turned that recipe into burgers for me and Todd, using whole-wheat rolls, lettuce and the chutney from the recipe as toppings. I mixed coriander, cumin, fennel and cinnamon into the meat and formed them into burgers, then I mixed finely diced red onion, cilantro and fresh mango into prepared mango chutney. Todd wouldn't touch the chutney but I liked it.

I can't bring myself to call this Indian pudding, although that name does conjure up warm New England winter desserts. It also brings up in me 4 years of p.c. training at a liberal arts college in the '90s. So the more accurate, but much less evocative, cornbread pudding. This is what I think of when I think of molasses desserts -- actually, first I think of molasses cookies, then gingerbread, then this. But I read about this edition of Sugar High Fridays today and wanted to participate so bad I could taste it. Plus, the baby's turned me into a quickie, shortcut-taking, make-ahead, throw-it-together kind of cook, and this recipe, from Gourmet's 5-ingredient-recipe column (I think), fits my new lifestyle. So here it is: Cut 1 medium corn muffin into cubes and put in an oven-proof bowl, then mix 2/3 cup milk with 1 tablespoon molasses, 1 egg, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger and some salt. Pour milk mixture over cubes and let set 5 minutes, then bake in a 275 degree oven for 45 minutes. Top with ice cream or whipped cream (or just cream might be nice, or a drizzle of maple syrup, or some fruit compote).

Yesterday during one of August's naps I roasted some mushrooms with olive oil, salt, pepper, onions and thyme. Today I warmed them up and ate them over slices of premade polenta that I broiled then topped with fresh mozzarella. I was afraid it'd be bland which was crazy; every shrunken little mushroom quarter had an intense flavor that paired really well with the bland polenta and creamy cheese. With just a little prep work the day before it was so quick, too. So often I just end up eating an almond butter sandwich or some yogurt for lunch because I'm so consumed by August's neediness (he's 5 months so it's understandable). It makes me sad, though, when I'm not more conscious about what I'm eating, more thoughtful. It takes a little planning to make it work when you have to steal time from the baby to cook. A sandwich with an interesting flavor combo, a tube of polenta or other convenience food, some make-ahead ingredients, it can work.

Todd's been working late and August is going through a fussy phase, so when the baby fell asleep this morning I flew into action and got started on a few dishes (he's not a reliable napper, so I could have had only about 20 minutes; this morning it was closer to 40). I baked off some par-baked rolls for dinner tonight; split a pound of ground lamb in half, using one to start on the ragu Mark Bittman wrote about in his column today and seasoning the other half with cumin, coriander, cinnamon, fennel, salt and pepper and shaping into patties for burgers tonight; washed and quartered some mushrooms then tossed them with chopped onion, salt, pepper, olive oil and a sprig of thyme and popped them in the 400 degree oven; and chopped red onion, cilantro and mango and mixed it with prepared mango chutney to top the burgers tonight. Whew! When's my nap? It feels good, though, to have some stuff ready to go. The ragu needs to be heated and have the milk added, the mushrooms I'll layer with polenta for a quick lunch for me, and the burgers are ready to go for tonight.

I can empathize with getting stuff done while the little one sleeps. I have a 9 year old but he also was not a reliable napper when he was tiny. Hated to sleep. Wouldn't. When he did, I cheered. I either napped too or did bits of cleaning and cooking like you. It felt great when my hubby got home and most of the dinner was actually prepped so eating would be done at a reasonable time instead of 10 pm.

My son stopped napping all together when he was 2 weeks short of 3 years old. He didn't sleep through the night till past 5 years old. He still never wants to go to sleep - usually somwhere between 10 and 10:30 on a school night and 11 pm on a weekend or vacation night. I know what it is like.

Good that you got such a great meal pulled together when the little one slept. Good job. Sounds delicious.

I made a Gyro Burger last week and it was delicious. This sounds similar. 

I'm proud of you. But remember to get some sleep when the little one does. That is what saved me from going nuts.

I pulled the rest of that pork shoulder out of the freezer this week and made two dinners out of it for the weekend. I threw half of it in the slow cooker for shredded pork tacos again, then made braised pork with orange and fennel with the rest. Actually, not so different from the pork with prunes I made first with this pork shoulder, just different flavors. I think I'd like it to have a more pronounced orange flavor and would add more orange peel next time, or substitute some orange juice for the liquid. Browned a pound of pork cubes, then removed that to a bowl and sauteed a small chopped onion in the pan. Added a couple 2-inch strips orange peel and a piece of peeled ginger, then a couple tablespoons soy sauce and rice wine vinegar, some fennel seeds, a cinnamon stick and a cup of chicken stock. Braised in 350 degree oven for 1 hour, then add a sliced fennel bulb and braised an additional 30 minutes.

I'm finding that I eat a sandwich just about every day, especially since I'm home at lunch and need something that's easy to make. I try to make them interesting, though. A little chive in my egg salad, some smoked salmon and cream cheese. Kale with balsamic vinegar, which I think did not agree with the baby's stomach. Yesterday I had an open-face sandwich, recipe from Epicurious. I used a parbaked whole-wheat roll from Fresh Direct, baked it up and sliced it in half. Drizzled the halves with olive oil then toasted them under the broiler. Then I spread them with apple butter and Dijon mustard and layered ham and Cheddar cheese on top. Broiled again. This is so obvious, obvious, OBVIOUS, but I burned the edges of the roll and the top of the cheese because I didn't keep an eye on the sandwich. After two minutes the cheese was started to melt but not brown, but a minute later the taste sensation was cinders. After scraping off the burnt, it was a pretty good sandwich. The sweetness of the apple butter may seem like overkill with the ham, but it contributes more than just sweetness, an apple flavor, that makes the whole thing more interesting. I think without the mustard it would be too sweet.

Hi there, pretty site!

I've been making giant sandwiches lately layering different meats and cheeses with tomatoes and roasted red peppers into loaves of italian bread.  Then I stick the whole thing into my huge Foreman grill set on high and squish it down.  10-15 minutes later, it's a lovely sandwich; crusty on the outside and gooey in the middle.

I have some apple butter that I canned last fall.  I think next time I'll try your combo here and see how it turns out.

I had lots of kale left over after the chorizo soup, so I found a recipe in The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen that's basically braised kale over bruschetta. Saute chopped kale in olive oil with a garlic clove for 10 minutes, until it starts to wilt. Then add some water, salt, pepper and pepper flakes and steam covered for another half an hour (the liquid was gone from mine at this point). Drizzle the kale with balsamic vinegar (which reminded me of the spinach with vinegar we used to have when I was a kid, only better), then toast some bread, drizzle it with olive oil and scrape a garlic clove on it, put the kale on top, then top that with shavings of pecorino romano.

It occured to me as I was eating the rest of the kale sandwich-style that there's a Tony Luke's thing going on here, only vegetarian. (Tony Luke's is a Philadelphia cheesesteak place that recently opened up a branch near Port Authority - which is, happily, near Todd's office. Their claim to fame in NY is not the cheesesteak but the pork sandwich with sauteed broccoli rabe and provolone. It's juicy and messy and about a foot and a half long, spicy and yummy.)

After about three days the crust on the raisin and pecan bread I ordered from Zingerman's was getting pretty tough to bite through. (Though I tried valiantly, I failed to consume the whole thing. Todd wasn't much help since the loaf was loaded with raisins and he's not a big fan.) Zingerman's also sells chips made from their leftover bread, so I thought I'd take a cue from them and bake up some of my own. It was easy: I sliced the leftover bread pretty thin, then baked the slices flat on a baking sheet in a 300 degree oven until they were crispy (maybe 15 or 20 minutes?). Their a good snack on their own or dipped in some cream cheese or almond butter. The bread's not sweet, but there are so many raisins and pecans that the overall impression is a sweet snack.

OK. I'm reading a review of The Red Cat, where I've always wanted to go, on Words to Eat By, and I'm suddenly desperate. Are there any wonderfully interesting restaurants in NYC where I won't get dirty looks for bringing a stroller? I just had lunch at California Pizza Kitchen, and while I love their chopped salads, with the perfect distribution of ingredients and dressing (and available in half sizes!), it's certainly nothing to brag on. I hear Schiller's is very kid-friendly, and I read a review of Lupa written by a man who always takes his young daughter there, but what about babies? Anyone recommend someplace?

I tended to stay away from places with white table cloths, but mostly when the kids were older and pulling things, knocking glasses over etc. How old is he? With a small baby it is actually easier. I would go in the off-hours, early for dinner or for a late lunch. I remember a lovely lunch at L'Ecole once and my daughter slept through the whole thing. If you can time it with a nap that would be terrific.
Seriously, since kids, I don't get out so much anymore thus my repertoire of great restaurants is not very up-to-date. We had a very nice meal at Little Giant a while ago and I would like to go back. It was a very pleasant place (I think someone had a baby there, but I am not sure) and if you came early I don't think anyone would mind.
Take advantage while he is small and you can take him along.

I know I've been writing a lot about the foods I bought and less about what I've made lately, but Zingerman's web site has one of the best features I've seen on an e-commerce site. When you're placing your order and get to the shipping charges, the site tells you how much more you can spend while paying the same shipping charges (the shipping charges always feel shocking to me when I purchase food that way, so I'm glad to pile more goodies on, get more for my money). When you click on the hyperlinked text, you get a list of what you can afford to add to your order. I added some Spanish chorizo to my order of ganache-filled figs and pecan-raisin bread. So far I've made scrambled eggs with chorizo and a chorizo, kale and potato soup. For the soup I sauteed a diced onion with some diced chorizo, then added two cut-up red potatoes and a huge pile of kale. Poured in some water and added chicken soup base from Penzey's, a bay leaf, a couple sprigs of thyme, salt, pepper and some red pepper flakes. Boiled until the potatoes were cooked then removed the bay leaf and thyme. With the rest of it I think I'm going to simply made skewers of chorizo served with a chimichurri-type sauce.

This recipe is a find for someone like me, who is home all day but doesn't have a lot of time to devote hands-on to stirring polenta. It's from Paula Wolfert's The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen. I always make my polenta with regular cornmeal but this recipe comes out so silky I'd like to try it with a courser meal, maybe even something marketed as polenta. It was a great bland base for the extra-spicy sausage and broccolini I served over the top, although it might have been too bland. There's a point at which Woflert adds more salt that I forgot to add. You just combine 1 cup cornmeal with 4 cups water, a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon of olive oil or melted butter in a casserole dish, then bake for 1 hour 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven, then stir (add more salt to taste) and bake for 10 minutes longer. Simple!

We had our first supper club since August was born so I chose something easy to make in case the babe needed my attention. Good thing, too, because Todd ended up not coming at all, which left the childcare to David, the other husband who rarely brings something to make. He was completely willing and a great babysitter even though I gather he hasn't had much experience with babies. The host's husband, Eric, also spent some time with August on his knee while I chopped. It's good for these guys. Anyway, I made rau thom com ga, mint rice with chicken. I had wanted to make a sticky-rice dish, but this is more of a fluffy-rice dish. I wasn't going to make my own stock so I poached a whole chicken breast in a panful of water with some peppercorns, star anise and ginger (not sure the flavor translated). Then I added Penzey's chicken soup base to 2 3/4 cups of the strained poaching liquid and cooked 2 cups jasmine rice in it (put stock and rice in a pot, bring to a boil, cover and reduce to a simmer for 20 minutes, then let sit another 10). Once the rice was done I mixed in a finely diced small red onion, a cup of julienned mint leaves and the chicken, shredded. Served with nuoc cham, which is a mixture of 5 tablespoons sugar, 3 tablespoons water, 1/3 cup fish sauce, 1/2 cup lemon or lime juice, 1 minced garlic clove and 1 minced Thai chile (this is the recipe in my cookbook; on Saturday Lisa made the nuoc cham for her dish, bun, and I just used some of hers). We also had Lisa's bun with pork (a salad of greens, basil, mint, cucumber, sprouts, noodles and peanuts), Julie's canh ca nau dua (fish and pineapple soup, which she used a fish head for), and a very bizarre coconut and banana dessert with tapioca (which I'm not a big fan of anyway) and sweet potato noodles. Julie and Lisa both said they had fun shopping for the more unusual ingredients (the guy at the fish shop almost seemed excited when Julie asked for the fish head), but all the ingredients for my recipe were available, as Rachael Ray would say, right in the regular grocery store. August and I'll have to do more fun shopping for the next supper club, which I think we decided would be recipes with alcohol. Todd had some of my rau thom com ga warmed up when I got home and said he liked it, even without the dipping sauce. It was better, with more flavor, than I thought it would be, but I liked it drizzled with the sauce. The fragrant jasmine rice really helped boost the flavor.

so in honor of their anniversary I used one of their top-10 commented-on recipes for our supper club last night. I took some liberties with it, though, which I'll post soon. They're also hosting a recipe contest and have articles looking back at www.epicurious.com/features/ten.

My Penzey's order arrived while I was on vacation. I had forgotten what I had ordered, so it was like getting a present to open it up. Now I feel inspired to make all kinds of things. I got coriander and fennel, two ingredients I've been missing in some Moroccan dishes, and some dried spearmint for lamb dishes and tabbouleh. I ordered poppy seeds for lemon-poppy seed bread, although I might look for an even more-intense use, and three thick, beautiful, virile vanilla beans. I also ordered some star anise \"pieces\" and was pleasantly surprised to find they're mostly whole. Round it out with some chicken stock base and a freebie Italian seasoning and I'm ready to start cooking.

Todd's grandmother died recently, and while Todd's mom was going through some of her things she found this cookbook and thought of me. It's a relic of the early sixties, but it has a refreshing and honest (and sometimes amusingly dated) view of cooking and hostessing, with tons of make-ahead advice. I've only made one thing from it so far, but it isn't the recipes that I find appealing. Stories and tips (such as how to decide what to serve for a balanced and easy-to-eat buffet) are sprinkled throughout the book without feeling like essays or forced intros to the recipes. It's fun to curl up with and read. The recipe I did make was au gratin potatoes, and the main thing I learned from it is it's not that hard and you don't need a mandoline. I would actually use a different recipe next time, because you sprinkle flour on each layer in this one to thicken the sauce but it actually just makes curdled-looking squiggles (it was tasty, though). I think Julia has some wonderful herb-infused milk potato recipes.

It took me years to figure this out.  When making potatoes au gratin, think baked macaroni and cheese.  The concept really is the same.  Make a white sauce and swap out the cheeses (swiss, american, cheddar) and the herbs (rosemary, chives & parsley, thyme)  depending on the meat you serve it with.  Look for such a recipe and you won't be sorry.

I kept the main ingredient of the chocolate puddings I made the other night, ricotta, secret from Todd until he told me what he thought of them because he doesn't like ricotta. He told me he liked them well enough, but that the texture felt like a mistake. I liked the texture, a cross between mousse and cheesecake. This was a recipe from Giada DeLaurentiis on the Food Network that I adjusted from 6 servings to 2. Drain 1/2 pound ricotta for a couple hours, then add it to a bowl with 1 egg yolk, 2 ounces melted chocolate (I melt in microwave until almost melted, then stir until the carryover heat has finished the job), a tablespoon sugar and a splash of almond extract. I only have a hand-held mixter with one type of attachment, so first I whipped the egg white with a pinch of cream of tarter to soft peaks, then whipped in a tablespoon sugar (beaters and bowl must be clean to get volume with the white). Then I beat the ricotta with the other ingredients there. Stirred some of the whites into the ricotta mixture to lighten, then folded in the rest of the whites. Baked in a water bath for 25 minutes in a 325 degree oven, then cooled for a few hours in the fridge.

Two more meals from the pig (pork shoulder) I butchered last weekend. I threw some diced tomatoes in the slow cooker with about 1 1/2 pounds of the meat, then added cumin, ancho chile powder, salt and oregano. Cooked 7 hours, first on high for an hour, then low. Then I added a whole chipotle chile and some of its adobo and stirred to break up the pork. Cooked for one more hour. The first night we ate it over rice topped with chopped tomato, avocado, onion soaked in red wine vinegar and parsley. The second night was tacos in flour tortillas.

What do you do when you can't use the traditional walnuts in your banana bread? Chocolate, of course. I used a recipe for cranberry-banana bread from Chocolate & Zucchini , which meant I got to use my new kitchen scale. Cream 1/4 cup butter (55 g) with 1 cup sugar (200 g), then add 2 eggs, one at a time, then 2 overripe bananas, 1/4 cup water and 1 teaspoon vanilla. Sift together 1 3/4 cup flour (200 g), 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon salt (I added a few gratings of nutmeg). Mix dry into wet, add a pile of chocolate chips, then bake in a greased 9 x 5-inch pan for 55 minutes in a 360 degree oven.

As a thank-you for giving us a jumpstart when our battery died (we left the lights on and only discovered it the day before we had to move the car because of alternate-side parking) I made dinner for a couple of friends. I finally tried something from The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen; I'll be doing that again. I made pork stew with prunes and onions; the pork turns out nice and tender and kind of sweet. There are about five layers of flavor in the stew, only one of which I was less than happy with (the pearl onions could've been better, I just have to figure out how). I started prepping this the night before by cutting an X in the root end of 12 pearl onions, blanching them for 2 minutes, then cooling them and popping off the skin. The next morning I butchered a pig. (It only felt like I butchered a pig; I actually cut up a boneless pork shoulder I had ordered for $1.99 a pound from Fresh Direct as part of my new efforts to grocery shop more economically. It took about 45 minutes and involved removing the meat from a huge, freckly flap of pig skin. Cracklins anyone?) I cut about 1/4 of it into cubes for the stew, then tossed them with 2 tablespoons of oil seasoned with cinnamon, pepper, rosemary and thyme and put that in the fridge. Six hours later (and 2 hours before dinner) I cooked the pork in a deep skillet (no extra fat) with the lid on for 5 minutes, then with the lid off until all the moisture had boiled off and the meat was browned, about 10 minutes. Took the pork out of the pan and added 1 cup diced onion and cooked until browned, then added that to the pork. Combined 1 tablespoon each red wine and mustard and 1/2 cup dry white wine in the pan and reduced to a glaze, then added another 1/2 cup wine. Reduced, then added the last 1/2 cup wine and reduced that. Added 3 peeled garlic cloves, 12 baby carrots and a bay leaf to the pan, then poured in 1 3/4 cup chicken broth and added the pork and onions back in. Set on a back burner on low, covered, for 45 minutes. During that time I soaked 12 prunes in hot water and put out olives, warmed pita and a strained-yogurt dip, and carmelized the onions. The recipe's technique was to boil, covered, 1/4 cup water, a teaspoon of sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons butter and the onions in a skillet for five minutes, then cook uncovered for 10. I don't feel like the onions got cooked enough and will probably try cooking them lower for a longer time the next time I try them (or maybe roasting?). Anyway, after the 45 minutes I added the prunes and onions to the pork and cooked for 15 more mintues with the lid off (the recipe called for it on, but I wanted to get rid of some of the liquid). I made couscous during the last 15 minutes because my new favorite serving method is a big pile of couscous with a well in it, into which I dump some long-simmering stew (so forgiving timewise, which is great when there are guests) that I top with something green (usually flat-leaf parsley). It's a nice-looking presentation.

I recently made this for friends too and it was also a big hit. I also had a problem with the onions thinking I needed more practice and wondering if it was worth the time it takes to peel them myself or to just use the frozen already peeled. I asked a friend of mine who's cooking I admire and he swears by the frozen peeled, so maybe next time I'll try them. Anyway. I really like Paula Wolfert's books, I have a few and so far nothing I've made has been disappointing.

This was a quick make-ahead meal (I was able to assemble this while August slept and popped it in the oven when Todd called to say he was on his way home) and it's pretty versatile, too. I've been wanting to make cannelloni for a while, but I was planning to make my own pasta or crepes. It's just an extra couple of steps that kept me from making the dish. So I turned to no-boil lasagne noodles, which worked pretty well in a pinch. I soaked 4 of them in hot water for 10 minutes while I thawed and squeezed dry a box of chopped spinach. Meanwhile I mixed a scant 1/2 cup ricotta with a lot of Parmesan Reggiano and shredded mozzarella and some oregano, salt, pepper and hot pepper flakes. Mixed in half the spinach (saved the rest for my tomato soup the next day), then drained and blotted the noodles. Spread 1/4 of the ricotta mixture at a short end of each noodle and rolled them up. Spread some pasta sauce (I used bolognese, which I think was a little too much but Todd liked) in the bottom of a casserole dish, then place the noodles in seam-side down, then cover them with more sauce and mozzarella. Bake at 350 degrees for 35 minutes.

Chili is one of those things I make all the time, but I rarely do it the same way twice. Some kind of meat, some kind of beans, diced tomatoes, chopped onion, cumin, chile powder, sometimes cinnamon or molasses. Last time it was ground turkey, a chipotle chile in adobo, kidney beans and cinnamon (plus the tomatoes and onion). With the leftovers I made a pie. I simply placed the chili in a deep casserole, and put it in the preheating oven to warm it. Then topped it with half of the cornbread recipe I use all the time: 1/2 cup each cornmeal and flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon salt, 1 tablespoon sugar. Mix 2 tablespoons melted butter with 1/2 cup milk and 1 egg. Add wet to dry and mix. (This is the half recipe.) Baked in 450 degree oven uncovered for 20 minutes, then, because the top was browned, covered with foil and cooked for 15 more.

Every nursing mother I know has put some kind of restriction on her diet hoping to make things gastronomically easier for her babe (we're all martyrs these days). But one baby girl in my \"playgroup\" (the moms just sit around and talk, nurse, change diapers, etc) has severe distress and may have a lactose intolerance, so the mom's off dairy for a while to see if things clear up. Which makes baked treats kind of difficult, since she's being really strict and can't have things made with butter or milk. But I found some spice cookies made with shortening. Not so excited about baking with shortening (except for biscuits and pie dough, where it can make a great texture), but it fits the mom's diet, I think. And they tasted pretty good, not very sweet but chewy and spicy. Start by creaming 3/4 cup room-temperature shortening with 1 cup packed brown sugar. Add 1/4 cup molasses and 1 egg. Combine 2 cups flour, 2 teaspoons baking soda, 1 teaspoon each cinnamon and ginger, 1/2 teaspoon cloves and 1/4 teasoon salt. I also added a few grinds of black pepper. Mix into the wet stuff and chill it in fridge for 1 hour. Roll into tablespoon-size balls, dip one side in granulated white sugar and bake in 375 degree oven 10 minutes. The recipe is from Epicurious.

Hi Kim!
If you ever need help with non-dairy cooking again, let me know.  Unfortunately, I'm fairly experienced.  Xander has been off of all Dairy and Gluten (wheat, oats, most grains) since the summer.  A few weeks ago, we found out that he is also allergic most of my substitutes (Rice Flour, almonds, soy, corn, potatoes!) as well as Eggs and most nuts!  This is going to get very interesting.  I found a cookbook, and now need to learn about how to use amaranth flour :)  He isn't allergic to walnuts so there will probably be a lot of walnut flour involved.
Lots of margarines are dairy free- of course, they don't do as well in cookies as the shortening probably did!

It's been one culinary misstep after another lately, which is why I haven't written. St. Louis cut pork ribs, which are supposed to have a good portion of fat cut off, still ended up grisly and swimming in their own fat at the end of two hours' cooking. Some sausages, pork with kashkaval cheese, tasted gamey and fatty. A trip to Eddie's Sweet Shop ended in the revelation that it's closed on Mondays, the day we took the long walk. I did make some turkey chili that I'll redress as leftovers tonight and some spicy molasses cookies, which I'll also write about later.

Those ribs were still good regardless of the gristle. The spicy sauce was great (a little toooo hot) and would be good to try again with a leaner meat.

This was perfect for me because I could prepare it after the baby went to bed and have it in the fridge waiting for me when I was ready for lunch the next day. It'd also be perfect picnic food. It came out of the Julia and Jacques book I just got. Inspiration for it, anyway. They used anchovies and lettuce; I used tuna and green beans. Fresh Direct has these par-baked whole-wheat rolls that I love because they're the perfect size for a sandwich (and they perfectly fit the veggie burgers I buy, but I hate to even admit I eat those things), and I can just bake up one or two at a time when I want them. This time I sliced one in half horizonally, drizzled lots of vinaigrette over both halves, then layered on oil-packed tuna, cured black olives, steamed green beans and sliced tomato. Wrapped the sandwich in plastic wrap and put it under a heavy jar in the fridge (so the juices from the tuna and tomato would soak into the bread).

Todd's been in the doghouse the last few weeks - until this weekend he hadn't had a day off for about a month. Then he took a trip to Finland for business, which is why I took a trip home to Colorado. But while I was staring at a cupboard full of meal replacement bars and drinks at my parents', Todd was eating a Scandinavian meal at a nice place in Helsinki. Fortunately for our marriage, the Helsinki airport offers a good selection of food gifts. He brought me some caramels and birch syrup, which I guess is the equivalent of maple syrup, although I did notice it starts with a sugar syrup and then adds the birch stuff. I have to admire the Finn's package designs, at least. I reserve judgement on the food itself.

I spent the last few days in Colorado with my parents and for my last night there I decided to make the lamb in the previous post. They had really liked their first taste of lamb, the lamb pitas we had the last time they visited. Then my brother and his wife said they'd like to come, but she doesn't like the idea of eating baby sheep, so I added a chickpea stew to the menu (identical to the chickpea soup without the stock, water and bouillon). To round out the meal I added some roasted zucchini and dates and mint tea for dessert. I piled the lamb on a bed of couscous. My dad and I prepared it together: shopping for ingredients, preparing the spice mix and prepping the meat in advance, chopping, sauteeing, etc. Last Chistmas I lamented not having someone to cook with, and now I have someone! And it's so gratifying to cook for a group of folks, and introduce them to new flavors. Todd was in Finland while I was in Colorado, and that's inspired me to try a Scandinavian menu next. I wonder if I stll have that Aquavit galley floating around?

I'm loving this All About Braising cookbook. I made so many changes and took so many shortcuts, but it still tasted awesome. I had wanted to make braised lamb shanks from another cookbook but my stinginess took over when I saw how much it would cost, so I went for the much cheaper lamb stew meat. This recipe was for lamb chops but I figured the spices and the technique would work with the meat I bought. I mixed the spices and rubbed it on the meat the night before I cooked it. And I took shortcuts with the spice mix (used ground instead of toasting seeds then grinding them, which I know compromises the flavor, but it's either that or don't cook at all). I even didn't have coriander and fennel, the two main spices (see, it's an amazingly forgiving recipe). I did have black pepper, allspice, salt, ginger, nutmeg, cinnamon, cloves, turmeric and cayenne, so I mixed it up, tossed it with the cubes, then let it sit in the fridge overnight and most of the next day. Two hours before dinner I browned the meat in butter, then removed it from the pan and added a sliced onion and some turmeric (should've been saffron). Cooked until soft, then added 2 minced garlic cloves and stirred less than a minute, then added a cup of water and the meat with it's juices. Covered it and cooked it in a 300 degree oven for 1 1/2 hours. Served over couscous with chopped parsley on top.

On my list of reasons to be sad about leaving my job to stay home with the baby is that I no longer have access to cast-off copies of new cookbooks. One of the last ones I got my hands on before leaving was Molly Stevens' All About Braising, which I've really been enjoying. I made a pot roast and the peperonata from it, and tonight I took some liberties with a Moroccan-spiced lamb chop recipe (more about that later). The upshot of that is that, for the first time in a while, I'm picking out my own cookbooks. Todd bought me two for V-day: Julia and Jacque Cooking at Home and The Slow Mediterranian Kitchen. David Leite posted an interview with Paula Wolfert, the author of the latter cookbook, on his Leite's Culinaria. recently. In it they complained about how everyone's interested in food but no one cooks anymore. So it's ironic that I've really enjoyed reading her cookbook but have yet to make anything from it. But, as she says in the interview, it is the reading material that makes her cookbook unique. Someone could steal her topic but never reproduce the results. Kind of like some recipes (bread, for one).

Vinegar and Strawberries?

We had some leftover strawberries from our Valentine's Day fondue, so I finally got to try something I'm aways reading as a serving suggestion: strawberries and balsamic vinegar. Julia Child suggests macerating the strawberries with a little bit of sugar in balsamic, which is what I did. It tends to make the strawberries taste more like strawberries, sweet with a tang. What I liked even more was the liquid that was left, a mixture of the strawberries' juices and the balsamic. I drizzled it over poundcake and topped it all with the strawberries. I actually think the poundcake was too sweet; most recipes I see are for the mixture served with sabayon or mascarpone.

Today a friend brought over some fantastic floral-flavored chocolate from Cacao Sampaka, which was featured in Saveur's February issue. I tried a rosemary one and another one I couldn't identify. It had a smokey, almost musty taste, and I think it may have been jasmine tea, just because it seemed like a tea flavor and that was the only tea in the box. The rosemary one was an utter surprise: The chocolate and rosemary flavors were so distinct, separate, the chocolate a backdrop for that foresty rosemary flavor. It tasted so unique and recognizable at the same time. I'm hooked. Unfortunately I don't know how to get my hands on more. The chocolates are sold in Barcelona, Madrid, Valencia and Girona, according to Saveur. They do have a web site, though they don't seem to sell online.

Todd and I were sitting in one of our favorite quick-bite places, La Mancha Empanadas on Austin street, when a man walked in and asked if they had any low-fat options. Fortunately, they do not. The guy behind the counter (I think he may have been the owner) mentioned some healthier fillings but confessed that the dough, which is thick and flaky, is not low in fat (thank goodness!). He was equally frank with me when I asked, upon taking one to go, if it was hot. \"Yes. If it weren't, it'd be like a brick.\" I don't know how they do it. The empanadas are piled high in the case, but I've never had one here that was anything but fresh and hot (except for the dessert ones - apple, cherry, guava and on one occasion chocolate and cream - which are served cold). I can't pass up the spinach and cheese, but Todd's tried a few - chicken, pork. They have other nontraditional fillings, like pizza, barbecued pork and ham and cheese.

Last night while making dinner I made peperonata: braised a thick-sliced onion with 2 sliced bell peppers, a generous pinch of salt and some red pepper flakes. I say \"braised\" because I got the recipe from All About Braising by Molly Stevens and because the vegetables are cooked in a skillet in olive oil with the lid on, so they exude a lot of juice. Cooked them for 45 minutes, then hit them with some balsamic vinegar and put them in the fridge. Ate the peperonata at room temperature on some toasted country bread smeared with goat cheese. You need something tangy to balance the sweetness of the peppers. It's amazing how something so simple can be so good.

I had a weird confluence of reading material sent my way last week. One former coworker sent me the new Ruth Reichl book, Garlic and Sapphires, and another sent me an interview with William Grimes that was in Newsweek when Grimes resigned as restaurant critic (the coworker ran across it while doing some research). Then there was an article in the Times about the loathing restaurant workers feel toward diners. They just all drove home to me the weird interaction between diners and the restaurants they go to. When Reichl was offered the job as the New York Times’ new restaurant critic, she said the Times should be writing reviews not for people who will go to the restaurants but for those who may never set foot in them. Yet throughout her new book is evidence that she does feel responsibility toward the more disenfranchised of the dining public to portray an honest picture, because they will act on her advice. No doubt her ability to write food porn would have been better if she had shown up to restaurants as herself and let them lavish her with their best efforts. Instead she became the kind of characters who often receive servers’ scorn. It makes sense, but I never realized high-profile reviewers would go to such lengths to disguise their identities. One of the pleasures of the book is Reichl’s exploration of how her various disguises affected her. I ate it up. But it strikes me as odd that restaurants are willing to create such an artificial experience for reviewers, and therefore artificially high expectations for their diners. In her book Reichl describes an instance when one of her guests paid the check for the couple sitting next to them, who obviously had saved their money to go to what reviews had called one of the most romantic restaurants in the city. It also served about the worst food and had treated the young couple very badly. That's a familiar scenario. It's kind of terrible that eating at a great restaurant is for a lot of people an entirely uncomfortable experience that they're paying a huge amount of money to have.

I love these oven pancakes. They're very eggy and so simple to make that cleanup's really easy. I've never had a clafouti but I always imagine it's something like this, like a set custard. It puffs up quite a bit in the oven. First you preheat the oven to 425, then put 2 tablespoons of butter in a pie plate and put that in the oven. Once the butter's melted, I covered the bottom of the plate with some bottled sour cherries (not cherry pie filling; just cherries in juice). Put that back in the oven, then whisked together 3 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup flour, a teaspoon sugar, a pinch of salt and a grating of nutmeg. Pour that into the heated pie plate, over the cherries, and bake for about 16 minutes, until set and the puffed-up edges are nice and brown. Slice and serve. We ate it with maple syrup. You could probably add more sugar or flavorings like vanilla. The original recipe used sliced almonds instead of cherries, or you could add different cooked fruit, like apples. Maybe even make a savory one, with smoked salmon, ham or bacon, or some cheese?

Just clicked through to your very nice blog from another one (the blogosphere is so cool!) and was happily reading when I must have said out loud        \"mmm that sounds good\".  My husband asked what I was talking about.  When I said \"sour cherry oven pancake\" he said, \"mmm that does sound good\".  

So guess what we're having this weekend?

I had baked the shrimp (450 degree oven with lemon juice and zest, olive oil, garlic, salt and pepper) last night and we only ate half of it, so I was looking for a way to use the rest without cooking it more. Jamie Oliver does this thing with cold couscous and lemon dressing, so I decided to try that. Whisk 2 tablespoons lemon juice with 5 tablespoons olive oil, salt and pepper in a large bowl. Whisk in 1 cup cold water, then 1 1/2 cups couscous. Let sit 15 minutes. Last night I added the shrimp, cold, and quartered artichoke hearts. Kind of a summery dish, but it was balmy around here today - 41 degrees!

In addition to the cassoulet and cake, we had a simple salad on my birthday: just romaine, vinaigrette and some grated Parm from my Zingerman's box. And I'm eating the salad and thinking it's one of the best I've had, but I can't figure out why. The flavor was full and mellow, almost thick and buttery. Then I realized it was the cheese. Maybe it was some special alchemy with the sweet, thick balsamic I used in the dressing. I even felt weird about the combo, but it stood up. All that richness worked beautifully with the hearty, crisp romaine. As a followup to my previous post: the cassoulet was good, and the cake was dense and moist, better than their sometimes dry cupcakes. As for the frosting, a little goes a long way since it is almost pure butter, too rich. Every plate always ends up with a smeary gob left on it.

I'm turning 30 today. A big milestone, but a small day in comparison. I'm hanging out with my baby all day, then Todd and I will eat a nice dinner here at home, ordered from Fresh Direct (a cassoulet). It feels kind of pathetic after all the fabulous places I've eaten and all the options available to me. I just have no one to leave my 2-month-old with, and wouldn't feel that good about leaving him anyway. My parents are visiting in three weeks and I think I'll make them babysit while we go out one night. I've got some places in mind. I am making Todd bring home a cake from Cupcake Cafe, which is just a couple doors down from his office. Considering the proximity he should bring me treats all the time. Their sweet potato doughnuts are my favorite. Maybe the cassoulet will be fabulous, the cake decadent. It doesn't matter much to me as I sit here with my new baby sighing, cooing and smiling in his sleep. But I'll let you know. Update: The cake in question;

Happy Birthday to you! I have a best friends who's birthday is today too. She is 44 today.

I know your situation because I am in the same one - have a son who we don't leave to any babysitter. Since we moved here, we haven't gotten one local babysitter. Only when his grandma visits to we go out anywhere without him. He is 9. 

My birthday was spent at home too - I made my own birthday cake - an Ebingers Black Out Cake - and my hubby brought home chinese food and flowers.

So, happy birthday! I  hope hubby comes home with really good goodies from Cupcake Cafe and some flowers or a great gift.

How excited would you be if this box arrived just days before your birthday? I persuaded Todd that it had to be opened immediately because of the perishables sticker on it. Of course, Todd knew what was in it, and that most of it wasn't perishable, but he let me open it anyway. One of the few perishables in the box was a big loaf of Zingerman's paesano bread, with a thick, crusty crust and soft interior with huge holes. Zingerman's is a collection of foodie shops (bakery, creamery, deli, etc.) in Ann Arbor; I have the book Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating, which is broken into chapters on things like olive oil, honey, cheese, etc. and explains how they're made and what makes them great. It's the perfect book for someone who doesn't like to cook. It's good for cooks, too, but it teaches how to buy such great ingredients that you hardly have to do any cooking at all to make an impressive spread. Zingerman's also does a lot of mail-order from their web site.

The best thing about these fudgey cookies is that there's nothing you can't eat raw, so the batter's fair game. First you mix 1 cup flour, a pinch of salt and 1/4 teaspoon baking soda in a bowl, then you melt 5 tablespoons butter over low heat in a medium saucepan. Add 7 tablespoons cocoa and a cup of sugar, 1/3 brown and 2/3 white. Whisk together, then add 1/3 cup plain yogurt and 1 teaspoon vanilla then mix in the flour mixture. Drop by the tablespoon 2 inches apart and bake in a 350 degree oven 8 to 10 minutes. They come out of the oven really soft, so you have to leave them on the sheet for a couple minutes to firm up. They're chewy and a good fix for a chocolate craving.

I'm not a big fan of most fish, probably because it's so good for you. But pair it with some smoked sausage to cancel that out and I'm in. I was looking for a way to use up this chorizo and decided such a bland fish could use a flavor boost. I sauteed diced onion and chorizo then added salt, pepper and paprika and a can of diced tomatoes. Put two cod fillets on top and spooned some of the tomato mixture over them, then cooked it for 15 minutes in a 350 degree oven until the fish was opaque at the center.

I did the menu equivalent of buying an outfit to match a pair of earrings tonight. I had turkey gravy left over from the open-face turkey sandwiches of the other night, so I decided to make pot pies with it (I also had a box of ready-to-bake pie crusts). To make the filling I mixed cubed chicken breast from a rotisserie chicken with the gravy, frozen peas and cooked, quartered baby carrots. Piled it into two ramekins and topped it with pastry circles cut about 1/2 an inch bigger all around. Baked in a 450 degree oven for 15 minutes to cook the pastry. I'm becoming a regular Sandra Lee (horrors!).

We did not get to the grocery store yesterday afternoon (although I did go to the drugstore for diapers last night and have to say I really like being out in the snow). But because I've been staying home with the baby I've been stocking up on food and we were in good shape. In fact, last night I had multiple options for Todd. He chose pasta with broccoli and chickpeas, a recipe from Gourmet (there were tons of recipes in the Jan issue I found I wanted to try). Saute 2 minced garlic cloves and some crushed red pepper flakes in a couple tablespoons of oil for just a minute, then add a box of frozen chopped broccoli. Once the broccoli's thawed and heated through, add half a 15-ounce can of chickpeas. Toss in 2 servings of long pasta (we used linguine because it was what we had, but the recipe called for whole-wheat spaghetti). We both really like it, with its touch of heat from the pepper flakes. It makes 2 very generous servings.

The best part about cooking at home is you get to alter dishes to include all your favorites while leaving out what you don't like. This recipe is a combination of two different sources, Todd's mom and the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, and a couple ideas of my own. I diced an onion and 1 1/2 links of smoked chorizo in the afternoon while the baby slept. When Todd got home (early last night, around 6:30!) he sauteed them in a big skillet. He also sprayed corn tortillas with cooking spray and toasted them on a baking sheet in a 350 degree oven (it took about 15 minutes, and I turned the heat up to 400 for the last five because they weren't toasting fast enough). I added cumin and ancho chile powder to the onions and chorizo, then half a 28-ounce can of diced tomatoes. Brought that up to a boil then dropped it to a simmer. Broke an egg into a custard cup, then slid it from the cup into the tomato mixture to poach, and then repeated with another egg. Covered for five minutes, then took the cover off for five more to boil off some of the moisture on low heat (the tortillas weren't done yet). I also heated some fat-free \"refried\" black beans in the microwave. Spread that over the toasted tortillas, then spooned the egg and the tomato mixture on top. This was an incredibly hearty dish, but I've reached that stage in nursing where I'm ravenously hungry all the time. Todd has to eat fast to finish before I do or I start attacking his plate.

***CONTENT
Rastall is the dining hall at Colorado College. I met my husband my freshman year of college, and we spent loads of time that first year, when we were just friends, in the dining hall with a loud, leisurely group of people (some with whom we still keep in touch). So you can imagine the mixture of nostalgia and offense I felt when Todd burst out at dinner last night, \"Rastall. That's what this reminds me of.\" Granted, I had made a dining hall classic: hot open-face turkey sandwiches. But I certainly didn't want my version reminding my husband fondly of his college days. I have to explain, though. Todd did not consider Rastall a negative experience: The choices were relatively plentiful, the vast array of salad accoutrements is impossible to match in a home kitchen, and there was always cereal when things got really dire. One cook, Charles, was famous for his omelettes. And it's not like I put a lot of work into dinner. I had purchased some Fresh Direct turkey gravy, which Todd liked but I found kind of salty, and simmered some sliced deli turkey in it, then piled it on squishy sandwich bread (the only kind to use for open-face, gravy-based sandwiches). Easy. And, for Todd, it fits into a little-known genre of college-nostalgia comfort food.

I mentioned this in a past entry and said I would post the recipe but never did. Yesterday some coworkers came over to see the baby and I couldn't decide whether to make something for them. I finally decided not to, but then they were running late and Todd was all over the baby, and this cake is so easy to make I couldn't resist. It comes from a one-bowl recipe story in Cooking Light from a while back (I haven't gotten Cooking Light for at least three years) that I love; there's a coffee cake and a chocolate cake I also still make from it. You start by melting 5 tablespoons butter in a large bowl, then add 1/3 cup brown sugar and whisk together. Whisk in 2/3 cup molasses and 2 eggs, then 2 teaspoons ground ginger, 1 1/2 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice, 1/2 teaspoon each baking soda and dry mustard and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Then add 1/2 cup milk and stir in 1 1/2 cup flour just until moistened. Pour into 8-inch square baking pan and bake at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. The flavors meld and get better the second day, but it's good even on the first with some freshly whipped and slightly sweetened cream.

Friends with older babies tell me that I have oodles of free time now and that I'll learn what it really means to be busy when August starts walking and stops sleeping so much. I guess it's nature's way of curtailing a new parent's freedom slowly, edging me into it so I'm not too overhwelemed. Because I have to say that even though I'm home all the time I cannot always find the time to prepare the food that I had planned. So I've been looking for dishes with make-ahead elements so there are things I can do whenever August decides to take a nap. Baked pastas and casseroles work well. A slow-cooker meal fits in, too, because he sleeps later than me in the morning and I can just throw everything in. Another option is meals so quick I can wait until Todd comes home to throw them together. That's the category this soup falls into. In fact, the prep of this soup fell into a third category, things so simple that Todd can start the work while I instruct him from the sofa where I'm nursing. He cut 3 all-purpose potatoes into relatively small pieces (but not quite a dice) and then I chopped an onion and two links of smoked chorizo. Sauteed that in a pot for a few minutes to soften the onion and get some color on the meat and potatoes, then added a couple cups each water and chicken broth. Simmered that until the potatoes were done, then I added half a box of chopped, frozen spinach. Seasoned with salt and pepper and served.

I went to a meeting last night, leaving August at home with his dad. It was a return to normalcy that I really needed, especially since the baby was fussy and hungry all day yesterday. I went on bed rest late in October, so it had been more than two months. On the way to the meeting I stopped by an empanada shop on Austin street and got a spinach and cheese empanada to eat on the way. The joy of walking down the street eating dinner out-of-hand on a relatively warm, damp night! I love that New York is such a walking city, and there are so many great street and take-along foods here (Chicago-style dogs from Madison Square Park, the vertical fold that makes a slice of pizza take-along food, empanadas, jerk pockets, kati rolls, that fake soft-serve from the trucks, etc).

This time I had all-purpose potatoes instead of baking potatoes, so I cut them up and boiled them, then mashed them. I also had some thyme, so I put that in with the milk and flour at the beginning. I made salmon wrapped in phyllo for my in-laws for their anniversary. And the polenta with Italian sausage and some kind of vegetable has become kind of a staple for me. I refer to my fudgey brownies all the time.

Poor Todd. He's been working really hard, late the last two nights and then full days this weekend, and I'M the one who feels put-upon about it. Being left alone with a 6-week-old baby all day and then also during those evening witching hours when all babies turn from pumpkins to wailing terrors made me as hysterical as our son. (I think we just get kind of sick of each other.) Anyway, this is on my food blog instead of the baby blog because Todd brought me a present to make up for it. Two presents. Ninth Avenue near his office has become quite the culinary mecca, and there's a branch of the Little Pie Company nearby. So I got not one little pie, but two: a sour-cream apple pie (sorry there's no picture, but we ate it fast) and a cherry. A thirty-second nuke gets the underlayer of the brown sugar and walnut topping on the former a little gooey and warms the paper-thin apples coated in sour cream. I'm glad Todd chose the apple because it's one I've wanted to taste for a while. It's so rich that a quarter of the (maybe 6-inch?) pie was plenty. Haven't dug into the cherry yet, so I'll have to report back when we do.

Whenever I order from fresh direct I get a couple types of deli meat, figuring sandwiches are always an easy meal. Last time I ordered sliced ham and roast pork loin. I didn't realize until I received my order that I had the makings of a cuban - just added some pickles, Swiss cheese and a long roll with a medium-crusty crust and a coarse, holey interior (that way when you press it you end up with a crisp crust and a compacted interior). I don't have a sandwich press, so I heat a cast-iron skillet while I assemble the sandwiches, then put them in another pan over medium heat and squash them down by placing the hot cast-iron on top and pressing down with my oven-mitted hand. The insides steam and get all melty and hot.

I have made a Cuban before but I hate Swiss cheese! So, I use any other type that I have on hand but leave the rest of the sandwich the same. Comes out quite delicious. I don't have a sandwich press either, or a panini grill, but I do have quite a large George Foreman Grill and it works very well. I find I have to open and shut it twice - use it twice - to get the sandwich as crispy as you can get it at a restaurant.

I have had real Cuban sandwiches - there is a truck that sits in the Pocono Bazaar, which is an outdoor flea market in Marshalls Creek, PA that serves those sandwiches. They are incredible. They are delicious. I just ignore the fact that I am eating Swiss Cheese. The pickles seem to take away from that flavor so I don't mind it as much. Even with this knowledge, I still find I cannot buy Swiss Cheese, and use it in one of those sandwiches. Also, you have to have the right bread. I make my own Cuban Bread if I'm going to make one of these. 

I'm glad you find these as good as I do. Have one with a Cuban coffee and all is right with the world.

On a whim I ordered some prosciutto with my last Fresh Direct order, then realized that I don't really like uncooked prosciutto. (Horrors! Did I really admit to that?) So I had to find a recipe to use up the offending meat. And in the process I found a dish I'd make again. I pounded some chicken cutlets, seasoned them with salt and pepper, then topped them with prosciutto. Mixed one box of thawed frozen spinach with grated Parmesan, salt and pepper, then spread that over the prosciutto. Rolled it up from the narrow end then fastened with a toothpick. Browned in a skillet, then added 1 1/2 cups chicken stock and simmered until the chicken was cooked through.

But only if no one in the family is dieting. I call it that because while I was pregnant I never felt OK getting mousse in a restaurant because sometimes they're made with uncooked egg whites. This recipe, from Alton Brown, doesn't use any eggs at all, so even little kids can have it. (Oops, well I guess you'd have to omit the rum, maybe, but I think it'd still work.) This is not his recipe to the letter, so for fail-safe results look his up on www.foodtv.com. First I put a shot of dark coffee in the top of a double boiler with 1 cup chocolate chips (which is all I had; anyone looking for a good BD present for me might buy me some nice bittersweet chocolate for baking), a splash of dark rum and 2 tablespoons butter. Melted it above simmering water until there were just a few chunks left, then pulled it off the simmering water and stirred it until the carryover heat finished the job. Set it aside to cool. Then I sprinkled 1/2 teaspoon gelatin over some (less than 1/4 cup) heavy cream in a metal 1 cup measure. Let it sit for 10 minutes, then stirred it over low heat until the gelatin had melted. Added that to the chocolate. Whipped the rest of the cream (a little more than 3/4 cup) in a chilled metal bowl with chilled beaters until medium peaks would form, then stirred a dollop into the chocolate. Folded in the rest, then divided between 4 ramekins and chilled in the fridge for 1 hour. Really, really rich stuff.

Ro-Tel Beef Stew

Before last night, I'd never used Ro-Tel tomatoes with green chiles, but last night I made a beef stew based on an Epicurious recipe that uses a can of diced tomatoes and a can of diced green chiles. I figured the Ro-Tel tomatoes would count as both, but I think they are far spicier than a can of diced green chiles would have been. Todd really liked the stew, but there are two things I would have done differently: There was no thickener, so it was really watery; I would coat the beef in flour next time. And the spiciness of the tomatoes overwhelmed the subtler flavor of the cilantro; maybe if I had followed the recipe exactly it wouldn't have been a problem. I started by seasoning then browning a pound of cubed stew meat, then added a chopped onion, some carrot and a couple diced stalks of celery. Cooked that a bit, then added the tomatoes, 1 cup chicken broth and some dried oregano. Simmered it for an hour, then added some chopped fresh cilantro. Served over rice.

So this is where I find myself. The only place I've eaten out in the last month was Pizzeria Uno, which is just a 10 minute walk from my apartment. The saddest thing about that is I really enjoyed it, in a notch-above-diner-food sort of way. Their fish-and-chips is pretty good (is that sacrilege?), with a thick, crunchy crust and moist, white, bland fish underneath. I had chicken breast stuffed with spinach, broccoli and some kind of gooey white cheese. There's a soft spot in my heart for desserts at these chain restaurants. Sometimes you don't want some fusty, pretty little dessert, but instead a made-in-America over-the-top confection. Hot fudge sauce and piles of whipped cream are always included. This one was a giant, flat, warm, soft chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream and the aforementioned accoutrements. Yum. I have an excuse for this state, though: my new baby. I haven't been willing to go far from him yet, and I don't know how I feel about taking him to a restaurant. But I am determined that this isn't the end of good eating for me. It's just going to be more of an effort.

Good Luck with venturing out and dining with the baby, I do hope you try taking him to a restaurant. I started taking my daughter to restaurants when she was about 8 weeks old and it was a real pleasure. She was very well behaved for the most part and when she started to fuss I'd just take her to the restroom and settle her. It's only been recently, since she started walking that restaurant outings have been hard. She doesn't want to sit in her chair for too long and I'm not keen on having her toddle around disrupting other diners so we've been dining out less. Anyway, good luck.

I second what Deb said!  We started taking Xander out when he was a few months old.  He was always SO GOOD!  He liked looking around at everything, and never fussed.  I miss that!  Deb is right, it's when they get older that the real fun starts :)  Actually, Xander is still PRETTY good, but tends to get impatient when things take too long now (we bring snacks!) Of course, the kinds of restaurants we go to have DEFINITELY changed.  Xander always did well in the busier/louder environments- not only was he entertained, but if he did cry at all, no one noticed!

My parents have never tasted lamb, but they're game to try new things, so we made ground lamb in pitas with mango chutney for lunch the other day. This recipe, from Fine Cooking, is a keeper (even though I took some liberties). My dad sauteed 3/4 pound ground lamb with 1/4 minced red onion (we minced half the onion and reserved some of it for the chutney), a teaspoon each ground ginger and cumin and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Once it was cooked, we added a couple tablespoons prepared mango chutney. Then I made the chutney to serve with it: the rest of the prepared chutney and minced onion, chopped cilantro and lime juice to taste. We ate the lamb and chutney in pitas (I added plain yogurt to mine). It was so easy and pretty good.

Kim, I'm from Melbourne Australia.  

I'm in my early 50's & I find it hard to believe that your parents have never tasted lamb.  No offence intended...maybe theres a valid reason for that.

But then again, if I remember correctly, lamb has never been very popular in USA.  Correct me if I'm wrong please.

However, lamb is a staple diet here & is as common as steak & pork.  We have it as cutlets or chops (fried or bbq'ed or baked in the oven), in casseroles and as a roast.

If I remember correctly again, Australia has just started exporting sheep to USA to keep up with the demand.  But I think the USA farmers arent too happy about it.

I think I may have inspired my dad to spend more time in the kitchen. He came to stay with us when I had the baby, and part of the deal was that he had to help out: cooking, running errands, cleaning. I couldn't imagine he would hold up his end of the bargain. My dad didn't seem like the type. But he really rose to the occasion. He scrubbed the spot on the kitchen floor where my old stove used to sit until you could actually see the floor underneath. He made spaghetti, eggs, Thanksgiving dinner with pumpkin pie and mashed potatoes. I guess he went home to Colorado and made a roast for my mom, brother and sister-in-law, and a couple more pies. Now he's back and he's still cooking and cleaning. We made jambalaya last night (I was his sous-chef). He's semi-retired and I think he's found a new hobby. Maybe my interest in cooking is genetic?

One of the problems of shopping Fresh Direct is that sometimes you'll order some meat or produce and end up with a cut that weighs way more than you expect. We got a 3-pound cut of London broil in our order the other day, and I had to come up with multiple uses for it. So yesterday I cut it into three portions: sliced one thinly against the grain for fajitas, cut one into cubes for beef stew and left one whole for shredded beef sandwiches from the slow cooker. We made the fajitas right away. Seasoned the meat with salt, cumin and chipotle powder and seared them on both sides. Took those out of the pan then added a sliced onion and red bell pepper and cooked until softened. Assembled the fajitas on warmed flour tortillas with cheese and Mrs. Renfro's chile sauce, which is really hot but also has great flavor. Yesterday I put the chunk of beef in the slow cooker with some seasonings, 1/2 cup water and a sliced-up onion until it was falling apart and the onion was completely soft. Ate that on halved seeded Italian bread with Swiss cheese on top (the bread soaks up a lot of the juices from the meat -- yum). Tonight is beef stew night. Lucky Todd's a beef-and-potatoes kind of guy.

Last night when I asked, \"What should we have for dinner?\" Todd realized that he doesn't think of the kitchen when I ask that question; he thinks of the phone and the pile of takeout menus on the desk. And I have discovered that I really hate most takeout. So the other night I pulled together dinner from what we happened to have on hand: some broccoli, elbow macaroni and strips of chicken from the top of a salad we ordered for lunch. While the macaroni cooked I heated about 1/4 cup oil in a skillet and added some red pepper flakes, then some minced garlic. Then I added the broccoli florets and sauteed them, then the chicken just to heat through. Then I spooned in the macaroni along with some of the cooking water into the skillet, added salt and stirred and heated to meld the flavors. Served it with Parmesan grated on top.

that's my favourite way of cooking.
making something out of seemingly nothing.
in our household this regularly translates as omelettes.
I think I could write a book on omelette fillings!

Courtesy of Mark Bittman a couple of weeks ago, sort of. He had a recipe with Italian sausage, and I did an even more streamlined version. It actually took a while to get around to doing it because Todd always changed the subject or suggested something else for dinner whenever I said I was making pasta. I don't know what he thought I was planning to make. It was really easy, though. Todd cooked 3/4 pound campanelle just a couple minutes short of being done while I diced up about 3/4 pound mozzarella. We tossed half the cheese with the pasta, some sauce from a jar and some flash-frozen spinach (I bought a bag of this stuff from Trader Joe's and I love it; instead of being one big clump of frozen spinach, it's individual leaves, so it's so easy to grab a few and throw them in a soup, sauce, etc). Dumped that in a casserole dish, covered it with the rest of the mozzarella and grated some Parmesan over the top. Baked it for 20 minutes in a 400 degree oven, until the top was all melted and getting kind of crusty on the edges. It was so good, with the crunchier top noodles and the gooey, cheesey pasta underneath. Todd really liked it a lot.

I wanted to try a new cut of meat, so I ordered turkey tenderloins from Fresh Direct. There aren't many recipes for these (not even sure where you'd find the tenderloin on a turkey; next time I carve a Thanksgiving bird I'll have to see if I can figure it out). One I found on Food and Wine's web site was pretty popular with Todd, so here it is. First I mixed 6 tablespoons flour with 6 tablespoons grated parmesan cheese, 2 minced garlic cloves, salt, pepper and some of that hebes de Provence Todd's mom bought me on a piece of waxed paper. Then I beat a couple of eggs (probably would only need 1 for a pound of tenderloins) in a shallow bowl. Pounded the tenderloins out thin, then dredged in milk and flour mixture and sauteed in olive oil, 3 minutes on each side. Served with lemon wedges. I also roasted veggies, cutting carrots, parsnips and a sweet potato in matchsticks and tossing them with oil, salt and pepper before roasting in 400 degree oven for about half an hour. I experimented with roasting a beet in the same manner but found it just dried out until I wrapped it in foil, to steam it more than roast it. Haven't tasted the beet yet, though, so I don't know if I ruined the thing or not.

It started with a cup of dried beans and a ham hock, which I had never cooked with before. It was smoked and looked very much like an animal part, with the skin and (ugh) a few coarse hairs bristling. Very cheap, though, and it did the job in the soup. First I soaked a cup of dried pinto beans overnight (why go to all the trouble of the quick-soak method when all you have to do is plan ahead a little?), then drained them and put them in the slow cooker with a diced onion, the ham hock (which I took the skin off of), three diced celery stalks, four cups of water, a bay leaf and some herbes de provence (because I don't have dried thyme). Cooked it on high for an hour, then turned it to low for four more. Then I added a diced carrot and a giant parsnip, diced, and cooked it for a few hours more. Shredded the meat off the hock and added it to the soup, discarding the bones, fat and gristle from it. The soup comes out thick and rustic, perfect on a rainy day with a wedge of bread.

I had written this entry as a draft and then went into the hospital before I posted it, so it's a few weeks later now. But on October 27 I wrote: One of my excuses for missing the most recent IMBB was that my parents and Todd's were in town. The arrival of all these folks was because I had a baby shower this weekend, which my friend Emily planned and catered for me (I hosted since she lives in a typical NY studio). The highlight of the brunch were the waffles and assorted toppings: greek yogurt with honey, homemade apple butter courtesy of Todd's mom, rum-soaked raisins, toasted walnuts, whipped cream, Nutella. We had ice cream, but I don't think it ever got put out. We also had cheddar scones (which we were going to serve sandwiching ham and arugula mayo), mini frittatas with chicken sausage, citrus salad with honey and vanilla, muffins, pumpkin bread from one guest and cranberry bread from another, coffee cake from the food editor at work. Pumpkin soup from Julie in my supper club. White-chocolate dipped dried apricots. Cinnamon coffee, spiced cider and mimosas. Too much food (it was gratifying, though, to realize that a good portion of my friends love to cook/bake and share). But all the parents have been enjoying the leftovers!

Last night I had the smell of garlic on my fingers for the first time in a while. I've been in and out of the hospital the last couple of weeks for pregnancy complications, and now I'm on modified bed rest. I've been trying to figure out what my limitations are as I head back into the kitchen, so I've been looking for really simple things to do. Yesterday for lunch I took a suggestion from Ina Garden (I've seen a lot of her and Paula Deen lately, and WAY too much of Rachael). Toasted some sourdough, slathered on some mango chutney, then melted thin slices of Cheddar over the top. I ate it with tomato soup with spinach, an ultimate childhood combo with an element that made it a little bit interesting. Last night I just sauteed lots of minced garlic in lots of oil, then wilted baby spinach in it, tossed it with capanelle and topped it with Parmesan. Todd's parents stayed with us for an extra week to help around the house and take care of me. Todd commented on his mom's ease at pulling together an evening meal, not even realizing the thought and grocery trips that go into dinner every day. She did pull together bits and pieces on the last night they were here to make a pork, cabbage and carrot saute with sauce that we ate over rice. I loved it. Plus it added cabbage to the list of foods Todd'll eat. She also made pasta, chicken enchiladas, steak-, onion- and Swiss-topped baked potatoes, an omelet, a beautiful pork loin with potatoes and soup. Home-cooked food is so much better than takeout. I'm going to miss them (mom's cooking and dad's dishwashing abilities--plus the company, of course).

So October 24 came and went and no terrine. I had bought all the ingredients, picked out a recipe for something that was at least layered (a ragu and polenta \"terrine,\" layered then baked and served hot). But crises at work, the arrival of my parents for a visit then Todd's, and the exhaustion of late pregnancy foiled me. My dad made \"chili soup\" out of the ingredients that would spoil. I guess to a lot of people \"chili\" is not really a type of soup, more of a stew (which I would also considered a type of soup). The chili soup I had growing up always had onions and peppers, ground beef, kidney beans, spices and a lot of tomato juice to make it soupy. Even now my dad had to improvise and add a couple serving-size cans of V8 to the whole tomatoes in juice I had him break into the chili.

I think I've mentioned this one before. The package of sweet Italian turkey sausage we bought had six links, and I used three to make a sauce for polenta (took it out of the casing). Last night I used the other three to make mini meatballs for a sausage, spinach and cannellini bean soup. I just split the sausages, rolled the meat into balls and dropped them into boiling broth (sauteed onions and garlic, then added 6 cups water and a 2-cup bouillon cube) to cook. Right before we were ready to eat I added half a box of chopped frozen spinach and a drained can of cannellini beans. Topped soup in bowls with grated Parmesan. Another quickie!

It's been getting cool here (I love it), so I've been cooking the kind of warming, hearty dinners that fill the apartment with smells. It's been kind of frustrating, though, because for the last two nights I've made dinner but Todd works so late that he has to eat it warmed up or the next day for lunch. And I've been making stuff I think he'll like, so I hate to waste it on when he's not around. If I'd known he wasn't going to be home, I'd make a mushroom ragout. Monday night was polenta night, which is like an easier version of mashed potatoes to me. I added lots of Parmesan and some heavy cream to make it rich. I had intended to saute sweet Italian turkey sausage with onions and peppers for the topping, but when I pulled out my pepper it had kind of a slimey goo on it. So it was sausage with tomatoes instead. Last night I made a pork stew from the wine issue of Food and Wine, with orange and cumin. I followed Fran's advice of not crowding the pan and ended up with a nice, rich, meaty sauce that had a fresh taste of orange. First I sauteed about a pound of pork cubes until it was browned, then I took it out of the bowl and added a small diced onion and one minced clove of garlic. Stirred that for a few minutes, until the onion was softened, then added the juice of one orange and reduced that. Added a couple cups of water, 2 teaspoons of ground cumin and a bay leaf, brought it up to a boil, then put the pork back in. Simmered for 30 minutes, while I made some fragrant jasmine rice (my trick with the rice is to not simmer it the full amount of time, but turn the heat off for the last few minutes and let it sit to let carryover heat do the work). Then added a generous half cup of chickpeas to the stew, warmed them through, then grated in some orange rind and added a little more minced garlic. During the simmering the sauce reduces and thickens a bit, but the rice is definitely a good soaker-upper under the stew. Todd said it smelled great when he came home (at 9:30!), but he had already eaten.

It's been beef stew kind of weather lately, and there was a recipe for quick beef stew in Food and Wine that gave me the idea to do it (although I did it differently). I think a long-cooked stew is better, of course, but this was good for something quick (the meat didn't break down as much as it would have had the stew cooked longer). First I cut about a pound of stew beef into smaller cubes, then sauteed it in some olive oil until it was brown on all sides. It gave off a lot of liquid, so I poured the beef and most of the liquid (was it fat?) into a bowl, leaving a little in the pan to try to make a fond, which kind of worked after a little heat was applied. Added a diced onion and potato, and two diced carrots, and stirred that until they started to brown and picked up the brown on the bottom of the pan. Then mixed in a couple of tablespoons of flour and stirred it around to coat the vegetables and cook a little. Poured in a can of beef broth, the meat and its juices, a bay leaf and some salt and pepper. Cooked for about half an hour, until the juices had thickened and the vegetables were tender. Then I added a couple splashes of red wine vinegar (the F and W recipe used 2 cups of red wine, but I didn't want to open a bottle just for that since I wouldn't be able to finish it in my current state). It wasn't too bad. I ate mine and ran off to a meeting, leaving the rest on the stove for Todd, who ate when he got home. Another busy night.

The liquid that the meat gave off may have been due to overcrowding the meat in the pan.  You should have browned the meat in smaller batches so that the cubes don't touch each other as they brown.  2 cups of red wine would probably have been too much wine, especially for a quick stew.  I think your use of a little wine vinegar was a great substitute for the acid of the wine. Next time use it earlier in the recipe to deglaze the pan and to let the acid work on the meat longer.  Good job!

We have a column in the magazine called Quick Cook, and after dinner a couple of nights ago I realized that's what I've become. A 30-Minute-Meal-er. A Quick Cook. I think things are about to slow down in my life, but for the past couple of months meals have consisted of whatever I can throw together and eat in the 45-minute window I have before I need to rush off someplace. Pork tenderloin is a great quick meal. The other night I got home about 15 minutes before I needed to leave for a doctor appointment (the doctor's right across the street), so I mixed a spice rub I had received as a gift (it had fennel, something spicy, cinnamon and lots of other things I can't remember) with a couple tablespoons of olive oil, then slathered that over the pork. Cubed up a sweet potato and tossed it with the spice mix and olive oil for me, then did the same thing with a white potato and just salt, pepper and olive oil for Todd. Arranged them all on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet, covered it with more foil then popped it in the fridge. When I got home from my appointment, I got out the pan, preheated the oven to 450 degrees, then cooked the pork and potatoes for 20 minutes, plenty of time to reach that safe-food temperature I need. And it was still tender, despite the lack of pink in the center. Hence the name, I guess.

This chicken turned out kind of bland, but it's been a lifesaver this week in terms of the leftovers being handy for making quick dinners on these frustratingly late nights. I made chicken melts, like a tuna melt with shredded chicken, one night, and quesadillas once. Tonight I'll make chili with what's left. And the first night we ate it over couscous with mango chutney and plain yogurt on top. I sliced an onion and put it in the bottom of the slow-cooker, then mixed a couple tablespoons of flour with turmeric, cumin, red pepper, salt, black pepper (there was not enough seasoning, though). Coated a whole chicken breast (bone-in but skinless) with the flour mixture, then placed it on top of the onion, then added about half a cup of water. Cooked on high for 6 hours, then removed all the bones from the chicken and stirred it so it shredded apart. It ends up so moist you can reheat it without it drying out, and it's an easy shred - it just falls apart. A full chicken breast (both sides) will last Todd and I for four substantial meals. I hate to eat chicken so many times in a row, but we've disguised it in a variety of ways.

I've had the most aggravating last couple of weeks. All I want to do is get home early enough to pull something together in the kitchen, a pot of chili or a pork tenderloin. But it's always something: delays with the subway, Lamaze class, last-minute projects at work that have to be done RIGHT NOW. Just when I think things are going to calm down, they don't. I guess it's something I should get used to as a woman who's 7 months pregnant. I'll have someone else dictating my entire schedule in a while. So even though the process of making a cheesecake did not go smoothly for me this weekend, I still thoroughly enjoyed it, and was even glad for the little difficulties. And I am definitely a big cheesecake fan.

And I am definitely a big cheesecake fan.

A couple weeks ago (the last time I did anything in the kitchen; it's a work-related hiatus from having a life) I set out to make the Tiger Cake from the Bittersweet cookbook. It's a marbled bundt cake made with olive oil that has a touch of white pepper, too. When I got to the step where you mix the cocoa with sugar and water, I realized I had two unmarked containers of cocoa: one was dutched and the other was the regular kind. The recipe called for the regular kind but since I didn't know which was which I figured, what the heck, I'll use half of each. That way I'll at least get some of the right kind of cocoa in there. Then I read the note at the end, which said DO NOT use dutched cocoa because it interacts badly with the olive oil and makes a bitter taste. So no cocoa for the bundt. Thus the albino cake. It was a good, basic snacking cake, nice and moist and not crumbly so you could eat it out of hand. I felt like the olive oil flavor was really pronounced at first and actually faded as the days went by (would that happen?). I didn't taste the pepper, but the recipe said the pepper just emphasizes the olive oil taste. I'll have to post the recipe later, since doing it from memory 2 weeks later is probably not the best idea. I remember choosing the recipe because you don't have to do anything fancy to marble it, just layer the two batters and they do it themselves in the baking.

You know, I reviewed that book, and I made it with the wrong kind of cocoa and it turned out fine. The warning note freaked me out, but it was too late by the time I saw it and...no problems.

I had a little bit of a blood-glucose scare last week, so when Todd and I were at Whole Foods I picked up chicken breasts, something I'm not really so fond of. These breasts looked different, though; they weren't the big, bloated breasts that usually turn me off at the grocery. And when I opened the packet I found that what I had thought was one breast was actually three thin breasts that had been butterflied and stacked on top of each other. I adapted a recipe I found in Rachael Ray's cookbook, chicken and leeks, because I had a bunch of big yellow onions. Seasoned the breasts on both sides, then seared them in a hot skillet, about 3 minutes each side. Then I took them out and added a large sliced onion. Cooked that until it was soft and had picked up all the brown bits from cooking the chicken, then added a cup of chicken broth, a splash of vinegar and the chicken breasts. Simmered that until Todd came home, about 15 minutes later. Onions are actually pretty high on the glycemic index, but paired with a protein it seemed to me like it'd be OK. This dish developed a pretty rich, deep flavor just from the fond and the sauteed onions, and even chicken didn't seem so bad.

it doesn't act like it at all. I wanted to make pizza and thought I would make dough for a crust, but, short on time, I decided to try a polenta \"crust\" instead. It didn't get crispy, though, so, while it wasn't bad at all, it really wasn't a pizza. It was polenta with tomato sauce, meatballs and cheese, which is also very good. I used quick-cooking polenta, 1/2 cup to 2 1/4 cups water, bringing the water to a boil then whisking in the polenta and bubbling for about 5 minutes, stirring the whole time. Then I added salt, pepper and oregano and spread it in a 9-inch springform pan and put it in the freezer to cool. Warmed up and sliced meatballs and shredded cheese while that was cooling, then removed the sides of the springform pan from the polenta and spread tomato sauce over the solidified polenta, arranged sliced meatballs and roasted red pepper and sprinkled with Parmesan, mozzarella and oregano. Baked it in 450 degree oven for about 10 minutes (probably could have used a bit more time, if I had added cheese at the end) on a rack near the bottom, then sliced it like a pizza to eat.

We ventured to Whole Foods in Manhasset on Saturday, so I was able to buy pork tenderloin (we can never find them at our groceries here). I have reason to believe I've been eating too many carbs and sugars lately, so we had a no-starch dinner Sunday night: roasted pork tenderloin with chunky salsa and avocado. And Todd kept raving about it, so he'll be agreeable to a change in our diets (NOT Atkins, but more protein, veggies, etc). I spread the tenderloins with mustard and sprinkled with salt and pepper, then roasted it in a 425 oven until it reached an internal temp of 160 degrees (baby safety temp, but the pork still came out good and tender - I even think the temp went up to 170 while the pork rested). While that was cooking (about half an hour) I chopped up tomato, cilantro and a scallion, then added the juice of a lime and salt and pepper to the mixture. Sliced up half an avocado, then served it with the sliced pork and the salsa. Tonight we had the pork in quesadillas with cheese, black beans, roasted red pepper and topped with the salsa, which I mixed with the other half of the avocado, cubed.

Welcome to the car-driving club, Kim, and good luck finding parking! I'll start with Queens and work my way outwards:

Sapori D'Ischia in Woodside, Queens, has an excellent supply of cheeses, cured meats, pastas, and other specialty products from Italy.

Despana Brand Foods on Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights has a small, but good selection of products from Spain.
http://www.thefoodsection.com/foodsection/2003/10/source_despana_.html

A car makes it much easier to transport the fine beers at Park Slope's Bierkraft and Cobble Hill's American Beer Distributing Company. 

Patel Brothers on 74th Street in Jackson Heights is a giant Indian supermarket. They have the largest supply of packaged flatbreads I have ever seen.

If you are in Long Island, there's a supermarket-size Fairway.

If you are in New Jersey, National Wholesale Liquidators, strangely enough, operates the International Food Warehouse, which has a huge selection of ethnic foods. Here's an account: http://www.chowhound.com/dinner/dinner.html

Also in NJ, Wegman's (there's one on the way to Princeton) is the biggest supermarket I have ever seen. Nothing particularly unique about it, but it is a sight to see when Key Food and C-Town are the norm.

I live in San Fran area and we are so spoiled!  But one thing we don't have is your high-quality Greek stores.  We are Greek and adore some of the stores on Ditmars. There's one--If I remember--called Angelo's. So nice that it is not all chains yet in that area. There is a HUGE Greek grocery at 31st st near Astoria Bl, just off the elevated line. Olives are out of this world.  Try the ones from Crete!

This was a quickie, convenience-food dinner. I simply heated Fresh Direct meatballs (which are pretty good) in tomato sauce, then hollowed out a baguette that I had halved horizontally and filled it with the meatballs. Topped it with Parmesan and provolone, then put it under the broiler to melt the cheese. The meatballs overwhelmed the bread, though, so next time I think I'd halve the meatballs before assembling the sandwich.

My mother came from the north of Italy and polenta was part of their staple diet. As a result she hated it as she had so much of it. Consequently I have always thought of it in the same way so haven't eaten much of it. But this recipe sounds like it might be worth trying. I love parmesan so I think I will like this one.

My supper club got together to prepare a picnic lunch on Saturday. We had curried fried chicken, baked figs with brie, deviled eggs with bacon and spinach, fruit kabobs and three different kinds of free-form tarts: apple, mixed berry with mint and peach. I made my usual picnic fare, black bean and corn salsa, but I made it finger food by putting it in tortilla Scoops and topping it with some diced avocado. I also made a couple of drinks, Watermelon-Lime Agua Fresca and strawberry lemonade. The watermelon drink was fantastic and refreshing. I used a spoon to scoop a quarter of a big watermelon into a blender (it was seedless, but I tried to get rid of most of those little white seeds as I scooped). Then you puree it, then add 1/4 cup lime juice, a pinch of salt and some sugar water to taste (3 tablespoons sugar dissolved over low heat into 1/2 cup water). Serve it cold, cold, cold on a muggy day. Yum! The strawberry lemonade was a recipe from Real Simple, so it was . . .well, you know. Puree a few strawberries (the recipe said 6 to 8, but I used about 10 because mine were small), then add a can of frozen lemonade concentrate and 24 ounces seltzer. Was not such a big hit at the picnic (could be because someone spilled most of it before a lot of people got a taste, but it was just a filler drink anyway, in case the watermelon drink was not enough).

We picked up the most wonderful tomato at a farmstand on the way home from Connecticut this week. It was red, tomatoey, and so sweet. We chopped it up and tossed it with some spaghetti, artichoke hearts and Parmesan for dinner the other night (the artichoke hearts could've used more flavor, but the tomato more than made up for it). I cooked the pasta in lots of salted water, then when I drained it I saved a little bit of the water in the pot and added the tomatoes (not to cook them, really, but just heat them a little). They released some juice into the water, so when I added the pasta back to the pot, it soaked up the juice and got a little pink and flavorful. Tossed that with the artichoke hearts (I used plain, but I'm not sure marinated would have been better; they might have overwhelmed the tomato flavor), salt, pepper and Parmesan.

This isn't it. This is. I've always been curious about these boiled dumplings; it's one of those things that sounds appalling but is such a traditional dish that you think you must be missing something, that it must be better than it sounds. Well, if boiled apple dumplings fit in that category it must be when someone else is making them. Mine turned out awful. Since I approached the whole project with some skepticism I only boiled one and baked two more. The baked ones turned out much better, although the Granny Smiths I used were so tart they could have used more sugar (we just solved that problem by eating them with ice cream on top). The dough was good for baked apples though, and so easy that I'd definitely use it again. It's just 2 cups sifted flour, 1/2 teaspoon baking soda, 1 teaspoon sugar, a pinch of salt and a cup of sour cream (mix dry ingredients, then add sour cream). Form it into a ball and refrigerate while you peel, halve and core 4 apples. Then you stuff the cored space with a mixture of 4 tablespoons butter, 2 tablespoons sugar and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and put the two halves back together. Roll out the dough to 1/8 inch thick, then cut it in four pieces and wrap each piece around an apple, sealing by brushing lightly with milk (Todd helped with the milk, and he was laying it on pretty thick.) Here's where I strayed from the recipe. I dropped one in a big pot of boiling water with a lemon half in it and boiled for 15 minutes, after which time I had the fallen-apart mess you see above. I also baked 2 in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes, basting them with the leftover butter mixture when they started looking dry. (I only made 3.) Thank goodness. I would've cried if all three had ended up like the tasteless goo of the boiled one. Split a baked one between two bowls and top with raisins, walnuts and ice cream. I have been oh-so remiss about posting a link to the rest of the IMBB entries. Here it is, finally: life in flow

Hi,
I just was searching to see if anyone every made boiled apple dumplings like my grandmother. One thing that may have helped your dumpling from falling apart would be to wrap them in cheesecloth or some other clean, thin, white cloth (I think my grandma used old tea towels (as she called them) that she cut into squares large enough to wrap around the pastry wrapped apple). Then try a gently boil, not a full rolling boil. I loved them with a bit more sugar on top and in a bowl of milk. I was trying to find where the recipe originated (I believe Grandma's was PA Dutch, like most of her other recipes) but I'm not certain. 

Anyway, I hope this helps. They're not the same type of dumpling as baked apple dumplings, much more on the chewy side but there are alot of German dumplings (knodel)that are similar.

Hope you try them again. Oh, by the way, Grandma never used Granny Smiths, always Macintosh or Winesaps which were sweeter and held their shape.

I'm so glad I got the new NYC Gourmet Marketplace in the mail. I had no idea what a wealth of food shopping was available to me right around work. These are the places I've decided to try: I'm going to send Todd to Good & Plenty to Go and the Little Pie Company for some prepared food and a 2-person pie next time I don't know what to make for dinner. Maybe for a special occasion I'll pick up some steak at Le Marais. And there's a wealth of bakeries: in addition to Amy's Bread and Cupcake, which we already frequent, there's Poseidon (I think I may have been there for cannolis that are filled to order), Pazzo, Ruthy's and an outpost of Sullivan Street.

Sweeet Potato, Bourbon-Pecan, Lemon Chess, Coconut Custard, Nectarine-Blueberry, Chocolate Silk and, of course, Apple . . . and I sampled every one at the end of the class I took this morning at the New School. It seems like the nuances of those traditional, homey kinds of baking techniques (breads and pies) are always the ones that elude me, so I signed up for this class to work on my pie dough. And I learned a couple of things that'll be useful: 1. Don't fear the food processor. When I've made pie crust in it in the past, I ended up with a paste. I knew it was simply a matter of not overprocessing next time, but I always figured it was better to use a pastry blender anyway. Not after today. We blended the dry ingredients (1 pound flour, 2 to 4 tablespoons sugar and 1 1/4 teaspoon salt), then pulsed in 10 ounces cut-up cold butter and 2 ounces lard until it looked like rough meal. 2. But don't overwork it. We took the dough out of the processor after cutting in the fat and put it in a big bowl to sprinkle in the 4 ounces ice-cold water, then we squeezed it with our fingers (not our palms) to make it come together. Finish that job with some parchment. 3. I need a scale. One pound of flour is about 3 cups, but it seems to be 3 cups and a smidge more. Dough amounts were always measured in ounces. Surely I'd find other uses for it. 4. Just roll the center, then turn. That seems to be the key to getting the crust round. And I have the wrong kind of rolling pin. I need the plain kind, just a piece of wood, basically, either flat or tapered. I have the kind with handles. 5. Refrigerate, refrigerate, refrigerate. Literally three times. Cut up the butter and lard, then put it in the fridge while you measure the flour. Refrigerate the dough in a disk after forming, then again after you've rolled it out, either in the pie plate or flat. Maybe even an extra time or two if the dough starts to get too soft while you're working with it. 6. For a crisp crust, process the butter to small pieces, bake in Pyrex or ceramic and bake on the bottom oven rack. 7. You can never have too much pie. After sampling all seven types of pie this afternoon, I can safely say I've tested this one. And I was surprised to find my favorite was the Coconut Custard pie, followed by the Apple. Maybe it's because those are the fillings I worked on - the best pie is the one you make yourself, no?

I did have one interesting thing for dinner this week, but it wasn't too complicated to make. Just shredded chicken (left over from Todd's diner fried chicken the night before), diced avocado and mango, lime juice, salt and pepper. Just ate it as a salad that night, then on toasted bread as a sandwich the next day. I crave avocado these days. If it's in something on a menu, I order it. I buy them cheap at the local fruit and veggie stand. The other night I had half an avocado sprinkled with lime juice and a couple of corn cakes for dinner. It's almost like the creamy, smooth flesh quenches a thirst in me.

Todd and I spent the weekend at the Park Central hotel and had a really nice five-course dinner in their restaurant, Cafe New York. All the food was good, but something I must, must, MUST learn to reproduce at home was the banana-chocolate French toast with maple ice cream. It was actually a slice of bread pudding, toasted on both sides and served with the ice cream. Seems like a lot of flavors going on at once but they all worked well together. I also loved a berry soup that I started with there the night before. It was hardly sweet at all, and kind of fizzy with a sharp finish that makes me think it was made with sparkling wine or soda. Sprinkled with mint so every few bites would be a little different, with that fresh, clean mint flavor. I think there was cream in there, too.

Seems like I'm doing less planning and more tossing together lately, shopping more with the thought, \"What would be good to have on hand?\" and less with a list for \"What do I want to make?\" Last night I had a can of white beans, a small jar of marinated artichoke hearts, some fresh thyme, a quarter of a red bell pepper and a par-baked frozen small baguette from Fresh Direct, so I made crostini. It would've been better if the bread had already been baked all the way, and maybe even a day old, because as it is I had to finish baking it, let it rest, cut it and broil it. And I was hungry! While the bread was baking I chopped up the artichokes, drained the beans and diced the pepper and mixed it all together with the thyme, salt, pepper, a little marinade from the artichokes and some balsamic (which is less likely to give me heartburn). It was probably good the bread had a long process to go through because it gave the beans some time to just sit. It was good for a thrown-together meal. I'm pretty sure thyme is my favorite herb at this point. So durable in the fridge, and pretty versatile.

For a while after receiving my past maker as a gift, I made pasta quite a bit. Time to get back into that habit! I made this dish with what was in the kitchen: semolina flour, an egg, a medium yellow onion, butter and olive oil, salt and a sprig of thyme. First I made the pasta, and I used semolina this time because that's what I bought it for. In the past I've used all-purpose flour, which makes a much sturdier pasta. This dough was a little more difficult to work with, but I think the results were lighter, if you can imagine pasta feeling \"light\" (imagine a good gnocchi dumpling compared to a bad one). A generous 2/3 cup flour mixed with some salt in a wide, shallow bowl, and break up an egg with a fork in a well you've made in the center of the flour. Gradually incorporate the flour, then knead in bowl for a few minutes. Wrap up and refrigerate for 30 minutes to let it rest. Then I thinly sliced the onion and sauteed it in butter and olive oil with a sprig of thyme until the pasta's done, about 30-45 minutes. They get brown and soft with some crispy parts. Get a big pot of salted water boiling. Roll out the pasta (I did it to setting 6), then cut into fettuccine. Add pasta to water and cook about 5 minutes. Then transfer pasta, with whatever water's clinging to it, to the pan with the onions. Toss, top with Parm, and eat. Todd loves those onions, which are kind of the same thing Pop's Pierogies serves on top of their potato ones.

Another IMBB event. This one is hosted by life in flow (the writer of which also does Food Porn Watch) and features anything that can be called a dumpling. I'm so glad, because I found the two previous IMBB events I participated in creatively inspiring challenges. Plus, I got a couple of recipes out of them that we liked so much we'll eat them again. And it's fun to see how 50+ different people can come up with 50+ different ideas for the same theme. It'd make Forest Gump's friend Bubba proud.

I should hardly put this under the \"recipes and cooking\" category, because it's more of an assembling kind of thing. I love cake and ice cream together, but custom seems to dictate that it's only served at children's birthday parties (which is one reason we're having a child - not only can we throw him our own, but we'll hopefully get invited to a few other parties). So this week I made an ice cream cake, layers of the two frozen together. I'm ashamed to say I used a pint of Ben & Jerry's vanilla fudge swirl (which was not the most attractive choice) and a box cake mix I picked up off the giveaway table at work. I discovered the assembly of such a concoction is a much more scientific process than I thought. I made mine in a loaf pan that happened to be a bit bigger than the cake pieces I used, which resulted in kind of a mess. Tasty mess, though. Made the cake mix in a 9 x 9-inch pan, then cut it in half to make two long strips (I contemplated halving it horozontally, but it was too thin). Lined the loaf pan with plastic wrap, then put the first layer down. Softened the ice cream on the counter for a while, then spread half of it over the cake, then added the second layer. Topped it with the rest of the ice cream, then sprinkled toasted walnuts on top. Put it back in the freezer for a couple of hours.

I wanted to do something nice for Todd, nostalgic, so I decided to make sloppy joes. We used to buy a can or packet of mix or something and have them for dinner, but this time I made them from scratch, from a recipe from Rachael Ray, which was really good. Brown a little more than a pound of ground sirloin in oil (I think Fresh Direct charged me for sirloin and gave me chuck, though, because I had to drain off huge amounts of fat and the meat was more pink than red), then add 1/4 cup brown sugar and stir a bit. Add half a diced red bell pepper and half a diced onion. Cook for about 5 minutes, until soft, then add a tablespoon red wine vinegar and Worcestershire. Finish with a regular size can of tomato sauce (15 ounce-ish) and a couple tablespoons of tomato paste. Spoon onto buns and eat. I like to scoop up the stuff that falls out with those thick olive oil potato chips. There's a reason I called this entry what I did, though. I had been mercifully heartburn-free up until the sloppy joes (it's a common pregnancy ailment). I didn't even recognize it at first, never having had it before. Now I can't eat the food I've been craving throughout, tomatoes in any form. This child is going to know what he put me through! (Just kidding)

Since its churros and hot chocolate were reviewed somewhere last winter, I have wanted to go to Noche. The pros and cons kept see-sawing me, though. The reviews weren't so good. It's just down the block from my office. It's loud, dance-clubbish, not my kind of restaurant. It serves a cuisine I love. It's in Times Square. It's right in front of me when I desperately need to use the bathroom and am kind of hungry, too. The last one finally drove me into Noche Thursday night with Todd, and I'm glad it did. Gotta say, Todd was not thrilled when he looked at the menu. There's a ton of seafood on the menu and a whole section of ceviche, which limited his choices a lot. He doesn't like corn, which narrowed it even further. He was going to have mole chicken (doesn't really like mole) when I directed him to the braised short ribs over a sweet corn arepa. Whew! What a relief when it arrived. The ribs were a fully-2-inch thick slab of tender, flavorful meat over a few crosswise bones. With my tiny stomach capacity I just ordered an appetizer, skewers of shrimp, steak and chorizo (which Todd also loved). Two of each, with just a couple bites of steak and chorizo and one jumbo shrimp per skewer. There were greens in the middle of the plate, but they seemed to be drenched in oil, so I skipped them (and why eat greens when you can have meat!). Also ordered yucca fries, which came in thick slabs topped with chimichurri sauce. They were kind of like potatoes, if potatoes had a grain like a piece of wood. But not really fiberous. I actually craved them again this morning. And we finished the meal with the churros I had wanted for so long, warm, long, grooved doughnuts that were fried in a loop and coated with cinnamon and sugar. The chocolate dipping sauce was dark and rich, and the dulche de leche, while lighter and thinner than I thought it would be, tasted so good, almost creamy, with the cinnamon. Everyone was super-nice (because it's Times Square?), especially the waiter who answered all my pregnancy food-safety questions without a hint of annoyance. He actually acted interested in the eating habits of pregnant women. The place is huge, with at least three open upper floors and a winding staircase (but also an elevator). Seemed a good place to accommodate a large group.

This was a recipe from Food and Wine, but they served the succotash over mesclun and I just did away with the greens, which I'm not the biggest fan of anyway. I think they said that corn and soybeans together make a complete protein. It's a pretty mixture. Make the dressing by mixing the juice and zest of a lemon with salt, pepper and thyme, then whisk in as much oil as you like in your dressing (I usually go pretty light on the oil). Then saute about 1 1/2 cups corn, 1 cup soybeans and a diced red bell pepper for a few minutes, until everything is heated up but still kind of crisp. Toss it with the dressing and a few halved cherry tomatoes.

I've been making lots of smoothies for breakfast to try to get in some calcium, protein, etc for breakfast, and this one was one of my favorites. Whenever our bananas are starting to get overripe, I peel them, break them in half and put them in the freezer so they're ready for smoothie-making. For this one, I blend half a frozen banana to break it up, then I add about 1/3 cup plain yogurt, some milk, a couple tablespoons of almond butter and a couple squirts of honey.

IMBB: Grilled Flatbread and Shrimp with Tomato Jam

***CONTENT
One of my coworkers has raved to me about how fantastic pizza on the grill is, and I've always wanted to try it, so when the IMBB challenge (on Too Many Chefs ) this time was grilling, I was inspired to do something similar. Since all I have is a cast-iron grill pan, I settled for flatbread. Once I found a recipe on Food & Wine for Moroccan-spiced tomato jam and shrimp I was ready to go. We took the shrimp off the skewers and ate this like a sandwich (I was really proud of Todd for eating - liking? - the spicy-sweet tomato jam, but he's become incredibly adventurous). I made the tomato jam the day before: Sauteed 2 tablespoon grated fresh ginger and 1 big clove minced garlic in butter in a small saucepan until fragrant, then added 1/4 cup cider vinegar and a cinnamon stick. When that started to thicken, I added a big can's worth of peeled, seeded tomatoes (drained off the juice and broken up a bit with my hands), 1/4 cup brown sugar, 1 tablespoon cumin, 1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder (the recipe called for cayenne, but this was all I had) and 4 whole cloves. Let that simmer for about an hour, then turned off the heat and added a squirt of buckwheat honey and some salt and pepper. I removed the cinnamon and cloves and divided the jam into two food-storage containers, one big (to marinate the shrimp) and one small (to use as a condiment). So today I mixed 1/2 pound cleaned medium shrimp into the marinade and stuck it in the fridge while I made the flatbread. Then added 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast to 1/2 cup warm water and let it sit for five minutes (mine never got bubbly, but it didn't seem to affect the final product; not sure 5 minutes is enough time for the yeast to get going). Mixed in 1 1/3 cup flour, 1 tablespoon oil and 3/4 teaspoon coarse salt, then kneeded for a couple of minutes and put it in a greased, covered bowl in a warm spot to rise for 30 minutes. While that was working, I threaded the shrimp on skewers and heated the grill pan with some oil. Divided the dough into four portions, then flattened each portion to 1/8-inch thickness by patting and pulling. Grilled each one 2 minutes on each side. Then grilled the shrimp skewers 2 minutes each side. We ate the shrimp with the reserved jam in the flatbreads, kind of like tacos. It was good: the bread's kind of chewy and warm and the jam is mostly sweet, with a little bit of heat left over when you're done.

Last night I started on tonight's dinner, pasta with roasted tomatoes. I cut five plum tomatoes in half lengthwise, then crosswise, and tossed them in a baking dish with olive oil, salt, pepper, a coarsely chopped onion and a large minced garlic clove. Baked it at 350 degrees for about an hour, then let it cool and put it in the fridge. Tonight when I got home I just popped it in the oven again to heat it up (about 10 minutes) and boiled some penne and dinner was ready. And it was so good. The tomatoes get sweet, with an intense, almost caramelized flavor. You have to toss the pasta with the tomatoes and all of the juices, which, with some Parmesan gratings, is all it needed.

It might take a high tolerance for risk, but the NY Times had an article about two weeks ago praising the use of public park grills in New York.

***CONTENT
The only reason I call this posole at all is because the original recipe I was using was for posole. I ended up substituting so many ingredients, though, that it was a different animal altogether (good, though). Substitution number one. When I originally wanted to make the recipe I couldn't find Anaheim chiles, so later, when I was ordering from Fresh Direct I checked to see if they had what I needed. Problem is, I didn't remember correctly what I had been looking for and ordered six poblanos. I broiled them until they were black, then put them in a bowl in the fridge, covered with plastic wrap, until I was ready to use them (in the meantime I \"borrowed\" about half of a small one to chop up and put in an quesadilla I made for my dinner; just plain jack cheese and roasted poblano, but it was really good; I get a good char on my quesadillas just in the pan). Substitution number two. Food Emporium (which is the grocery closest to my office; I've lost my stamina for running all over the city looking for ingredients in the heat and humidity with my growing belly) doesn't carry pork shoulder, just lean pork loin. I found some really meaty pork ribs, though, that did the trick quite well. Substitution number three. This was the most detrimental one, the one that makes this really, really NOT posole. Couldn't find hominy at FE, and Todd didn't feel like running around looking for some (I don't blame him), so I put a can of garbanzos in at the end. It was OK, but hominy would have been 100 times better. Brought 4 cups water to a boil then added the pork ribs and cooked for 10 minutes. Then added the chiles, which I had seeded, peeled and chopped, a chopped onion, three minced garlic cloves, a teaspoon each cumin and oregano and a tablespoon ancho chile powder. Simmered that for 2 hours, then removed the pork (it was falling apart by this point), shredded it and removed the bones, then put the pork back in. Added a big can of drained garbanzos and heated through. I served it with lime wedges, toasted tortilla strips and pickled minced red onion (just minced a red onion and added salt, oregano and white vinegar to cover). It made tons, with good, spicy, deep flavor that contrasted well with the pickled onion and lime. I'd make this again, definitely, but next time with the all-important hominy.

We went to a new place near Todd's office last night, HK, over on 9th Avenue near Port Authority. It brought up a couple of questions I have about NYC restaurants. Why skimp on the pita? We ordered an appetizer of dips, hummus, tzatziki and baba ganoush, and when we got it there were ample portions of the dips but just four little triangles of pita. This is not the only place this crime has been committed. I was eating the baba ganoush with a fork because it tasted so good to me, really eggplanty if eggplant were sweet. Also, what's the appeal of eating dinner alfresco along 9th Avenue? The stretch from my office at 50th down to where we were last night is always clogged with honking, exhaust-spewing angry drivers trying to get to the Lincoln Tunnel. This place has a wall lined with something like glass garage doors so they can open the whole place up to the side street, where trucks continuously rumble by. I've got to say, though, that there's something lovely in the sight of New Yorkers basking in the fumes and noise while enjoying a bowlful of mussels or a salad. And why tout that you're serving Haagen-Dazs on your menu? In Kim's fantasy world, every nice place would have industrial ice-cream makers to churn up their own. I used to hate that restaurant desserts always featured ice cream, but I find that it's often my favorite part. Chefs manage to get such fabulous flavors in there. Of course, I still ordered some of the Haagen-Dazs. It's not transporting, but it's still yummy. This is not to say I didn't like eating there. It was noisy and seemed a little more focused on decor than food, but what we ate was tasty, and not too pricey. I had seared tofu with spinach and mushrooms in a mushroomy sauce, and it was pretty good. We'll probably go back since it is so close to Todd's office.

I used the tofu to make a sandwich the next day, with the mushrooms and some roasted red pepper. I really liked the flavor of that sauce, though. It was really tasty soaking into the toasted Italian bread.

So I haven't had many food aversions lately, but I finally found one: lamb sausage, but mostly cooking it (not eating it). We had sandwiches the other night, from a recipe in Real Simple, with lamb sausages, sauteed onions and mustard on toasted ficelle, and it was good stuff. I just can hardly think about cooking up the rest of those sausages; it makes my stomach churn.

Is anyone addicted to Serendipity 3's frrrozen hot chocolate? I've had it before, but it's actually hard for me to forgo the other delights they offer and have it when I'm there. But I went to a book launch there this week and they passed small servings (a relative term) of it around on trays, and it was suddenly the perfect thing for a summer day. Richly, deeply chocolatey, with this wonderful slushy coolness of ice. I kind of regretted the sundae I had just had (I don't care what the pregnancy police say; baby loves sugar - although I try to limit myself to one sweet a day). They sent us home with the mix they sell, and we made it last night. It's just 1 cup of milk, the packet of mix and 3 cups of ice in a blender. It's so good. I can't even tell you that it's not quite as good as the restaurant's, because I couldn't tell much of a difference. The packet says serves two, but it's so rich you could easily get four servings out of it. The packet just contains sugar, nonfat dried milk, dextrose and cocoa, so maybe it's reproducable at home. I wonder if the recipe's in the dessert cookbook for the restaurant that they just released?

We had some things to celebrate last night, so we went to Stella for dinner. I think the biggest draw for that place, and their smartest move, is all the snacks they bring out before you even order. We got olives, cured meats, thin little snappy breadsticks, focaccia, bread and a pizza-like thing. My coworkers love to drink in the bar because you get the same assortment of snacks as long as you have a drink in your hand. The place is huge, so there's more likely to be room, too. After all that we split a fritto misto, which was fine. They have a lot of salads, carpaccios, pizzas. But my entree was really fantastic: rosemary and lamb tortelli with pine nuts and prunes. It's not a very big plate, but it's full, and the dish is so rich that they could really get away with giving you about half. I chose that over calves liver with polenta or porcini pappardelle. We didn't get to dessert because we were both stuffed. (The lamentable thing about the growing uterus is the crowded belly; I reach this sudden wall where, oops, I'm full, and I can't even fit in a spoonful of gelato. It usually happens at dinner, after I've grazed all day.) It looked like the usual suspects, though: tiramisu, a panna cotta, berries, etc. That's not to say it's not good. (It also reminds me of that lovely buttermilk panna cotta I made once, which would be perfect for the hot weather. Yum.)

I was going to skip writing about this because, although it was quite good, it's not really \"cooking.\" Then I got an issue of Real Simple in the mail with the coverline \"The Easiest Dinner Ever,\" a story all about sandwiches for dinner. I've been redeemed! Although the recipes they include are for substantial sandwiches, and mine was of the lunchbox variety: almond butter and apple slices on whole-wheat bread. It was just so good, though, you don't understand. I love the crunch of the apples in the sandwich (although I'm a fan of nut butter and banana sandwiches, too). Very schooldays.

I cannot get this right! The focaccia I made this weekend was bland, flat, chewy, gross. I can't bring myself to throw it out, but I'm going to have Todd do it. I think the flavor is easy to remedy: add more salt. And I was pretty optimistic about the texture, too. The dough was really sticky, but it had this nice, bubbly look to it. I think the problem might have been that the recipe called for a lot of sauteed vegetables scattered over the top, which didn't let the bread rise in the oven at all (and may have flattened it a bit). The edges were nice, though kind of hard (I think I cooked it too long to try to get the top that was under vegetables to be more brown and less pasty-white). Should I try this recipe again? Or give a different one a try? Does sticky dough sound right?

I've noticed that even restaurant focaccia with a lot of veggies on it tends to be soggy and doughy. Less Is More. If you want veggies make pizza. (She said, never having baked with yeast in her life.)

But kudos to you for trying.
Luisa
2004-06-29 10:01:00
I think somewhat sticky or tacky dough is what focaccia dough is supposed to be like before you bake. My family in Italy, when not baking totally plain focaccia (plain except for salt and rosemary on top), plants a few cherry tomatoes here and there in the dough, but nothing else. So, why don't you try making the dough and baking it solo, and then roasting the vegetables separately and serving them with (on top or beside or inside) the focaccia after the baking?
Kim
2004-06-29 10:17:00
That is a terrific suggestion, Luisa. I really think the dough would have been right with a few alterations, and the veggies smelled good on their own, too.
Sandra
2004-06-30 11:17:00
Luisa's suggestion is great. I make a \"Cuban Pizza\" with a not-so-home-made crust and it works best if I bake the dough for about 5 minutes first. I add the toppings and then bake for another 10. That way the center is cooked but not browned and the edges have a chance to get crisp. Wes doesn't complain so it can't be that bad. 

Good luck next time (and yes, there should be a next time) :)

We're attending a big picnic this weekend, one of the few events that I have an old standard recipe to bring. I started making this long, long ago, before I really cooked at all, so by today's standards it's pretty simple, kind of a dump recipe (dump in this, this and this). But it's still quintessential picnic food to me, coming from Colorado. One of my former supervisors used to make something similar, white beans, tuna and red onion, as her picnic staple. Mine's a corn and black bean salsa. It involves opening, draining and rinsing a can of black beans and a can of corn (dump, dump). Then you add chopped red onion, scallion, tomato and cilantro, cumin and lime juice. It tastes better afer it sits for a bit. I bet fresh corn would be nice, but that's another one of those things I don't get my hands on very often. I serve it with tortilla chips, but I've seen people eat it like a salad, with a fork, too. My other picnic standard is the fudgy brownies I wrote about awhile back.

I have a rule against having all burners going at once. It's not a safety thing; I just don't like doing dishes that much. But last night I made scallops with orzo and tomatoes, which required two nonstick skillets and a saucepan, and it was definitely worth it (maybe because I made Todd do the dishes?). The tomato sauce sounded really weird, with ginger, lemongrass and basil, but it came together much better than you would think. And I love, love, love the sweetness, the softness, the crisp browned exterior of seared scallops. Boiled a cup of orzo for until it was done, a bit more than five minutes. While that was working, I sauteed about an inch of minced ginger and a minced stalk of lemongrass for about 2 minutes. (I think I used parts of the lemongrass I shouldn't; it was really hard to tell. I peeled back about half the layers, cut off the top 2/3, then minced the rest. I think the tough part I ended up with was at the very bottom, though.) Added 2 big chopped tomatoes and cooked for another minute, then tossed in a couple tablespoons sliced basil leaves. Heated oil in another nonstick pan, then seared the scallops for 2 minutes on the first side (salting and peppering the tops), then 1 minute on the other side.

I have never tasted a really good fresh apricot. I even went to Red Jacket Orchard's booth at the Union Square farmers' market last year, but it must've been too early or late. So yesterday when I went to the grocery to buy some kind of fruit to make a tart filling, I veered toward the apricots (they were giving off a very apricot-y scent). I figured a cooked apricot would taste more like an apricot than any fresh apricot I had had. And they did, but they were also really, really tart. Do apricots get sweet? If I made this tart again I'd add a lot more sugar, and maybe leave out the lemon. Maybe the tartness of apricots is why lots of the tart recipes I saw added a cream cheese or frangipane layer. I used a refrigerated pie crust, which I rolled out thinner to fit into my 10-inch tart pan (not sure I needed to, though; I had a bit of extra). Mixed sliced apricots with 5 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch, 1/2 tablespoon lemon juice and some zest. Arranged in a spiral, then baked at 425 for 15 minutes, then turned it down to 375 for another 25 minutes. Then I brushed it with melted cherry jam (what I had on hand), and I can't decide if that ruined the way it looked or added interesting color. Another thing I noticed was that apricots are tiny, so the edges of my tart were too high. I'd form the tart edges lower next time.

Kim,
I can't believe you've never eaten a good, fresh apricot before! I get them all the time. They should be soft and more orangy than yellow. It'll drip juice when you bite into a good one. They're usually quite sweet, too. Maybe a tiny hint of tart, but not even close to the tartness of a peach. I'll have to bring you a good apricot sometime to show you. See you next week!

I'm one of those people who are always annoyingly early for everything, who doesn't understand that if the party starts at 8 I shouldn't arrive until at least 8:30, probably closer to 9. Plus now that I'm pregnant I'm hungry all the time to a whole new degree, if such a thing were possible. So we sauntered into Madison Square Park, where this year's Big Apple Barbecue Block Party was held, at a quarter to 12. This year the barbecue was along 26th street, and tickets, information, desserts, music, etc were scattered throughout the park. I guess I'm gloating here because for once being annoyingly early for everything paid off. We bought our tickets and jumped from (relatively short) line to line, sampling various pork and beef products. About 30 minutes after we got there, the lines started getting long. By the time we left around 1:30, they were unmanageable, kind of a mess. We wanted to try the whole hog but couldn't bring ourselves to stand in a line that snaked halfway down the block between 5th Ave and Madison. But I loved the beef brisket from The Salt Lick; it was soft and chewy with a band of pink on one edge. Todd was partial to a pulled pork sandwich. We were pretty happy. (Although I still love everything about the first one: the rain, the crowded street, the music. Even the food seems better. I guess that's what nostalgia does.)

It's hard to imagine being nauseated for seven weeks, isn't it? It was for me 10 weeks ago, when, just a few days after finding out that I was pregnant, the nausea started. I'm excited about being pregnant (we had wanted this for a while), but I never imagined how it would rob me of one of my favorite hobbies, this blog. I've been eating to keep my stomach settled, my weight up, and not with the pleasure or curiosity I used to have. At points I couldn't imagine ever being interested in food again, and the only \"cooking\" I could handle was putting my breakfast in the toaster.

You sound about as crazy as I was. One thing I noticed was that my tastes really started to change when I was pregnant. I have never been much of a meat eater, but suddenly I NEEDED steak, etc.  It may give you the chance to explore foods you haven't really liked so much in the past.  For months I had a cream cheese, tomato and cucumber sandwich for breakfast.  I craved french fries and pretty much any kind of potatoes constantly.

It's hard to imagine being nauseated for seven weeks, isn't it? It was for me 10 weeks ago, when, just a few days after finding out that I was pregnant, the nausea started. I'm excited about being pregnant (we had wanted this for a while), but I never imagined how it would rob me of one of my favorite hobbies, this blog. I've been eating to keep my stomach settled, my weight up, and not with the pleasure or curiosity I used to have. At points I couldn't imagine ever being interested in food again, and the only \"cooking\" I could handle was putting my breakfast in the toaster. The worst of the nausea has passed, but I'm still not 100 percent back in the kitchen, as I'm sure anyone who has read this for a while can tell. And even eating out can be a minefield. Never excitedly say to a pregnant woman, \"Now you can eat whatever you want!\" It simply isn't true.

***CONTENT
My mom didn't cook or bake very often, but my friend Nicole's mom did. I once raved over some banana-chocolate chip muffins she had made, so after that she would send Nicole to school with a baggie of muffins for me whenever she made them. One of the few signs that I would grow up to like being in the kitchen was that I was the resident banana-bread baker when I was a kid. Whenever the bananas would turn black, I'd get down the bread pan. This time I decided I'd make muffins with my mushy bananas, though, taking a lesson in portability from Nicole's mom. I used a recipe from Basic Baking and substituted chocolate chips for the nuts. Next time I think I'd cut down on the spices, though; they kind of just compete with the chocolate. Maybe even just use cinnamon. Anyway, I whisked together 2 cups flour, 1 teaspoon each baking soda and baking powder, some salt and 1/2 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, ginger, cloves and nutmeg. Separately I mashed three overripe bananas with 1/4 cup oil, 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1 egg. Mixed that into the dry ingredients, added some chocolate chips (maybe about a cup), then baked the muffins in a regular-size 12-cup muffin tin in a 375 degree oven for 18 minutes. They're not very sweet muffins, almost seem kind of healthy, but then there's the chocolate. I liked them better at room temperature the second day.

Mmmmmm...that sounds delicious! Now that we are out of the house my mom doesn't bake nearly as much. 
Now, my mom would cook- but she wouldn't allow us to cook- but your mom would!   I have so many memories of going to your house and spending hours in the kitchen making cookies (usually after convincing poor Chad to ride his bike to the store to get us the dough, which we would usually overeat before making any!)  Concoctions like Kraft Mac and Cheese with Spaghetti Sauce- we were usually cooking while eating our weight in chips and salsa. 
It was so wonderful to have an escape into such a relaxed environment- as I remember the only requirement was that we share with the rest of your family :)

The Big Apple Barbecue Block Party, sponsored by Blue Smoke, is coming up. Todd and I went last year and had a lot of really good food. It rained a little, the lines were long, and the whole ticket system was a little annoying, but it felt good to stand out on 26th street (which they block off for the event) eating barbecue from all over the country and listening to music. It's June 12 and 13, and a bunch of people, including Calvin Trillin and Ed Levine, will be participating in seminars during the weekend. There's information about it at Blue Smoke's web site.

Heather's grandfather gives us a fruitcake from Colin Street every year (4 years & counting; I expect no less this Christmas). I think he used to drive out there to get it, but lately he's let the USPS do the legwork. I can handle about 3 really thin slices over the course of a week or so, and I'm good until the next Christmas.

Dreams of a Good Table

***CONTENT
I had the strangest dream this morning, but I know where it came from. Todd and I had just settled into a booth at some restaurant I don't recognize with the newspaper, planning to order breakfast. Some woman, a manager or something approached us and asked us if we'd be more comfortable at one of the tables at the center of the room. Todd said no, he'd like to read the paper and the booths had the best lighting. She insisted, so we gathered our water and coffee cups and followed her. I was kind of annoyed, and so she asked if anything was wrong. I explained, saying the place wasn't busy and I didn't understand why she was arbitrarily moving us. She turned to me and said, \"You knew exactly what you were doing when the hostess seated you,\" suggesting that we had lied to sit at a booth. It was bizarre, because we hadn't. But it was pretty realistic. What is with the whole seating game at restaurants? Is it just snotty hosts and hostesses, or is there some secret math that only people who have worked at restaurants know? At most places we eat regularly, if the place is empty they seat us at one of the comfortable tables. But at Market Cafe, near Todd's office, the place'll be completely empty and they'll try to give us a table in the middle row, where you're constantly bumped by people walking by, instead of a table along the wall. They always let us sit along the wall when we ask, but why do they always try to stick us in the worst seat? (By the way, the waitstaff there is pretty nice otherwise. Maybe there is some \"rule\"?) The reason I had the dream is that a coworker had a weird experience at the new Outback in Chelsea. He went in a little more than an hour before closing and requested a booth in the bar, but the hostess said she could only give him a table, so he accepted. But he got increasingly annoyed when he realized, while some booths were occupied, there were a handful empty. He had wanted a booth, with better lighting, so he could read. So close to closing, why couldn't the hostess accommodate his request? She even stared blankly at him, offering no help at all, when he complained.

Tough to speak to the individual experiences you described, but yes it is a game.
I hosted and waited tables at a restaurant, and let me say that to please customers and waiters at the same time as a host/hostess is a near impossibility.  This challenge can turn the hosting people into mean creatures.

Dear Kim -
I'm sorry to have contributed to a bad dream, but thank you for not making me feel like a crank. As Sally in \"When Harry Met Sally\" said about her ordering proclivities, \"I just want it the way I want it.\" In other words, I just want to sit where I want to sit. In the future I will be a little more assertive up front.

Yes, it's in what's become  the middle-America section of Chelsea at 6th Ave. and 23rd. In addition to Outback (at whose doorway my shadow will never darken again), there's an Olive Garden and a Best Buy. Haven't been to the Olive Garden, but for electronic/technology equipment at low discount prices, you probably can't beat Best Buy (avoid during December, though). I bought my Sony CD Walkman there, but I tend to run about 10 years behind the trend on these things. Now I'd like to have an iPod.

Chocolate-Ricotta Muffins

When it's a chocolate muffin, what keeps it from being a cupcake? The muffins I made last night, from Mollie Katzen's Sunrise Cafe weren't really too sweet, but they were nice and moist. I have the advanced uncorrected proof of Katzen's newest cookbook, but I think it's time to get a real copy. I've made one stinker from it, but I mostly love the ideas I get: different cooked grains for breakfast, with fun flavorings like Chai, maple or orange, savory and sweet baked goods, roasted or stewed fruit, tofu and cheese scrambles, hashes, veggies like roasted mushrooms or creamed spinach, wild rice pancakes with mushrooms and goat cheese, blinzes. But I had some ricotta in the fridge I needed to use up, so I made these muffins. It made a huge batch, 12 muffins with a panful of minis made with the extra batter. I mixed the dry ingredients (2 1/3 cups flour, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 2 teaspoons baking powder, a heaping 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 1 cup each sugar and chocolate chips) in one bowl, then combined 1 cup ricotta with 2 eggs in another. Added 1 1/3 cup milk and 1 tablespoon vanilla to the wet ingredients, then added wet to dry, drizzling in 4 tablespoons melted butter and folding it all together until it was thoroughly moistened. Baked in a 12-muffin pan at 350 degrees for 25 minutes. They're moist, not too sweet with lots of chocolate chips throughout. When I tested them with a toothpick, I kept hitting chocolate chips, which made me think, at first, that the muffins weren't done, but I kept poking until I just got moist crumbs attached.

Yes I did. Todd was at class last night, so I had a bowl of oatmeal for dinner. I always used to prefer very dry oatmeal, with a rougher texture. I usually use about half the liquid the box calls for (a 1 to 1 liquid/oats ratio instead of 2 to 1). But it seems as though a lot of my food preferences are changing lately, and I even like my oatmeal a little more liquidy these days. The bowl I had last night was so creamy and satisfying. I started to bring 1 cup of milk to a boil in a small saucepan, but then I got worried the milk would scald so I added the 1/2 cup oats. Brought that to a boil and let it bubble 5 minutes, stirring the whole time. Then I added some brown sugar, cinnamon and blueberries. Let the heat of the oatmeal kind of cook the berries until they were warm and some of them burst, then ate.

These lentils turned out good: firm and flavorful. I cooked the lentils in a lot of water, the way you make pasta (although I put the lentils and water together in the pot, then brought it all to a boil). Tonight I cooked 1/2 cup lentils (with a crushed garlic clove and a sprig of rosemary for flavor) in perhaps 4 or 5 cups of water, for about 11 minutes (not the 30 minutes instructed on the package; I checked on them often and stopped boiling them while they were still firm). I used green lentils because that's what I had on hand. Drain and let cool. Meanwhile I made a mustard vinaigrette (heavy on the vinegar) and dressed the spinach and quartered grape tomatoes separately (the original recipe didn't have tomatoes). Added dressing to the lentils to taste, then assembled the salad.

The recipe for this was actually a peach-blackberry cobbler, but Todd brought such big, beautiful blackberries home that I had to use all of them (more than the recipe called for). I cheated, too, and used one of those refrigerated pie crusts. I will never perfect pie crusts from scratch as long as I can buy a pretty decent unbaked crust at the grocery store (to my eternal shame). I mixed 2 cups sliced peaches (from a bag of frozen) with 1/3 cup sugar, 1/2 tablespoon cornstarch, a couple squeezes of lemon juice and some finely chopped ginger (not enough, though, because I couldn't really taste it in the finished product). Then I folded the blackberries in (2 cups), being careful not to crush them. Left that to get juicy while I prepared the lattice top. I unfolded the crust and brushed it with egg white, then sprinkled it with sugar, cinnamon and a few grates of nutmeg. Cut it in strips, then poured the fruit into the gratin dish and wove the strips on top (I only used about 1/2 of one crust; I baked the rest as ice-cream garnishes). Baked in a 375 degree oven for 45 minutes. Let it cool a bit, then serve over vanilla ice cream (it's especially good when it's still warm, and the juices run in with the melting ice cream).

Then the rest of us will go out and come back with something sort of mediocre that cost at least $5 and often closer to $10.

in london, we have a sandwich chain, \"pret-a-manger\" where sandwiches are made at the premises fresh every few hours and what's not being bought fresh or left over at night is given away to shelters and other charitable institutions. I agree with you that that's the way to go and more businesses should act like that. It's a bit like boxing day (I am told that boxing day comes from centuries back where the rich families put left-over food from Xmas day on their doorsteps for the poor to pick up).

I bought a quarter of a watermelon the other day, and have thoroughly enjoyed having it all to myself because Todd does not like watermelon (which is so improbable to me that I actually bothered to ask him why - futile). It reminded me, though, of a salad someone made for supper club. I remember being quite skeptical as she started pulling together the two main ingredients: watermelon and feta. But it was really wonderful, the salty feta contrasting beautifully with the sweet, wet watermelon. I have a theory that in one bite it creates and quenches a thirst in you. Nigella Lawson has a recipe in Forever Summer that has a bunch of other stuff: olives, parsley, red onion, lime, mint, pepper. I can't remember what Sam's had, but I do think tossing together a little lime juice, some cubed or crumbled feta and some chunks of watermelon would be yummy. Maybe I'd add a little ground cayenne or chipotle for heat, although that may be going too far.

Hi Kim,
Can't get into copydesk. We've been down a few hours so I thought I'd check your blog. I was raised with lingonberries prepared as a condiment and used the way cranberries are here. Don't recall having them in whipped cream, but rather with roast meats or poultry. I think especially with duck to cut the fattiness. 
How are you? August has a birthday coming up as I recall. What a big boy he must be. All iis well here. Not much changed. George pretty OK. He'll have hernia surgery early December. Hopefully it can wait until after Thanksgiving. We plan to go to Claudia's in VA and would hate to have to cancel.
I'll go back to your blog now and see what you've written before the berry piece. Best to Todd.

I should have known that it would take a rainy day to get me in the kitchen again. Beautiful spring days call for street food, ice cream, maybe the very first spring produce. They're not really cooking days. But the whole way home on the subway Monday night I was thinking how nice it would be for Todd, shaking the rain from his umbrella, to follow the warm, spicy smell of chili down the hall to our apartment door. So I made it. I like using ground chuck for chili, because I have this theory that the extra fat keeps the beef from clumping, that it helps to break it down into even, small pieces and it helps it to cook evenly. Of course, then you have to drain off huge amounts of melted fat, which I do by spooning the cooked beef into a paper towel–lined bowl, then pouring off the fat into a jar I keep in the freezer (I'm always afraid the temperature contrast will break the glass, so I let the jar warm a little at room temperature, and let the grease cool a little bit). Then I cooked chopped onion and bell pepper in the same deep skillet, and added a couple cans of tomatoes with the juice, one diced and one whole (which I smashed up with a wooden spoon). I added lots of cumin and ancho chile powder, and a little bit of chipotle powder for heat. Salt. Then let it bubble until Todd got home. We shredded Cheddar over the top, and ate it with some leftover bicuits. Normally I would've added the spices before the tomatoes, to toast them a little, but I'm out of practice and I forgot. I'm not sure it makes a huge difference in the finished product, but I did have to add way more of the spices than I thought. I kept adding and tasting, adding and tasting, until it almost seemed there.

David is my friend's husband, and the second-least-active member of my cooking club. Todd's the least active. (David, no offense. You're dabbling a lot more.) Inspired by all of us cooking all the time (I like to think, although I bet it's mostly Julie), David made Julie tacos for dinner the other night. I love this, because he used the box and the seasoning packet, just like my parents used to do when we were kids. It sounds like David's formative food experiences were a lot like mine. Anyway, here's what he says: I’ve never cooked. Before meeting Julie (a friend of Kim), pre-packaged and/or fast foods were what I ate, punctuated by bowls of cereal for breakfasts and the occasional “dinner out” at nights. Sure, I’ve boiled water for pasta, scrambled eggs here & there, blended a few smoothies, made mashed-potato paste and even botched a stir-fry, but seriously I’ve never cooked. Growing up, our family foraged in a similar way – eating out, ordering in or grazing on pre-packaged foods. My step-mom made lasagna twice yearly or so, and my dad would roast chickens sporadically. He also made tacos when friends slept over, whereupon we’d engage in taco-eating contests. I loved tacos as a kid; it was fun to build them, to mix and match the various ingredients. Each ingredient would be so neatly compartmentalized – a bowl of grated cheese, of lettuce, of salsa – it all made sense. It may have been the empowerment I learned from such “taco-nstruction” that had me believing I could easily prepare tacos. So I got some ground meat and followed the directions on the seasoning packet. The store-bought shells weren’t crispy and the canned refried beans needed softening, so I heated the beans in a pan and crisped the shells in the oven. Surely this qualifies as cooking since both the oven and range were used simultaneously. The other ingredients, which included grated cheese, shredded lettuce, sliced olives, diced tomatoes and salsa were prepared and placed in bowls beforehand (mise-en-place, I’m told). Unfortunately, I used store-bought pre-grated cheese, which gave the tacos a junky edge. Additional ingredients could have included chopped onions, sour cream, guacamole and maybe tilapia instead of beef, but I kept it simple this first try. The bowls were arranged on the table, and we sat down to begin construction. Though they weren’t as tasty as dad's, they were just as fun.

This may strike everyone reading this blog as remarkably obvious, but every now and again, I'm struck by how easy cooking can be. I'm not talking fancy cooking here, I'm talking about one step up from takeout. And that's an important step. Last night I was faced with a mixed bag of ingredients in the fridge and neither Kim or I had much inclination to cook. But Kim had thought ahead and planned quick fajitas using some leftover chicken from Boston Market (yes, we've been eating more takeout of late.) Within a few minutes she'd chopped green peppers and onions and I sautéed them with some chipotle powder, chili powder and cumin plus a little salt and black pepper. A couple of minutes on low heat and the chicken Kim shredded was ready to go in. Flour tortillas wrapped in aluminum foil go in the oven on low heat. A few more minutes and we're chowing down on chicken/onion/peppers wrapped in a soft, warm tortilla. It all seems so easy since at I write this I realize all I did was shake the skillet a few times. Now, coming up with the menu - that's hard. I leave that to Kim.

This is the friend, Rebecca, who baked that yummy caramel apple pie last fall. Now she's baking bread! My two kitchen fears (I'm a bit jealous). She also tells about an asparagus salad she made for Easter: A friend invited us to her apartment for Easter. Easter is one of my favorite holidays (then again, I love just about any holiday that celebrates eating). I decided to make two recipes that are part of my family's Easter tradition. Asparagus and red peppers in mustard vinaigrette really tastes like spring--and this time of year, you can get delicious asparagus even at your local supermarket. Steam the asparagus until it's barely tender--there should still be a little crunch to it. Blanch it in cold water. Make a vinaigrette with 2 tablespoons tarragon vinegar, 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard, and 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme. Add some fresh tarragon if you're lucky enough to have some, and a splash of Tabasco if you like a little spice. Whisk in 1/2 cup olive oil. Arrange the asparagus on a platter, top with julienned roasted red peppers (I use jarred peppers--everyone says roasting peppers is easy, but I have a 10 month old baby and don't have the patience!), and drizzle with the vinaigrette. My mother has made Easter braid for as long as I can remember, and although I crave it every Easter since I moved to New York, I've never been brave enough to make it myself. The recipe itself is not hard, but it's easy to be intimidated by yeast (not to mention the kneading and the braiding). It's a soft white dough made with milk, butter and eggs. For sweetness there's lemon peel, raisins, and a dash of mace. It has to be kneaded for 10 minutes, and it rises once before it's braided and once after. It baked beautifully, and I knew the glaze was delicious because I licked the spoon (it's a simple sugar glaze, with confectioner's sugar, water, and a little butter, and my mom always adds almond extract), but I was a little nervous until we actually ate the bread. It was almost as good as my mom's, and I'll definitely be making it next year.

Todd has some opinions on America's celebrity chefs competing on Iron Chef: Shame on me for thinking they'd make it a bout for the ages. Walking through the subway the other day, I noticed a series of large ads for Iron Chef America with Bobby Flay, Wolfgang Puck and Mario Batali prominantly featured. As you can see, each is armed with the blunt intrument of his choice (Flay's monster-sized meat tenderizer is hidden behind the logo). Where I made my mistake was thinking that it'd be entirely American chefs competing against one another. I was already rubbing my hands in glee envisioning Emeril Lagasse hitting the mat from a body blow delivered by Batali or Tony Bourdain. Alas, it's not to be as Flay, Puck, and Batali will be pitted against the same old Iron Chefs that always do battle in Kitchen Stadium. After a preview I saw late on Friday night, the whole thing looks pretty tired and Bobby Flay looked impatient to pick up his paycheck as he took down Iron Chef French with some oversized lobster. Oddly, the Web site lists Alton Brown under the \"Bio\" section. Could there be a surprise appearance by the Good Eats host? I'm skeptical how well he'd do. By the time Iron Chef Japanese was finishing off his menu, Alton would just be getting back from the hardware store with a collection of MacGuyver-ized cooking implements.

I'm actually looking forward to seeing it. Admittedly, I'm a dork for the original show (oddly actually) and I do like Flay and Batali. Tony Bordain would be an awesome combatant...and I would like to see Ming Tsai in a true east meets west battle.

I'm sick of Wolfgang though...no real interest in him. 

I love Alton too...but I have to agree with you that he'd be too busy calculating the proper angle of his knife!

The last time I was on the Fresh Direct web site, they no longer had YS knishes available, but one of my coworkers, Julie, recently went to the bakery and says that experience far improves upon a warmed-over knish. Here's what she says: I grew up in New York City, and have had a few Yonah Schimmel knishes over the years, but I had never eaten at the bakery before. My husband, David, and I decided to stop by for a quick dinner a few weeks ago before heading to a movie at the Sunshine theater next door. I’m so glad we did, because eating a freshly baked knish runs circles around picking one up at a deli and eating it reheated. I ordered a sweet potato knish, which at first I thought sounded strangely unorthodox, but the waitress convinced me by telling me it was her favorite. My husband ordered the cheddar cheese knish. We also shared a bowl of split pea soup, and, of course, a Dr. Brown’s black cherry soda. The soup was yummy, thick and satisfying. But the star of the experience was the sweet potato knish. It arrived piping hot, with a sprinkling of cinnamon on top. It was so tender...and was sweet and savory at the same time, made with both sweet potatoes and regular potatoes. And onions. Since eating at Yonah Schimmel’s (which I recommend as a New York experience even if you don’t order a knish, as it’s been there since 1910 and looks that way), I have thought about the sweet potato knish now and then, so when Kim came into work and handed me the container from Fresh Direct, I was excited but also sad she wasn’t feeling well enough to eat it. Kim, I’m thrilled you’re feeling a bit better now, and when I place my first order with Fresh Direct (we live in the same neighborhood and have been anticipating its arrival together), I’ll order a Yonah Schimmel’s sweet potato knish and bring it to work for you.

Since I haven't been feeling well, one of my coworkers, Meghann, agreed to contribute this review: Working one office down from Kim, and a regular lunch buddy, I get to hear about her culinary adventures on a regular basis. I love to cook myself, but since I live with two other girls and share a tiny kitchen, most of my food experiences are in restaurants around the city. I'll make my own crême brulées one day, but for now my sweet tooth is getting quite a fix from a few soul/southern food restaurants that I'm reviewing as a freelance assignment. At Kitchenette Uptown, the Harlem outpost (up-post?) of the TriBeCa restaurant, our coworker Robb and I got to celebrate his 30th birthday with three sweet courses in a row. He had potato pancakes with crunchy apple compote and sour cream, buttermilk-soaked honey glazed fried chicken, and tart cherry pie for dessert. My goat-cheese, beet, walnut and apple salad wasn't overly fancy, and tasted as if the South had appropriated the dish, upping the sweetness of the vinaigrette and throwing in extra walnuts for good measure. For a main dish, I had roast chicken with apple stuffing, buttery wilted swiss chard and mac and cheese, and then went for the peanut-butter chocolate pie. I wouldn't normally order this much food, but I had to order a variety of things on the menu for the review. I'm glad I had an excuse, though, because this was definitely a case of eyes bigger than stomach. Luckily the restaurant sat at the bottom of a hill that I had to walk up to get to the subway at 125th street, a bit of exercise after a big, wonderful meal. Thanks Meghann.

I just wanted to apologize that I haven't posted lately. I've been so sick and food is the last thing I want to think about. Gatorade and soda crackers do not really make an interesting entry. The Fresh Direct (home-delivery grocery service) arrived on my worst sick day, Sunday. Piles and piles of food that I don't even want to look at, let alone prepare. Some of the nonperishables are still sitting on the kitchen table, waiting for me to find a place for them. Here's my impression so far: The bananas came at the perfect stage of ripeness, that early stage so we had a few days to eat them. The strawberries were not good, which only means that Fresh Direct can't work miracles and produce tasty strawberries in April. The dried fruit was good, moist without being sticky, not too sweet, with the flavor of the fruit intact. The broccolini looks lovely but I haven't cooked it yet (I'm just excited to find it somewhere). I gave my coworker, Julie, a Yonah Schimmel's sweet potato knish I had ordered, so she'll have to report on that. I think I'm beginning to get my appetite back, finally. I've been bereft without it.

The phone rings at 11:30 last night, and again at 9:30 this morning. It's an automated call from Fresh Direct, letting us know our very first order will not be delivered today because of a power outage and that we need to re-place the order. The timing of the calls makes me think they wanted to make sure to get us out of bed, whether we're early to bed or late sleepers. It was pretty easy to re-place the order, though. We'll see if the delivery goes smoothly. I've been waiting so long for them to get to my neighborhood that I won't believe it worked until they arrive on my doorstep. (When the service started, they said six months. Needless to say it's been longer. I'm still excited about it, though.)

My parents were in town last weekend, and we went to the Natural History Museum to check out the new ocean life room. In the gift shop they had some chocolate left over from their big chocolate exhibit, so I bought some Vosges Haut-Chocolat: Red Fire, with ancho and chipotle chiles and cinnamon. I was kind of disappointed, though; it tasted like a red hot to me. It also kind of reminded me of my uncle Larry's cinnamon schnapps. He probably uses red hots to make it. It's fabulous, if I remember correctly: the heat from the cinnamon flavor and the bite of the alcohol. I added a little chipotle powder to my last mug of hot chocolate, and I liked that better than the Vosges chocolate, too. The temperature heat and the flavor heat combine for an intense experience. Anyway, there were two other Vosges flavors I want to try: curry and coconut with milk chocolate (Naga), and ginger, wasabi and black sesame seeds with dark chocolate (Black Pearl).

was a cream puff from Beard Papa's. But with my parents and an impatient Todd in tow, it was impossible to justify standing in a line that stretched all the way to the end of the block. (Had I been alone, and not in a big hurry, I would have waited, because I wanted to see if it was worth it.) So I made some of my own when I got home. I remember making cream puffs for a progressive dinner in college, then filling them with pudding or ice cream. You start by bringing 1 cup water, 1/2 cup butter and a pinch of salt to a boil. Add 1 cup flour all at once, then stir until it forms a ball. Let sit 10 minutes, then add 4 eggs, one at a time, stirring each egg into the dough completely before adding the next. Place heaping teaspoons on a greased or silpat-lined baking sheet 3 inches apart and bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes. Easy. It was an OK dessert for my diabetic father, too, because I filled his with sugar-free pudding (the rest of us had regular pudding). For something fancier, I'd make a pastry cream (which is what I bet Beard Papa does).

Papa Beard will be worth the queue. At least it was when the fad first came to my city almost 2 years ago. but i still love a piping warm one filled with so cold smooth cream anytime now. but i prefer vanilla over cocoa cream filling.

<img alt=\"pineapple.jpg\" src=\"http://www.walkernewyork.com/eats/archives/pineapple.jpg\" width=\"152\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" class=\"entryimage\" / > This seems to be a theme for me lately: produce that presents itself as a puzzle, a difficult safe that one must figure out how to crack. The second artichoke I had, the one I steamed one day then ate cold from the refrigerator the next, made me relent and decide that, dipped in a good vinaigrette, it was worth it. The bowl of plain yogurt and diced fresh pineapple I just had has made me change my mind about what I had believed was a waste of time. First, the pineapple Todd picked out was pretty green, but I found online that as long as it has some yellow or red at the bottom (which ours did) you can ripen it on your counter, upside down (I think it was NBC's Produce Pete who gave me that tip). It's almost as though the ripeness gradually runs down the pineapple, and over the course of a few days the pineapple turned yellow, from the bottom (which was on top) to the top (I had perched the pineapple on of that tuft of stiff leaves that come out the top). Once it's ripe, you slice off the top and bottom, then the tough exterior. Then there are all those eyes; I had seen people on TV find the rows of eyes and cut out a row at a time, which I did, then picked out the rest. It's not a quick job, though, whatever TV chefs may say. Mine also had all these little seeds embedded in it, and so I took out as many of those as I could. Then I quartered it lengthwise, cut out the fibrous core and chopped it into chunks. I diced a bit up and mixed it with plain yogurt: sweet with the tang from the yogurt, smooth creaminess with the juicy, slighty fibrous pieces.

When cleaning pineapple, try to peler a vif the sides as you would citrus fruit.  A serrated knife works best, and be sure to let the knife do the work.  There are cleaner ways to slice, but the above is the fastest.

I love roasted pineapple myself.

<img alt=\"pineapple.jpg\" src=\"http://www.walkernewyork.com/eats/archives/pineapple.jpg\" width=\"152\" height=\"200\" border=\"0\" class=\"entryimage\" / > This seems to be a theme for me lately: produce that presents itself as a puzzle, a difficult safe that one must figure out how to crack. The second artichoke I had, the one I steamed one day then ate cold from the refrigerator the next, made me relent and decide that, dipped in a good vinaigrette, it was worth it. The bowl of plain yogurt and diced fresh pineapple I just had has made me change my mind about what I had believed was a waste of time. First, the pineapple Todd picked out was pretty green, but I found online that as long as it has some yellow or red at the bottom (which ours did) you can ripen it on your counter, upside down (I think it was NBC's Produce Pete who gave me that tip). It's almost as though the ripeness gradually runs down the pineapple, and over the course of a few days the pineapple turned yellow, from the bottom (which was on top) to the top (I had perched the pineapple on of that tuft of stiff leaves that come out the top). Once it's ripe, you slice off the top and bottom, then the tough exterior. Then there are all those eyes; I had seen people on TV find the rows of eyes and cut out a row at a time, which I did, then picked out the rest.

I made this recipe once before, a long time ago, and I think I used broth instead of wine that time. The shrimp produce a lot of juice, too, so you end up with tasty liquid to sop up with a piece of bread. It's really easy: Clean a bundle of asparagus and snap off tough ends. Cut into 2-inch pieces, then saute for a couple of minutes with two minced garlic cloves, salt, pepper and red pepper flakes. Add 1 pound of shrimp and saute a few more minutes, until shrimp is pink. Add 1 cup dry white wine (I used an acidic pinot grigio) and a squeeze of lemon juice and bring to a boil. Serve in bowls with toasts rubbed with a cut garlic clove. Takes less than 1/2 hour.

My parents are coming for a visit this weekend, and I've invited some friends over for dessert one night to meet them. The problem I'm facing is that my dad is diabetic, and I want to make something he can enjoy with the rest of us. I've read some positive information on Splenda, the sweetener made from a modified sugar molecule that can be substituted at a 1:1 ratio for sugar in recipes where the sugar isn't the basis of texture or browning. But I've also read a few negative things about Splenda, a few side effects and complaints that there haven't been enough studies. But on one of these sites, the person claims suclarose (Splenda) is about 600 times as sweet as sugar (which is not what the Splenda web site says). There are other seeming discrepancies between the negative Splenda sites and the official Splenda site. Am I being too careful? I wouldn't consider using something like Splenda if it weren't for my father's diabetes (I'm a firm believer in real butter, full-fat cream, real maple syrup, in moderation). If it were summer I'd serve fresh berries topped with whipped cream or balsamic vinegar. Are there any options like that for very early spring? I'm considering making a rustic apple tart by tossing the apples with a little Splenda (that's probably what I'll do).

You might want to look at the following place: http://www.sweettalkplus.com/cgi-bin/jboard/jboard.pl. It is the Sweettalk web site and has a recipe resource.
A great dessert is a brownie made with splenda and black beans (sic). There is a great sweetener caled agave you can find too.

There's also Stevia, which is an herb that is just as sweet if not sweeter than sugar. For diabetics (my mom is one) it's said to be helpful because it nourishes the pancreas and helps restore pancreatic function. I'm not sure if that claim is backed up by the FDA, it's just something I've read about the herb. Anyway, good luck with dessert.

My fiancee and I use Splenda all the time...from sprinkling on strawberries, to green tea to baking with it. It definitely works 1-to-1 and I've not had any problems with side effects.

Incidentally, my father is diabetic as well and we've made him several weight watcher desserts in the past that almost never call for added sugar.

You all have good suggestions (except Todd, perhaps, who of course does not like the prospect of eating brownies made with black beans, as picky and unadventurous as he is - but I still love him). 

I have a couple of Weight Watchers cookbooks that I'll have to take a look at; that's a good idea.

I'm now leaning toward a pannacotta made with whole milk or cream, since fat's not the issue. I'll try using one of the artifical sweeteners you suggested.

Maybe a darker chocolate would be bitter enough to cut the richness of the whipped cream filling, which I thought was almost too much. I've begun to use my jelly-roll pan a bit more lately, which was another reason this cake appealed to me. The batter doesn't have any flour, either. Now, this is the recipe I used, which has a couple differences from the basic Bittersweet Roulade recipe in the book.

I finally tried making a broiled grapefruit for brunch this morning. Just sprinkled some brown sugar mixed with minced candied ginger over the cut sides of a halved grapefruit, then put it under the broiler for 5 minutes. It gets sweet, warm and juicy - Todd even liked it. We just had it with scrambled eggs and toast, but I think it'd be a nice addition to brunch. It's a little more labor-intensive than it looks, though: I cut along all the little membranes and along the outside edge to make it easier to eat (no grapefruit spoons here). We also had cafe au lait, although we need to get those big cafe au lait bowls to really enjoy that.

In honor of St. Patrick's Day, I made Nigella Lawson's hash recipe from the NYT yesterday, substituting diced leftover lamb mixed in for the fried egg on top. Figured it was at least as Irish as I am (which is not very much): lots of potatoes, and isn't lamb kind of Irish, too? Anyway, it was pretty good. I sauteed half a sliced onion in some oil, then added three red potatoes cut into 1/2-inch pieces, salt and a dash of chipotle (she called for cayenne). Cooked that over medium-low heat, stirring frequently, for about 20 minutes, then added the lamb and cooked it for another 10 minutes. The potatoes kind of stick to the pan, making all these little browned bits as you stir them. Good food for a late dinner on a snowy night (I went to bed about an hour after).

We had lots of leftovers after a weekend of company, so we've been eating sandwiches for practically every meal. I don't object, though, because a sandwich can be catered to the individual diner, and that means I get to have whatever weird ingredients on it I want. Monday night we had smoked turkey sandwiches on 7-grain sandwich bread, and I always add a lot of chutney because I think it goes so well with the smokiness. Yesterday for lunch I spread salt-cod puree (brandade) on a baguette that I had sliced lengthwise and toasted, then topped it with roasted peppers. Last night we toasted onion rolls, then topped them with heated, sliced roast beef in the sauce and Swiss cheese, then put them back under the broiler to melt the cheese. I ate mine open-face with more sauce; Todd put the top on and ate it as a sandwich. I think we're both sandwiched out now, though. Maybe pasta, a quesadilla or a fritatta to keep working on those leftovers.

I've always liked Peg Bracken's suggestion regarding leftover meat: \"Have you re-presented it as an honest cold-cut platter? It's easy to forget the obvious.\"

But I guess you've already done that re: the sandwiches.

Have you read Bracken's \"I Hate To Cook Book\"? I just love it. I don't say I'd make all her recipes, but some of them (the chocolate cookies, for one) work really well.

We would've thrown the poor thing out if we didn't have one of those digital thermometers to tell us that the inside was perfectly cooked, medium rare. The outside was charred in places and red in others, like it was raw (I still don't know what that was, but it wasn't raw). I instructed Todd to slice it up and put it on the serving platter, so our guests wouldn't see the horrible looking chunk of meat - and then what does he do but take it out to the table and slice it up in front of everyone! But the slices looked so nice and pink inside that everyone forgave the roast its disgusting exterior. The sauce was awesome, too. I was skeptical about the burned fond at the bottom of the roasting pan making anything but a charcoal-tasting sauce, but when I smelled the pan it actually smelled rich and meaty, so I went ahead, with great results. Added butter, then 1/4 a finely diced onion, sauteed it until the onion started to brown, then added 1 cup of the red wine we were drinking, let that cook a bit, then added 1 cup chicken broth. Reduced that a bit, then whisked in 1/2-tablespoon-size chunks of butter (6 of them), one at a time, until it was a smooth sauce.

***CONTENT
Chocolate cream pie with a meringue topping is a two person job (especially if you don't have a standing mixer, although women for years made it without one). One of the key elements of putting the whole thing together is to spread the freshly whipped meringue over a piping-hot filling, so the meringue sort of cooks on contact and doesn't break down and weep. So I have my arms stretched across our small kitchen, stirring the bubbling chocolate custard with one hand while I hold the running mixer in the meringue with the other. The other key is to prevent shrinking by spreading the meringue to cover all the edges of the pie. I did have a problem, though. As the pie sat, sweet little amber-colored beads formed on top of the meringue. It wasn't exactly weeping in the traditional sense, where there's a watery layer between the meringue and the filling. I was thinking maybe it was because the meringue was overcooked, because the recipe I used cooked it at 425 degrees for 20 to 25 minutes. But the texture of the meringue was just what I like, foamy but solid, so I'm not sure that's it. Any ideas?

The beads sound like caramel.  Probably the meringue was either over-sugared or under-whisked -- either way condensation once it came out of a hot oven (either due to steam escaping from the center of the meringue or due to humidity in the kitchen) might dissolve sugar crystals on the surface, leaving beads of caramel as the water evaporated.

Of course, that's just a guess.  You don't want to over-whisk a meringue; that just makes it too dry and difficult to work with.
Kim
2004-03-17 16:37:00
It kind of tasted and looked like caramel, so that makes sense! Oversugaring sounds like it could be my problem. I was halfway through the recipe when I realized I was using four egg whites instead of three, so I added more sugar to compensate. That probably did it. 

My fridge tends to be pretty moist, too, so I'm sure that didn't help.

Ever since I went to Craftbar the first time and had this pureed fish that you eat with toasts, I've been wanting to eat it again. Come to find out it's a bistro staple, and there's a recipe for it in Bistro Cooking at Home. It's pretty easy to do but it makes a bit of a mess. I had a hard time finding salt cod in my neighborhood, too. The fish store, the cheese shop, the gourmet grocer - people there had never even heard of it, or they only carried it during the holidays. I finally found the fish at the Food Emporium near my office, choice grade with no skin or bones. Soaked it for 2 days, changing the water intermittently, then put it in a skillet (they're the same shape as regular cod fillets, although perhaps a bit shrunken), covered it with water, brought it to a boil and simmered for a few minutes, until the fish was flakey. Meanwhile boiled half a potato cut in 1-inch cubes until tender and steeped a chopped garlic clove in 1/2 cup hot light cream. Put the fish, potato, cream in a food processor with 1/4 cup olive oil and salt. Pureed until it was smooth but still had some texture from the flakey fish. Added more salt, then served with toasts and topped with more oil and some roasted bell pepper strips. It was good, but next time I'll add more garlic. The taste was pretty subtle, and the bread I used was so good that it almost overshadowed the brandade.

Calling this meat-n-potatoes is a bit of a stretch, since it really was potatoes with a little bit of meat in the stuffing: twice-baked with pancetta, cheddar and onions (I know I'm mixing my regions here, but it's basically cheddar and bacon). I rubbed the potatoes with garlic oil, stabbed them a few times with a fork, then nuked them (they would've been better, undoubtedly, if I had oven baked them, but I didn't have that kind of time). Let them cool for a few minutes, then cut them in half lengthwise and scooped out the middle, leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch potato shell. Mixed the insides with cheddar, a mixture of sauteed strips of pancetta and diced onion, milk, salt and pepper. Spooned that back into the shells, topped with a little more cheese, then broiled for a couple of minutes to crisp the outside and melt the cheese. The filling encouraged compulsive eating. How much more unhealthy can you get? We tried to assuage the guilt with a mixed-green salad on the side and pineapple slices for dessert.

The recipes from Solo Suppers are usually more food than one person can eat, but I think that might be intentional: She includes a few salads and some tips on how to reuse leftovers. It feeds right into my scavangerishness. Last night I made a single-serving Parmesan pudding, a set, savory custard, and found that, instead of the one pudding the recipe made, I could make two decent-sized puddings from it. I ate one for dinner last night with a salad and the last of the tomato-olive compote (that is a versatile topping) and the other for breakfast this morning with my apple juice. I also lightened the recipe a bit as I went along. Start by melting 1 tablespoon butter in a saucepan, then add 1 tablespoon flour and cook for a few minutes to make a roux. Whisk in 1/4 cup light cream (the recipe called for 1/2 cup heavy cream), then take the saucepan off the heat and add 1/2 cup milk, 1 egg, 1 egg yolk, salt, pepper, nutmeg and 2/3 cup grated Parmegiano-Reggiano (I don't think I added quite enough - I didn't measure and the pudding only had a faint flavor). Pour into buttered ramekins with a buttered round of parchment in the bottom and bake in a waterbath in a 350 degree oven for 25 minutes (I started checking at 15 and found that they needed the full 25 minutes). Let sit for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the edge, unmold onto a plate and remove the parchment. This has a great consistency: smooth, firm, creamy. Not gelantinous. It's a perfect palatte for other flavors. The recipe recommended adding veggies to it or serving it with a green vegetable or red pepper sauce. Two problems: the course-ground pepper (the only way I can do it) sank to the bottom and marred the look of the unmolded custard, and I had a hard time getting the parchment to fit perfectly, so the edges of the custard are a little ragged from the excess paper. Better to have too little parchment than too much, I think.

Last week I had a nice little mezze-type dinner for myself: roasted feta with pita wedges and a cold, steamed artichoke with lemon vinaigrette. The feta was really cute and easy. I put a 2-oz, square slice of feta in a ramekin, drizzled over some olive oil, sprinkled with roasted red peppers, kalamata olives and oregano, and broiled until the edges of the cheese started to brown. I toasted the pita under the broiler for the last couple of minutes the feta was broiling. This was a recipe from I think the March edition of Gourmet, which was the New York edition. I had steamed the artichoke and made the vinaigrette the night before, so it was a quick dinner, too.

Roasted Mushroom Tartine

I picked out a few different mushrooms for this: hedgehogs, black trumpet, enoki and cremini. The really cheerful and friendly woman who checked me out bravely tried, and failed, to guess the name of each one. Quartered the creminis and tore the hedgehogs and trumpets in pieces, then tossed them together with some olive oil, salt, pepper, white wine, diced onion and garlic, and sprigs of thyme in a casserole dish. Covered them with foil and baked them for 25 minutes in a 375 degree oven. Then I added the enoki, stirring the mushrooms, and cooked them for another 10 minutes. (This was based on a recipe from A New Way to Cook.) Now I don't know if this was breaking Clotilde's rules for a tartine (I made this recipe for Is My Blog Burning?), but I brushed a thick slice of firm Italian white bread with some garlic oil, then toasted it under the broiler. Spread on a layer of fresh whole-milk ricotta, then piled on the mushrooms and drizzled with balsamic vinegar.

Adding a couple more-expensive types of mushrooms to cheaper cremini kept the price of the whole thing down, and I did feel like it was a more complex flavor.

I too find that it is very easy to use/abuse the stand mixer.  It sort of gives you permission to do so.  It seems to take longer to clean it and its components than it does to actually use it.  I try to be mindful of that when I use my Kitchen aid mixer and not over-mix.  You really must stand over it and be careful.

This is so unrelated to the topic- but Kim, have you ever tried \"grilled\" lettuce?  I saw it done on the Food Network and ever since I'm so curious.  She grilled romaine lettuce whole and then split it in half lengthwise and added a vinegrette dressing.  It sounds so interesting- I intend to try it this summer!

I never use my stand mixer when I'm making quick breads (not even when I'm making a huge batch of, say, banana bread). It's too easy to make a tough quick bread in a stand mixer. Over mixing causes tunneling in the bread which is why it's tough and often dense. Although, I've never had an overmixed muffin/bread turn out dry--maybe you forgot to add the fat or maybe the recipe is flawed and there is not enough fat for the recipe? or not enough liquid?
Kim

You know, Nicole, that we're grill-deprived out here. But I have sauteed endive and I have a head of radiccio in the fridge that I want to sautee, too. I think I saw that on the Food Network. Was it Giada, or maybe Rachael Ray? Sounds good to me. I always find romaine too tough for a salad (unless it's hearts in a Ceasar), so I bet it'd be good kind of wilty and grilled.

I like the stand mixer for creaming the butter, but I think I'll mix the flour in by hand in the future. I don't think the muffins were actually dry; Todd just didn't know how to describe the weird rubbery texture. The way you describe it, Roxanne, is exactly what it was like. So bizarre. But I guess the stand mixer makes great yeast breads. Have you done that?

Todd's birthday was Wednesday, and he chose Les Halles (on Park Ave South) for dinner. I think it's because he read Kitchen Confidential recently and was curious to see the place Bourdain wrote so much about. It's funny because if we had given it any real thought the Les Halles in our imaginations would have matched the real one, but we both imagined something less dark, crowded and noisy. We were both game, though, and really grew to like the liveliness. Our drinks were ho-hum, but we split an order of smoked herring and potato salad to start that was my favorite part of the meal. It was one whole smoked herring fillet, draped over four big chunks of boiled potato. The herring was not flakey, but had the texture of tough cold-smoked salmon. At first Todd said the texture bordered on revolting, but he grew to like it. The best part was that the potatoes get covered in all that smokey olive oil from the fish, the excess of which I mopped up with the good bread. I almost wish I had stopped there, simply because I was so full after eating my main course that I could hardly enjoy dessert. I ordered merguez and frites. The four lamb sausages were very unevenly seasoned from link to link: the cumin and heat of the first one overwelmed any other flavor, but the second link was more mildly seasoned, and benefitted from the spicy harissa served with. Good fries and a few greens that offered a cool break from the heat of the lamb. Todd's steak (a NY strip, I think) was so sweet and tender, with a pronounced beefy flavor, like a good hamburger on the grill. (Is it depressing that I think his steak tasted like hamburger? I don't mean it that way.). Chocolate-banana cake for dessert, which I would've enjoyed more had my tastebuds recovered from my main dish. Happy Birthday, Todd! I hope you enjoyed it.

The Food Network recipe calls for a blanched-carrot salad, so that might make more sense, but I liked the texture the raw carrots gave the sandwich.

My coworker brought risotto with shrimp, tarragon and lemon for lunch the other day, and she mentioned what a relaxing experience making risotto could be, standing over the pot, stirring with one hand, a glass of wine in the other. I applied the same principle to polenta last night, and topped it with a mixture of roasted mushrooms seasoned with thyme and drizzled with balsamic vinegar. I'm afraid I found it difficult to just stand and stir - and that bothers me. I want to be the kind of person who can just stand and be, and not get bored. I had to turn on some music, find other things to do in the kitchen, etc. I think I need to practice my relaxation techniques. More polenta, risotto for me. Jam. Other long-cooking things that need regular stirring. I like the idea of foods that will force me to slow down.

***CONTENT
I made a seared scallop recipe from Bistro Cooking at Home, the most exciting part of which was the compote the scallops are served with (although the scallops were good, meaty and sweet with a nice sear on one side). First you peel and trim 10 garlic cloves, then put them in a small saucepan and cover them with olive oil. (It does take a lot of oil unless you have one of those tiny saucepans, which I don't. The extra oil gets flavored with the garlic, so I've been using it to brush bread for bruschetta.) Simmer it for 10 minutes, then remove the garlic cloves and 1/3 cup oil to a bowl to cool. Roughly chop a couple handfuls of pitted olives (I used kalamata) and about a cup of sundried tomatoes. (The tomatoes I used were a revelation. I don't know where my produce stand got them, or if they dehydrated them there, but they were sweeter and meatier than I've ever had, pleasant instead of overwhelming. They came in one of those plastic rectangular boxes.) Dice a shallot. Add it all to the cooled garlic and oil. At this point I refrigerated it overnight, then added chiffonaded basil and let it sit at room temperature while I prepared the scallops. As you can see from the photo above, I ate the compote the next day on bruschetta.

It looks like that's the way I'm going. I'm a once-a-week shopper generally, at one or more of the groceries in my neighborhood, but I've been to the new Whole Foods five times since it opened, to supplement my regular grocery shopping with things I can't find in my neighborhood or want to buy mid-week for freshness reasons. Yesterday at lunchtime I bought scallops (because the fish store in my neighborhood was closed Sunday when we were doing our shopping), a variety of mushrooms for tonight and a loaf of bread that was crusty and yeasty, with a even, firm middle that'll be good for sandwiches. The prepared foods area is a zoo at lunchtime, but the grocery area is easy to shop at that time of day and the line, though sometimes very long, moves really fast. And everyone who works there has been so friendly; how long can that possibly last?

Use #2 for Leftover Wine - Poached Pear Tart

This picture is midway through the making of an upside-down red wine–pear tart (like a pear tarte tatin), after the pears had cooked but before the pastry was added. Yesterday I had about a cup of merlot left in the bottle and wanted to try cooking something with it, so I made this tart from A New Way to Cook. The recipe called for 2 1/2 cups dry red wine, so I halved the recipe, making a small, four-serving tart. The wine cooking liquid is flavored with vanilla, which (however improbable it may seem) works. The two flavors—the deep, mellowness of the wine and the fragrant sweetness of the vanilla—amplified each other. The flavor that gets lost, though, is the pear. Mix 1 cup wine, 2 tablespoons sugar and half a vanilla bean, halved lengthwise and scraped in a nonstick skillet (mine was 8 inches across the bottom). Simmer that for five minutes, then take it off the heat to cool a bit and add two sliced pears in whatever pattern you want the tart to have, cutting up a few slices to fill in the empty spaces. Simmer that in the wine, turning once, for about 45 minutes, until the wine is syrupy and the pears are tender. At this point you can leave the pears sit for a while or cover the pears with a thin round of pastry dough (I used one of those refrigerated pie crusts cut down to fit), then bake at 425 degrees until the crust is browned, about 15 minutes. Right when you're ready to serve, unmold onto a cakeplate. If the tart has cooled, you can heat the pan briefly over medium heat to loosen it before you try to unmold it.

when this happens (as it does, often), the following old words of wisdom: \"if of thy mortal goods thou art bereft/and from thy slender store two loaves alone to thee are left/sell one/and with the dole/buy hyacinths to feed thy soul.\" put things into a positive perspective.

Todd said a funny thing when we sat down to eat these souffle-like cakes, \"It's amazing. One instant they're not there, the next they're there.\" It's a thought I often have when I make something quick out of simple ingredients. You take all these components and combine them to create something entirely different. I whipped these up after we finished dinner, so that speed might have contributed to Todd's temporary awe. The recipe was from Everyday Food, but I altered it to make just 2 servings, which was kind of difficult because that was 1/3 the recipe. (What's 1/3 of 1/2 cup? I know it's 1/6 cup, but how do you measure that out? How many tablespoons is that?) First I separated 1 egg and whisked the yolk with 2 generous tablespoons of sugar (less than EF instructed, but I wanted a tart, not-too-sweet cake). Whisked in 2 teaspoons flour, then a teaspoon grated lemon zest and 1 tablespoon and 1 teaspoon lemon juice. While I was doing that, Todd beat the egg white to soft peaks with a pinch of salt. Folded the whites into the lemon mixture, divided it between 2 greased ramekins, then baked it in a water bath at 350 degrees for 15 minutes, or until the tops are brown (the recipe said 20 to 25 minutes, though; I'm thinking my new oven runs hot). The cakes form a top souffle-like layer with a lemon custard layer underneath (if you were trying to make a souffle you'd wonder what you did wrong). But it's good: as you scoop down through it, you're coating the cake part with the warm custard. I would make it more lemony next time.

I've been trying to use my pasta maker a lot, so about every other week I'll make pasta on a weeknight. Last night I rolled out the pasta kind of thick in the machine, then cut it into squares by hand for a really rustic look. A generous 3/4 cup flour and 1 egg make good-sized portions for two people. Todd really liked the \"condiment,\" as he called the sauce, so here it is: While the pasta was resting (before I rolled it out) I opened a 15-ounce can of stewed tomatoes, drained the juice and cut the tomatoes into large chunks. Sauteed a large minced garlic clove in some oil, then added the tomatoes, some oregano, salt and a couple sprigs of thyme (odd, I know, but I had it and wanted to use something fresh). Put that over low heat while I rolled out, cut and cooked the pasta, then tossed it with the cooked pasta and scattered some feta over the top.

It must've been all the discussion yesterday about growing up on a lot of prepackaged foods that made me reach for the pouch of Lipton's Smoked Chipotle Rice, orzo and rice with a mild chipotle flavor, for dinner last night. I had been to the launch of Lipton's new Southwest flavors a couple of weeks ago, and this was a new product sample. I think it was not too bad with all the additions I made to it. I followed the instructions on the package, bringing to a boil 1 3/4 cups water and the rice mix. I added some things, though: frozen peas, chicken shredded from a roast I did last weekend, pimientos. Once the water's boiling you cover the pot, turn down the heat and simmer for 7 minutes. At this point I tasted and added some ground chipotle, for heat (adding another layer of redundancy to \"smoked chipotle\"), and ancho chile powder. Let it set to thicken the sauce. It was so fast, leaving me plenty of time to lie on the sofa watching TV. Is that what speed and convenience give me? More TV-watching time?

Hi Kim. Ah, using a tiny spatula is a great idea. I love the idea of using a mini muffin tin, but I have a hard enough time unmolding my panna cotta as it is. Looks lovely. Also, to bridge the gap between vanilla extract and vanilla bean, I'll use vanilla paste, which gives me the speckles with with ease of extract.

So I'm always feeling a little bereft when I read about some famous chef, like Jacques Pepin or Anthony Bourdain, who grew up around great food, soaking up all this information when their brains and taste buds were like little sponges, learning from toddlerhood from moms and dads who could cook. I grew up on frozen fish sticks, chicken nuggets and pizza, tuna salad, spaghetti from a box with sauce from a jar, rice and pancake mixes, condensed-soup casseroles, canned peaches over cottage cheese. Mmmm, it makes me nostalgic just thinking about it - but it also makes me a novice about what makes for really good food. So you can maybe understand how excited I was when the intros to two of my new books both revealed that the authors kind of fell into an interest in food relatively late in life, and both lament for a moment their non-food beginnings before going on to either 1) impart a huge amount of information on how to identify fantastic ingredients or 2) share recipes for homey, delicious, beautiful bistro-type dishes. There's hope for me yet.

Bistro Cooking at Home (Gordon Hamersley) and Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating (Ari Weinzweig). (I hope I'm remembering what I read correctly.) They're not necessarily household names, but . . .

Didn't Julia Child get kind of a late start?

Kim, what's your point?  It's because of all that canned spaghetti sauce and fish sticks that you are actually the expert you have become.  

Also, I hope you know you have broken your mother's heart.  What could possibly be more \"comforting\" than a 1978 pot pie?  :-)

We enjoyed...Margo

You know, Margo, you're right. And it's all programmed in me now, so tuna-noodle casserole is the ultimate comfort food for me and I can't eat a slice of cantaloupe without salting it first. I get a little thrill of recognition evey time I remember something my mom used to make. Like those peanut butter cookies or lemon bars, or chicken and rice casserole. 

I'm not knocking my childhood food (well, maybe I am a little). It just wasn't sophisticated, and revealed more of a need for speed and convenience than a love of cooking (which Mom would be the first to admit she doesn't have). 

The nostalgia factor may be one way Eric Ripert has a point (I'd be curious to see exactly what he said). I can't imagine a roast chicken being a simple childhood standard, or how differently I would view food if it were. The foods that are really elemental to me will always be the foods my mother made, even if I cook entirely differently.

So I'm always feeling a little bereft when I read about some famous chef, like Jacques Pepin or Anthony Bourdain, who grew up around great food, soaking up all this information when their brains and taste buds were like little sponges, learning from toddlerhood from moms and dads who could cook. I grew up on frozen fish sticks, chicken nuggets and pizza, tuna salad, spaghetti from a box with sauce from a jar, rice and pancake mixes, condensed-soup casseroles, canned peaches over cottage cheese. Mmmm, it makes me nostalgic just thinking about it - but it also makes me a novice about what makes for really good food. So you can maybe understand how excited I was when the intros to two of my new books both revealed that the authors kind of fell into an interest in food relatively late in life, and both lament for a moment their non-food beginnings before going on to either 1) impart a huge amount of information on how to identify fantastic ingredients or 2) share recipes for homey, delicious, beautiful bistro-type dishes. There's hope for me yet.

Which books/chefs are you refering to?  Some chefs lke Eric Ripert insist that one cannot understand cooking unless they grew up with it, and that someone like yourself could never understand food.  This is just dumb.

Bistro Cooking at Home (Gordon Hamersley) and Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating (Ari Weinzweig). (I hope I'm remembering what I read correctly.) They're not necessarily household names, but . . .

Didn't Julia Child get kind of a late start?

Kim, what's your point?  It's because of all that canned spaghetti sauce and fish sticks that you are actually the expert you have become.  

Also, I hope you know you have broken your mother's heart.  What could possibly be more \"comforting\" than a 1978 pot pie?  :-)

We enjoyed...Margo

You know, Margo, you're right. And it's all programmed in me now, so tuna-noodle casserole is the ultimate comfort food for me and I can't eat a slice of cantaloupe without salting it first. I get a little thrill of recognition evey time I remember something my mom used to make. Like those peanut butter cookies or lemon bars, or chicken and rice casserole. 

I'm not knocking my childhood food (well, maybe I am a little). It just wasn't sophisticated, and revealed more of a need for speed and convenience than a love of cooking (which Mom would be the first to admit she doesn't have). 

The nostalgia factor may be one way Eric Ripert has a point (I'd be curious to see exactly what he said). I can't imagine a roast chicken being a simple childhood standard, or how differently I would view food if it were. The foods that are really elemental to me will always be the foods my mother made, even if I cook entirely differently.

Hmm...I really love orange marmalade, so I think I would have been a lot happier with your treats than you were. : )  I think I like the idea of the bar cookies better as one layer, too.  The marmalade glaze on top is so pretty!

I was alone for dinner last night, which made it the perfect night for butternut squash, which Todd does not like (surprised?). I found an itty-bitty squash at Natural, cut it into cubes, tossed it with olive oil, salt, pepper, herbs and chunks of chicken sausage and roasted it in a 450 degree oven. Stirred it once, but only took it out after the smoke set off the alarm (which just sends me running to close the doors to the kitchen, since the smoke detector is in the hallway and is just barely out of my reach, even when I'm standing on a chair). Drizzled on some balsamic at the end. Simple and simply good, although it didn't feel like a complete meal on it's own.

One of the best meals I ever made was an acorn squash stuffed with sausage, apples and sage, and maybe some raisins (going back a few years).  Saute all the stuffing components, suff them into the squash (cut in half) back for 45 minutes.  Good stuff.

I agree that it doesnt seem like enough...it is more of an appretizer sounding item.
Kim

That sounds like a perfect home-alone meal. I think I'll keep that idea on hand. Is one squash too much for one person? I guess I could find a small one. And this way you don't have to try to peel it.

Don't do this to yourself! I ordered three food-related books from Amazon.com (thanks Mom and Dad for the gift card) and I spent all last night jumping from one book to the other, just soaking them in. It made me realize that I almost never pick out cookbooks for myself. I find things on the giveaway table at work or coworkers bring cookbooks to me, or friends and family buy them for me as gifts. I could only name one cookbook on my bookshelf, the Betty Crocker cookbook, that I specifically asked for. With all these cookbooks pouring in, it feels wasteful to buy one for myself. But this time I couldn't resist. The first one I picked was Solo Suppers, which I read an article about in the food section of an Atlanta paper Todd brought home from a business trip. I have at least two nights a week when I cook just for me, so this book will get a workout. She seems to understand small-scale purchasing and prep. I browsed on Amazon a bit and settled on two other books: Bistro Cooking at Home and Zingerman's Guide to Good Eating, which was much bigger than I thought it would be (hooray!). After I placed my order I saw Bistro Cooking in a bookstore and got really excited about getting my order. There are at least three recipes in there that use foie gras (Todd's mom gave me some and I haven't known what to do with it).

Todd and I went here late Saturday afternoon, for some wine, salumi and sandwiches. I really love their menu, especially if I'm with someone who's just willing to graze on starters and maybe split a sandwich. I have to admit that I've never had a main plate here because I'm always too full on the other stuff (never had dessert here, either, which is really sad because a couple of the desserts looked remarkable). Todd started with a New York State microbrew that he really enjoyed, and the waitress suggested a glass of German weisser burgunder for me: clear, crisp, hardly sweet at all with a full flavor and a nice bite at the end. We had a salumi assortment and really liked the coppa, hot soppressata and speck. When Todd ordered the hen of the woods sandwich, I was at a loss. Clearly he's thinking he's ordering some kind of fowl, not a deceptively named fungus. What should I have done? I said, \"Oh, I thought you didn't like mushrooms,\" which Todd said was snotty (my word, not his). I guess I should have waited until he had a mouthful and said, \"Oh, by the way, hen of the woods is a mushroom,\" and laughed and laughed as he spit the offending bite into his napkin and gargled with his microbrew. I had a tuna sandwhich, which involved three slices of crustless pullman white and two layers of not-white tuna dressed minimally, with just capers and pickled onions. It was very good and, with the right tuna, easily reproducable at home, I would think. That's what I love about this place: really good ingredients.

So Todd's history of ordering gaffs goes back further than I knew. He didn't tell me that. 

I hope it doesn't discourage him. He's become positively adventurous when ordering. Whole roast sea bass? Suckling pig? Venison? I'm going to have to start getting more adventurous myself, just to keep up.

I had never eaten, nor prepared, an artichoke. I've had canned and bottled artichoke hearts, marinated and not, but I'd never eaten a fresh, whole one: pulled off the leaves layer by layer, dipping them in mayonnaise, melted butter or vinaigrette, scraping the fleshy part of each leaf with my teeth, until at last you reach the inedible choke and the payoff, the heart. The people who describe it to me are usually rapturous or nostalgic with the adventure of wading through all those rough leaves to find the delicate, and appropriately named, heart. Having steamed and eaten my first artichoke (with both garlic butter and lemon vinaigrette for dipping), I'm ambivalent. I enjoy the adventure, the big messy pile of leaves that overtake your plate as you eat down, down to the end, but I'm not entirely sure about the flavor. Green and mild, the flavor of the flesh was kind of masked by the accompaniments. Todd started eating them plain, which was a better way to actually taste spring in it. As we reached the center, the tips of the leaves became entirely edible, revealing the satisfying texture that we would find at the heart, firm but without a crunch. I think maybe after all the work for so little payoff, the heart feels like a motherlode.

When I was thinking about writing about our visit to Q, A Thai Bistro, I realized the two dishes I really wanted to mention, Todd's whole roasted sea bass and the cabernet-pear tart we shared for dessert, don't really seem very Thai. Although maybe roasting a fish whole is a traditional Thai preparation. I'm not sure. It was an impressive presentation, though. (I was a little jealous.) The fish had crispy skin and came with a hot and sweet garlic sauce. The cabernet-pear tart was interesting. The cabernet part seemed to be a thin layer of cabernet gelatin on top of the tart, which consisted of a dense almond-flavored cake with chunks of pear. I'm intrigued by the possibility of making wine-flavored gelatin. Maybe I'll look for recipes, or experiment. Not entirely sure it's a great idea, but who knows? Anyway, it seems odd to be able to drop this much money on Thai food in my neighborhood. It's a nice place, but it still seems a little pricey (which is probably why we haven't been there more than twice).

We made dinner at home on Saturday and I wanted to do something special, so I made two different mashed potatoes: sesame potatoes and chipotle sweet potatoes. I had sesame potatoes the first time I ate at the Biltmore Room, and they were pretty easy to recreate at home. I used one baking potato and one all-purpose, since that's what I had, and peeled and boiled them as usual. Then I added chicken broth and mashed with a potato masher, going for a silky consistency. Drizzled in some sesame oil to taste, and added some salt and pepper (but just a little, because I really wanted sesame to be the primary flavor, which is why I didn't use milk or butter, either). For the chipotle sweets, I just mashed boiled sweet potatoes with chicken stock and added chipotle powder. The two contrasting colors looked pretty on the plate.

I've been wanting to make this for a while: challah French toast with a pocketful of creamy, mild cheese and fruit. Todd's not a big fan of ricotta, so we made it yesterday with cream cheese. It actually ended up being pretty easy. Slice thick, maybe 2-inch, pieces of challah (straight across, not on a diagonal - it's easier to get the filling to every bite that way). Cut a pocket from one of the long sides, trying to make it as big as possible without cutting through the other sides. Spread some cream cheese in there (maybe a heaping teaspoon) and some jam (we used Stonewall Kitchen Black Raspberry, which Todd's mom gave me for my birthday). Dip (only for about 30 seconds if the challah is relatively fresh) each side of the bread in a whisked mixture of 2 eggs, 1/2 cup milk, a pinch of salt and some vanilla. I was too lazy to get out the nutmeg grater, but that would be good, too. Cook like you would regular griddle French toast, then dust with powdered sugar and eat. The cream cheese melts and the filling gets hot, so it's sweet and creamy. I'm thinking I might try a peanut butter and banana filling next time.

For V day this year I made a really simple chocolate tart that I thought was fantastic, from the Bittersweet cookbook. It's a shortbread-type crust with a set chocolate custard filling that has a flavor deepened by espresso powder. To make the crust, melt 1 stick (8 tablespoons or 1/2 cup) butter in a large bowl, and add a pinch of salt, 1/4 cup sugar and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla extract. Stir in 1 cup flour (the recipe said the dough is really soft, but mine wasn't even dough at this point so I probably added another 1/6 cup). Pat the dough into the pan (mine's a 10-inch pan, and the crust is thin in it) and bake for 20 minutes in a 350 degree oven (until the crust is golden brown). While that's baking make the filling by mixing 1 cup heavy cream, 3 tablespoons butter, 1/4 cup cocoa powder (either natural or Dutch) and 1/2 cup sugar. Stir over heat until thoroughly mixed and bubbles start to appear along the sides of the pan. Take off heat and stir in 1 1/4 teaspoon espresso powder and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla (I thought of steeping half a vanilla bean but didn't want to waste a bean on something that has a primarily chocolate flavor). Right before the crust is finished, whisk the hot milk into a slightly beaten egg, a little at a time to temper the egg. Pour the filling into the crust, turn off the oven and pop the tart back in for about 10 minutes, until the center is set but still jiggles slightly. Cool on a wire rack. The recipe said serve warm or at room temperature, but we also liked it the next day straight from the fridge. It cuts very cleanly.

Inspired by Chocolate & Zucchini and a recipe for eggs over asparagus and prosciutto in that Solo Suppers article, I had a baked egg for dinner, accompanied by a buttered slice of bread, roasted Brussels sprouts and a glass of wine. It wasn't just any baked egg, though. Baked with cream and in a waterbath, seasoned with salt, pepper and fresh thyme, this egg was silky and well-seasoned, with that sweet, fresh fragrance of thyme. I heated the oven to 450 degrees as soon as I got home. I halved the largest Brussels sprouts and tossed them all with olive oil, salt and pepper and roasted them for 15 minutes before I started preparing the egg. To make the egg I poured in a little bit of heavy cream (just enough to cover the bottom of a ramekin) then broke the egg into the cream, at which point the cream seeped through the sides to cover the egg. Seasoned with salt and pepper, placed the ramekin in a baking dish, put it in the oven, then I filled the larger dish with nearly-boiling water. Baked for 12 minutes, then took out both the Brussels sprouts and the egg. Sprinkled fresh thyme over the egg.

***CONTENT
I know, there's a group out there saying, \"What does 'leftover wine' mean?\" But this recipe is really worth the cup of good red wine it uses. It's a recipe that I adapted from Epicurious.com because I didn't have all the ingredients it called for. I had tried one of my birthday wines, the one from the formerly Cote-du-Rhone region of Gigondas, and wanted to give it a spin in some food. First I soaked pieces of day-old French bread (crusts on) in whole milk for 10 minutes (I'd guess 1 1/2 cups of bread to about 1/2 cup milk). Meanwhile I finely chopped half a white onion and a handful of fresh parsley. Put a little less than a pound of ground beef in the food processor, then added the onion and parsley, 1 egg, the soaked bread (omitting any milk that wasn't soaked up), dried sage, salt and pepper. Processed it all until it was a consistent paste (this took awhile and was kind of difficult, as the processor was really full; I think I'd put the bread on the bottom next time). Formed into 2-inch meatballs and baked in single layer in a glass baking dish at 350 degrees for 30 minutes. Tossed the baked meatballs with a light dusting of flour, then panfried them in butter and olive oil until they were brown. Then I added a mixture of 1 cup wine, one small can tomato juice and some chicken-stock paste to the pan, stirring to get some of the stuff on the bottom of the pan. Brought to a boil and bubbled for about 20 minutes, until the sauce was nice and thick. Sprinkled with more parsley. I served with bread, but the recipe from Epicurious suggested mashed potatoes, which I think would be even better. The sauce is fantastic, rich and winey, with a concentrated flavor.

Ouch! Gigondas in a sauce?? I'm sure it was good; it better be good. But how about drinking the gigondas with the meal and opening a cheaper syrah or heavier rhone for the sauce. That way you'll have a bottle of wine open that you'll have to enjoy the following night!
Kim
2004-02-25 09:55:00
What's the objection? Is it simply the price? (I really am curious, since I'm kind of a wine novice. What do you cook with?) 

It wasn't terribly expensive - less than $20. And Todd and I are kind of lightweights, so 1 bottle minus the 1 cup for the sauce still left a lot of wine for drinking. Anyway, I wanted to use something I really liked the taste of, since the flavors were being concentrated in the sauce. And it's all part of my wine experimentation, to find out what works for cooking and what I like for drinking.

Julie and I went to Amy's Bread on 9th Avenue yesterday during lunch just to get in a walk to enjoy the nice weather. She bought lunch, I bought a loaf of French bread, then I ordered an oatmeal cookie that had been calling to me while I waited for Julie to get her sandwich. The woman who was waiting on us (we thought she might be Amy) recommended these lime-cornmeal cookies that I had also been eyeing; it didn't take much convincing for me to switch my order. The yellow cookie was about 3 inches in diameter and rounded like a drop cookie, with just enough lime glaze to deliver a burst of sweet tartness with each bite. The rustic, coarse texture was soft in the center and kind of crunchy on the edges. The cookie part was not very sweet at all, which was a perfect balance for that glaze, and had flecks of lime zest throughout. We both liked it, and Julie kept mentioning it all afternoon.

The February 1 issue of Woman's Day has a recipe for lime cornmeal cookies, but they're the freeze-and-slice variety, which I think would make a crunchier, thinner cookie than the Amy's Bread cookie, which seemed like it was a drop cookie. Maybe lowering the amount of flour in the WD recipe would allow you to bake them as drop cookies? I don't know if the magazine is still on newsstands, but it's the one with the citrus cover. 

There's also a Martha Stewart recipe on FoodTV.com, but I haven't had a lot of success with her recipes, so . . .

I think girls who get cookies and then don't share them with coworkers, even though they know coworkers love cookies more than almost anything, are selfish.

Amy's Lime-Cornmeal Cookies

Julie and I went to Amy's Bread on 9th Avenue yesterday during lunch just to get in a walk to enjoy the nice weather. She bought lunch, I bought a loaf of French bread, then I ordered an oatmeal cookie that had been calling to me while I waited for Julie to get her sandwich. The woman who was waiting on us (we thought she might be Amy) recommended these lime-cornmeal cookies that I had also been eyeing; it didn't take much convincing for me to switch my order. The yellow cookie was about 3 inches in diameter and rounded like a drop cookie, with just enough lime glaze to deliver a burst of sweet tartness with each bite. The rustic, coarse texture was soft in the center and kind of crunchy on the edges. The cookie part was not very sweet at all, which was a perfect balance for that glaze, and had flecks of lime zest throughout. We both liked it, and Julie kept mentioning it all afternoon.

The February 1 issue of Woman's Day has a recipe for lime cornmeal cookies, but they're the freeze-and-slice variety, which I think would make a crunchier, thinner cookie than the Amy's Bread cookie, which seemed like it was a drop cookie. Maybe lowering the amount of flour in the WD recipe would allow you to bake them as drop cookies? I don't know if the magazine is still on newsstands, but it's the one with the citrus cover. 

There's also a Martha Stewart recipe on FoodTV.com, but I haven't had a lot of success with her recipes, so . . .

Todd brought the food section of the Atlanta newspaper back from his trip there last week, and they had a big article on the book Solo Suppers, with a handful of excerpted recipes. I haven't tried any of them yet, but a couple of them, like asparagus with poached eggs, looked good. The recipes really seemed to embrace cooking for one, taking advantage of benefits of shopping for just yourself instead of dwelling on the difficulties. Maybe I'll have to pick up the actual book. It was appropriate, too, since his trip left me solo dining three nights last week, and now that school's started back up it's going to be a regular event again. While he was gone I cooked one serving of dried pasta, adding a handful of frozen bay scallops at the end of the cooking time, then drained them and tossed them with butter and thyme. Another night I had cheesy polenta topped with warmed bottled eggplant tapenade I got for my birthday. Neither was a lot of trouble, but they were good enough that I felt like I was pampering myself.

***CONTENT
This was a recipe from Food and Wine, but in the magazine the fish is baked on top of thin slices of potato and tomato that have already been baking for a while. By getting rid of that I made this a pretty quick dish. Sunday morning I smashed two garlic cloves and about a third of a jalapeno, minced, with some salt in the mortar. Added a couple tablespoons of olive oil, the juice of half a lemon, cumin, paprika and chopped fresh cilantro and stirred it all together. Spread half of that over the non-skin-side of a 1/2-pound striped bass filet and put it in a baking dish in the fridge. When we got home for lunch, I popped it in a 475 degree oven for 15 minutes. Served the extra charmoula on top; I think the fresh herby-crunchy-spiciness was key to the dish. It made just enough for Todd and me.

I can empathize with getting stuff done while the little one sleeps. I have a 9 year old but he also was not a reliable napper when he was tiny. Hated to sleep. Wouldn't. When he did, I cheered. I either napped too or did bits of cleaning and cooking like you. It felt great when my hubby got home and most of the dinner was actually prepped so eating would be done at a reasonable time instead of 10 pm.

My son stopped napping all together when he was 2 weeks short of 3 years old. He didn't sleep through the night till past 5 years old. He still never wants to go to sleep - usually somwhere between 10 and 10:30 on a school night and 11 pm on a weekend or vacation night. I know what it is like.

Good that you got such a great meal pulled together when the little one slept. Good job. Sounds delicious.

I made a Gyro Burger last week and it was delicious. This sounds similar. 

I'm proud of you. But remember to get some sleep when the little one does. That is what saved me from going nuts.

Todd had suckling pig at Bar Pitti last night, and it was like nothing I had ever tasted before. The meat was so white and mild, and the texture was so soft, almost like it wasn't even meat. I can't come up with a way to describe it; maybe like biting into a bread dough that you've just finished kneading. It made me a little sad, though, because it was so clearly young flesh. It's odd; I don't have the same qualms about veal. I have to say, too, that this is one of the most welcoming restaurants I've eaten at. The waiter was friendly and casual, and explained everything in detail. Two of our party were about an hour late and had told us to go ahead and eat without them. The restaurant needed the table we were at for a party with reservations and seemed a little anxious about serving our friends, but they were very apologetic and nice about it.

I do not have any qualms about eating the meat of an animal slaughtered at a young age, I am a carnivore, should I wait untill the calf writes its first novel? Graduates from secondary school? I love cats and cats don't go in much for veggies , so I'm just staying in touch with my inner cat.

Maybe it's the name- \"veal\" sounds nothing like an animal, young or old, while \"suckling pig\" is a little too descriptive for comfort. If veal was instead called \"young nursing cow\", it might lose some of it's marketability.
Kim
2004-02-09 11:31:00
Todd kind of said the same thing you are, Laika. Lamenting the foreshortened life of an animal that's being raised as food anyway is just a matter of degrees. If you carry the argument out you could conclude we shouldn't eat any animals at all (which is what a lot of people do decide). 

Ted, should the idea that we might have to be fooled by a semantics game in order to eat certain foods disturb us? 

The menu Saturday night called it \"suckling pig,\" but when Todd ordered he called it \"piglet,\" which made the waiter laugh and say he'd have to remember that one.

Piglet - that's even worse.

I confess I like to stay as far from the source of my food as I possibly can, and I'm pretty sure this is NOT a good thing. I think when God legitimized the eating of dead flesh, He wanted us to be quite aware of where it was coming from & the sacrifice it takes to fill our bellies, of the fact that we live in a fallen world, pointing ultimately to the The Sacrifice that will one day, among other things, put an end to a practice that was (I believe) not originally intended. I think the ritual of eating has always been of a sacramental nature (we take our hands, our minds, and the stuff of earth that God has given to create something new and life-giving for ourselves and our communities); the insertion of animal \"sacrifice\" into that cycle is pretty grave & significant, and should be remembered for what it stands for- but now I believe I'm rambling.

Having said all that, the sight of blood & the smell of (live or dead) animals make me rather sick to my stomach, and I've purposefully avoided having to practice what I believe...

Humans are omnivores by nature.  And, veal is deeee-licious.  That being said, meat is not exactly having its best moments lately.  Contaminated cows and chickens...fish with too much mercury, problems with farm-raised salmon...pork trying to say it's \"the other white meat\" (see i'm using the quotation marks for you, kim), and even atkins folks recently acknowledging that maybe eating pork chops and hamburgers for breakfast everyday isn't too bright.  Perhaps the vegetarians are actually onto something.  But, oh, I love sauteeing veal in butter and lemon and then wrapping it around sage leaves, mozzarella and prosciutto (use a toothpick to hold it all together)-mmm, that is the stuff.

We just had a sneak peek at the new Whole Foods in the Time Warner building (which is about 8 blocks up from my office, so I was curious), and it was a zoo. I guess I'm kind of ambivalent because of all fuss (it is, dare I say it, just a grocery store). But they do have nice selections of cheese, fish (sea scallops for $7.99 a pound, which seemed like a decent price to me), produce, meat, olive oils (they have their own brand, which is pretty decent, and then have added a red seal to other brands they like) and prepared foods (sushi, Jamba Juice, soups and lots of prepackaged foods like samosas, summer rolls, potato pancakes, falafel, plus they'll have Thai, Indian and Mexican food bars soon). I have to go back and peruse the cheese more carefully, and I noticed they have a lot of smoked and cured fish I'd like to try: smoked trout, whitefish and salmon, salmon \"candy.\" And, oh, the produce was pretty: Baby white eggplants and green and purple cauliflowers, a trio of colors of tight, squeaky-looking cabbages, piles of clementines. They also have a chocolate-dipping station, where they can dip anything, a bakery, other confections, a special wine shop. It's hard to tell from here whether I'll become a regular shopper. Eight blocks is so near, but in NYC it's also just far enough away that there are closer options. The selection will probably draw me back, though.

I tended to stay away from places with white table cloths, but mostly when the kids were older and pulling things, knocking glasses over etc. How old is he? With a small baby it is actually easier. I would go in the off-hours, early for dinner or for a late lunch. I remember a lovely lunch at L'Ecole once and my daughter slept through the whole thing. If you can time it with a nap that would be terrific.
Seriously, since kids, I don't get out so much anymore thus my repertoire of great restaurants is not very up-to-date. We had a very nice meal at Little Giant a while ago and I would like to go back. It was a very pleasant place (I think someone had a baby there, but I am not sure) and if you came early I don't think anyone would mind.
Take advantage while he is small and you can take him along.

It must be the season for these because I've been seeing them everywhere. They're really very striking-looking, and don't taste very much like oranges. In fact, I kind of find the taste a bit insipid, like cherry flavor or fruit punch. From the outside they look like orange, some like oranges with a blush. I think the red flesh is beautiful but would rely on something else for flavor. (Although maybe if you reduced the juice you'd end up with something surprising.)

***CONTENT
We called too late to get reservations to the Biltmore Room on Saturday night for my birthday, so we found ourselves there, in a cozy, intimate room at 9:30 on Sunday night. The fireplace had a fire in it, and couples sat side-by-side at tables along the wall, talking low with their heads together. Midway through our meal the staff had begun cleaning up to close, but we felt leisurely, comfortable, and our waiter never rushed us a bit. I liked it. I may get in the habit of having dinner late on a weeknight. Oh, and the food was good, too. Todd's starter was quail with a pumpkin risotto that had a rich, smokey-ham flavor. Out of curiosity I ordered stuffed squash blossom, which was a strange choice for a January dinner, a light and crispy fried blossom (much bigger than I thought it would be) stuffed with crab and served with corn and avocado. The main courses we ordered were really the highlights, though (I'm starting to think that's as it should be). Todd had cocoa-dusted venison, and I feel like I tasted allspice in there, too. I had spiced duck breast, served medium-rare with port-braised figs. I love duck, at least in the incarnations I've had it. We split the warm pear financier, and the ginger ice cream that accompanied it was still a knockout. I said I'm going to have to try to replicate it, and Todd looked at me mournfully and reminded me that I'm not so good at making ice cream. (I just think I need practice.) Anyway, it was good; we were very happy. It'd be nice if they changed their menu, maybe seasonally. But we're officially fans now (Todd, too).

I think you'd really enjoy the duck at Peking Duck House in Chinatown-on Mott Street-(20 Mott was fabulous before it closed).  I had leftovers the next day for lunch (which were just as good) that made everyone extremely jealous as I rolled my pieces of duck and scallion into the thin pancake and then dipped it in hoison sauce.  Oh, man, that's the stuff.

***CONTENT
My parents sent six Omaha steaks for my birthday, and Todd and I had a little bonfire on Saturday night while making them. We had thawed two bacon-wrapped filet mignon, seasoned them, then put them on a piece of foil on the broiler pan. When it was nearly time to turn them over, I went to the kitchen and saw flames shooting up from the steaks. I yell, turn off the broiler and start to pull the broiler pan from the oven. Todd comes in and wants to douse it with baking soda, but he doesn't know where I keep it, or put a pan lid over the flames, but all the lids are stored in the bottom drawer under the oven so we can't get to them with the oven open (besides, I read recently that you're not supposed to do that). Slapping the fire once with a wet oven mitt only made the flames get momentarily bigger (it wasn't really a very big fire). As we argued about what to do, the flames got smaller and smaller until they went out. All the fuel (the melted bacon fat) had been consumed. We're convinced it happened because we lined the top of the broiler pan with foil, which collected a pool of ignitable fat. The thing that disturbs me now is that neither of us thought to use the fire extinguisher, which is in a very convenient spot in a side cabinet. Of course, if we had we wouldn't have been able to eat the steaks, which were really tender. Someone at work had said that Omaha steaks tend not to have much flavor, but the bacon wrapped around these made them flavorful, too. And perfectly cooked, believe it or not, pink in the center and juicy and tender all over. Also roasted potatoes seasoned with a new spice rub (another gift) and some Brussels sprouts (which Todd decided really aren't that bad).

It took me years to figure this out.  When making potatoes au gratin, think baked macaroni and cheese.  The concept really is the same.  Make a white sauce and swap out the cheeses (swiss, american, cheddar) and the herbs (rosemary, chives & parsley, thyme)  depending on the meat you serve it with.  Look for such a recipe and you won't be sorry.

I have a coworker, Greg, who is from Kentucky and always regales us with tales of the exotic fare one can sample there. His childhood home is relatively near Owensboro, which is known for its barbecue, particularly its mutton. For my birthday this year Greg called up Moonlite Bar-B-Que and ordered a gallon of burgoo, a soup he had mentioned that I had never heard anything of. It arrived frozen solid, in a gallon-size plastic jug, and took two days to thaw. It's primarily mutton, but also contains potatoes, tomato paste, cabbage, corn, ketchup, spices, worcestershire sauce, chicken, beef, onions and vinegar. There's a little bit of heat, a little bite from the vinegar, but what you mainly taste is the mutton, a rich, meaty, almost but not quite gamey taste (it was originally made with squirrel, so the literature included in the package goes). The soup's been cooked so long the mutton's in tiny shreds that hold together the thick juice, but the corn must've been added later because it's fresh and plump. We ate it with cornbread, although Greg says they usually have it as a side to Moonlite's barbecue. (I'm amused by the idea of this meaty soup, almost entirely meat, as a side to more meat.)

Todd gave me a great birthday present this year (you're going to be reading a lot about a few great birthday presents over the next few days). He knows I've had fun learning more about wine, and that I'd like to have a small collection around the house so we can open a bottle whenever we have guests or just feel like it ourselves. So last night he said, \"I need to pick up your birthday present, and it's just down the block. Do you want to come along?\" My curiosity was aroused, because I had no idea what he had in mind. He led me to the wine shop, then told the guy there (the owner, I think) that he wanted to buy me six bottles of wine, all different, so I could taste around. I think the owner actually enjoyed picking them out for me. We had already picked up a shiraz from the Barossa Valley in Australia because we found the bottle charming (it's the Piping Shrike, and it has a funny little story on the back and not a whole lot of info on how the wine tastes). After approving our selection, the owner picked out six other bottles (the last one was free) of sharp, flavorful red wines (I like bright, spicy wines right now, rather than rich, mellow ones). We got a Spanish rioja that hasn't been mellowed for U.S. palates; an Italian ripasso, which is made by pouring wine over amarone (partially dehydrated) grapes; a Gigondas, from the Rhone region of France; a merlot that is not typical for merlot; and two others from California.

When I saw the cover of last month's Real Simple, I thought, \"What could be more boring than chicken soup?\" I am not a big chicken soup fan, and that includes real chicken stock from a chicken carcass, chicken noodle and matzoh ball (although I'd be willing to try a really good matzoh ball soup if someone knew where I could get some). To me the only reason to eat chicken soup is if you're sick. But when I finally read the RS recipe, I decided to try it. In addition to 3 tablespoons of minced ginger it had parsnips, carrots, a turnip and sliced scallions sprinkled over the top. It starts with sauteeing the ginger with a couple minced garlic cloves and a thinly sliced onion. Then add the chicken broth and the vegetables. The recipe uses a rotisserie chicken, but I don't get the point. I just added cubed raw chicken to the soup, and it was cooked by the time the vegetables were soft, 20 minutes later. It was pretty good, with all that ginger. I also made the maple-walnut biscuits (a half-recipe, since the whole one made 8 biscuits). The best part of the biscuits is the maple syrup you brush on top for the last 5 minutes of baking. (There's maple syrup in the dough, too, but I felt like it was less detectable.) Oh, the photo is courtesy of my coworker, Julie, from when I ate the leftover soup for lunch. Thanks!

I always think I don't like that fennel-licorice-anisette flavor, but I bet you're right here. It'd be one of those places where it goes so well with the other flavors that it wouldn't matter.

I can't say that I've had macaroni and cheese from the box recently, but I'm still a defender of it. It's fast, it gives you that carb-comfort, it doesn't cost a lot. And sometimes you have to just wallow in the guilt of eating low. I made macaroni and cheese last night from a recipe in an issue of Cook's Illustrated from the 1980s in which they tried to claim that their stovetop mac and cheese was almost as fast as the blue box. But that's only after grating 1/2 pound of Cheddar cheese, whisking milk, eggs and seasoning, boiling macaroni, making then tossing breadcrumbs with butter and toasting them. Then comes the seven minutes of constant stirring that prompted the writer to claim that it's almost as fast as packaged. (Never mind all the dishes you get dirty.) What's the point of making the claim? Just say it's better, richer, more fulfilling. A different animal entirely, really. Making mac and cheese from scratch fulfills entirely different longings than making it from the box. Why even compare the two? That said, I'd make the Cooks Illustrated mac and cheese again in a heartbeat. It was incredibly fast (30 to 45 minutes) and so creamy right out of the pot, with the nice crunchy contrast of toasted breadcrumbs on top. First I put the water on to boil, then turned my attention to the breadcrumbs: I had some left over from the cassoulet I made last weekend, but I needed more, so I used packaged bread. First I ground half a piece in the coffee grinder to clean out the grounds (it really works!). Threw those crumbs away, then ground more bread for the topping. Tossed about a cup of crumbs with about a tablespoon of melted butter, then toasted in a 350 degree oven for 10 minutes. Tossed 1/2 pound elbow macaroni in the boiling water. Mixed 1 cup evaporated milk with 2 eggs, a heavy dash of Tabasco, a teaspoon of dried mustard, lots of salt and a few grinds of pepper. Drained the cooked pasta, then tossed it in the same pot with 3 tablespoons of butter. Then, over low heat, added the milk mixture with most of the cheese and stirred until melted. Then added the rest and stirred for 5 minutes more, until it starts to thicken. The longer it sits, the thicker it gets. I ate it right away, sprinkled with the bread crumbs. Todd ate it about 45 minutes later, and it had set up a bit, like a baked mac and cheese would. He said it was still good. Once you finish the steps above you could put it in a casserole dish, cover it with the crumbs and bake it until bubbly.

Funny, I just made a not-from-the-blue-box mac-n-cheese last night.  And I was going to make a cassoulet a few weeks ago, but work got in the way.  It must be the weather that drives us to these casserole comforts.

OOoo, sounds good. I will definitely try this one. I have noticed that many mac and cheese recipes call for evaporated milk - I guess because it combines better with the cheese without using flour?
Kim
2004-01-29 14:23:00
The good thing about Cooks Illustrated is that they explain everything. I think it said the evaporated milk tended to be more stable, and meld better with the cheese, because of the processing it goes through. I'll check again when I go home.

Do you ever see those signs with quotation marks around random words? Please don't \"feed\" the \"birds.\" Parking in \"back.\" You know what I mean. Here the quotes serve a purpose: Some might say this is not \"authentic\" cassoulet. (I won't get into why authentic is in quotes here.) Mostly because it starts with a pound of sweet Italian turkey sausage, which is inauthentic on about three different levels. It still tasted good, though. I feel like the fennel from the sausage combined well with cassoulet's traditional thyme. Anyway, it's much easier and faster than the usual cassoulet, too. Saute the aforementioned sausage, removed from casing, in a little bit of oil in a Dutch oven. Add a thinly sliced onion and a minced garlic clove. Then pour in 45 ounces rinsed, drained canned white beans, 5 sprigs thyme, 1 1/2 cup chicken stock, 2 chopped parsnips, 2 chopped carrots, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, then simmer gently for an hour. Meanwhile combine 1 cup fresh breadcrumbs with 2 minced garlic cloves and 1/4 cup chopped parsley. Spoon the bean mixture into a shallow casserole dish, then spread breadcrumbs over the top and bake in a 400 degree oven for 10 minutes. This makes a huge amount, so I only baked half of it Sunday night for Todd and I (he took leftovers to work the next day). Then I washed out the casserole and spooned the rest of the mixture in it and put it in the fridge. I brought it to work today, with the rest of the breadcrumbs, to share with a couple of coworkers. We've been trying to start up a rotation of taking turns bringing lunch for the others once a week, but we all tend to be busy so it's been slow getting it started.

Chocolate Babka

***DATE
2004-01-26 10:59:00
***CONTENT
This recipe was from Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe, which I'm really growing to like for ideas. It doesn't look like the round babka I'm used to having, and it had a lot less air in it. In fact, when I first cut into it after it baked, I was kind of disappointed because it looked like cake. But cutting it, and eating it, revealed a different story. It's dense, rich, with that eggy heaviness. And chocolate. I was worried because I didn't use all the sugar-cocoa mixture, but it didn't seem to matter. On Day 2 it was starting to get a little on the dry side, though. As a coworker and I compared recipes it became clear that this is a relatively low-fat recipe with about half the usual amount of yeast, which probably accounts for the dry, dense texture (the handfuls of extra flour I added certainly didn't help). Dissolve 1 1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast (about half a packet) in 1/4 cup warm water for 5 minutes. (I added about a teaspoon of sugar to feed the yeast, then added that much less later; I wonder if that affected the outcome. I just like to see that my yeast is working.) Then stir in 1/2 cup yogurt, 1 egg, 1 1/4 teaspoon salt, 3 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons melted butter. Stir in 2 cups flour, 1 cup at a time, then work an extra 1/4 cup in with your hands. At this point my dough was so sticky I kept adding more flour, about 3 more handfuls (I have a pretty light touch when measuring flour and always seem to add too little, although with this recipe you really have to be careful not to add too much; the dough stays very sticky). Then I sprayed my hands with nonstick spray, which really seemed to help. Work all the flour in while it was in the bowl, lift the dough, spray the bowl and the top of the dough with nonstick spray, then put the dough back in the bowl. Let it rise in a warm place 1 1/4 hour, while it increases in bulk a bit more than 50 percent (which kind of looks discouraging after making things that double in bulk, but the recipe does use only half the yeast packet). Punch it down with a greased fist, then put it on a greased surface and let it sit 5 minutes, then pat and stretch it into a 10 by 16 inch rectangle. Spread to within 1/2 inch of edge with a tablespoon of softened butter, then with a mixture of 5 tablespoons sugar and 3 tablespoons cocoa powder. Sprinkle with 1 cup chocolate chips. Roll it up from long side, pinched end closed, then transfer to a greased baking sheet, seam side down, and let it sit for another hour (it doesn't rise much). Bake in 350 degree oven 40 minutes until brown and sounds hollow when tapped. I think I may use a different recipe next time, but the technique should be universal (the proportions of ingredients just differ).

Chain or no, Cafe Spice is one of my favorite Indian restaurants. It has an open kitchen, too, so while we waited we watched them cook, roasting meats on skewers, scooping thin dosa off the cooktop. Their lunch is a pretty good deal. Yesterday Todd and I ate and had drinks for $31 with tip. I had the South Indian lunch special, which had some familiar and some not-so-familiar items on it. One of the most pleasant surprises was the idli. Idli are fairly bland cakes (almost like cornbread) shaped like little UFOs and made from ground rice, dal and water. I was actually pretty sure I wasn't going to finish them until I dipped them in the bowl of sambar, a spicy broth that had chiles, tomatoes and eggplant in it. It soaked the flavorful juice right up and turned out to be a great way to eat it. The special also included a mini potato dosa, a crepe-type bread filled with curried potatoes, onions and cashews. The coconut chutney, a smooth puree, had this wonderful, milky-watery coolness, like really freshly made mozzarella has (it was awesome with the dosa). The third item on the platter, my least favorite, was uttapam topped with onions and peppers. It turned out to look kind of like little pizzas made out of pancakes. Still OK, but not as great as the other two.

It was my first idli but, like the author, I am definitely now a fan. I think the idlis were my favorite thing at lunch Sat. I was afraid that I was eating them \"wrong\" by soaking them in  sambar, but how can something that tastes so good be wrong. 

There must be some kind of idli mold to make them that shape. Then they're steamed?

Those ribs were still good regardless of the gristle. The spicy sauce was great (a little toooo hot) and would be good to try again with a leaner meat.

This is a variation on a recipe from Elizabeth Alston's little pancake cookbook. I started by slicing a Granny Smith apple thinly, as though I was making a pie, then sauteed it in some butter with brown sugar until the slices softened. While that was cooking, I whisked 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 cup flour, 2 eggs, 1/4 teaspoon salt, a few gratings of nutmeg and a big dash of cinnamon in a 4 cup measure. Spread out the apples in their pan evenly, then poured in the batter (which was the batter for Easy Oven Pancake in the cookbook) and popped it in a 450 degree oven for 12 minutes. It's an eggy pancake, full of sweet-tart apples. We poured maple syrup over the top.

This is one of those places you walk into and everything is so breathtakingly beautiful that you just have to look for a while, even before you can start contemplating the flavors. (It also makes you mad at yourself for not having a camera along; this picture is from their web site, www.buttercupbakeshop.com.) We confined ourselves to the cupcakes (just $1.50 each): lemon, Devil Dog (with marshmallow-looking frosting), German chocolate, red velvet, spice, Lady Baltimore (white with a cherry nestled in the frosting on top) and then the regular yellow and chocolate. We both settled on spice, which had a sour cream frosting. The cupcake part was good, with a spicy (nutmeg?) bite and the texture of a quick bread, with golden raisins and walnuts. The frosting was piled high and fluffier than Cupcake Cafe's, sweeter too (almost too sweet, without a detectable sour cream tang). Not the dense, rich Cafe cupcake, but a chewier, sweeter one. It seems more like an everyday cupcake to me. Not that it's mediocre. It's just a sit-down-after-school-with-a-big-glass-of-milk-and-a-treat cupcake. The one thing that keeps it from firmly planting itself in that camp is the huge quantity of frosting. (Which I can't decide whether I'm for or against; it's nice to have frosting for every bite, but it makes it less portable and more decadent.)

I don't know how to choose what to write about today. Should it be the sad tale of my belly flop with chocolate pot de creme (I used frozen egg yolks that hadn't completely thawed, so you can imagine the rest), the yummy tortilla soup topped with toasted corn tortilla stips and cheese that wasn't really that difficult or exciting to make (diced onion and jalapeno sauteed; added cumin, chile, garlic, then chicken soup base, water, a can of diced tomatoes and a sliced pork chop left over from lunch the day before) or the rosti that was pretty but soggy and, mysteriously, tasted to Todd like wet socks (tasted to me like onion, potatoes, salt, pepper)? Todd took a pretty picture of the soup, though:

The weather was sunny, cold, with a frigid wind (but not as cold as it had been the two previous days). The company was Todd and two friends who moved to Minnesota a few months ago and who had some big news. The place was Pigalle, a French bistro that's just two blocks down from my office. All these elements came together to take me out of my day Friday, to forget about the office and the cold and the things I don't like about my life for a while. Tucked into a table along the back wall, we had a view of the big, bright room lined with windows and mirrors. We almost all ordered bistro standards: fragrant onion soup with a thick layer of melted cheese on top and bread soaking up the broth, a thick, fluffy omelet, steak frites (and one order of ravioli that looked great). I had a frisee salad with lardons and a poached egg on top. Happy, happy, happy. I have to get back to try the onion soup. It smelled awesome. And it's easy to see myself stopping in there for lunch one day, alone with my magazine without feeling ill-at-ease, for a warming crockful.

I got my Penzeys order yesterday and found a surprise. They had packaged, along with my order, a sample of their chili powder. Unlike lots of national brands, their chili powder doesn't have salt, just ancho chile powder, cumin, garlic and Mexican oregano. I had ordered cumin, ancho chile powder and Turkish oregano, so it's almost like they were showing me that I could get it all together in one. I also ordered their awesome single-strength bourbon vanilla, which comes with a vanilla bean in the bottle (one of their bestsellers is the double-strength vanilla), and paprika, turmeric and chicken soup base. I haven't tried it yet, but it's kind of a paste and the first ingredient is chicken meat, so we'll see how it is. In the past I've ordered chipotle chile powder (smokey and hot), cardamom pods, paprika (they have hot and sweet), sage, curry powder, peppercorns. They have a great selection of whole spices, vanilla beans. The have a few stores, and apparently people are always clamoring for a Penzeys to be built in their town, so the company is running a competition. Whatever city sends the most postcards to Penzeys will win a store in their town. (I think the city has to have a population of 300,000.) The company doesn't do a lot of marketing, so this is a way for them to find out where they're known and where a store my do well. It could be genius, or it could fail terribly. It'll be interesting to see. I'm sending my postcard in. (Write \"I want a Penzeys in my town\" and send to Bill Penzeys, c/o Penzeys Spices, 19300 west Janacek Court, Brookfield, WI 53045; make sure to include your address because it's limited to one entry per address.) They have all the rules on their web site. The contest ends July 31, 2004.

It's amazing how good food can make up for a host of ills. After our meal at Divane last night I made a trip to the restroom. It turned out to be nicely designed, with one stall and three women squeezed into the tiny room in front of me. Plus it was about 30 degrees warmer than the dining room. The sauna-like temperature and the good meal made all the women talkative, so we chatted and laughed as we waited, complaining about the cold dining room and the scatty service (two different waitresses were trying to take our orders, and they were a little too aggressive about drinks and starters, which there were only four of, including salad, hummus, spicy lamb pita and something else). The bad: the aformentioned service, the cold (which they couldn't do much about, it was 10 below outside), the vinegary-tasting shiraz that was their house red. The good: the donor kebab with yogurt. There were three piles on a huge platter. To the left was a salad of sliced onion, cilantro and peppers. To the right, a shredded carrot salad that was really good, with a hint of something acidic but not enough for me to identify it (lemon juice?), and big round slices of some kind of watery-tasting radish. In the center was a huge pile of thinly sliced lamb with hot sauce and yogurt. Under the lamb, swimming in the yogurt and sauce, were these spongy, chewy squares that I couldn't identify until Todd said they were toasted pita, and then it was obvious (a great texture). About $45 for two main courses and two drinks, but you could almost get away with just a starter and one main for two (I took home more of my dinner than I ate at the restaurant). I thought I didn't really like lamb until I tried this; it had a hint of that lamby-gamey taste, but just enough to be nice. Good stuff.

Just clicked through to your very nice blog from another one (the blogosphere is so cool!) and was happily reading when I must have said out loud        \"mmm that sounds good\".  My husband asked what I was talking about.  When I said \"sour cherry oven pancake\" he said, \"mmm that does sound good\".  

So guess what we're having this weekend?

Here's a tale of the pointlessness of going to Key Foods on a Sunday afternoon: I had intended to make chimichurri, shrimp and asparagus (I know, but I had some great asparagus in early December from the grocery - sweet, asparagusy), a pistou for vegetable soup. I guess it's winter, and I was thinking spring. No basil, only the saddest-looking curly-leaf parsley, no shrimp, moldy asparagus. It was almost comical.

Using a recipe from Molly Katzen's Sunlight Cafe as inspiration, I made Chai-spiced oatmeal for breakfast this morning. I had bought cardamom pods to make Chai tea this winter and forgot all about them, so that's next, but here's an interesting spin on the plain old bowl of oatmeal (I loved it): Combine 1 cup milk, 1/2 cinnamon stick, 2 crushed cardamom pods, 4 cloves, a pinch of salt and a grating of fresh nutmeg in a small saucepan and heat almost to a boil, until steam is coming off it, the edges are getting bubbly and the center kind of starts to undulate. Turn off the heat and steep for 15 minutes, then use a slotted spoon to strain out the big spices. Then add about a tablespoon of honey (I used strong buckwheat honey, which I love, although Katzen's recipe called for light honey) and turn the heat back on medium-low. Sprinkle in 3/4 cup oats and stir. Cook for 8 minutes or until the oatmeal is a consistency you like. I added more honey at this point because it wasn't quite sweet enough for me. It makes 2 kind of small servings. The taste is almost the way perfume or flowers smell, warm and spicy, and there's a nice rough and creamy texture, since I used a higher ratio of oats to liquid than is usually recommended (thanks, Lael, for the tip).

I went to the grocery store last night with $7 in my pocket and the idea that I wanted to make soup with the can of chickpeas I had at home. I had looked at a couple of recipes for Moroccan-style soups, but most had squash or raisins or something else Todd doesn't like. So I bought a can of stewed tomatoes and a box of frozen chopped spinach (I also had to buy milk and I found ladyfingers to make something that's closer to real tiramisu). The resulting soup was pretty good; I intend to make it again so I will record faithfully exactly what I did last night, even though I don't think all the ingredients/steps are absolutely necessary (ie the bouillon cube, the Italian-flavored stock, etc). I sauteed one small diced onion, then added a large minced garlic clove and a sprinkling of cayenne for heat. Poured in a can of Italian-seasoned chicken broth (the 15-ounce-ish size), a big can (28 ounces) of stewed tomatoes, chopped up and with their juice, a couple cups of water and a bouillon cube. Also added a bay leaf, some oregano and a cinnamon stick (crucial to the final flavor). Let that bubble for 10 minutes, then added half a package of frozen chopped spinach and a regular-size can of chickpeas. At this point I added another shot of cayenne (I used this instead of ground chipotle because it seems like cayenne is more pure heat, which I wanted, and I didn't want the deep flavor of chipotle to overpower the cinnamon, which was a distinctive but not entirely recognizable flavor). Heated and served with bread to sop up the juice.

Happy Birthday to you! I have a best friends who's birthday is today too. She is 44 today.

I know your situation because I am in the same one - have a son who we don't leave to any babysitter. Since we moved here, we haven't gotten one local babysitter. Only when his grandma visits to we go out anywhere without him. He is 9. 

My birthday was spent at home too - I made my own birthday cake - an Ebingers Black Out Cake - and my hubby brought home chinese food and flowers.

So, happy birthday! I  hope hubby comes home with really good goodies from Cupcake Cafe and some flowers or a great gift.

This Vietnamese restaurant is at 9th Avenue and 20th Street, so it's relatively close to the Charles Cowles gallery, where we went last night to shake hands with a photographer Todd really likes, Edward Burtinsky (I really like him, too, but Todd's the photo junkie). I'd never had Vietnamese before so it seemed like a good time to try it. The place isn't well-marked (in fact, I never found the name of the place anywhere on the storefront), but I had read somewhere that it was the shop with palm trees or ferns or something out front, which is how we identified it. It's kind of too cool for us, with an entirely glass front, waitstaff all in black and a little square pot of live grass and candles on every table, but the staff didn't come across as haughty or anything. We arrived around 7 and it was about 1/3 full, but by the time we left they were busy. The wine I had, a riesling-type white, was sharp and flavorful, perfect for the spicy food. I had barbecued pork, which came in a bowl of brothy sauce, with piles of lettuce and thin noodles on the side. I don't know how I was supposed to eat it, but I ate the pork, sometimes with the lettuce, then dipped the noodles in the sauce left in the bowl (the sauce was really good, salty and meaty). We also split an order of tuna summer rolls with cilantro and a salty, spicy dipping sauce. Looked at the dessert menu, but nothing sounded quite enticing enough. I kind of wanted to try ginger flan, because it sounded kind of odd, but Todd wanted the chocolate mousse cake (boring) so we opted for nothing. (He said whatever I wanted was fine, but I really wasn't that interested. What a shock.)

The last week in January is Restaurant Week, where participating restaurants around the city serve $20.04 prix fixe lunches and $30.04 dinners. I'm not a huge fan of prix fixe to begin with, and I've had some not-so-good Restaurant Week lunches. Maybe it's the places I've chosen. I know I had a great meal at Molyvos, but it wouldn't have cost me a whole lot more to just pay the a la carte prices. Are there good meals to be had during Restaurant Week? Are there places you can go where you don't feel like a schmuck for order the prix fixe? Is it too late to get a reservation at said places? A lot of times the dishes just seem kind of assembly line to me, more so than usual. I've gotten so I don't even participate anymore. The winter Restaurant Week usually happens just before my birthday, and I tend to view that as a hassle; I have this idea that reservations are more difficult to get because of it.

Hey now. It's not nice to get a girl's hopes up and then dash them like that. (Although we are early eaters, or used to be.)

I've discovered I'm kind of ambivalent about Gramercy and Union Square Cafe, anyway. They're held up at these dining pinnacles, and I can't imagine the experience could possibly live up to my expectation. Maybe I'll just admire them from afar, allowing myself to still imagine that there are places where the food is always transporting, the waitstaff always courteous and helpful.

I attempted tiramisu last night. I say attempted because I couldn't find ladyfingers and ended up using Stella Dora cookies that are shaped like ladyfingers, which made an entirely different animal altogether. I knew I didn't have the right kind of cookie, though, so I only made a half-batch. I'll spend more time looking for real ladyfingers later, which should improve my results immensely. First I whipped 8 ounces mascarpone with 1/2 cup powdered sugar, 1 cup heavy cream and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract. Then I placed 5 of the cookies side by side on a platter, brushed them liberally and repeatedly with a mixture of strong coffee and kahlua, then added a layer of the mascarpone mixture. Repeated the layers once, then dusted the whole thing with cocoa powder. I think it would've worked better if I had soaked the cookies in the coffee mixture instead of brushing them. Another option, the one in the recipe I used, is to make a sponge cake in a jelly roll pan (but I didn't feel like doing that last night). I have about half the mascarpone mixture left over. I think I may make the sponge cake, then cut rounds to fit in my ramekins and make individual tiramisu with that.

I've never used heavy cream; The recipes I've used call for separated eggs (cream the yolks with sugar, beat in mascarpone, fold in beaten egg whites).  I'm with you on soaking the cookies though.  The \"authentic\" recipes tell you to just brush them, but I don't mind them being a little sodden so long as the coffee flavor is there to cut through the richness of the filling.

The line at our local gourmet-ish grocery store, Natural, forms right in front of the deli counter and sometimes snakes back through the refrigerated dairy aisle. Yesterday when Todd and I stopped by for a few things, the line was all the way to the back wall of the store, blocking access not only to the deli but also to the milk, eggs, cheese and refrigerated tubes of pizza crust (if they even carry it), which is what I was after. So instead I picked up some yeast, deciding to make my own pizza crust. Which is what I did. I'm still astonished that I can casually decide to make pizza crust and just do it. And it only took about 1 1/4 hour, including the first rise. I think I'm ready to graduate to more advanced yeast-based recipes, like bread (I know, bread's not really advanced, but I'm kind of scared of yeast, so I'm taking baby steps). Deb's bread always turns out so beautiful, so maybe I'll try a recipe from Deb's blog.

I commend you for making your own pizza dough, but did you know as another alternative you can buy unbaked dough from a pizzeria? In fact, just last week I purchased a large dough for $2.50 from Nick's (one of the best pizza places in NYC), conveniently located across the street from Natural.
Kim
2004-01-05 16:14:00
I love Nick's. How do you bake the pizza when you get it home? Do you get similar results to Nick's crust?

Do you just drop by, or do you have to call them ahead of time?
Deb

You don't need to call ahead. I just walked right in.  They will give it to you right away, coated in flour or in oil and in a to-go tin. I actually didn't make pizza, but used the dough to make focaccia (approx. 15 minutes at 450 degrees), so whether a pizza would come out as good at home is still an unknown. The focaccia came out very nicely (will post soon).

I think it's conceivable that you could replicate Nick's crust at home since they use a gas oven, but of course the temperature of their oven is likely much, much higher than anything you could achieve with an oven at home. I would think baking a pizza at at 450 to 500 degrees for 10 minutes or so would work, or just following the baking directions of any other pizza recipe.

Looking forward to hearing how the homemade dough turns out.

I did get a pasta maker for Christmas, so we had homemade pasta on New Year's eve. It's the third time I've made fresh pasta, including the class I took, and I'm beginning to be convinced that it wasn't just beginner's luck; it is very easy to do, and somewhat difficult to mess up. The recipe I use is 2 1/2 cups flour in a bowl, then you break up three eggs and mix it with some salt in a smaller bowl. Pour the eggs into a well in the center of the flour, then use a fork to incorporate the eggs and flour. Knead for a few minutes, then wrap in plastic and put it in the fridge for at least half an hour to relax (it's much easier to roll out that way). Meanwhile I sauteed some Italian sausage and garlic and added some tomatoes and oregano. Let that bubble while I filled the Dutch oven with water, put it over heat to come to a boil, and rolled out the pasta. To use the machine, I cut the dough in quarters, then flatten a quarter into a long oval. Feed it through the machine on 1 first, maybe a couple of times, then progress up through all the settings, running the dough through each setting at least once. When we reached setting 5 (my machine goes to 9), we put it through the linguine setting. It takes about 3 minutes to cook. I had to boil it in two batches, removing the first batch from the water and putting it into the pan with the sausage and tomatoes (so it could soak up all the tomato juices, although I'm not sure fresh pasta soaks up sauce like dried does). It was good stuff. The noodles were really long, which reminded me that for Chinese New Year (I think) people eat long noodles, maybe for longevity? That's the story I'm going with for my extra-long linguine on New Year's eve. Maybe it'll be a new tradition. It took three of us to make the noodles (although I think you could do it alone).

I did get a pasta maker for Christmas, so we had homemade pasta on New Year's eve. It's the third time I've made fresh pasta, including the class I took, and I'm beginning to be convinced that it wasn't just beginner's luck; it is very easy to do, and somewhat difficult to mess up. The recipe I use is 2 1/2 cups flour in a bowl, then you break up three eggs and mix it with some salt in a smaller bowl. Pour the eggs into a well in the center of the flour, then use a fork to incorporate the eggs and flour. Knead for a few minutes, then wrap in plastic and put it in the fridge for at least half an hour to relax (it's much easier to roll out that way). Meanwhile I sauteed some Italian sausage and garlic and added some tomatoes and oregano. Let that bubble while I filled the Dutch oven with water, put it over heat to come to a boil, and rolled out the pasta. To use the machine, I cut the dough in quarters, then flatten a quarter into a long oval. Feed it through the machine on 1 first, maybe a couple of times, then progress up through all the settings, running the dough through each setting at least once. When we reached setting 5 (my machine goes to 9), we put it through the linguine setting. It takes about 3 minutes to cook. I had to boil it in two batches, removing the first batch from the water and putting it into the pan with the sausage and tomatoes (so it could soak up all the tomato juices, although I'm not sure fresh pasta soaks up sauce like dried does). It was good stuff. The noodles were really long, which reminded me that for Chinese New Year (I think) people eat long noodles, maybe for longevity? That's the story I'm going with for my extra-long linguine on New Year's eve. Maybe it'll be a new tradition. It took three of us to make the noodles (although I think you could do it alone).

I have made a Cuban before but I hate Swiss cheese! So, I use any other type that I have on hand but leave the rest of the sandwich the same. Comes out quite delicious. I don't have a sandwich press either, or a panini grill, but I do have quite a large George Foreman Grill and it works very well. I find I have to open and shut it twice - use it twice - to get the sandwich as crispy as you can get it at a restaurant.

I have had real Cuban sandwiches - there is a truck that sits in the Pocono Bazaar, which is an outdoor flea market in Marshalls Creek, PA that serves those sandwiches. They are incredible. They are delicious. I just ignore the fact that I am eating Swiss Cheese. The pickles seem to take away from that flavor so I don't mind it as much. Even with this knowledge, I still find I cannot buy Swiss Cheese, and use it in one of those sandwiches. Also, you have to have the right bread. I make my own Cuban Bread if I'm going to make one of these. 

I'm glad you find these as good as I do. Have one with a Cuban coffee and all is right with the world.

This is a cookbook Todd's mom gave me for Christmas. His great-aunt Trudy won it when she was 13, in 1925, for a recipe for split-pea soup that she has written in the back. The recipes are interesting, odd and kind of vague (recipes don't specify an oven temperature, just saying \"a hot oven\" or \"moderate oven\"). There are lots of ingredients I've never heard of or never used: Porto [sic] Rico molasses, sweetbreads (two recipes for sweetbread and cucumber salad), aspic, tongue, chaud-froid, croquettes, coupes, baskets, creamed vegetables, mutton, mincemeat and puddings. In fact, lots of everything. The recipes are really short, and the book is more than 700 pages. They're written in sort of a backward manner that I find myself using when I'm in a hurry, with lots of steps and important information relegated to a sentence clause. Here's a recipe for curried vegetables: Cook one cup each potatoes and carrot, and one-half cup turnip, cut in fancy shapes, in boiling salted water until soft. Drain, add one-half cup canned peas, and pour over a sauce made by cooking two tablespoons butter with two slices onion five minutes, removing onion, adding two tablespoons flour, three-fourths teaspoon salt, one-half teaspoon curry powder, one-fourth teaspoon pepper, few grains celery salt, and pouring on gradually one cup scalded milk. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley. Other recipes have ingredients lists, and the best part about the book is where someone has made notes: how to halve a recipe for Cottage Pudding, \"Nancy List made for Donna's dinner 8/29/86\" next to Snow Pudding I. Don't know if I'll cook from it, but it's fun to read. I like the recipe style; I imagine it's written for women who knew their way around a kitchen.

that's my favourite way of cooking.
making something out of seemingly nothing.
in our household this regularly translates as omelettes.
I think I could write a book on omelette fillings!

Todd and I spent five days with my parents for Christmas this year, and I spent a lot of time baking \"with\" my mom. I put \"with\" in quotes because my mom does not like to cook or bake. The first time this was really driven home was when we set out to make peanut blossoms. (The recipe we used came out kind of crumby, so I won't transcribe it here; my mom couldn't remember which recipe she's used in the past. Even though they were tasty and did disappear, we decided that next time we'll use the recipe on the Hershey's Kisses package.) She got a phone call around the time we started rolling cookies and abandoned me. Next was the lemon poppyseed bread that she wanted to make for friends. I made it while she was out shopping. (And forgot to put the poppyseeds in the dough, so I sprinkled them on top. They were mini loaves so it didn't matter much.) Even Christmas day she managed to be out of the kitchen for a good portion of the time, setting up the tables and tracking down cutlery and tablecloths. (I may have lost it a little bit right before dinnertime on Christmas day. I guess I can't stand the heat sometimes.) The thing is, she knows I love to do this stuff, and I always volunteer. I guess I've read too many of those stories, where the writer reminisces about standing on a stool next to his/her mother, elbow-deep in flour, cutting out cookies, beating butter, sneaking a bit of the dough or licking the beaters. I've idealized baking with someone, so I strive for that Norman Rockwell picture. When I think about it, though, I realize I kind of got that this year. In our own less-than-perfect way, my family spent a lot of time together in the kitchen: gossiping over a second glass of wine with my parents, complaining with my brother while he assembles the vegetable tray (which I call \"crudité\" to my family's amusement), making coffee with my dad in the early morning, talking with my mom as we prep about what a great cook her mother was (my mom's mom got sick when I was very young, so all I remember is a wheelchair-bound grandma who always gave me bubble bath for Christmas and loved Lawrence Welk - the bubbles from the show and my bath seem to be linked in my memory). It was a good holiday. I love this stuff.

The liquid that the meat gave off may have been due to overcrowding the meat in the pan.  You should have browned the meat in smaller batches so that the cubes don't touch each other as they brown.  2 cups of red wine would probably have been too much wine, especially for a quick stew.  I think your use of a little wine vinegar was a great substitute for the acid of the wine. Next time use it earlier in the recipe to deglaze the pan and to let the acid work on the meat longer.  Good job!

Todd and I went out of town for Christmas this year, so instead of schlepping all our gifts for each other, we had our own little pre-Christmas Christmas this morning. And I got some new toys. But first I want to mention that I made vegetable soup for dinner last night, and while peeling carrots and potatoes with my 8-inch chef's knife I yelled to Todd, who was playing games in the living room, \"I don't suppose you got me a peeler for Christmas this year, because if you did you should give it to me now.\" Well, not only did he give me a peeler, which he did not break out last night, but he also gave me a Microplane, which is awesome. We have a Christmas morning tradition of hard meats, cheeses, rolls and clementines for breakfast, kind of a mini smorgasbord. But this year Todd really wanted proscuitto and parmesan reggiano (an Italian smorgasbord?). So when I opened up the Microplane, I was grating everything: the clementine peel (who even knew you could grate such a thin peel), the cheese. It really is the best grater ever. Todd bought it, along with the peeler, a funnel and a madeline pan, at this restaurant supply store on 17th street near Union Square (Broadway Restaurant Supply). He said it was not even expensive.

Welcome to the car-driving club, Kim, and good luck finding parking! I'll start with Queens and work my way outwards:

Sapori D'Ischia in Woodside, Queens, has an excellent supply of cheeses, cured meats, pastas, and other specialty products from Italy.

Despana Brand Foods on Northern Boulevard in Jackson Heights has a small, but good selection of products from Spain.
http://www.thefoodsection.com/foodsection/2003/10/source_despana_.html

A car makes it much easier to transport the fine beers at Park Slope's Bierkraft and Cobble Hill's American Beer Distributing Company. 

Patel Brothers on 74th Street in Jackson Heights is a giant Indian supermarket. They have the largest supply of packaged flatbreads I have ever seen.

If you are in Long Island, there's a supermarket-size Fairway.

If you are in New Jersey, National Wholesale Liquidators, strangely enough, operates the International Food Warehouse, which has a huge selection of ethnic foods. Here's an account: http://www.chowhound.com/dinner/dinner.html

Also in NJ, Wegman's (there's one on the way to Princeton) is the biggest supermarket I have ever seen. Nothing particularly unique about it, but it is a sight to see when Key Food and C-Town are the norm.

I live in San Fran area and we are so spoiled!  But one thing we don't have is your high-quality Greek stores.  We are Greek and adore some of the stores on Ditmars. There's one--If I remember--called Angelo's. So nice that it is not all chains yet in that area. There is a HUGE Greek grocery at 31st st near Astoria Bl, just off the elevated line. Olives are out of this world.  Try the ones from Crete!

(I've tried a couple that have failed completely, a problem I never had with Cooking Light.) I'm thinking maybe Food and Wine would be a good one to try for a while, and I've signed up for two free issues of Real Simple. (The deal is supposed to be that I get to try the first two issue and then, if I'm not happy, I can write cancel on the bill and never pay a thing. But they have yet to send me my two trial issues buy have already sent me two bills. It's so aggravating. It's like they've scammed me into a subscription that I'm not sure I want.

I adore my subscription to SAVEUR, I'm often inspired by the recipes and love the laid back approach to the whole magazine. I also love The magazine of La Cucina Italiana, there's always something in each issue I'd like to try and I like the wine articles too. Those are my top 2 favorites, and the ones that I wouldn't let my subscription lapse on.
I used to subscribe to Gourmet years and years ago, even back then the recipes were over the top and required specialized ingredients that cost a fortune, I finally decided it wasn't for me,  really haven't missed it either.

I can tell you that food & wine's site (foodandwine.com) is MUCH better than Bon Appetit's (epicurious.com) -- and all recipes (I think) from both magazines are available at their respective sites -- so you might want to browse for some recipes and both and see if any of what you see grabs your fancy.

I have a copy of Bon Appetit at home and was on the verge of signing up for that, but I can't help but think it's not much different from Gourmet. 

I did subscribe to Cooks Illustrated for a while, but I usually found the recipes so daunting. (It was great reading material, and I learned a lot, but I can't think of one recipe I used in the year I had it.) Now that I'm a little more experienced at cooking, maybe I'd be more likely to use the recipes.

I know it's bad, but I used two convenience foods to make apple turnovers this morning and was pretty happy with the results (although I do think the filling could be improved upon with fresh apples sauteed with butter, brown sugar and spices, but then you lose the 5-minute prep time). The magazine I work for has a 1-2-3 dessert feature, and that's where this comes from (with my own modifications). It's one of those refrigerated pie crusts and apple pie filling. The crust is folded in fourths when you buy it, so you just tear it into quarters along those lines, put some filling on each quarter, sprinkle it with cinnamon and freshly ground nutmeg, then fold the crust over the filling and press closed with the tines of a fork. Cut some vents in the top of each and bake in a 450-degree oven about 10 minutes (mine took 13 minutes). I think those pie crusts are much, much better than anything I can make from scratch. I'm working on that; I think it's going to take a lot of practice for me to perfect pie crusts. These refrigerated crusts almost make me wonder why I should bother, though.

We haven't gone to the grocery store in ages (we've been out of milk all week) so I was really scraping the bottom of the barrel when I made dinner tonight. I had old, old, old carrots and celery (which was mostly leaves), a leek, garlic, chicken stock and some bread left over from a takeout dinner on Wednesday. So I made \"vegetable\" soup (it was very green). Chopped up the celery stalks and the leaves separately, and sauteed the stalks with carrots, leeks and garlic in a Dutch oven, then added chicken stock, water, a diced potato, salt, pepper and the celery leaves. Simmered until the potato was tender. It was pretty good, with pronounced celery, leek and garlic flavor fighting for prominence. Cut the bread in half lengthwise, broiled it, then put some shredded Parmesan on top and put it back under the broiler until the cheese was crusty. I just love the challenge of making dinner out of nothing. It's like Gordon Elliot's Doorknock Dinners. There are some nights any chef would be hard-pressed to make something from the contents of my fridge. But I feel inspired by the challenge. Now I'm in the worst position, though. A completely empty fridge, which means complete freedom to make whatever I want (since I'm going to the grocery store). This is when I spend hours flipping through cookbooks, never settling on anything.

So I didn't win my first baking contest, where I entered my chocolate-dipped coconut macaroons. (Sniff.) The really sad thing is that the recipe I made only made 18 cookies, and I had to give them 12, I gave one away, and Todd and I ate two right after they were baked, so I only have three left. (I guess that could be a good thing, too. Wouldn't want to get sick of them.) The good news is that my friend, Julie, did. She won in the most creative category, for chocolate sandwich cookies with peppermint filling. She got the recipe for the chocolate part from epicurious.com (the Dark Chocolate Cookies recipe, but she chilled the dough until it was firm enough to roll into balls), then made the peppermint filling with a combination of peppermint extract, confectioners' sugar and a tiny bit of cream (it was thick enough that she could roll it in a ball then flatten it). The thing that put her into the winners' circle, though, was that she placed a small star-shaped cookie cutter on top of the assembled cookie, then dusted it with confectioners' sugar to make a pattern. Hooray Julie!

Sorry you didn't win, Kim. You did say you had to compete with a bunch of equally talented bakers so even though your macaroons were scrumptious I'm sure, the choice was probably hard to make for the jury! Better luck next time!

That's what I was this weekend. Yesterday, the failed brownie recipe (which was from a site I had never visited before, my bad). Then a devil's food cake with Cointreau-spiked whipped cream to take to dinner instead of the brownies. But today was the big baking day. I made all three cookies shown: chocolate-dipped coconut macaroons, almond macaroons and cinnamon-hazelnut biscotti. The coconut macaroons were supposed to be for the cookie contest at work (more on that later), but when I got home from the store I realized I didn't buy enough coconut. So I sent Todd up to the convenience store, instructing him not to go all the way to the grocery store even if he didn't find coconut at the convenience store (it was snowing, and I could just make half of a recipe). Yet I had such faith in Todd's ability to find coconut that I started separating all the eggs for the cookies. So when he came home without coconut, I had two extra egg whites, and that's where the almond macaroons came in. Then I was on a roll, so I made the biscotti. (I'm planning to give out treats at work.) The problem is, I still don't have anything I'm 100 percent happy with for the contest. The chocolate on the macaroons melts at a warm room temperature, the biscotti has the same chocolate and the almond macaroons aren't that exciting. I think they're my choice right now, though. I'll probably change my mind before tomorrow morning. Or right now. Maybe I'll risk the coconut ones (they're awesome, if a little melty).

Hi Kim-
Your cookies look wonderful. I especially like the way the biscotti turrned out. I've always had trouble slicing mine so that they turn out looking like yours. I always end up with chubby little versions of the long cookie. Is there a technique to how you slice them?

I've only used one basic recipe for biscotti, from Cooking Light, and varied it in different ways. The batter turns out really sticky and kind of thin, so I tend to form it into two wide slabs instead of logs, which is where the length comes from (when I slice them crosswise). The loaves turn out so wide that just slice them straight across (not diagonal). I know it's not the way it's supposed to work, but it works for me.

One of my coworkers says she gets a letter when someone tries a recipe from the magazine and it doesn't work. Often this reader wants the money she spent on ingredients to be reimbursed by the magazine (which the magazine doesn't do). I always scoffed at these readers, but now at least I can sympathize with the sentiment (although I still would never expect such a thing). I printed out a recipe from another blog this morning, for caramel-topped brownies, and really ended up with a stinker. I think the problem was that the instructions said to use a 9-inch square baking pan, but I noticed later at the end of the recipe \"makes 50 brownies.\" So I'm thinking it should have been baked in a 9 x 13-inch pan. The pan was really full, and the brownies took 20 minutes longer to bake than they should have (by that time, the caramel layer had both burned and oozed into the brownie layer, making a big mush). I have no idea how the recipe would have turned out if the instructions had specified the correct pan size, but I'll never know (I actually had to throw it out). I'm too mad about wasting all of my nuts, vanilla, butter, eggs, chocolate, etc. to give it another go. So I want to apologize to anyone who might have tried cooking (particularly baking) anything from here and got bad results because I transcribed something wrong. My mom calls me every once in a while to say, \"I don't understand. Your site says to (fill in blank with one of my silly mistakes).\" I am grateful for the constructive criticism. I'm a copy editor in my day job so, while the blog is an attempt to escape that for a little while, I can appreciate the benefit of a second pair of eyes reading things, especially recipes.

I just had the most terrible moment of doubt reading the opening lines of your entry, thinking \"oh my oh my, I hope it's not one of my recipes\"!!! Followed by a sigh of relief : I don't have a caramel brownie recipe. 

But, just like you, I truly hope nobody ever wastes good ingredients on a recipe of mine, so I'm extra careful when transcribing them, but you can never be 100% sure!

My biggest fears about posting recipes on my site is that someone will either hate it once they've tried it or I will botch up the instructions and end up ruining someones cooking experience.
I try to be sooo careful when posting and yet, sometimes, I still leave something out. I got an email the other day from someone who wanted to try a recipe I posted a year ago and they told me I had left out how many eggs to use. yikes!

Todd's holiday party for work was last night, and one of the appetizers was wedges of apple tart. It wasn't anything like what I expected, though - it was savory instead of sweet. It had a crust like a pizza and included some kind of cheese. I think it could be great with some brie or other mild, silky cheese (it could have been brie). Maybe add some pepper and thyme? I wonder if I'll ever get a chance to experiment. (I think it's a little too weird of a combination for those I cook for, so I'd end up eating it all myself.)

I threw together dinner last night and it turned out pretty good. I coated strips of chicken (the package said for stir-fry) first in egg white, then in almond meal seasoned with salt, pepper and fresh thyme, sage and rosemary. Let it rest for a while, so the egg white can dry out a little (I think it helps the coating adhere), then panfried it. I could find a hundred uses for this almond meal. And I hate to admit it, but fresh herbs are definitely worth the trouble/expense. Argh. It's so much easier to reach for a jar of dried. I'm still a proponent of dried spices, though.

Is almond meal the same as powdered almonds, you think, or is it more of an almond *flour*? In any case, this sounds unusual and great, and would probably be fantastic with fish, too : trouts are often served with toasted slivered almonds.

And I have to agree about the fresh herbs. They're something of a pain (they're yet another ingredient to think about buying, and then they end up just collecting mold in the fridge) but they make all the difference in the world!

I'm not sure what the difference between almond flour and powdered almonds is. This is just almonds, but they're ground so fine that it's like flour (actually, probably more like cornmeal). I saw a recipe for cookies made with ground almonds and hazelnuts, then sandwiched together with chocolate, on another blog. Sounds good. My problem this time of year is deciding what to make among all the good cookies out there.

I've bitten off more than I can chew (hahaha) in the holiday baking/candy making category, I think. We're sending a package off to Todd's sister and her family tomorrow, so I baked a batch of Italian wedding cookies to send in that (I'm going to have to make another batch I think, because they were good; I used the almond flour I bought recently at Trader Joe's), and then I made lemon-rosemary mini bundts (which I froze for gifts) and orange-chocolate truffles. Next weekend I want to make shortbread for one coworker, another cookie as a contest entry and chocolate-and-caramel covered matzo. I'm thinking maybe cinnamon and hazelnut biscotti or chocolate crinkles for my contest entry, but I don't know. I can't decide whether I should steer clear of chocolate. (If the judges are eating lots of chocolate cookies, will they get sick of it?) If I went with my own nostalgic favorite I'd do peanut butter blossoms (the one with the Hershey's kiss inside), although my mom used to make them, a long time ago, with these starburst-shaped chocolates instead. They're always the first cookies gone. The truffles I made today didn't turn out very pretty. It's more of a trick than the recipe intimates to get them round. Mine looked like little chocolate rocks, all different shapes. Toward the end I realized that you have more control when you move the truffle from one spoon to another. REALLY rich, too. The ones I made had some Cointreau in them.

There are five categories: best tasting, best looking, best bars, most original and best intentioned. I don't think I should go for best looking, because I'm not an aesthetic perfectionist. Todd's been pressing me to make Nanaimo Bars, which are layered bar cookies with a cookie layer, custard layer and a layer of chocolate on top. I'm thinking something simpler, though. Maybe a Mexican wedding cookie. This weekend I'm hoping to make lemon-rosemary bundt cakes and truffles. It's snowing buckets right now, so it'll be a good weekend for indoor activities. Don't forget to send me your award-winning cookie recipes, though. I can tell I'm going to make myself crazy trying to figure out what to enter.

Oooh a contest! Exciting! I would enter it too, if only there was one - there's just 9 of us in the company, and I'm guessing there may be about two of us who ever made a cookie at all! Do you have to choose the category you want to shoot for, or do you just enter and they can select you for any category?

I'm not sure what to recommend, the vanilla pecan squares I made recently (to be found on my blog) were good and original, but I don't know if they're contest-winning material!

In any case, good luck!

I'm pretty sure you just enter your cookies and the judges choose the category winners from all the entries. (Except for the bar cookies category, which makes me think bar cookies may be the way to go: That way you have a shot at all five categories.) There are lots of fantastic bakers with classic family recipes on staff, so I'm not getting my hopes up.

I'll check out your recipe. A nut-based cookie sounds like a good idea.

I made the cover recipe from the new issue of Everyday Food, and it smelled awesome when we took it out of the pan (the topping is made by coating the pan liberally with butter - 2 tablespoons - then adding 1/2 cup sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon and 1/4 teaspoon allspice, then putting a single layer of fresh cranberries on top of that; then you put the batter on top and bake it). Suddenly the apartment was filled with the warm, spicy scent of holiday baking. It was like the instant the Grinch hears the Whovillians singing and his heart grows bigger: I'm in the Christmas spirit. I was actually cheerful walking to work in the bitter cold this morning. We're going to eat it tonight, so I'll let you know how it tasted (and post the batter recipe if it turns out to be good).

This was pretty good. I liked the cranberry topping, even though it's not the prettiest thing (it ends up being kind of a red mush on top of the cake, which is a pretty, vivid color but not visually appealing texture-wise). The cake was a good foil to the tart topping, bland and sweet, but not the best texture. It was almost too light, making the cake top-heavy. If I made this again I might use the same topping but try to find a denser cake.

This is not to say we haven't enjoyed it.

The last time I made this recipe some friends invited us over to their house for the afternoon just as I was putting it in the oven, so I transferred it all to a slow-cooker and turned it on low. This time I followed the recipe and cooked it in my Dutch oven in the oven. It was a little more solid this time, could be sliced instead of falling into shreds, but still tender and good (in the slow cooker the roast falls apart). Heat some oil in the Dutch oven, then add some butter and 2 large onions, sliced thin. Cook over medium-high heat until soft, then lower heat and cook another 10 minutes, until the onions are caramelized. Pour in 1/2 cup balsamic vinegar, 1/4 cup white wine, 1/4 cup soy sauce, a couple tablespoons brown sugar, and salt and pepper and heat, scraping up brown stuff on the bottom of the pan. Add a 2-pound beef roast that you've trimmed the fat from (I don't know what cut I used, some kind of round?) and cover with the onions. Put in 350 degree oven for three hours, until it falls off the fork when you try to pick it up. The beef has a faint sweetness and is soft enough to bite and chew easily, even with thick slices. We ate it on sandwiches yesterday and it didn't even need condiments because the juice is so flavorful. (I shredded mine and Todd ate his in slices). The recipe goes on to refrigerate the liquid overnight, skim the solidified fat off the top, then reduce it into a syrupy liquid. Too much effort for a sauce, especially since the beef is pretty good on its own.

I made this last night for dinner and was pleased with the results. They were tender and almost fluffy, a little but not too chewy, with a good potato flavor. I can't wait to experiment with other varieties. The recipe called for 1 pound Yukon Gold potatoes boiled whole, but all I had was regular baking potatoes, so I cut them in quarters and boiled them for 20 minutes. Then I peeled them (while still hot) and put them through the medium size holes on my food mill. I mixed in two eggs, one at a time, then 1 cup flour, 1/2 cup first and then the rest gradually. I split the dough in half and, on a liberally floured surface, I rolled each half into a 1-inch-diameter log, which I then cut into 1/2-inch sections that I put in the fridge until the water was ready. Once the water was boiling, I dropped a few in, then fished them out when they floated to the top (less than a minute). Tossed it with asparagus, heavy cream, proscuitto and Parmesan. I have about half of them left uncooked, in the freezer for a future meal. Kind of a mess to make but so easy.

Hi,
I've been really enjoying your blog for several weeks now, and I just wanted to drop you a note to say so. I have a lot of spare time at work, and I've endlessly searched the web for good stuff to read, and this is one of my favorite food blogs. I had a question about the gnocchi- when you mix in the eggs with the potatoes, are the potatoes still warm? i'm never really sure what to do when i have to mix eggs with something hot- i don't want to accidentally cook the eggs, and i don't want what i'm working with to get too cold and unworkable.
sorry for the really long comment.
Kim
2003-12-02 17:06:00
I'm glad you like it. 

I had the same thought you did about adding eggs to warm potatoes. The potatoes are still kind of warm when you mix the egg in (I think they need to be, because you want to get all the benefit from the starch in them or something like that). But they cool off quite a bit while you're peeling, and then putting them through the food mill makes little worm-shaped potato, which cools off even faster. 

The short answer is, they didn't end up being hot enough to cook the egg. I put them in one at a time, and then I stirred it all up as soon as each one was in there. No cooked egg pieces at all.

The food story in tomorrow's New York Times magazine is about how chefs come up with specials, and it's really all the same things you always hear (which means it must be true): what's seasonal, available; happy delivery mistakes; and the one that can make you believe you shouldn't order the pot pie or soup special, because the chef's trying to pull a fast one on you by using up what didn't sell yesterday or the day before and calling it \"special.\" But that last one, and our empty refrigerator, made me realize something about myself: Given an empty refrigerator, my options of what to fix are only limited by what I can think up and afford, and that paralyzes me. I pile up cookbooks and food magazines on the sofa next to me and start flipping through them, stacking them up, open and facedown. Then I start going through a second time to make a list, and decide that what I have chosen isn't interesting enough, substantial enough, \"fall\" enough, healthy enough. I really go nuts. I guess that probably says a lot about me. But I do thrive on a produce drawer full of wilting greens and aging carrots, three-week-old gouda in the fridge, bones in the freezer, sprouting potatoes in the bin. I'm a pantry-forager, a scavenger. I'm inspired by what we have left, what we need to use before it goes bad, like chefs in the old days with their specials. But I think it's kind of like a sonnet: Rules and boundaries and restrictions take away some of your decisions, which gives you freedom to focus on the others, and come up with something truly spectacular. A few generations ago they did that out of necessity, to save money, which I still find can be a good reason for it. I have a coworker who always goes to her brother's for Thanksgiving, so the next day she and her husband roast their own turkey because they want to have the leftovers. I love that. Maybe next year I'll do it.

Went to a friend's mom's for Thanksgiving and brought this for dessert. I was calling it \"pot de creme\" becuase I thought it'd be too cumbersome to add the brulee topping at the mom's apartment and so wasn't going to add it. But once I had cooked the custards, the tops were kind of brown and unappealing-looking, so I called the friend, Julie, and she mentioned she had received a kitchen torch as a wedding present. So we busted it out after dinner; it was fun. Her husband and brother even came into the kitchen to watch and did a couple themselves. Once I got started on this recipe it ended up being so easy that it only took about 15 minutes of prep time. You put 2 cups heavy cream in a saucepan with 1/2 a vanilla bean that you split and scrape the seeds out of (seeds go into the cream, too). Heat that until the cream's bubbling where it touches the sides of the pan, then remove it from the heat. Meanwhile whisk 1 egg, 3 yolks and 7 tablespoons maple syrup (the recipe called for grade B, which is more flavorful, but all I had was grade A; I just measured a scant half-cup). Then slowly pour in the cream, whisking to keep it from cooking the eggs. Pour that mixture through a fine strainer into a container with a pouring spout. Place eight 4-ounce ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet, divide the mixture among the ramekins, place in a 325 degree oven and add hot water to the rimmed baking sheet to create a waterbath. It's supposed to take 40 minutes to cook. I turned on the convection feature, which the recipe said would take the same amount of time but would protect the custard from the direct heat coming from the bottom of the oven. When I checked on it after 35 minutes, the tops were getting brown and one of the custards was actually bubbling! I took them out right away, and the texture ended up being fine (except for the unsightly brown tops). But it freaked me out that I had ruined them. Put them in the fridge overnight (or at least two hours). Right before you're ready to serve, pat the moisture off the top, add about a tablespoon of sugar to the top of each one and spread evenly, then torch away (or put them under the broiler) until the top is brown and hard. I had put the 1/2 vanilla pod that got strained out of the cream mixture in a jarful of sugar, and that's the sugar we used for the brulee. The vanilla made it smell like we were toasting marshmallows as we torched the tops. It was good stuff, though. Silky with a crunchy top and a faint flavor of maple in the custard.

I love cherry chocolates so you can imagine how appealing this cake looks to me.  I am looking forward to eventually getting the recipe.  It is calorie free, right?

Maple Creme Brulee

Went to a friend's mom's for Thanksgiving and brought this for dessert. I was calling it \"pot de creme\" becuase I thought it'd be too cumbersome to add the brulee topping at the mom's apartment and so wasn't going to add it. But once I had cooked the custards, the tops were kind of brown and unappealing-looking, so I called the friend, Julie, and she mentioned she had received a kitchen torch as a wedding present. So we busted it out after dinner; it was fun. Her husband and brother even came into the kitchen to watch and did a couple themselves. Once I got started on this recipe it ended up being so easy that it only took about 15 minutes of prep time. You put 2 cups heavy cream in a saucepan with 1/2 a vanilla bean that you split and scrape the seeds out of (seeds go into the cream, too). Heat that until the cream's bubbling where it touches the sides of the pan, then remove it from the heat. Meanwhile whisk 1 egg, 3 yolks and 7 tablespoons maple syrup (the recipe called for grade B, which is more flavorful, but all I had was grade A; I just measured a scant half-cup). Then slowly pour in the cream, whisking to keep it from cooking the eggs. Pour that mixture through a fine strainer into a container with a pouring spout. Place eight 4-ounce ramekins on a rimmed baking sheet, divide the mixture among the ramekins, place in a 325 degree oven and add hot water to the rimmed baking sheet to create a waterbath. It's supposed to take 40 minutes to cook. I turned on the convection feature, which the recipe said would take the same amount of time but would protect the custard from the direct heat coming from the bottom of the oven. When I checked on it after 35 minutes, the tops were getting brown and one of the custards was actually bubbling! I took them out right away, and the texture ended up being fine (except for the unsightly brown tops). But it freaked me out that I had ruined them. Put them in the fridge overnight (or at least two hours). Right before you're ready to serve, pat the moisture off the top, add about a tablespoon of sugar to the top of each one and spread evenly, then torch away (or put them under the broiler) until the top is brown and hard. I had put the 1/2 vanilla pod that got strained out of the cream mixture in a jarful of sugar, and that's the sugar we used for the brulee.

We visited Todd's extended family in Seattle this weekend, and his aunt asked me to pull together this salad, which is a family favorite. I grew more and more skeptical as I assembled the ingredients and started making the dressing. It all comes together really well, though. (And apparently tastes even better the second day.) It's a head of broccoli cut into florets and 1/2 cup each cashews, dried cranberries and bacon all tossed together and then dressed with 3/4 cup mayonnaise mixed with 2 tablespoons red wine vinegar and 1/2 cup sugar. The dressing IS really sweet, but hold your criticism until you toss it with the broccoli mixture. It actually tastes great. (But who ever thought of putting these ingredients together?) One of Todd's cousins says she substitutes yogurt for some of the mayonnaise when she makes it, in order to not cancel out all the good effects of eating broccoli.

Have you ever had hot zabaglione? I actually thought it sounded kind of strange, a sauce made of egg yolks, sugar and marsala. It's whipped in a round-bottomed zabaglione pan (or the top of a double boiler) over gently boiling water until cooked. I was expecting something like custard, but it's much airier and tastes strongly of the wine. Palmira's serves it alone in a small wine glass, as well as with chocolate gelato with fruit. I had it alone last night when we ate here, which was the perfect introduction to it. It was a great way to squeeze in dessert after a big meal. The proprietors' daughter, Jennifer Desmond, had sent me some menus, and there were a number of appetizers, salads and desserts I wanted to try (including the zabaglione), but I actually ended up liking the entrees we had the best (granted, we didn't give them much chance to show off with the starter, since we order antipasti, which was good). We both ordered specials. Mine was rigatoni with duck ragu, which was exactly what I had been shooting for when I made ragu: super-rich, with this deep, meaty flavor. Todd had branzino, which seems to be their fish of choice, with oranges, tomatoes(?) and olives (very adventurous of Todd, but he really liked it). Todd doesn't usually like sweets except for dessert, but the flavors of the sauce were so well-balanced, the oranges were more acidic with just a hint of sweetness, cutting through the briney olives. I never would have found the restaurant on my own, but it's actually pretty easy to get to once you know it's there, especially if you're already downtown: one stop into Brooklyn on the 2 or 3 train, then get off at Clark Street and it's right around the corner, 41 Clark Street. The location kind of illustrates one of the strange things about New York: You can be so easy to get to, but if you're not right on a main street with lots of foot traffic, it's hard to fill seats. Palmira's is pretty big, with two main dining areas (they do host lots of parties, especially this time of year), and on a Thursday night it felt kind of empty. It seemed reasonably priced (we would have spent about $100 for antipasti, wine, beer, entrees, two desserts and coffee) with pretty good food. Everyone's friendly there, the service is good, the dining area is comfortable, which makes it feel like a neighborhood place that's still looking for its neighborhood.

Thanks for the review.  Got to admit that I live around the corner from the place, but the cavernous space and empty tables have kept me from going in.  Besides, I'm inordinately fond of Noodle Pudding's Italian fare right down Henry Street.  Guess I'm going to have to check it out and post a little review of my own.  If they are consistently good, it's a definite winner...

I just stopped by your site; you eat out a lot! Sounds like you try some pretty good places, too. If you go to Palmira's I'd like to hear what you think. It was a bit uncomfortable to eat in such an empty place, which does tend to affect the whole experience. 
I usually go to a different place every time I go out, so I've only been to Palmira's the one time (can't say anything about the consistency of the food at Palmira's).

Finally, a resturant that has staying power.  It's so much brighter and comfortable than the previous encounters.  The food is incredible, and yes, everyone is very accomodating.  You feel like you're out for a special occasion, but the check doesn't say that.  
I no longer live in brooklyn, but don't mind the drive.

I've eaten at Palmira's many times, and have found that it has only gotten better each time.  Everything over the last couple of months has improved dramatically -- the food, the service and the ambiance.  They also have a great wine list.  It is quite a large place, and it is a great place to have a party which we did about a month ago.  Everyone had a terrific time.  It certainly is worth a try.

I don't know what to call these, but I'm going to have to come up with something because I've made them about three times now (in the last two years), which makes them a part of my repertoire. I don't want to anger any barbecue fans by calling this barbecue (which is what the recipe calls them, even though they're not). It's just shredded chicken in a lot of really flavorful juice, which soaks into the toasted buns and makes everything tasty. You mix 1/4 cup brown sugar with a tablespoon chile powder, 2 teaspoons cumin, 1/2 teaspoon paprika and some salt and pepper, then you pat that all over about a pound of boneless chicken breasts. Heat oil in a pan, then cook the chicken 2 minutes on each side. Take the chicken out of the pan, add a thinly sliced onion, and cook the onion a couple minutes, stirring it around to get all the stuff that's left in the pan (there's a lot). Add the chicken back in, pour in 1 cup chicken broth, and simmer it all covered for 30 minutes. Take out the chicken and shred it, then add it back in and simmer to reduce the liquid, about 15 minutes. Serve on toasted buns. There's a recipe for quick pickled cucumber slices, but Todd doesn't like them, so we just use dill pickles or eat without.

You are right it doesn't fit the bbq sandwich standard of chopped, sliced or pulled meat,  in an up to 50/50 mixture of bbq sauce and other nonmeat substances. 

P.S. I would say, if pressed, call it a \"pulled chicken sandwich au jus.\"

The cake recipe is another one of those Cooking Light one-bowl recipes. I had made it right before everyone showed up so it would be warm, but it was actually better the second day, and even better the third (the spices almost seem to intensify).

I've noticed that even restaurant focaccia with a lot of veggies on it tends to be soggy and doughy. Less Is More. If you want veggies make pizza. (She said, never having baked with yeast in her life.)

But kudos to you for trying.
Luisa
2004-06-29 10:01:00
I think somewhat sticky or tacky dough is what focaccia dough is supposed to be like before you bake. My family in Italy, when not baking totally plain focaccia (plain except for salt and rosemary on top), plants a few cherry tomatoes here and there in the dough, but nothing else. So, why don't you try making the dough and baking it solo, and then roasting the vegetables separately and serving them with (on top or beside or inside) the focaccia after the baking?
Kim
2004-06-29 10:17:00
That is a terrific suggestion, Luisa. I really think the dough would have been right with a few alterations, and the veggies smelled good on their own, too.
Sandra
2004-06-30 11:17:00
Luisa's suggestion is great. I make a \"Cuban Pizza\" with a not-so-home-made crust and it works best if I bake the dough for about 5 minutes first. I add the toppings and then bake for another 10. That way the center is cooked but not browned and the edges have a chance to get crisp. Wes doesn't complain so it can't be that bad. 

Good luck next time (and yes, there should be a next time) :)

This time of year I always want to spend the weekend with a big, bubbling pot of something working away on the stovetop, so this weekend it was wild rice and smoked turkey soup. I love the chewiness of wild rice, and the faint smoke flavor from the turkey gives the soup a nice, warm fall taste. Saute 1 cup each diced carrots, yellow onion and green onion in a couple teaspoons butter for a few minutes, until the onion starts to get soft. Add 3 minced cloves garlic and some chopped dried rosemary, then add 1 cup wild rice, 4 cups chicken stock, about 1/2 pound diced smoked turkey (I had the deli give me one big slice) and pepper and simmer for a little over an hour, until the rice is cooked. Then whisk 1/3 cup flour into 2 3/4 cups milk and pour it into the soup. Simmer for about 8 minutes, until the soup starts to thicken, then add a couple teaspoons of sherry and some more black pepper and salt.

I keep forgetting to mention that we went to Daisy May's last week. I work at 50th and Broadway, so it's a bit of a trek, but Todd was at Javits for a photo show so I met him over there for lunch. I guess I've been holding off on writing this up because I don't know what to say. Todd was very unhappy with his meal and the price, but I think he's being unreasonable. (He's a Virgil's fan.) Three things I can say: There's no seating, so take it to go or eat standing up at a built-in ledge along the window (which didn't bother me); it's a lot of food, so you could get by for two people sharing one order of barbecue ($8) and a couple of small sides ($3 each); it's a great option, the best I know of, when you're trapped over at Javits for the day. Oh, and go for the ribs; even I wasn't all that impressed with the pulled-pork sandwich Todd ordered. But I liked the dry-rubbed ribs I had. They were this great texture, really pretty firm, but the meat still comes right off the bone when you bite into it, in shreds. Easy texture to handle with your fingers, but even the dry-rub was messy (I would be disappointed in it if it wasn't). We had mashed potatoes, which were overly buttery and a weird, lumpy-with-pools-of-runny texture, and Cheddar corn, which was really pretty great. Too much to finish on my own, though. I'd trek over there again for some more (without Todd, though). I'm pretty sure they deliver, too, so I may persuade some of my coworkers that we all want barbecue. Shouldn't be hard to do.

Mmmmmm...that sounds delicious! Now that we are out of the house my mom doesn't bake nearly as much. 
Now, my mom would cook- but she wouldn't allow us to cook- but your mom would!   I have so many memories of going to your house and spending hours in the kitchen making cookies (usually after convincing poor Chad to ride his bike to the store to get us the dough, which we would usually overeat before making any!)  Concoctions like Kraft Mac and Cheese with Spaghetti Sauce- we were usually cooking while eating our weight in chips and salsa. 
It was so wonderful to have an escape into such a relaxed environment- as I remember the only requirement was that we share with the rest of your family :)

Fired up the broiler for the first time last night (I'm running out of new features) to make a quick tuna melt: I mixed the rest of that olive-oil packed tuna with capers, celery, pepper and a little mustard to hold it together, then spread that over a piece of bread I had toasted under the broiler on the low setting (two broiler settings! who ever heard of such a thing?). Added some cheese to the top (roasted pepper would've been nice here, too), then put it back under the broiler until the cheese was getting blistery. Tuna melts are another thing I remember eating a lot of when I was a kid, which can make any food feel like comfort food. Ended the meal by making a stovetop rice pudding with some leftover rice, milk, sugar, cinnamon, a crushed cardamom pod, nutmeg and rose water (I was reaching for the vanilla when I noticed the rose water in my cupboard and thought that might give it an interesting twist - it did, although I think I may have added a little more than was necessary).

I gave my new tart pan a spin with a recipe I made from the Once Upon a Tart cookbook for a friend's fall-themed dinner party. Did NOT like the Once Upon a Tart crust at all (it was way too crumbly, and used about twice as much butter as any other recipe I saw), but the apples and custard were great (the custard itself takes on some apple flavor, and it was even better the second day), and I was really happy with how easy it was to use the pan. So first you make the crust and fit it into the pan (which I won't go into since I was so unhappy with the crust, except to say that it was really hard to work with, even though I opened the window so the apartment would be cold), then refrigerate it to firm it up. Meanwhile, slice the apples about 1/8 inch thick (I used 2 giants and 2 little apples, but I don't remember what the three different types were, and ended up with way too many apple slices). Arrange them in concentric rings, with the smaller apple slices inside. I used the rounded end slices to make a small design in the center. Then pour the custard (mix 1/3 cup sugar with 2 eggs until pale yellow, add 1/2 cup light cream, 1/2 cup milk and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract) over it and bake in a 375-degree oven for 1 hour 15 minutes. When I put the tart in, all the custard pooled at the front of the tart, so I put a little piece of foil under it to level it. Looks like we need to figure out how to adjust the feet to level the new oven. This is another place I strayed from the recipe. After 10 minutes the back of the crust was getting brown and the front was not, so I turned on my new convection oven feature. Forty minutes later the tart was done. The apples that stick up above the tart get a little burned, but it gives the whole thing a nice burnished look. Once the tart has cooled a little, brush it with some melted apricot jam. The tart leaked all over the oven floor during baking, so it looks like it's time to use the new oven's self-clean feature. I'm really breaking this thing in.

There was a moment last night when the excitement of my new oven really hit me (just this one more time, then I'll stop). The timer on my oven had gone off (I had set it for the minimum time), so I turned on the light (the light!) and could see that the brownies were still wet in the middle. When they finally were done and I opened the door (there's that light again!) and pulled the pan out, everything was so gleaming, bright and smooth and chocolatey smelling. It made me realize how dark and cavernous my old oven was. Anyway, the brownie recipe was from this great book I borrowed from someone here at work, BitterSweet by Alice Medrich. I had fallen in love with the book before I even tried a recipe (I want to try a couple more before I decide to buy one for myself). Each chapter has a long introduction, which is a mixture of what she learned from testing the recipes (in a very conversational way, though; not like a Cooks Illustrated scientific kind of approach), anecdotes about her life, history about the recipes in the chapter, the kinds of chocolate she uses. Almost all the recipes in her book include variations that use different types of chocolate, including chocolates with different percentages of chocolate liqueurs. Great explanations for why you use a certain technique and what each ingredient does.

What an oven!  As one of the appeciative co-workers to which Todd is referring, let me commend you on an extremely well-executed brownie.  I don't have much of a sweet tooth so can't claim to be an expert but, thanks to you, the office is now also \"gleaming, bright and smooth and chocolatey smelling\".  Delicious.  Thanks for sharing the bounty.

i admit i am hooked on walker eats, as much for the comforting tone as for the comfort food. and today i was presented with an absolute treat. i work with Kim's husband and he generously presented me with one of these brownies...holy cow! i must confess here that i am not supposed to eat sugar -- in fact much of my pleasure in reading the entries on this site is from vicarious enjoyment...but i couldn't resist and i ate a big bite of brownie. it was utterly delectable.

I have a new oven! It has a waist-high broiler (instead of a broiler drawer), a special high-powered burner and another, low-powered burner for simmering things, it's self-cleaning, has two built-in timers (one that actually turns the oven off when the time's run down), and a convection feature. It's not as wide as my old oven, which is going to take some getting used to (I used to have lots of extra surface area on the actual stovetop where I could put things down). It's still a gas oven and stovetop, which I like. Anyway, I've been repeatedly foiled in my attempts to use it. It arrived yesterday afternoon but wasn't hooked up and ready to go until about an hour before I had to leave last night. Then tonight I had the slowest subway ride, so I got home later than usual (a ride that normally takes 30 minutes took three times as long). The good thing about the extra-long ride is that it gave me a chance to think about what to have for dinner. I ended up having pasta with oil-packed tonna (tuna), capers and olive oil. I put the oil in a small saucepan on the simmer burner and dropped a crushed clove of garlic in there, to infuse the oil with the garlic. Cooked the pasta on the power burner; not sure if the water came to a boil faster, but this Barilla pasta I got, spaghetti rigati (spaghetti with ridges), really does cook in 5 minutes. I tossed the tuna and capers into the oil, then added the pasta. Tossed it all together, added some grated Parm, and was eating 15 minutes after I walked in the door. The oil could have used a little more garlic flavor, but overall it was a pretty good meal (and amazingly quick). It's not really that late yet. Maybe I'll give the oven its first spin with some brownies.

I have a confession to make: I always use canned beans. Once in college Todd's roommate James got excited about making a pot of beans, and I remember a too-small pot simmering on the back burner of the stove for what seemed like the entire day. I wondered how he had the patience to wait for the beans to be done. Whenever I've tried to recreate the experience (OK, the one time), I've ended up with chalky, mushy beans (try coming up with that combo on purpose). But now that I'm confined to slow-cooker meals, I thought I'd try again, but this time I soaked them overnight (instead of using the quick-soak method) and then put them in the slow-cooker for 8 hours. First, I was astounded by how quickly a pound of dried black beans soaks up water. I had put them in a bowl and covered them by about 2 inches with water, and when I looked an hour later the water level was below the level of the beans (so I added more water). Let it sit overnight, then drained the beans and put them in my slow-cooker with a 15-ounce can diced Italian-style tomatoes, 2 chopped bell peppers, 1 chopped onion, 2 minced jalapenos, 4 minced garlic cloves, a tablespoon each cumin and chipotle chili powder, a teaspoon each cinnamon and dried oregano, lots of salt and 1 ounce chocolate chips. I didn't think there'd be enough liquid, but there was, and after 8 hours on low the beans had a great texture, firm and toothy. Topped them with rice, Frank's hot sauce, sour cream, Cheddar cheese and scallions. Have about 6 cups of beans left, so we'll be eating bean burritos, soup, etc. all week. I like using the slow-cooker for things like this, that need gradual, gentle heat for a long time. I saw a couple of recipes for steamed pudding in a slow-cooker, which seems like another natural use, along with braising meats, cooking beans, caramelizing onions. What about other low, slow-needs foods, like cheesecakes and custards? I don't know how I feel about doing things like meatloaf or lasagna, which take 10 times longer in the slow-cooker but don't seem to benefit from the technique. There's a million slow-cooker or crockery cookbooks out there - anyone know a good one? One that doesn't have a single recipe that includes a can of cream soup?

Interesting.  How did the chocolate chips affect the texture?  That's something I've never heard of adding to beans, but it sounds fantastic.
Kim

It was such a tiny amount (I may have even added less than an ounce) that it didn't really affect the texture. It adds a very faint sweetness, but also a depth, that cocoa flavor. If you didn't want the sweetness you could probably add cocoa powder instead.

Real home cooks have a collection of recipes that work for them, that they know by heart and can adjust according to what they have in their kitchens. I feel like I won't be a real cook until I have one. So every time I make something new, Todd gets 20 questions: What do you think? Would you want this again? Do you like it more than what I made last night? Do you like it more than the other [insert chicken, pasta, steak, etc. here] dish I made last week? He's been spared the 20 questions lately, though, because I've either made things that are becoming regulars in our home, or I've made things that I wasn't really that happy with. I have a recipe for fantastic and rich coconut macaroons that I made this weekend, then dipped in either Scharffen Berger bittersweet or Key Food semisweet (I do like the deep, musky bittersweet flavor better that the semisweet, but didn't necessarily prefer the texture of one more than the other). Anyway, after making these cookies twice I've decided they deserve a place in my canon. I've also included a couscous dish with sausage and chicken. You cook onion and then add chicken, kielbasa, broth, tomato paste, a cut-up turnip, a carrot, turmeric (last time I substituted cumin), hot pepper flakes, a cinnamon stick and bay leaf and simmer for a while, then you take out part of the liquid to make the couscous. The couscous comes out great. My oven finally died so it's going to be the microwave, electric skillet, waffle iron and slow-cooker for us for a while. It'll be an interesting challenge.

Clotide - It's a recipe I got from Epicurious.com (chocolate-dipped coconut macaroons; http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=11607). The first time I made them I was looking for something special to dip in chocolate fondue, so I made the basic macaroons. I use a little less sugar than the recipe calls for, 1 cup instead of 1 1/3, and I bake them on a silpat. Awesome and chewy, especially when they're dripping with warm, melted chocolate.

I like your site. You reminded me that the Chocolate Show in New York is coming up. Maybe it'd be fun to go.

Lynn - I've never made mulligatawny, but I'd love to try your recipe. Do you have other recipes you tend to return to again and again? I have a chocolate pudding from, believe it or not, the Cooking Thin cookbook, and a really easy bread pudding that I frequently make when I need to use up stale bread. Buttermilk pancakes from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, biscuits (my husband's specialty), a dough for pizza, some snack cake recipes, but nothing dinner-y. A spinach, chickpea, garlic and pasta combo that I made for dinner tonight. Seriously, I need to start repeating some recipes.

I had a nice time here. We were looking for a place to eat around NYU at about 10 Monday night (a couple places we tried were closed), and someone said he ate at Bar Pitti a lot. It's crowded, with warm yellow walls (as far as I remember) and mirrors. Their specials menu, which is written on small chalkboards and is in Italian, is about as long as their regular menu, and features lots of specialties that regulars recommend: meatballs, a daily parpadelle, etc. I wasn't very hungry, so I had some kind of cured meat, thinly sliced, very mild with pliable sheets of Parmesan and sliced arugula. The other dish I tried, some kind of sausage with lentils, was pretty good. Todd had a pork sandwich and someone else had a spaghetti-type pasta with, I think, garlic, artichokes, leeks, olive oil, tomatoes. (I almost ordered that, but you know you can't have duplicates when you try a new place.) Everyone seemed happy. It was reasonably priced for Italian, and fairly good. I'll go back (although I hear it's usually pretty crowded during normal dining hours).

It astounds me how the most modest ingredients make the most fantastic food: old bread, sugar and eggs make creamy bread pudding; flour, water and eggs make pasta; the cheapest cut of beef, carrots, onion, celery and time for a great stew; a chicken carcass and some veggies for a rich, thick stock; flour, water and yeast for bread. I made polenta last night to eat with the leftover ragu, and it's basically 2 cups of boiling water, 1/2 cup basic cornmeal (about 10 cents' worth) and a lot of stirring (of course, I added butter and Parmesan at the end, but you could have a very respectable, creamy polenta just by adding a lot of salt and freshly ground pepper - but even a wedge of Parmesan can be a modest ingredient when you consider how far you can stretch a chunk). The ragu, which disappointed me the first time, was transformed by the modest cornmeal mush. Frugality is highly underrated.

I had lunch here yesterday and hope that I get the chance to go back soon. It's on 8th Ave, between 24th and 25th, across from that grassy block. The restaurant felt very intimate, and the staff were friendly and helpful and seemed eager for us to come back. But it was the Asian-influenced food that really made me happy. It may seem like we had some run-of-the-mill dishes, but the extra touches made the meal. Our first course was slices of seared tuna with sorbet, fennel salad and those little baby, sprout-like greens (I want to call it mache but am not sure that's right). The salty crust on the tuna, the smooth interier of the fish, the crisp fennel and cold, slushy tart sorbet was a great combination. Then we had seared chicken with a tomato-eggplant chutney that was so spicy and good. That came with sesame mashed potatoes, which I am going to have to try to replicate at home (with sesame oil). Dessert was the best, though (usually is for me). A pear-almond financier with powerful ginger ice cream melting all over the top. Again, the contrasts were appealing: the ice cream itself was cold, spicy, creamy, melting over the top of warm pears in a crunchy, strongly almond-flavored cake. I want to try to reproduce that ice cream at home, too. Maybe by steeping fresh ginger? Anyway, CitySearch labels it $40 and up and I didn't see the menu, so I'll have to find a special occasion for an opportunity to go back. But I liked it so much that it would be worth a special occasion.

I made long-simmering ragu this weekend, and it was fine, although I kind of felt like something was missing. It's weird, it had that depth of flavor I was looking for, but was almost too mellow, without any standout flavor. I have a bunch of ideas for what might remedy it, or what could make it better next time: It might just need more salt (I'm always a little too light on the salt), which a liberal grating of Parmesan over the top could take care of, or I might need better tomatoes (I used fresh), wine or meat (I used a mix of ground beef and veal). Maybe even more garlic. I threw in some chopped-up Parmesan rind toward the end, and more of that might have made a difference. Or maybe my expectations were just too high?

I always find ragu very difficult, but to me all long-cooked tomato sauces just taste acidic and heavy. I much prefer the uncooked fresh, but of course you have to have good summer tomatoes to do that.
Kim
2003-10-22 09:24:00
This was almost the opposite for me; the ragu had almost no acidity. A coworker really thinks it was the fresh tomatoes I used. 

I grew up with a tomato-based meat sauce on my spaghetti, so it's another one of those high-carb, cozy kinds of food to me. Fresh, uncooked tomato sauce is perfect summer food, but when the weather gets cold I need my warm, heavy sauces. (The better to pack on those winter pounds, although I'm one of those people who, peversely, tend to lose in the winter and gain in the summer. Must be all that shivering.)

I made long-simmering ragu this weekend, and it was fine, although I kind of felt like something was missing. It's weird, it had that depth of flavor I was looking for, but was almost too mellow, without any standout flavor. I have a bunch of ideas for what might remedy it, or what could make it better next time: It might just need more salt (I'm always a little too light on the salt), which a liberal grating of Parmesan over the top could take care of, or I might need better tomatoes (I used fresh), wine or meat (I used a mix of ground beef and veal). Maybe even more garlic. I threw in some chopped-up Parmesan rind toward the end, and more of that might have made a difference. Or maybe my expectations were just too high?

I always find ragu very difficult, but to me all long-cooked tomato sauces just taste acidic and heavy. I much prefer the uncooked fresh, but of course you have to have good summer tomatoes to do that.
Kim

This was almost the opposite for me; the ragu had almost no acidity. A coworker really thinks it was the fresh tomatoes I used. 

I grew up with a tomato-based meat sauce on my spaghetti, so it's another one of those high-carb, cozy kinds of food to me. Fresh, uncooked tomato sauce is perfect summer food, but when the weather gets cold I need my warm, heavy sauces. (The better to pack on those winter pounds, although I'm one of those people who, peversely, tend to lose in the winter and gain in the summer. Must be all that shivering.)

I've had this spoon for more than eight years, which may not seem like a lot to some people but is a long time to me. Some friends gave it to me as part of a whole basketful of kitchen stuff when I got engaged. I was still in college and didn't even have much in the way of the hodgepodge of hand-me-downs that college kids usually use in their first kitchens. Just some metal bowls (that are fantastic and I still use) that Todd inherited when a friend of his mom's moved into a nursing home along with a couple green-and-white plates and some mismatched plastic-handled forks and spoons. Sometimes I just use the spoon, but more often than not when I use the spoon it makes me think about the women who gave it to me, how they surprised me with the party, the communal nature of college living, the way our lives melded into one another's for a while. The morning walks I used to take with a couple of them; the long talks late into the night; how my roommates changed who I am. The way I was berating Todd for being slow and late when we walked in on everyone yelling \"surprise!\" (That hasn't changed, to my shame.) I have other kitchen equipment, from the wedding, that makes me think of the givers: a spice rack from my coworkers at the writing center, the set of pots and pans (not the ones we registered for but much better) from Todd's aunt and uncle, the coffeemaker from my aunt. When we got all these things, I had no idea how they would become a day-to-day part of our lives, and how they would stay with me and remind me of the people who gave them to us. So I guess the wedding-gift anxiety I usually have is unnecessary: They'll use that blender or toaster, and maybe once in a while when they do they'll think of me.

Terrific entry!
My food processor was a hand-me-down from a co-worker who decided to upgrade hers. It's perfectly fine, but old and looks it. Whenver I schlepp it out of it's hinding place, I think of her and all the times we spent our lunch hours and breaks huddled over cooking magazines and making up recipes, laughing and sharing our mutual love of cooking. It's nice to have stuff that has history behind it.

I bought apples at the Union Square farmer's market (HUGE apples) and took them over to some friends' where we made a caramel-topped apple pie on Sunday. I should've watched my friend better as she made the crust: It came out perfect, flaky but solid enough to hold everything together. She did it all by hand but didn't have any big lumps of butter in her finished crust. I think I just need to be more patient when I'm cutting in the butter (she used a pastry blender). It's amazing how a slice of warm apple pie with ice cream melting all over it can make me so happy. I had one of those \"this is awesome\" moments right in the middle of eating it.

Hi, Kim--

Great blog.

A couple of weeks ago, I bought some Northern Spy apples at the Ann Arbor Farmer's Market and made a pie with them. The apples made a wonderful pie.

I think the secret to a good pie crust is to use just enough water to hold the thing together and not to work the dough too much. Working it just activates the gluten and makes the baked crust tougher.
Kim
2003-10-25 07:42:00
Yeah, I think you're right. I'm always disappointed when I roll out my crust and there are big blobs of butter all over, but they all melt away during baking and make the crust flakey. I just need to work on getting my blobs a little smaller. 

My dough is always so moist to begin with, I rarely add much water at all. I'm especially bad with the food processor; I've discovered I like my mother-in-law's method of cutting in the butter with a pastry blender, then using a fork to stir in a tiny bit of water at a time. Maybe by the time I'm 50 I'll have perfected the crust part. 

I've heard Northern Spy makes great pie; a coworker of mine always uses a couple different types of apples in her pie, and I think she named Northern Spy as one of them. Just think of all the apple pies being baked across the country just in this one weekend alone! It makes me want to get out the rolling pin.

I just went to your site and saw that you make your own sausage - it sounds terrific, and a great family activity. I just can't imagine the Whipple family (my family) doing something like that.
danr
2003-10-26 08:34:00
That's exactly how I make my pie crust! :) The pastry cutter works well because the blobs come out the right size. If you cut the butter into the flour with a food processor, the blobs are too small, I think.

You might want to look at the following place: http://www.sweettalkplus.com/cgi-bin/jboard/jboard.pl. It is the Sweettalk web site and has a recipe resource.
A great dessert is a brownie made with splenda and black beans (sic). There is a great sweetener caled agave you can find too.

There's also Stevia, which is an herb that is just as sweet if not sweeter than sugar. For diabetics (my mom is one) it's said to be helpful because it nourishes the pancreas and helps restore pancreatic function. I'm not sure if that claim is backed up by the FDA, it's just something I've read about the herb. Anyway, good luck with dessert.

My fiancee and I use Splenda all the time...from sprinkling on strawberries, to green tea to baking with it. It definitely works 1-to-1 and I've not had any problems with side effects.

Incidentally, my father is diabetic as well and we've made him several weight watcher desserts in the past that almost never call for added sugar.

You all have good suggestions (except Todd, perhaps, who of course does not like the prospect of eating brownies made with black beans, as picky and unadventurous as he is - but I still love him). 

I have a couple of Weight Watchers cookbooks that I'll have to take a look at; that's a good idea.

I'm now leaning toward a pannacotta made with whole milk or cream, since fat's not the issue. I'll try using one of the artifical sweeteners you suggested.

***CONTENT
This was easy to scale down to one (actually two, but I like leftovers), from Food & Wine. First you saute about 1/3 pound 1-inch chicken cubes in olive oil until browned, then take them out of the pan and add 1/2 diced onion and 1 leek, sliced thin, reserving some for garnish. (This was the first time I used a leek, and I cut it in half lengthwise, then sliced it thin and put it in a bowl full of water and swished it around with my hands. The leek pieces float to the top and the sediment settles at the bottom of the bowl, so I skimmed the leek off the top of the water and shook it dry, then put it in the pan.) Cook until they start to soften, then add 1 cubed sweet potato and saute another 3 minutes. Then add 1 1/2 cups chicken broth, 1 bay leaf, a pinch or two of sage, salt, pepper and the chicken and simmer until chicken is opaque and potato is soft. Then I mashed some of the potato cubes with a potato masher right in the pot, added 1/2 cup milk and sprinkled with the reserved raw leek slices (these fresh, crunchy leek slices are have a sharp, oniony flavor and contrast with the sweetness of the soup). I love savory sweet potato dishes, and this was good and relatively healthy.

I've wanted to take another crack (haha, ugh) at making a cheesecake, and I had leftover almond paste so I thought I'd make this recipe. The cake has a good, kind of firm texture and is not too sweet. A pretty strong almond flavor, too, but not overpowering. This one cracked, too, while cooling, but the crack seemed to close up at the cake continued to settle. Plus you cover the top with the sour cream topping.

It's funny because it's really not that big of a deal, but I always think of a water bath as a major pain. I should try it next time. I wonder if you have to bake it for a lot longer if you use one. The cheesecake did tend to sink a little, all over, which closed up the cracks (you can kind of tell in the photo because of the raised edges).

I finally had Korean food last night, but not on Korea street. I met a friend near her workplace, at 54th and Park. It was a good place to go for a first experience; everyone was so nice about all of our questions. Some Citysearch reviews had complained that it was pricey and that they didn't bring out all the vegetables unless the customer's Korean, but that wasn't our experience at all (I'm beginning to think that Citysearch is useless for reviews; it's just a site the disgruntled use for revenge). I can see why Korean food is becoming so popular, though. It makes you feel like you're having a feast when they bring out all those little dishes of kimchi, pickled radish, octopus salad, lotus root, etc. I ordered bibimbop, which is sticky rice mixed with vegetables and beef. It's brought to the table with an egg yolk on top in the clay pot they cooked it in and then, tableside, the waiter breaks the egg yolk and mixes it into the rice with some hot sauce. They also brought out a savory egg custard for us to try. It was silky and slippery and hot. Perfect for a cold day. They have a great lunch special, too.

I've always liked Peg Bracken's suggestion regarding leftover meat: \"Have you re-presented it as an honest cold-cut platter? It's easy to forget the obvious.\"

But I guess you've already done that re: the sandwiches.

Have you read Bracken's \"I Hate To Cook Book\"? I just love it. I don't say I'd make all her recipes, but some of them (the chocolate cookies, for one) work really well.

This is what Todd usually orders when we go to Cabana (or one of his usuals), so when I saw the recipe in Food and Wine I decided to make it. We started with about a 2-pound London broil-type steak, beef shoulder or something like that. We were making half a recipe (the full recipe supposedly made 8 servings, although we're going on 7 servings now with half the recipe). Todd cut it in three pieces, with the grain, seasoned it liberally with salt and pepper, and browned it on both sides in a little bit of oil over high heat. Then he added 4 cups of water and a bay leaf, and the whole thing simmered for 1 hour 40 minutes. I turned the meat over halfway through. Removed the meat from the pan and set aside 1 1/2 cups of liquid, which looked like beef stock (discarded the rest). Sauteed 1 each thinly sliced red and green bell pepper and white onion until everything was getting soft and the onion was browning, then added 7 minced garlic cloves. Added the reserved liquid, 1 14-ounce can whole tomatoes crushed with my hands, a cinnamon stick, 4 whole cloves, another bay leaf and a couple tablespoons of capers. Simmered for about 20 minutes, then added the meat back in to heat. We ate it with rice. Last night we had leftovers wrapped in flour tortillas with diced avocado, scallion, lime juice and Frank's hot sauce. I preferred it that way.

I used almond paste for the first time this weekend. It was this modest, old-fashioned looking little can I found on the baking aisle, so I had one of those sticker-shock moments when it rang up at five dollars. I'm not cheap, I just had a limited amount of cash on me and it was sitting there next to the 99 cent packages of sugar, so . . . I sound so naive. I even pulled out my food processor for this one, and mixed 1 stick butter with 1/4 cup almond paste until smooth, then added 1 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract, then combined. Dropped 4 egg yolks (I freeze the whites) and 2 whole eggs, one at a time, through the tube while the processor was running. Added 1/4 cup sour cream and processed to combine. In a large bowl I mixed 1/2 cup each cornmeal and cake flour and 1 teaspoon baking powder, then added the mixture from the food processor and folded it all in together. Baked it in a buttered and floured 9-inch round cake pan, 350 degree oven, for I think 30 minutes, until the top was golden and the sides were pulling away from the pan. It actually wouldn't come out of the pan so I just left it in there and cut slices straight out of it (the buttered-floured pan never works for me). Great light texture, with a little of that cornmeal graininess, and the scent of almonds. It was best warm, but good even after it had cooled off. Now I have about 1/2 cup of the almond paste left to try in something new.

The beads sound like caramel.  Probably the meringue was either over-sugared or under-whisked -- either way condensation once it came out of a hot oven (either due to steam escaping from the center of the meringue or due to humidity in the kitchen) might dissolve sugar crystals on the surface, leaving beads of caramel as the water evaporated.

Of course, that's just a guess.  You don't want to over-whisk a meringue; that just makes it too dry and difficult to work with.
Kim
2004-03-17 16:37:00
It kind of tasted and looked like caramel, so that makes sense! Oversugaring sounds like it could be my problem. I was halfway through the recipe when I realized I was using four egg whites instead of three, so I added more sugar to compensate. That probably did it. 

My fridge tends to be pretty moist, too, so I'm sure that didn't help.

It was an epicurious recipe, but I didn't have any lemon juice, so I used balsamic vinegar (I know it sounds kind of gross, but it turned out pretty good). It was basically sugar and water boiled together until the sugar was dissolved, then I added quartered figs, a splash of the vinegar and some cloves and cardamom pods. Once the figs were soft and the liquid was thick, I stirred in some toasted sesame seeds, which also sound weird but give the jam a nice toasty taste. The first day this was good, but it got even better the next few days, almost perfumed. I ate it with goat cheese on a toasted baguette.

Mmm, your jam sound terrific!
We used to have 2 fig trees in our backyard where I grew up in Brooklyn. More figs than we ever knew what to do with, but still, we managed. One of the ways we used to eat them was cold, sliced and drizzled with balsamic. So good.

it sounds almost chutney-ish. i had something like it on monday on my little holiday, accompanying duckliverpaté and toast as a starter. it was a set menu, and i might not have let my choice fall on this, but the combination was lovely; the smoothness of the paté and the fruity spicy tartness of the conserves! i can just imagine the feast it would be with chèvre..

I can't imagine having something growing in my yard. (I'm finding it kind of hard to imagine having a yard right now.) So I'm always kind of jealous when coworkers bring in the fruits of their land. Unless, of course, I get to take some home with me. 

I like figs as a sweet-ish counterpoint to something smooth and savory - a sharp contrast to all that richness. Paté and figs sounds like a great idea. Not a big paté fan, and really don't like foie gras, but I think it's mainly because I haven't paired it with the right things.

I love this weather. Even the smells of cooking, of the gas burners on my stovetop firing up, are different when the air outside is so crisp and clean. I made pasta with tomato sauce last night, a childhood favorite, and it was the perfect food for the turn in the weather. I got out my sweaters, pulled on my flannel pajamas and made a list of warm foods to stock up on: teas, cocoa and cider, steel-cut oats, soups.

I don't know if there's a little ambiguity in defining \"pork tenderloin\" or if the butcher just gave Todd something else, but when I sent him to the pork store to buy a tenderloin, instead of the long, skinny little piece of meat I expected, Todd came home with a 3-pound roast. So we ate pork for about a week. First I roasted some of it, coating it with applesauce before I put it in a 500 degree oven and cooked it until it reached 155 degrees internally. Then we had sandwiches with some of the leftovers. With the rest of the meat, I made Bittman's pork and turnips (which we love) and Todd took those leftovers to lunch. On Sunday we finally ate the last of the pork I had roasted, stir-fried with rice, bell pepper, scallions, garlic and celery and seasoned with toasted sesame oil, soy sauce and red pepper flakes. You stir-fry the veggies first, add the garlic, then the rice and seasonings. So easy. (Although I did have to cook the rice the day before, but that's easy, too. I just left it sitting on the stovetop, covered, like Todd's roommate used to do in college.)

Adding a couple more-expensive types of mushrooms to cheaper cremini kept the price of the whole thing down, and I did feel like it was a more complex flavor.

Have people had success with Martha's recipes? I subscribe to Everyday Food, and I find the recipes in there a little hit or miss. This weekend I made peanut butter and chocolate creams, which are basically heavy cream whipped with one of those two ingredients. For the peanut butter, you whip 3/4 cup heavy cream to stiff peaks, add 2 tablespoons sugar and whip to combine, then fold in 1/2 cup peanut butter. If you thought folding peanut butter into whipped cream would be hard, you'd be right. But it eventually worked. The chocolate is what I really had a hard time with. You warm 3/4 cup heavy cream, pour it over 1/2 cup chocolate chips, let it sit for 5 minutes for the chocolate to melt, then stir to combine. Then pop it in the fridge for 15 minutes. When it's cool, whip until thick and fluffy. Only mine wouldn't get thick and fluffy. It had the texture of unset pudding. I usually chill the bowl and beaters when whipping cream and I didn't do that this time, so I stuck the whole thing in the freezer, then pulled it out and tried again, which made it worse. I ended up just freezing the chocolate cream, then I sandwiched the two creams between Nilla wafters and stuck them back in the freezer. They were pretty good that way. Martha's first suggestion for the creams was to eat them layered as a parfait, but I think that'd be way too rich. These little cookie sandwiches were perfect, like ice cream sandwiches with a slightly fudgier texture to the cream.

Manhattan clam chowder, made with scallops (because I had a bag of frozen bay scallops) instead of clams. I've never been much of a red chowder fan, but it's not as bad for you as New England chowder, and I had a bunch of vegetables I needed to use up. I started with a bottle of clam juice, added about half a bottle of water. Diced up 1 carrot, 2 stalks celery, half a large red bell pepper and a large scallion, added that to the pot and simmered it all for 10 minutes, to soften the vegetables. Then I added 1 diced potato, half a 28-oz can of whole peeled tomatoes that I had chopped up (with some of the puree in the can), thyme, salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne. Simmered that until the potatoes were tender, then added scallops and simmered until they were cooked through. Easy, and pretty tasty, too, with a distinct seafood taste. Yes, the bread got a little too broiled, but only on one edge. And I like that burned taste as long as it's not too much of it.

This is a restaurant in Chelsea Market that is committed to using organic ingredients. It's a cute little place, with only a few tables, but reasonably priced. We went there yesterday after some gallery-hopping. While we were having lunch, though, Todd started to feel nauseated, so I had to wolf down my food (a meatloaf sandwich with a sweet and spicy tomato chutney and mustardy coleslaw) so we could go. But we'll definitely go back. We like to spend our free time visiting galleries in the area and I never know where to eat. (Todd is feeling better, and it wasn't the chicken pot pie. It's much more likely that he was sick with disappointment about the photography exhibits we saw that morning. Nothing outstanding, although I really liked the series of tract houses and old barns at Robert Mann galleries, and the 360 degree views of famous sites like the Brooklyn Bridge and the Louvre at Laurence Miller were kind of interesting.)

Argh! I really want to try this place for a long time, we finally go, but you get sick and I don't get to enjoy my meal. Yes, you do owe me. There were about three things on that menu that I really wanted to try. (It was sort of light, girly food, the kinds of things Todd doesn't consider \"real food\" and I always want to have.)

For the consumate Chelsea experience, skip this new-agey, organic nonsense and head to the Eros diner at the corner of 7th Avenue and 21st St. There, if you're a guy, you'll be greeted by a hale and hearty, \"How are you, Chief (or Boss, and  if you become a regular possibly Baby)?\" While you'll find it hard to make up your mind from the extensive menu, the chocolate chip pancakes are exquisite. With the addition of sidewalk dining this summer, the Eros has become de rigeur as the place to see and be seen in this fab Manhattan neighborhood. See you there!

Kim

Well, Bubba, it sounds absolutely divine. It's funny, but I have a coworker who also raves about Eros (he has made it to \"Baby\" status there). It's entirely possible that you two have been there at the same time. (Another coincidence, you share the same e-mail address.)

The menu at Paradou sounds great, although Todd's not big on French (I'm used to dragging him places he doesn't want to go, though). I'll have to keep it in mind.

There's a place on 10th Ave, maybe at 17th or 18th, that has a huge patio-like area. It's always empty, though, which doesn't seem like a good sign.

I made chocolate chip cookies last night (I used a recipe in the Once Upon a Tart cookbook, but it's pretty basic). Sorry to sound like the end of a coming-of-age novel, but it taught me a couple of things about myself. I've come a long way in terms of cooking and baking. There was a time when baking a batch of cookies was an event, involving what seemed to me a huge shopping list, a long process and endless scooping and baking. I would skip key elements, like using room-temperature butter, or not know how to \"make\" the butter room temperature quickly (microwave, LOW POWER, in 30 second increments until your thumb leaves a mark). I know some of you will understand what I'm saying, and others of you have baking in your blood and can't imagine that a batch cookies could be viewed as daunting. Anyway, I have changed. I have all the ingredients on hand (they're staples in my kitchen) and everything goes so quickly and easily. I was a little surprised. And I always used to be disappointed in the results, but the cookies I made last night are awesome. (I have in my possession a box of Entenmann's cookies that I'm supposed to deliver to a friend, and that's what got me craving cookies last night, but I wasn't allowed to open the box since they weren't mine, so that's why I made my own. Mine were better.) The other thing I learned about myself is that I'm a comfort baker. Some news made me a little sad last night, so I made a batch of cookies, and it made me feel better. Skilled and useful, like I could do something that other people would appreciate and enjoy. Is that an unhealthy attitude about food? I just wish there were more than just the two of us to eat up all my comfort baking.

Hi Kim-
I don't think comfort baking is an unhealthy attitude about food at all. I think you should be proud of something you can make by hand that  makes others feel good, very few people take the time to do that anymore. I'm sorry your news made you sad, hopefully you'll feel better soon.
Kim
2003-09-23 09:04:00
It wasn't really that bad of news, I just had the blues, so the baking actually fixed me right up. Made me feel good about myself.

Mac and cheese is my savory comfort food, but I usually do reach for the sweets. There was just an article, I think it was in the NY Times, that said reaching for simple carbs like sugary sweets and pasta during stress is a biological impulse, because they calm you down. (You know, the carb coma you get after a big pasta meal.) The problem is if you're stressed all the time.

Coming from someone with a very big sweet tooth, there is nothing better than a hot, melt-in-your mouth chocolate chip cookie. I take baking these quite seriously. A great recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies is in the Typically Texas Cookbook II. (Yes, Texas --- what can I say...I don't have a good selection of cookbooks).  Will send it to you sometime.
Kim

Coming from someone with a very big sweet tooth, there is nothing better than a hot, melt-in-your mouth chocolate chip cookie. I take baking these quite seriously. A great recipe for oatmeal chocolate chip cookies is in the Typically Texas Cookbook II. (Yes, Texas --- what can I say...I don't have a good selection of cookbooks).  Will send it to you sometime.

One of the best meals I ever made was an acorn squash stuffed with sausage, apples and sage, and maybe some raisins (going back a few years).  Saute all the stuffing components, suff them into the squash (cut in half) back for 45 minutes.  Good stuff.

I agree that it doesnt seem like enough...it is more of an appretizer sounding item.
Kim

That sounds like a perfect home-alone meal. I think I'll keep that idea on hand. Is one squash too much for one person? I guess I could find a small one. And this way you don't have to try to peel it.

Wednesday night I went to a dinner at Bryant Park Grill honoring three honey recipe contest winners. Two thoughts on the night: 1. Alton Brown was the host, and he was as friendly, enthusiastic and smart as you would imagine him to be. He made the whole process of honey production interesting: the social network of bees, the process they use to make honey, beekeeping, the harvesting process and the different \"varietals\" of honey. We did a honey tasting, and it was fun. You definitely can detect different flavors in the honey (the strong, molassess-y buckwheat honey was my favorite). He looked kind of schlubby, unshaven and unkempt, but that was kind of nice, too. I mentioned my husband, who works on big web sites, loves him, and he said he gets all the techies. Must be that Bill Nye-MacGyver thing he has going on. 2. If I were the honey organization that hosted the evening, I would be pissed at Bryant Park Grill. The recipes looked great, but the execution sucked. The honey cocktail was weak, the goat cheese and figs were topped with a couple of sad nuts and barely any honey instead of being rolled in nuts and drizzled with honey, the fruit salad, which was supposed to be in a dressing of mint honey and yogurt, was watery with no evidence of dressing. The dessert, a honey gelato, was way too lemony and icey. Nice atmosphere, but I'd rather have good food, crappy decor.

This is, in the incarnations I've seen it, a broth-based soup with greens and meatballs. I know someone's going to be horrified, but since this is called \"Italian,\" I decided a good, flavorful shortcut for the recipe would be to use sweet Italian sausage to make the meatballs. I can never find packages that contain ground beef, veal and pork all together, and buying the separate packs would result in entirely too much meat, so this seemed like a good way to make up for the loss of flavor. This is a recipe from Rachael Ray's second cookbook. You start by sauteeing, then sweating, two chopped carrots and two chopped celery stalks in olive oil (I don't know if the recipe doesn't include an onion or if I just forgot to put it it). While that's cooking, covered, mix 1 pound sweet Italian sausage, removed from casing, with 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup dried bread crumbs, 1 egg, salt, pepper, nutmeg and minced garlic. Add 6 cups chicken stock and 2 cups water to the carrots and celery and bring to a boil, then form the meat mixture into small meatballs and drop into the soup. Add about a cup of small pasta (I used elbow macaroni; she suggests broken up linguine) and boil for about 10 minutes. Meanwhile chop and wash fresh spinach. When the pasta's soft and the meatballs are cooked through, add the spinach and allow it to wilt. Serve with more Parmesan grated on top. I liked the flavor of the sausage meatballs, with the sweet fennel-seed taste, and will probably make them again.

I always noticed this bread at the fruit and vegetable place near my apartment, and wanted to try to make something with it. It's probably close to three feet long and very soft. (And only 99 cents! I don't understand how these pitas and breads can be so cheap. Especially when it's about $5 to buy a loaf at a bread shop and $2.50 to buy a loaf of supermarket bread. I know the quality doesn't rival the bread shop bread, but it's \"daily bread\" quality and always fresh.) It says on the package to keep it refrigerated, but I had to fold it in half to get it to fit in the fridge. Todd would shake his head every time he opened the door. So I made a pizza. I spread marinara sauce over half the bread, then grated some Parmesan over that and sprinkled it with oregano and red pepper flakes. Added shredded mozzarella cheese, thinly sliced proscuitto and more mozzarella. Baked it on the oven floor for about 12 minutes with the oven at 450 degrees. The bread made a good crust. As I suspected, it didn't have a huge amount of flavor, but it was thick and light, kind of soft but crisp on the bottom and firm enough to eat slices out of hand without them drooping. I think the bread might make good panini. It seems that slightly thick, light bread, like focaccia, compacts and gets crusty in a press, making a nice, crisp, thin sandwich.

So Todd's history of ordering gaffs goes back further than I knew. He didn't tell me that. 

I hope it doesn't discourage him. He's become positively adventurous when ordering. Whole roast sea bass? Suckling pig? Venison? I'm going to have to start getting more adventurous myself, just to keep up.

It's popular among those who consider themselves food enthusiasts in NYC to criticize the titular cakes from Cupcake Cafe, and so I feel the need to defend them. A friend is getting married this weekend and the buttercream-laden cupcakes were featured at her shower here at work, so I've had a couple in the last few days. They're good for the type of dessert they are: elaborately decorated, very pretty. They're small, which is good because they frosting has the texture of pure butter and the cake is pretty dense. But I feel like it strikes a good balance. The size is perfect for the richness, the slight dryness of the cake complements the moist buttercream. There's just the right hint of sweetness without going anywhere near sweet or cloying. I don't feel sick when I'm done eating one, but I'm definitely done. Too-light desserts don't give you that satisfied feeling. Straight from the fridge, Cupcake Cafe cupcakes are fantastically decadent. And now a study, as reported in The New York Times, says there are benefits for your health, too.

I had a whole huge list of things I was going to do yesterday: AMMI had free admission, the San Gennaro festival is going on, we need groceries and cash. But it was one of those days, in the mid-70s so you don't feel justified turning on the air conditioner but the humidity hovers around 100 percent so you feel like your slugging through a swamp just walking down the block. But I did turn on the air and use this. I've been intrigued by the idea that you can bake a cake on a baking sheet . We call it a \"rimmed baking sheet\" at work, I presume because the jelly roll is not as common a dessert as it once was, so new cooks might be confused by the term \"jelly-roll pan.\" Anyway, I made a basic jelly roll yesterday, and it wasn't pretty coming out of the oven, although it didn't look too bad once it was assembled. Haven't tried it yet, but Todd didn't rave. I think I'll spread it with ice cream next time - the best thing about the birthday cake is eating it with ice cream, a creamy contrast to the spongey crumb of the cake. I make sure I get a little bit of each with every bite. Anyway, the cake recipe:

When it comes to food, even when Todd and I agree, we disagree. We had all that leftover chicken this week, so on Wednesday I made enchiladas. But not the enchiladas Todd likes, with the green chile sauce. I made a quick mole, with chile powder, chicken stock and chocolate. He ate it Wednesday night, but he keeps leaving the leftovers behind. I don't think he likes it much. Anyway, I do, and it's made from stuff we tend to have in our cupboard. Dice an onion and cook it in oil, covered, with cumin, a pinch of cinnamon, garlic, salt and pepper until it's soft. I added 2 tablespoons chipotle chile powder (this sauce was really hot!), 1 1/2 tablespoons of flour and another tablespoon of cumin. Add 2 cups chicken stock and simmer until it's reduced quite a bit and starting to get thick. Take it off the heat and stir in about a tablespoon of chocolate (I used chips). Stir some of the sauce into the leftover shredded chicken. Spread a spoonful of sauce over the bottom of a 13 by 9-inch baking pan, then make 8 enchiladas, rolling the chicken, shredded Cheddar cheese, raw onions and chopped black olives in corn tortillas. Lay them in the pan, then spread the rest of the sauce over the top and sprinkle with more cheese. Bake covered in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes, then uncover and cook for another 10 minutes.

It was fresh whipped cream, actually, spiked with a little Cointreau. If you chill the beaters and the bowl that you're going to use to whip the cream, everything comes together really well. I just sprinkled in a little sugar and poured in some Cointreau once the cream started to get fluffy, then continued to beat it until it was the right consistency. One of my favorite articles from Cooking Light was cakes that can be made using only one bowl. The one I made recently, and accompanied with the whipped cream, is a Devil's Food Cake. The key technique used in the article is melting the butter, then mixing it with the sugar, salt, levening, spices, then the flour. You start with 5 tablespoons of melted butter for this cake, then add 1/2 cup cocoa powder and 1 cup brown sugar. Mix that, then add 2 eggs, one at a time, then 1/2 teaspoon baking powder, 1 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Mix in 3/4 cup flour, then add 1 teaspoon espresso powder dissolved in 1/4 cup hot water and pour into a greased and floured 8-inch square baking pan. Bake at 350 degrees for 25 minutes.

Ouch! Gigondas in a sauce?? I'm sure it was good; it better be good. But how about drinking the gigondas with the meal and opening a cheaper syrah or heavier rhone for the sauce. That way you'll have a bottle of wine open that you'll have to enjoy the following night!
Kim
2004-02-25 09:55:00
What's the objection? Is it simply the price? (I really am curious, since I'm kind of a wine novice. What do you cook with?) 

It wasn't terribly expensive - less than $20. And Todd and I are kind of lightweights, so 1 bottle minus the 1 cup for the sauce still left a lot of wine for drinking. Anyway, I wanted to use something I really liked the taste of, since the flavors were being concentrated in the sauce. And it's all part of my wine experimentation, to find out what works for cooking and what I like for drinking.

My cousin decided to become a vegetarian after handling a raw chicken, and that was my first thought when I opened the chicken package yesterday. After I got it all rinsed off, though, I actually warmed up to handling the thing. I had made a lemon-thyme butter, which I rubbed under the loosened skin on the breast. Then I rubbed more all over the outside of the chicken, seasoned the inside with salt and pepper, and stuffed a cut-up lemon, a bunch of thyme springs, a small halved onion and some halved garlic cloves in the cavity. Placed it breast side up in my heavy, deep-sided skillet on top of a cut-up onion and some baby carrots and roasted it at 450 degrees, basting it every once and a while with the pan juices. I think the whole operation took about 1 hour 45 minutes, but I'm not really sure. I had stuck my thermometer in the thigh and took the chicken out when the temperature reached 165 degrees. The breast had reached about 162, but it was still really tender, juicy. Must've been all that butter.

It has whole cherries in it and is now one of my favorite condiments. It's actually somewhat like a jelly, with tons of the cherries making up the bulk of it. I made jam bars from it about a week ago, and this morning I mixed it with some thickened yogurt for breakfast (it felt like a sinfully rich breakfast, but I can't imagine it's that bad for you - just plain, nonfat yogurt and a spoonful of the cherries). Thickening yogurt is easy, and I like the finished texture better than the regular yogurt: I line my strainer with a paper towel and put it in a bowl that's deeper than the strainer. Then I fill the strainer with the yogurt, fold the paper towel over the top, put a small plate on top and weigh it down with a jar of something. Leave it in the fridge for a couple of hours, and all this liquid comes out of it, which you just throw down the sink.

Maybe it's the name- \"veal\" sounds nothing like an animal, young or old, while \"suckling pig\" is a little too descriptive for comfort. If veal was instead called \"young nursing cow\", it might lose some of it's marketability.
Kim
2004-02-09 11:31:00
Todd kind of said the same thing you are, Laika. Lamenting the foreshortened life of an animal that's being raised as food anyway is just a matter of degrees. If you carry the argument out you could conclude we shouldn't eat any animals at all (which is what a lot of people do decide). 

Ted, should the idea that we might have to be fooled by a semantics game in order to eat certain foods disturb us? 

The menu Saturday night called it \"suckling pig,\" but when Todd ordered he called it \"piglet,\" which made the waiter laugh and say he'd have to remember that one.
Ted Y.
2004-02-09 14:52:00
Piglet - that's even worse.

I confess I like to stay as far from the source of my food as I possibly can, and I'm pretty sure this is NOT a good thing. I think when God legitimized the eating of dead flesh, He wanted us to be quite aware of where it was coming from & the sacrifice it takes to fill our bellies, of the fact that we live in a fallen world, pointing ultimately to the The Sacrifice that will one day, among other things, put an end to a practice that was (I believe) not originally intended. I think the ritual of eating has always been of a sacramental nature (we take our hands, our minds, and the stuff of earth that God has given to create something new and life-giving for ourselves and our communities); the insertion of animal \"sacrifice\" into that cycle is pretty grave & significant, and should be remembered for what it stands for- but now I believe I'm rambling.

Having said all that, the sight of blood & the smell of (live or dead) animals make me rather sick to my stomach, and I've purposefully avoided having to practice what I believe...

Humans are omnivores by nature.  And, veal is deeee-licious.  That being said, meat is not exactly having its best moments lately.  Contaminated cows and chickens...fish with too much mercury, problems with farm-raised salmon...pork trying to say it's \"the other white meat\" (see i'm using the quotation marks for you, kim), and even atkins folks recently acknowledging that maybe eating pork chops and hamburgers for breakfast everyday isn't too bright.  Perhaps the vegetarians are actually onto something.  But, oh, I love sauteeing veal in butter and lemon and then wrapping it around sage leaves, mozzarella and prosciutto (use a toothpick to hold it all together)-mmm, that is the stuff.

The New York Times ran a recipe for scallop chowder last week. I didn't make that chowder. I intended to, but then Todd only got 1 cup of heavy cream (the recipe calls for 1 1/2 quarts) and I realized that it took a good 2 hours to make (way more time than I wanted to spend on a weeknight). I found this recipe for Fish Chowder on the Food TV web site (it's from Sara's Secrets, I think) and just substituted scallops for the fish. The recipe calls for rendering bacon fat, but I just melted some butter (that's what I had). Sauteed half a diced big white onion in it with a bay leaf and a few springs fresh thyme until the onions were soft. Added 1/4-inch-thick half-moons of potato (1 medium), 1 1/2 cups chicken stock (recipe preferred fish stock) and lots of salt and pepper. Brought that to a good boil, covered and cooked for 10 minutes (a lot of liquid evaporated, and what was left was kind of thick. I actually added about another 1/2 cup water at this point). Leave it off the heat for 10 minutes, then add 1/2 pound scallops (the little ones - bay?) and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in 1/2 cup cream and more salt and pepper, to taste. Todd got home late, so it sat for about 45 minutes before we warmed it up and ate it, and the recipe said that time allowed the flavors to meld. It was good; we both wanted to take the leftovers for lunch today, but, alas, there was only enough for one. (Would it make you think I'm a spoiled brat if I told you that I got to take it? He got the leftover salmon, which I would have willingly taken instead.)

Someone at work who is \"in the know\" told me that TimeWarner never really wanted Whole Foods in the building (not upscale enough, perhaps), but because they were unsuccessful in leasing the space to anyone else, they really had no choice but to take them.

Phyllo Experiments

***CONTENT
A box of phyllo contains about 28 sheets, but once it's open you have to use all of it in a week. So I've been trying out different phyllo recipes the last couple of nights. Last night I made salmon fillets in phyllo, and tonight I made banana-chocolate triangles. Both recipes were from the recent issue of Everyday Food, but I took a lot of liberties with the fish. I cut a 3/4 lb salmon fillet in half and skinned it, then seasoned it with salt and pepper. My fillets got gradually thinner on one side, so I folded that side under to make the whole thing even. Then I laid out a phyllo sheet, brushed it with melted butter, sprinkled dried sage on it, then added another sheet, which I brushed with more butter. Centered 1 fillet about 3 inches from 1 short end, brushed it with Dijon mustard, then rolled up the near end and folded in the sides. Then I rolled up the fillet in the phyllo sheet and brushed it with an egg wash. Repeated that for the other fillet and baked them in a 425 degree oven for 15 minutes. For the banana-chocolate triangles, I halved a banana lengthwise and cut it in 1/2-inch slices, which I tossed with sugar and chocolate chips. Laid out a sheet of phyllo and brushed it with melted butter, then sprinkled on sugar. Repeat with 5 more phyllo sheets. Cut the sheets lengthwise in 4 long strips, then mound some of the banana mixture on one end of a strip. Rolled up, using that corner-to-side technique that gives you a triangle at the end. Repeat with other 3 strips. Bake 10 minutes at 425 degrees. Make sure to let these cool before biting into them - the banana and chocolate get melty and really hot. Next is a tomato pizza with a crust made from phyllo.

Hi Kim!
Have you ever made Baklava?  Last Christmas I made it for the first time- and although it was time intensive, I enjoyed the process.  It was a big hit, with even Angelo in my office (who was a baker in Greece for 30 years) eating 2nd and 3rd pieces! 
I'm going to try the chocolate banana triangles with my leftover Phyllo this year!  Great idea!

My supper club made baklava during our Greek night - I just can't have a whole pan of that around or I end up eating the whole thing. When we moved out here we first moved to Astoria, which has a Greek population. So the first time I had baklava was in a Greek coffee shop in Queens. Big fan now, though. With a really strong cup of coffee.

Wasn't yesterday perfect slow-cooker weather? It was gray, cool and drizzly, so I opened up a couple cans of diced tomatoes and took the skin off 6 bone-in chicken thighs. Put that in the slow cooker with 1/2 cup of peanut butter and a small can of diced green chiles. Turned it on high for an hour, then switched it to low, went to a movie and came home to the smell of dinner filling the whole house. (I know the peanut butter seems weird, but it works. And the chicken gets so tender it comes right off the bone when you stir the stew. Plus now we have lots of leftovers.)

Please pardon my silly question-
are you using peanut butter to thicken the stew or for the flavor?

The peanut butter adds a nice nutty flavor; it certainly didn't thicken things up (the whole sauce was pretty thin). I wonder if it's because I used natural peanut butter - I worried that that might affect the outcome. We ate it with rice, so that soaked up all the juices. I think if I did this again I might try to spice it up even more, maybe with some curry or cayenne (the chiles didn't end up making it very hot). I'd add more peanut butter, too.

This was an easy recipe - an egg white is the secret to getting the sesame seeds to stick, and you pound the breast thin so it'll cook through before the seeds burn. First I pounded two small chicken breasts to 1/2 inch thickness, salted them, then dredged them through slightly beaten egg white mixed with more salt, and then through sesame seeds. Set that aside to allow the whites to dry out a little, and heat a good amount of oil (a scant 1/4 cup?) in the pan. Cook the breasts on each side about 5 minutes. I sliced them up and served them over arugula with balsamic vinaigrette drizzled on top. (I wanted to do an Asian dressing, but my sesame oil had gone bad and everything I tried turned out kind of foul. The vinaigrette was good with it, though.)

I think you'd really enjoy the duck at Peking Duck House in Chinatown-on Mott Street-(20 Mott was fabulous before it closed).  I had leftovers the next day for lunch (which were just as good) that made everyone extremely jealous as I rolled my pieces of duck and scallion into the thin pancake and then dipped it in hoison sauce.  Oh, man, that's the stuff.

***CONTENT
I made my first souffle last night, a cheese one, and I think it turned out pretty good. I made it from a recipe in Julia's Kitchen Wisdom and used a 6-cup dish, which made for a more stable, less spectacular souffle. (The souffle didn't rise above the dish; you'd need a 4-cup dish for that.) So I didn't even need a collar. First thing I did was heat the oven to 400 degrees and get out the 2 egg whites I had in the freezer. Then I prepped the bowl I was going to whip the whites in: rubbed the inside and the beaters with a little bit of salt and white vinegar (the residual vinegar in the bowl helps stabilize the whites). Then I put the frozen egg whites in the bowl and put the bowl in a pan with an inch of warm water (to thaw the whites). I added 3 more whites to that bowl, saving those egg yolks plus 1 more in another bowl. I prepped the baking dish by coating it with butter and grated Parmesan and shredded a cup of Madrigal Swiss for the souffle. Then I made the white sauce: Cooked 3 tablespoons flour and 2 1/2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan until foamy, then cooked it a couple minutes longer and took it off the heat. Meanwhile I heated a cup of milk in the microwave and then whisked it into the flour mixture. Simmered that over low heat to thicken, then added 1/4 teaspoon paprika, a couple gratings of nutmeg, 1/2 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of pepper. Then whisked in the 4 egg yolks, 1 at a time. Set that aside. Whipped the 5 egg whites in the bowl with a hand mixer until they were shiny and had peaks when the beaters were lifted. Whisked a big glob of that into the white sauce, then folded in the rest of the whites, alternating with the 1 cup shredded Swiss. Poured it into the prepared dish, put it in the oven, turned the oven down to 375 degrees and let it cook for 30 minutes. It was done when a skewer inserted in the side came out clean. Todd looked at this beautiful, puffy souffle and said, So it's basically like scrambled eggs. And I thought about the ingredients and said Yeah, I guess, except for the hour of work that went into it. But then when we dug in, and he put some in his mouth, he said, This is nothing like scrambled eggs. Why'd you say it was? (I guess I just thought he'd be more likely to try it if I said it was like something familiar - and this is my husband, not a child.) He ate it, had seconds and liked the cheese flavor.

This is one of those simple, quick desserts that I can throw together when I really want something sweet and homemade. The other one's the chocolate pudding I made for dessert when I braised some meat with a recipe from Chez Panisse - Basic Braise (Plus Pudding) in my archive. The basic recipe starts with old, dry French bread and includes cinnamon and raisins, but I play around with it a lot, substituting chocolate chips for the raisins, cocoa for the cinnamon, adding other spices. This time, I used some leftover cinnamon-raisin bread, cut in 1-inch cubes. I soaked about 4 to 5 cups of the cubes in 2 cups lowfat milk for a couple of minutes, while I mixed together about 1/2 cup sugar, 2 eggs and a dash of vanilla. Added the sugar mixture to the bread mixture and stirred until combined, then put it in a shallow baking dish and baked it in a 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes, until the small puddles of milk-egg mixture have turned to custard. No water bath, no fancy ingredients. And it's a pretty good bread pudding.

Chad thinks this should be called \"pudding bread\" instead of \"bread pudding\"- he had never had bread pudding before and expected more of the creamy taste of conventional pudding. 
 I've made the pudding twice now.   The first time I used what I had- whole wheat bread, soy milk, cage free eggs (I started out buying them for the health benefits (Omega 3's, Vitamin E)but they really taste better!)raisin, cinnamon, nutmeg and brown sugar.  It was so good!  The boys ate it up so quickly this weekend I had to buy a loaf of French Bread and do it again- but this time with more raisins and walnuts.  I used Vanilla Silk Soy Milk both times with great success.  
Have you ever made a total Chocolate bread pudding? I think that would be very good. This recipe is so simple and a great base I'll be playing around with!  Thanks for the recipe!

At home I had lettuce, crumbled blue cheese, walnuts and scallions, which I felt was on its way to being a good main-dish salad but not quite there. The deli around the corner from where I work, Belly Delly (yes, it's spelled like that), always has a whole turkey breast, sliced but still on the bones, on its steam table for lunch. So I got a few slices of that. (Fresh turkey for just over $1 - you can't beat that. And I don't want to hear about the food safety issues.) Tossed the greens with a homemade balsamic vinaigrette and put them on plates, then tossed the turkey, which I had pulled into strips, with the vinaigrette that was left in the bottom of the salad bowl. Topped the greens with that, then with the cheese, toasted walnuts and scallions. Yes, Todd was foraging around the kitchen for more food an hour later (sometimes I have to make a me-size meal).

We had eggs for dinner. Do I feel guilty about it? No. I sauteed the leftover diced chorizo and added leftover sauteed diced onion and bell pepper. I broke up some eggs in a bowl and added salt and pepper, then poured that into the skillet with the chorizo. Toasted some tortillas in another nonstick skillet and served it all together. The Key Food that's across Queens Blvd from us was terrible three years ago when we moved in. Dirty, slow (this is relevant, I promise). It's really improved, though, with faster, more helpful checkout people and nice, clean aisles with good variety. (I do still object to their produce section. They prepackage everything, so you're forced to buy six apples when you buy apples, or two dozen jalapenos, and you don't get to select each individual one yourself.) Shortly after the blackout they put up a sign that read that all their dairy, meat, etc, is new. So I felt OK buying eggs and milk last night. It seems like another sign that their management is really trying, too. (I know this seems like a long tirade about a regular old grocery store, but I cried when I saw my grocery options here. The gourmet stores are great, but not always convenient. The regular grocery stores are small and crowded, not well organized, lack selection, etc.)

One book I really enjoyed is Appetite for Life, a biography of Julia Child. I know it's been said over and over again, but she really takes an appealing approach to food: She's curious, passionate and rarely intimidated, or intimidating. Reading about her life was fun - she came to cooking relatively late, if I remember correctly. I've now stumbled upon another chef biography, that of Julia's colleague, Jacques Pepin: The Apprentice. His story is a bit more daunting for the novice cook, because he's been working in kitchens since before he was 13 years old. I haven't gotten very far in it yet, but I'm hooked. It's easy and enjoyable to read so far. He was a child in France during WWII, but he touches on the hardships with a very light hand, instead seeing how his summers spent as a city kid hosted by farmers gave him an early understanding of the superiority of fresh, simple food. He comes from a restaurant family and had an opportunity to apprentice at a hotel restaurant, but so far he's still a playful child.

If there any other interesting things aobut him that you be great to know.  I choose Mr. Pepin because he is a famous French chef that I decided to do a project on.

One of Todd's favorite foods is chorizo, that smokey, spicy Spanish sausage. I diced up some chorizo and sauteed it to cook out a little of the fat. Removed the sausage from the skillet, then I used to that flavorful chorizo fat to sautee diced green pepper and onion. Mixed it with the chorizo, then layered shredded Monterey Jack and the chorizo mixture on flour tortillas. Folded the tortillas in half, then cooked them to brown the tortilla on each side. I did use cheese in this, and thought it smelled a little off, but Todd insisted it smelled fine, and I'm sure I was just being paranoid. We both ate it, and neither of us is sick today. (The cheese is necessary to hold the whole thing together.) This was really good, especially if you get the tortilla crispy.

This is what a real tomato should look like. Big, knarled, dirty and red, red, red all the way through. I bought this Jersey tomato at the Union Square farmers' market. I've been trying to prepare meals with no meat, dairy or eggs, and this is what I came up with last night. First you combine 1 cup dry bulgur with 3/4 cup boiling water, cover it and let it sit 15 minutes. (I didn't think it'd be enough water, but it was. The bulgur ended up kind of chewy, which was nice.) Add a diced tomato and cucumber, 3 sliced scallions, a couple tablespoons chopped parsley, salt, pepper, a drained can of garbanzo beans and lemon vinaigrette (1/4 cup each lemon juice and olive oil, salt, pepper and a pinch of cayenne). Let it chill for at least an hour (it was better today for lunch than it was last night for dinner, so the longer you can leave it to chill, the better).

This was so easy to make: combine a 15-ounce can of white beans, 1 1/2 tablespoon olive oil, 1 chopped garlic clove, 2 tablespoons flat-leaf parsley and salt and pepper to taste in a food processor until it's the texture you want. I added cumin and chipotle powder, but lemon and rosemary might be nice, too. We dipped breadsticks in it and had a salad for dinner, but it might be good as a crostini spread, too.

this sounds absolutely delicious. years ago, in my greek au-pair era, i enjoyed something resembling this in the local tavernas: a puree of fava beans, or a kind of yellow split-peas, served up with lots of drizzled olive oil and bread...and, of course, retsina! those were the days..

Hi Kim,  

What fun to read your website!  It was truly refreshing to read such an optimistic outlook on what had to be a very challenging situation with the black out.  You truly have a gift for seeing \"the good in the bad,\" as my Mama always says.   

Next time you're home for a few days, you simply have to teach us how to make pasta.  I've waited forever for a class in our area and am convinced it will never happen.  Now what would it take to convince you to give your Mama, Jeana, and me a private cooking classs?!  (Sorry, I never can spell Jeana's name correctly!)  I'm sure it would be great fun and I would be delighted to host the class, furnish all the supplies, and host dinner for everyone in your family at our home.  Hope you'll think about it!

Hope Todd and you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing you when you're home again.

Warmest regards, Linda 
(Your Mom's best buddy! -smile-)

Lynn, that sounds great. I could make a whole meal out of that kind of thing, although Todd would be rummaging around in the cupboards or buying ice cream from a truck 20 minutes later. 

Linda, I would love to teach you all what I learned, although I'm not sure I'm qualified. It's pretty easy, though, and I love getting my hands dirty. (It doesn't even make that much of a mess.) I haven't bought a pasta machine yet, but it's on my list. I think I'll be home sometime around the holidays.

We have no food in the house: We returned from Durango late Tuesday, and hadn't found time to go to the grocery store when, on Thursday night, NYC lost power along with a good chunk of the northeast. I guess it 's kind of a blessing: Instead of worrying about food going bad in our fridge, we finally have a defrosted freezer, which until Friday morning had a three-inch layer of ice all the way around. I had made a trip to Amy's Bread during my lunch break Thursday, so I lugged a round loaf of sourdough with me when I joined the walking throngs during the most congested rush hour ever. Yesterday morning power returned at 8 a.m. for us, so restaurants weren't open for breakfast and the grocery store was just opening its doors. What do you buy when you know the market has been without power for 16 hours? We bought olive oil and tomatoes to make bruschetta with bottled artichoke hearts and the sourdough, plus doughnuts, a cantaloupe and nondairy creamer for breakfast. I've spent so much time shopping the perimeter of the market that I don't know what to buy when I suspect that all the fresh stuff is spoiled. And how long do I need to wait until I can be sure all that bad stuff is out of the shops? I'm suspicious of all the dairy, meat, poultry. Will eggs be OK? Maybe just not used raw for a while. What about our favorite little cheese shop? I think some cheeses would be fine, but how much of their inventory will they lose? I'm counting on fresh fruits and veggies as a saving grace, but the market we go to never has a very appetizing selection. Maybe the trains are running today and we can take a trip to the farmers' market. It's really amazing that such a huge loss of power turned out to be nothing more than an enormous inconvenience for most of the millions of people affected. I'm glad all I have to complain about is the possibility of some foul-odored milk or chicken. Maybe I'll find some cooking inspiration in Union Square.

Todd's mom is a great cook. So whenever Todd goes home to Durango (which only happens about once every three years) he always has some dish he wants her to make for him. This time, it was huevos rancheroes. For various reasons, he didn't get his dream breakfast until the last day we were there, right before we left for the airport for our 8 a.m. flight. Can't say that eggs and refried beans are the best thing to have at 6 a.m., but they did keep me full almost the entire six hours we were traveling (a good thing, too, because among the indignities United subjected us to on this trip was a terrible snack instead of the simple lunch that anyone flying a premium airline from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. deserves - they lost our luggage, too). Anyway, the huevos rancheros is pretty simple, but a satisfying combination. Flour tortillas fried in a thin layer of very hot oil just a few seconds, until crispy; refried beans; a fried egg; and enchilada sauce. Top it all with Cheddar cheese and salsa. I usually poach my eggs and toast corn tortillas in the oven when I make it - I still prefer the poached egg, but the fried flour tortilla definitely beats a dried out corn tortilla.

Thanks for the Huevo Ranchero Recipe- I had never had them before, but after I read your article I had to go to the store!
I baked the flour tortilla and it turned out pretty well- not as good for you as the corn variety but not as bad as a fried flour tortilla  (although you have to prevent that puffy stage)!
Thanks for the great recipe ideas- and I really enjoy jumping on and getting updates on your life there!

I commend you for making your own pizza dough, but did you know as another alternative you can buy unbaked dough from a pizzeria? In fact, just last week I purchased a large dough for $2.50 from Nick's (one of the best pizza places in NYC), conveniently located across the street from Natural.
Kim
2004-01-05 16:14:00
I love Nick's. How do you bake the pizza when you get it home? Do you get similar results to Nick's crust?

Do you just drop by, or do you have to call them ahead of time?

Good luck with your yeast baking Kim, 
I look forward to reading about how everything turned out.
Josh

You don't need to call ahead. I just walked right in.  They will give it to you right away, coated in flour or in oil and in a to-go tin. I actually didn't make pizza, but used the dough to make focaccia (approx. 15 minutes at 450 degrees), so whether a pizza would come out as good at home is still an unknown. The focaccia came out very nicely (will post soon).

I think it's conceivable that you could replicate Nick's crust at home since they use a gas oven, but of course the temperature of their oven is likely much, much higher than anything you could achieve with an oven at home. I would think baking a pizza at at 450 to 500 degrees for 10 minutes or so would work, or just following the baking directions of any other pizza recipe.

Looking forward to hearing how the homemade dough turns out.

That's Todd's mom's, actually (or I could've called them Crisco's peanut butter cookies, but that doesn't have quite the same ring). They're about two inches across and thin and crispy (but not crumbly), with tiny bits of peanut throughout. They're the kind with the crisscrossed fork marks on top (ah, childhood). Linda (Todd's mom) suggests flouring the fork if it sticks to the cookies when you press them down. Cream together 3/4 cup crunchy peanut butter, 1/2 cup shortening, 1 1/4 cups light-brown sugar, 3 tablespoons milk and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Add 1 egg and mix. Combine 1 3/4 cups flour, 3/4 teaspoon salt and 3/4 teaspoon baking soda, then add that to the creamed mixture. Drop by heaping teaspoonfuls and then flatten with a fork, making perpendicular marks. Bake in a 375 degree oven 7 or 8 minutes until browned around the edges. I haven't made these myself, but I have eaten a large enough number of them to be able to recommend the recipe (and to have gained a pound or two, too, I would think).

Do I have to say this? I almost hate to do it. I was passing through Madison Square Park at lunchtime today, so I stopped by the hot dog stand to try their New York hot dog. I had tried the Chicago dog a little more than a week ago. I think it's kind of overrated. I know, it's a hot dog, so how great can it be? But with all that stuff on top, you can hardly taste the dog. The New York dog comes with a big gooey mess of onions, sauerkraut, mustard and ketchup, which kind of hides the hot dog taste and texture (maybe that's the point, but if you don't like hot dogs, you just shouldn't eat them). The Chicago hot dog is kind of nice. It also has a little too much stuff, but it's fresh, clean-tasting stuff, like lettuce, tomatoes and hot peppers, neon green relish and atomic yellow mustard. The crunchiness of the toppings is a nice contrast to the snap and bite of the meat (am I allowed to call it meat?). That's not to say I wouldn't be there often if I worked in the area. And the price is really right for both. I'm just finding that I might be a bit of a hot-dog purist. (That's quite a contradiction in terms, isn't it?)

oh, and not to be an obsessive commentator, after all, but as far as too much fresh pasta goes you can put cut fresh pasta in the freezer, let it dry there for a bit, then wrap it tightly (try making \"nests\" of fettucine and then putting them into ziplock freezer bags once frozen enough not to stick. And take the term \"nests\" literally loosely!! As long as it is in managable bundles, fine). It keeps reasonably well for two weeks.  Just cook it longer after.  I learned this from a friend who learned it from her (very modern) Italian mother.

I had leftover pasta dough from this weekend's ravioli, so last night while Todd was at class I rolled it out, cut it into squares and boiled it. I sauteed the rest of the Swiss chard and tossed it with the pasta and some ravioli filling (ricotta, Parmesan, salt, pepper, parsley). The instructor at my pasta class said she usually figures one serving per egg (the recipe we used had three eggs, 2 1/2 cups flour), but I found that's way too much. So I had leftovers today for lunch. But it felt indulgent last night to be rolling out my single serving of fresh pasta, just for me. It's too bad pasta dough doesn't stay fresh for long in the fridge; otherwise I'd keep some in there all the time.

So our Sunday will be immortalized! We went to Bryant Park to be part of The Unbelievable Show's attempt to beat the Guinness World Record for the biggest picnic, and they succeeded. I'm actually kind of surprised; the park wasn't crowded at all, but there was a mammoth street fair stretching all the way from 42nd street to Central Park (it looked like) on 6th Avenue, a huge sea of people that could contribute to the effort. The lemonade had not thawed, but we didn't get rained on, and I started a book I'm really enjoying, so it was good.

It can be done. I did it yesterday. I made pasta by hand, with only flour, salt, eggs, a rolling pin and a knife. It helps to have some very strong arms (the pasta that Todd, taking pity on my, rolled out turned out much better than my too-thick pasta). The dough started to get kind of rubbery toward the end of the rolling, and would contract back after every roll. I think letting it rest for a few minutes helped, but it would have been even better if I were a more patient and persistant person. I think I've decided to go ahead and get a hand-cranked pasta machine, since they don't seem to take up that much space. Homemade pasta is so different from anything else, and it'd be so easy with a machine. I have a little bit of pasta dough left, and I think I'm going to experiment with some other shapes for my dinner tomorrow (I made ravioli yesterday).

Peach Ice Cream

The ingredients to the ice cream I just made, as they would appear on the side of the package: peaches, heavy cream, sugar, lemon juice, vanilla extract, salt. I can't bring myself to buy vanilla beans, especially if vanilla isn't the primary flavor. Here, the flavor's peach, all the way through. It's a recipe I cut out of a New York Times Magazine. First you peel and coarsely chop the peaches. I had three sad-looking, wrinkly peaches that inspired me to make the ice cream, because every time I walked by them, I'd get a tease of their aroma, but they didn't look very appetizing. They were heaven, though. The skins peeled right off, without a knife or blanching, and then my knife went right through the flesh, which came right off the pitt. Add 1/4 cup sugar, a sprinkling of salt and a squeeze of lemon juice, then let them sit and macerate for half an hour. While that's doing, combine 2 cups heavy cream with 6 tablespoons sugar and heat until the sugar dissolves. Then add a teaspoon vanilla and let it cool. When the peaches' half hour is over, pour the cream over them and put it in the fridge to chill. (Here's where things got frustrating for me. I had started chilling my ice cream maker canister about 8 hours before, and it wasn't enough time, but I started making the ice cream anyway, and it just wouldn't freeze. It may be obvious to most, but make sure the ice cream canister is frozen and the mixture is chilled before proceeding. I just put the mixture back in the fridge and refroze the canister, trying again at about midnight last night.) Do the ice cream maker thing to it, and then chill it in the freezer for some extra time or go ahead and eat it soft-serve. I do think, next time, I might use fewer peaches, and cut them into smaller chunks. The chunks get kind of sorbet textured, frozen and cold, inside the creamy ice cream. The peaches release all this juice so everything ends up tasting like peach, and the ice cream part gets this pale peachy color. You've gotta love summer.

So my lovely new wife and I are hoping to find a place to go peach and raspberry picking this upcoming weekend to obtain my two favorite fruits so we can perhaps make a cobbler or a pie.  When I typed \"peach, pick, and new york\" into google, I was delighted to see this great blog show up as the 5th site listed.  Now, if we can actually find a place in the tri-state area to pick peaches in august, I hope we can try the peach ice cream with our extra peaches-it sounds delicious and yes, i too really do love summer.  (By the way, Kim, those Greek meatballs were fabulous-I haven't forgotten to comment, just waiting until we have my friends over for dinner next weekend-we're going to make your meatballs as part of an all-Greek themed meal.  We'll let you know how it goes. Glad you enjoyed our baklava.)

Hi, Eric
Ooooh, I am jealous of you. Todd and I went apple picking last year with Julie and David, but he hates that kind of thing because picking apples used to be one of his chores. Let me know where you ended up going, how you liked it, and if they have anything left. I might have to persuade Todd to take me sometime.

I've decided on a menu for the World-Record-Breaking picnic in Bryant Park tomorrow (see entry below): steak salad with blue cheese, red onion, walnuts and greens, almond madeleines (which I made yesterday) and lemonade. The madeleine recipe I used is from Ladies' Home Journal. I don't know if it's the recipe or the weather, but even though they taste good and have a nice, fluffy texture, they've become a little sticky on the side that was up top during baking. I guess it's been pretty humid here, so I shouldn't blame the recipe. Mix 1/2 cup sugar with 3 eggs, then add 3/4 cup flour, 1/4 cup finely ground almonds, 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/8 teaspoon salt. Mix until combined, then pour in 1/2 cup melted unsalted butter and 1/2 teaspoon each vanilla and almond extract. Let it sit, covered, at room temperature 20 minutes, then spoon into madeleine mold (I had found a mini-madeleine mold on the giveaway table at work, so I ended up making almost 100 little cakes instead of the 24 specified in the recipe - it was one of those rubbery \"pans,\" and I think I approve, even though I was skeptical at first - the madeleines popped right out, and I hear that getting them out of the pan is usually a big problem with traditional pans). Made the lemonade same as last time, then stuck it in the freezer in plastic bottles so it'll be cold for the picnic. Oh, and we didn't go to Dos Caminos the other night. The reservation was late, so I made an earlier one at Noche, then Todd decided he'd rather have barbecue so we went to Virgil's instead. We love Virgil's (well, Todd loves it, and I'm kind of a fan). It's not fine dining, but I love the cheesy grits, which are the epitome of comfort food to me, and the ribs are good and plentiful so you're eating them for the whole week (at least, the next day).

Hi Kim-
Your cookies look wonderful. I especially like the way the biscotti turrned out. I've always had trouble slicing mine so that they turn out looking like yours. I always end up with chubby little versions of the long cookie. Is there a technique to how you slice them?
Kim
2003-12-15 15:21:00
I've only used one basic recipe for biscotti, from Cooking Light, and varied it in different ways. The batter turns out really sticky and kind of thin, so I tend to form it into two wide slabs instead of logs, which is where the length comes from (when I slice them crosswise). The loaves turn out so wide that just slice them straight across (not diagonal). I know it's not the way it's supposed to work, but it works for me.

I have friends who live out in Forest Hills and rave about Cheeses of the World ;) Anyway, there's nothing wrong with your madeleines getting sticky the next day - it's what happens with all madeleines the day after they've been baked. They're sort of like baguette in that they taste and feel different the day they're made and mildly deteriorate after that.

Well, Todd was in North Carolina for a couple of days, so I had Three Whole Days of eating whatever I wanted and I blew it, sort of. Actually, Tuesday night I toasted a pita in the oven, then spread goat cheese on it and topped it with peppers I had roasted the night before, and that was pretty good with a lettuce salad and homemade vinaigrette. Last night I had Amy's Bread sourdough toasted with goat cheese, cranberry chutney and smoked turkey (my new favorite combo), like a crostini or open-face sandwich. Also good with some salad and a glass of wine. Basically the same thing I had on Tuesday, with different bread and some different toppings. Tonight we're going to Dos Caminos to celebrate some good news at Todd's work, so I'll report back on that.

A group of people are trying to break the Guiness record for the largest picnic this Sunday, August 3, from noon to 2 in Bryant Park. The current record, according to the group, is 1,059 people, which I would think gets broken every Monday night when they show those films in the park (shows how adept I am at estimating the size of crowds). I think I read somewhere that you have to bring two food items for lunch, plus a drink, to qualify as a picnicker, and you have to register when you arrive at one of the booths. There'll be live music, too, and City Harvest will also be there collecting donations. Here are some links: www.theunbelievable.com www.bryantpark.org/calendar/aug.php Given my affinity for picnics, I can imagine no better way for me to have my little moment in the history books (using a very loose definition of \"history\"). Now I just have to figure out what to bring food-wise.

Is almond meal the same as powdered almonds, you think, or is it more of an almond *flour*? In any case, this sounds unusual and great, and would probably be fantastic with fish, too : trouts are often served with toasted slivered almonds.

And I have to agree about the fresh herbs. They're something of a pain (they're yet another ingredient to think about buying, and then they end up just collecting mold in the fridge) but they make all the difference in the world!

I'm not sure what the difference between almond flour and powdered almonds is. This is just almonds, but they're ground so fine that it's like flour (actually, probably more like cornmeal). I saw a recipe for cookies made with ground almonds and hazelnuts, then sandwiched together with chocolate, on another blog. Sounds good. My problem this time of year is deciding what to make among all the good cookies out there.

I bought a pint of blueberries and 1/2 pints of raspberries and blackberries on Saturday to make a summer pudding and then decided I didn't want to use all those beautiful berries in one place, so I used 2 1/2 cups-worth to make mixed-berry sorbet (the rest I'm working on, but I mashed some raspberries with sugar to top my yogurt this morning, and ate some more, plain, with lunch). The recipe was simple, and the results were fantastic: creamy and smooth, a pretty red color and bright berry flavor. First I pureed the berries with 1/2 cup water in the blender, then I strained the mixture to get out the seeds and skin (I had about 2 cups puree). Mixed in almost a cup of sugar, juice of 1 lemon and 1 tablespoon Cointreau (I think the alcohol actually helps the texture by keeping the mixture from freezing solid - just a theory). Chilled the mixture, then froze it in the ice freezer, where it really did become an eatable consistency. Then I put it in a plastic container to freeze further.

Todd and I get together with a group of friends on a regular basis to cook, and last night our theme was Greek food. We each take a recipe or two, and all the needed ingredients, to one person's house, and then we prepare a meal together. Last night we had haloumi, a Greek salad, spinach pie, meatballs with bulgur, baklava, ambrosia, lemonade, coffee and the only dry Greek wine at our local wine shop. I made the lemonade and meatballs. I had to partially prepare the meatballs ahead because the mixture has to sit for at least an hour, and up to four, before you form it into balls. I think it's because you add 1/2 cup dry coarse bulgur to the mixture, and the bulgur needs time to soak up moisture from the meat and other meatball ingredients. (I bought the bulgur bulk from a little place I found last week across 9th Ave from Port Authority. I think it's called International Food Shop or something like that, and it has all kinds of bulk bins of spices and grains in addition to olives and a load of other stuff, cheap.) To make the meatball mixture, I combined 1 pound total ground sirloin, pork and veal with the bulgur, 4 finely minced small scallions, about 1 cup parsley, minced, 2 minced cloves of garlic, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1 beaten egg, 1 teaspoon cumin and salt and pepper to taste. That's what has to sit in the refrigerator for an hour. Then you form them into meatballs (mine were a bit bigger than 1 tablespoon each) and put them back in the fridge while you make the sauce: Sautee 1 onion, cut in half and sliced into half-moons, until their soft and getting brown. Add 2 chopped cloves garlic and stir a bit, then 1/2 cup dry red wine, letting it bubble for about a minute. Then 2 cups \"grated\" tomatoes (this was a great trick; you grate the tomatoes on the large holes of a grater, and you only get the pulp and seeds, not the skin) and 1 cinnamon stick. Add the meatballs, bring it back to a boil, add 1/2 cup water, and simmer 20 minutes until they're done. The note on the recipe said they'll still be red when you cut into them, and mine were pink in places (I think I read somewhere that it has something to do with a chemical in the onions?). The recipe didn't say anything about letting them sit off the heat for about 10 minutes, but that's what I ended up doing last night (the baklava was being assembled on the dining room table, so we had to wait), and I think it was key to the flavor. When they were first done cooking, they were kind of bland and sitting in quite a bit of the sauce. I salted them up a bit and left them to sit. When we were ready to eat, they had soaked up a lot more of the juice and the flavor had improved dramatically. Sprinkled parsley on top so it'd be pretty. Lemonade was easy: Simmered 1 1/2 cups each water and sugar until sugar dissolved, added 2 cups lemon juice (took me about 12 lemons) and a thinly sliced lemon, and then added cold water to taste. It was all good, and we even had a little taste of walnut-honey heaven to bring home with us and snack on today.

This was pretty good. I liked the cranberry topping, even though it's not the prettiest thing (it ends up being kind of a red mush on top of the cake, which is a pretty, vivid color but not visually appealing texture-wise). The cake was a good foil to the tart topping, bland and sweet, but not the best texture. It was almost too light, making the cake top-heavy. If I made this again I might use the same topping but try to find a denser cake.

This is not to say we haven't enjoyed it.

Learning to Make Fresh Pasta

***CONTENT
This is the fresh parpadelle I made. Yesterday I took a basic fresh pasta class at the Institute for Culinary Education (formerly Peter Kump's) on 23rd Street between 5th and 6th Aves. It's the second cooking class I've taken, and the first at ICE. I took a From the Greenmarket class at the New School last year, which I thoroughly enjoyed. The New School class seemed more like a bunch of people getting together to cook a huge meal from ingredients at the farmers' market; the class I took yesterday seemed slightly more like being in cooking school. They have big kitchens with multiple stainless steel tables and professional-ish equipment, and we each got to make our own batch of fresh pasta. Yesterday we were left to our own devices to a greater degree, which is a little annoying when you've got a time limit in an unfamiliar kitchen, but is kind of nice, too. It's like they have a little faith in our abilities. Anyway, making fresh pasta is definitely something I'll try to do again here at home. You start with 2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour. Then, using a fork, beat three eggs with 1 teaspoon salt. Make a well in the flour and pour in the egg mixture. Then, using the fork you used to beat the eggs, continue to stir the eggs, incorporating more and more of the flour until it starts to resemble dough. Then start grabbing and kneading it with your hands, incorporating as much of the flour as you can. Turn it out of the bowl and continue to work it until it feels smooth and dry, almost a little rubbery. You'll be amazed at how stiff and dry the dough is; you can add water if necessary, but I didn't need to (I kept thinking I needed to, but when I broke the dough ball open, the inside was still a little sticky). Then you have to leave it alone for at least half an hour, wrapped in plastic in the refrigerator. We made chicken ragu, a 4-cheese sauce, a tomato and basil sauce and, my favorite, ricotta ravioli with sauteed Swiss chard and arugula. The filling consisted of 2 cups ricotta, 1/4 cup grated Parmesan, 2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley, and salt and pepper to taste. Then you sautee garlic in oil and add Swiss chard, arugula, salt and pepper and cook until the greens are wilted. Each group made all four sauces, so all four of us at my table were racing around at this point, trying to get all the sauces done in time. After the sauces were completed, we used pasta machines to roll out the dough and cut the shapes, flouring the pasta and putting it on a floured rimmed baking sheet when it was finished. For the ravioli, you roll the pasta out into sheets, make mounds of the filling along one long side of the sheet, brush the top of the other long side of the sheet with beaten egg, and fold it over, pushing out the air as you seal the top layer of pasta around each mound of filling. Then cut into rustic ravioli squares. Then you cook it up in boiling water, toss it in a saute pan with one of the sauces, and voila! We didn't learn how to hand-roll pasta, which is what I'm going to have to do (too bad, because using the pasta maker was pretty easy and it seems like hand-rolling it is really impractical). It's so satisfying, though, to make your own pasta, and fresh pasta is such a different taste and texture than dried.

Hi,
I've been really enjoying your blog for several weeks now, and I just wanted to drop you a note to say so. I have a lot of spare time at work, and I've endlessly searched the web for good stuff to read, and this is one of my favorite food blogs. I had a question about the gnocchi- when you mix in the eggs with the potatoes, are the potatoes still warm? i'm never really sure what to do when i have to mix eggs with something hot- i don't want to accidentally cook the eggs, and i don't want what i'm working with to get too cold and unworkable.
sorry for the really long comment.
Kim
2003-12-02 17:06:00
I'm glad you like it. 

I had the same thought you did about adding eggs to warm potatoes. The potatoes are still kind of warm when you mix the egg in (I think they need to be, because you want to get all the benefit from the starch in them or something like that). But they cool off quite a bit while you're peeling, and then putting them through the food mill makes little worm-shaped potato, which cools off even faster. 

The short answer is, they didn't end up being hot enough to cook the egg. I put them in one at a time, and then I stirred it all up as soon as each one was in there. No cooked egg pieces at all.

I love, love, love that Nick's is our local pizzeria, although I can't imagine taking it out. I'm sure it's fine once you've carried it home from the restaurant, the cheese cooling and congealing, the crust getting flabby, the sauce getting cold. But it's a transporting experience dining in. There's always a moment, when Todd and I are about halfway through inhaling a small pie, that we look up, interrupt whatever we're talking about, and smile around our chewing. It's good to be alive. Nick's pizza is one of those thin, crispy, burnt on the bottom crust, just enough sauce and cheese, and fresh strips of basil sort of pizzas. We start with a green salad, which is coated with a great vinaigrette and comes with four cherry tomato halves and a generous grind of fresh black pepper. When the pizza comes to the table, it's just barely cool enough to eat, and there's a moment a few minutes later when the pizza's the perfect temperature, and every bite holds a hint, a sweet tease, of oregano. I'm ashamed to say, from beginning to end, we don't really linger; we gorge. We can be in and out of Nick's in 30 minutes. But it's a happy 30 minutes, and the glow can last hours. They've apparently opened a new restaurant in Manhattan (upper east side?) and serve pasta there. As long as our Queens outlet doesn't change, that doesn't bother me.

This one's from Martha's Everday Foods. Can't say that I'm 100 percent sold on the crust, which is delicious but much too crumbly. (I suspect it might have been a problem when they were testing it, too, because there's a note on the recipe that says something about the crust materials seeming crumbly but coming together just fine once you press it into the pan. Hmmm.) Anyway, to make this overly crumbly crust, pulse 5 graham crackers, 1/2 cup toasted nuts (recipe said pecans, I had walnuts) and some sugar (2 tablespoons). Add some melted butter (3 tablespoons) and process until combined. Pour into 9-inch pie plate and press to the bottom and sides. Bake in 350 degree oven for about 8 minutes. To make the filling, mix 14-ounce can sweetened condensed milk with 2 egg yolks, then mix in 1/2 cup fresh lemon juice and pour it into the cooled crust. Bake for another 15 minutes, then let cool. Refrigerate for an hour. The crust is tasty, nutty and buttery, but, as I mentioned before, too crumbly. The filling, though, is great: smooth, cool, the tang of lemon balancing the sweetness.

Thanks for the review.  Got to admit that I live around the corner from the place, but the cavernous space and empty tables have kept me from going in.  Besides, I'm inordinately fond of Noodle Pudding's Italian fare right down Henry Street.  Guess I'm going to have to check it out and post a little review of my own.  If they are consistently good, it's a definite winner...

I just stopped by your site; you eat out a lot! Sounds like you try some pretty good places, too. If you go to Palmira's I'd like to hear what you think. It was a bit uncomfortable to eat in such an empty place, which does tend to affect the whole experience. 
I usually go to a different place every time I go out, so I've only been to Palmira's the one time (can't say anything about the consistency of the food at Palmira's).

Finally, a resturant that has staying power.  It's so much brighter and comfortable than the previous encounters.  The food is incredible, and yes, everyone is very accomodating.  You feel like you're out for a special occasion, but the check doesn't say that.  
I no longer live in brooklyn, but don't mind the drive.

I've eaten at Palmira's many times, and have found that it has only gotten better each time.  Everything over the last couple of months has improved dramatically -- the food, the service and the ambiance.  They also have a great wine list.  It is quite a large place, and it is a great place to have a party which we did about a month ago.  Everyone had a terrific time.  It certainly is worth a try.

Instead of going for the snap peas or cherries at the farmers' market this weekend, I bought these beautiful little bok choy, which inspired me to stir-fry last night, which is something we used to do all the time but haven't had for a while. First I stir-fried sliced tender, inner celery stalks, diced red pepper and carrots shredded with a peeler. Then I added the bok choy and cooked it for a couple more minutes. Removed that from the pan, added more oil, then added cut-up chicken, stir-frying it until cooked. Then a tablespoon of Thai chili sauce with garlic, 2 tablespoons soy sauce, 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar and a glop of honey (I never measure honey - too messy). Stirred in the veggies, then 1 teaspoon cornstarch dissolved into 1/2 cup chicken broth. Let it all thicken, then served over rice. Still have more bok choy, so I'm going to try it raw next, maybe with a peanut or ginger dressing.

my friend ralph makes a super thai curry with bok choy (it's called pak soi here): he stirfries the sliced thicker stalks with diced chicken and lots of garlic, scallions and then thai green curry paste, adds coconut milk, lets it briefly bubble, then throws in the tender leaves and lots of basil. it's simple but SO delicious. it's on the table in like 5 minutes and it receives hours of compliments...

So tonight I need to use up the rest of the bok choy. I think I want to try it raw, though, although the Asian-influenced dishes you two mentioned give me some ideas. Maybe a ginger dressing with red pepper strips and scallions? I guess I'll experiment a bit tonight (husband's going to be in class).

We went to the Cloisters yesterday, a beautiful, sunny, breezy day, and had a picnic in Tryon Park, which is the rambling, rocky park visitors must walk through to get to the museum. I packed sweet-tart, ripe plums and smoked turkey wraps with provolone (mine had apple-cranberry chutney; Todd's had mustard). We ate sitting on a park bench watching a boy try to learn to catch a baseball, then walked around the museum for a while. My favorite part of the Cloisters is the edibles garden, where they have fig, quince, pear and olive trees, as well as lots of greens and herbs. Got some ice cream from the truck at the entrance to the park, then took the subway down to the Union Square farmers' market. It was a perfect day.

This recipe was from Martha Stewart Living, and it only has three ingredients and is the simplest ice cream imaginable: a 15-ounce can unsweetened coconut milk, 1 1/2 cups half-and-half (it works out to be equal amounts coconut milk and half-and-half) and 3/4 cup sugar, mixed together and then frozen in an ice cream machine then transferred to another container to be frozen for hard-pack style. I found the half-and-half kind of rich, with a little bit of that feeling that the roof of my mouth was coated with it when I was done, but not in an entirely unpleasant way. It was a little icy, too, but that may be because of my ice cream machine: It's the kind with the cylinder that needs to be frozen, then you hand-crank it every 4 or 5 minutes for about half an hour. Done! I think I need to try a custard-based ice cream, though, to see if the texture is a result of the machine or the recipe I use.

Todd and I were walking around the flatiron district last night, looking for a place to eat, when we noticed a great big clog of people on the sidewalk up ahead. It looked like they were filming something. There was a thick, red carpet to the front door of a resaurant, and lots of very attractive people milling around outside, guarding a velvet rope. Is the velvet-rope feeling what that new show, The Restaurant, is going for? I guess the sight of all those well-heeled young people guarding the gates of an exclusive new restaurant sort of deflated me about the whole concept of the show. I thought it was going to be more of a gritty, what-goes-on-behind-the-scenes kind of thing, not a look-at-all-the-beautiful-people-and-their-dramatic-lives kind of thing. I don't even know if I'll watch it now. (Although I think I will - maybe it'll be both.) Is it going to be about the food at all?

The longer I watch this show I really wish that everyone of his waiters and the rest of his help would tell him what a ___ up he is and walk out on him.  It is not the waiters fault when the kitchen help screws up.  He is to interested in flirting with all the girls than he is about what is going on in the resturant.  Then he has to have him MOM go and try to smooth things out for him.  He is a big JOKE.  If he doesn't change his attitude I hope he fails big time.

I watched the show for the first time today and thought that the owners behavior was not that great. Looking at it in another perspective, it is difficult to run your own business. Also, the show has hours of footage that they condense into a half hour time slot. There might be many positive reactions that are not shown.

Where does one begin? I am a classically trained professional chef who has been working throughout the Beverly Hills area for 14 years. I must say that I originally ADORED Rocco on the Food Network's Melting Pot program. Now, it's next to impossible to even think about him as a true talent, let alone ever watch a program involving him EVER again. Not to mention the fact that I shall never set foot into one of his restaurants and support him. He is a cad, stumbling over himself and his big, fat, undeserved attitude and arrogance. His capitalistic attitude, constantly referencing his deep-pocketed sponsors, Am-Ex & Coors are truly offensive and distastful. And his disbelief of the injury sustained by his waiter on HIS property is not only disturbing, but opens him up to the world's biggest lawsuit. What an absolute idiot! And bringing his mommy around to the fuming customers was laughable and pathetic. The most repulsive was him sticking his tongue in a customer's ear and letting her pet him under the table, as he refers to his growing excitement over this matter. How dare he blame his overworked, underpaid waitstaff for his and his kitchen's unpreparedness? How dare he? He has to remember that he should be grateful for having kind and talented enough waiters to deal with his system that clearly doesn't work. He spoke down to them and told the \"children\" to quiet down as they voiced their displeasure with the myriad restaurant problems. I agree with the previous writer that indeed he is a big joke. He's digging himself an early grave and it's well deserved.

I keep forgetting to watch the show, then I'm kicking myself on Monday morning, but now I don't feel that bad about missing it. (Unless it's fun to watch him go down in flames?) The kitchen manager, who on the first show seemed really great and grounded, appeared to be very happy to be working for Rocco. I think I'd watch just to see how he's taking it all (seeing someone he admired - Rocco - brought so low).

Rocco's has so much potential, and could be a very successful restaurant. I think Rocco, needs to tone it down a bit, his manager should be taking the slack off his back. Rocco is the \"host\", his manager needs to do the running, serving, making sure food is cooked on time. I have been in the restaurant business for 10 years. I have worked in the front of the house, back of the house, serving, cooking, hostessing, managing, bartending among other tasks. I have brought business up in every restaurant I have ever worked in at least 90%. God the things I could do with this place are absolutely amazing. I wish I could be there and bring it out of the water, but in the mean time I guess watching will have to be satisfying. Good Luck Rocco. Nicki G.

As a resturant manager, it's exciting for me to know that the public gets to see the behind the stage action.  Working in a resturant is not easy, and I am hoping the viewers will be be enlightened by the show.  At the same time it's a very stressful show, I wanted to jump through the TV and fix things.
However, you have to keep in mind this resturant has a added factor most businesses do not - a TV SHOW!  It has to add more drama - it helps the ratings.  Rocco has to be out on the floor - selling himself - it brings the guest and the rating count up.  He has a team of managers that should be able to hold the place together.  
I'm shocked by some of the ways issues are handled, like hiring back the bartender - Pure Stupidity - He should have known she would walk back in the joint and show of her promotion and favoritism.  She showed she was in no way professional enough for a management position.  Never reward a quitter.  The staff's reaction is justifable, but I still think some of them have a small case of The Drama queen syndrome.

PS - As a manager I think it is completely inappropriate to take a staff memeber for a ride on a scooter. Come on  - Think Rocco Think!

Rocco;
  Love your show !!! The Best Of Luck. Remember the customer is always right. Love your style. Isn't life great, you have it all. Wish I could be there in the hub of resturant life.

Rocco is unprofessional. Taking the quitter bartender on a jaunt and giving her a scooter was assine. She should have been canned immediately - because bragging was meanspirited. From now on I will be more patient with waiters etc. I had NO idea this kinda stuff went on in restaurants.  Their jobs are extremely hard to do!  Most of the people in this place are dedicated and do a very good job!

First of all to all those people who are putting the restaurant and/or Rocco down.  You don't know who this person trully is, you see what's on t.v., and like one of the other commentors stated there are probably hundreds of reams of film and they are showing only what pertains to that actual show.  So, in essence if a show that Sunday is about the staff getting upset or blah, blah ,blah, than that's what they will show.  If that episode is about the staff being happy and joyful and blah blah than that's the footage they will use.  It's all about the ratings for a t.v. show-HELLO!?  To sit there and state that you think he is a _________ and he's a this and he's a that... do you kow him personally? do you know what's he's like under pressure? I know I am not the same person when I am under pressure, attitudes change and people react differently.  Just remember it's not the wait staff whose name is on the canopy outside the restaurant, it's Rocco's and if it fails than it's on him.  His managers need to step it up and take some of the pressure and the stress off of him and get the wait staff in check.  Working in a restaurant is stressful and they will experience growing pains... my advice to the wait staff is to suck it up and do your job, stop bitching and if you can't- move on! They are loads of wait staffers in New York who would give there right arm to be working with such a wonderful chef as Rocco DiSpirito.

In a \"small correction\" note to a fellow poster dated 8-11-03 @ 9:01 a.m. US Eastern Time:

Dear ***,

       While I agree that the idea of bribing an employee back to work with a ride on a scooter, is an absurd idea, I think that you are misinformed.  Rocco did not give the bartender a 'ride' on the Vesba.  He gave her, the Vesba.   I think it's sad how the gay man went through so much stress, in deciding on whether or not to quit, so that he could get his very  own SUV on the rehire bribing tip, when we know Rocco isn't going to give him anything like that. Rocco did that on a panicked spur of the moment.  He freaked, made a bad decision (as he's known for), and that was that.  Very unprofessional indeed.   What also was unprofessional,  was that bartender not keeping her trap shut.  I don't think she bragged to be mean, I think she is just immature and didn't think before she opened her big mouth.

Also,  I watched the show for the first and last time last night.  I did notice right off, his flirtatious nature with the ladies, and how he described it as \"being with his guests\". What about the rest of them, Roc?
My mother who watches on a regular basis says \"Well of course it's not going to run that smooth, it's only been open a week\".  Dear Mother, Rocco has two other restaraunts open, and he should know by now, what works and what doesn't.  Clearly he does not.  And by this, we would think that the other two stores are not running too nicely, either.   \"It's the staff\".  If it's the staff, he should have picked his staff more carefully, thus to run a more clean and smooth restaraunt.  Rocco is a child, playing an adult game.  This is Rocco, turning his own dream into a nightmare.

As a Culinary Institute of America grad and chef myself, will someone please help me understand why Rocco refuses to stop flirting with the guests and get into the kitchen especially when the food is coming out \"piping cold\" and from what I can see not very appealing to the eye.  Sure it is important to be in the front talking to the guests, but there will be no customers to schmooze with if the food continues to sucks and they stop coming in!!

I'm glad I had the opportunity to see what all this hype was about relating to Rocco's.  The buzz has been extreme.

A Doctor from California who is coming to NYC for the US Tennis Open was asking me what I knew of it and I just really didn't know anything about it at all...it wasn't on my list of nice places.  So I told her that I had no idea and couldn't say one way or the other.  But did recommend the TV program to her.

Well, who knows?  Maybe it is a nice place most of the time.  But after that little peek inside this operation and seeing things occur as they did, I can only come to one conclusion.  I probably will never know.  I don't see me going there any time soon to be totally honest.

As an alternative to Rocco's... I do have another suggestion.  Should you find yourself in New York City on the isle of Manhattan go to Homestead, instead!  This operation rich in history and quality would be my personal first choice between the two:

Having watched this show from the beiginning I am relieved to see that FINALLY Rocco has gone into the kitchen for a night. He is after all a Chef, and from the pr5esentation of the food a good one at that. He should leave the running of the front to his Managers and come out to see how it's going a few times a night, but spend less time being a celebrity and more time as a Chef. From one Chef to another it makes a difference!

I had high hopes for Rocco, but with each passing episode, my disappointment and disgust grows exponentially.  It all started with how he treated Gideon then continued with how he repeatedly mishandles the other kitchen midadventures and his staffing problems (most of which were self-created).

I hate to point out the painfully obvious, but can someone give this guy a swift kick in the pants and send him back to the kitchen where he belongs ?! Let Mama do the shmoozing !  She's better at it anyhow.  The food will drastically improve, the customers will be happier and so will the staff. Why call it Rocco's when Rocco's no where near the kitchen  ???

One last thing.  Laurent is useless.  How is this man earning his paycheck - that's assuming he got one ? (I won't even get into the labor standard violations and dangerous working conditions for the kitchen staff).  Hope dear 'ol Rocco's got lots of insurance, he's gonna need it.

First of all, I know I'm going against the obvious negative vibe that has been firmly established on this page, but what that hell, ambiguity affords such pleasures.

Gideon is an idiot.  His arm is not broken PERIOD.  I'm a doctor, if his arm was broken, it would have been secured with a cast and not put in a 50-cent sling.  While I'm quick to judge Gideon (due to the fact that...like I just said...he's an idiot) I don't think I can black robe and gavel the rest of the crew.  Editing does amazing things to perceptions, and I for one, don't feel obligated to allow some college kid to forge my opinions of some with his witty editing skills.  Rocco is doing as good as he can with what he has.  Give the guy a break.  At least he’s out there making things happen; giving losers like us something to discuss and debate.  Once you’ve grown the meatballs to start your own business while the entire country watches then you can talk to me about Rocco’s skillz.

I've been following this show since its premeire,as entertaining as this new concept of reality tv is, I can only walk away from it every week feeling the same thing- sorry for poor Rocco! As charismatic as he is, it might not save his dream of running his own restruant, not if he continues on the path that he's on. Yes, yes, it's easy to criticize from the outside, but when something isn't working, whether it be a result from poor hr management skills, to actually not being in the kitchen to oversee the food as he should be - hello he's the chef- something has to give. I hope Rocco gets a clue soon and comes up w/ some permanent slouable solutions to his ever growing lists of problems, or his dream will no longer be !

2003-08-18 12:03:00
When the show started, I thought it would be most interesting to watch and I allowed myself to get wrapped up in it.  I'm over it now.  What a dissapointment!  I understand that what we are permitted to see is only a part of what really happens, but what I have seen is enough to really turn me off.  And I know that the resturant business is highly competitive, and it's a \"dog eat dog\" mentality.  But you don't degrade and whip those who started out on your side, like Rocco has done with his staff. When he does acknowledge a mistake, his apologies are a quick after-thought, not in the least sincere. I feel sorry for his mom, she is being played like a fine tuned violin.  Rocco saw this \"survior\" type show as a way to make a name for himself, and therefore his resturants.  There was big $$$$ to be had, and he is banking that the publicity will see him through financially.  That's what it's all about, isn't it?  There are those who aplaud Rocco for doing this.  It's all about $$$$.  And those gruppies who wanted the chance to be on TV and get the \"special treatment\" from Rocco...get a life!  Is this what it's like in most resturants?  Give me an small old fashioned diner anytime!

I have watched this show since the beginning. I too am Italian. This concept of French bistro surroundings and paper boats don't cut it. If he truly is a good or even great chef, he needs to get in the kitchen. As for the Manager - fire him. He is supposed to take all the crap. I can do a better job. As for the food, keep it hot. Rocco stop flirting. Good luck

I think millions of people are hoping this loser Rocco crashes and burns. I think the network probably looked for a spoiled, arrogant, self-important restauranteur, so that we would all cheer when he falls on his ass, like 90% do. I realize that the show is edited for effect, but does anyone really believe that Rocco is a nice guy on the floor of the editing room?
Ricky

Hmmmmmmmmm
Paper plates and silver?
Ego the size of Michigan?
Mommy bailing Rocco out of PR incidents?
Hiring back the bartender?
Calling people \"baby's\" for lying?
Token feigned empathy for overworked and underappreciated employees?
Kitchen Mgr. too preoccupied with sucking up to boss and cameras?
Kitchen located so far from floor that food gets cold?
Rocco serving? (for a few minutes at least)
Flies in the kitchen?
Kitchen fire and restaurant stays open?!?! (FYI :: health code violation in case toxic fumes were released and fire extinguisher emitted contaminants)
Sweaty chefs dripping in food?
Sending injured and offended worker home after working to fulfull Rocco's dream?
Cold food...constantly?
Unpaid bills and payroll?
Inexperienced weekly attempts at a reorg. that might produce results?
Etc. etc.

What would I do?
Take bus. Mgt. 101 to start.
Get into counseling to lose the ego.
Fire the kitchen Mgr. ... oh! You can't because he's a friend and you owe him a favor?
Listen Listen Listen to your employees and validate them. And...LISTEN!!!!!
Don't micromanage.
Get back into the kitchen where you're supposed to be to let the Mgr. Laurent do his job.
Pay your bills.
Let your mom relax and teach the chefs how to.
Listen Listen Listen.
Get a better pest control service.
Take fewer reservations and don't bite off more than you can chew for greed sake.
Take back the Vespa.
Go get the gay waiter back and double his wages.
Lose the paper products. It might fulfill your fantasy but frankly, it cheapens what you're doing no matter what you may think. Sure, you serve it (force it) to the patrons long enough they'll accept it but Army Ants have the same philosophy about moving around an object.
Use an ice cream scoop (measured to your portion) for making meatballs instead of measuring every one....come oooon! 
Quit sucking up to the patrons, it won't keep the food warm nor change their devistated and horrendous feelings of disappointment.
Find a way to install a food elevator with warmer.
I could go on forever but start with those for now.

The good side of Rocco? 
He's a good chef...and...he loves his mom, that's obvious.

What can I say, that has not already been said?
Poor Rocco has no management skills YET!  He will have to become more aggressive to make it!  The three cooks that lied and did not come to work will now have formed  a track record for themselves.  Their knives will never get well seasoned because they are not TEAM PLAYERS.  You have to have a passion for the hospitality industry to survive and make it prosper.  If you do not have one coming in you should not be there. This not only includes the owner but the staff that is working for you
Passion for food, people, and the team you are working with.  This is taught by the owner and chef himself.  Rocco has to grow up a bit and learn to look in the mirror and create some wellness within himself to he can spread that to his staff.  Being a Master Chef is not the first step to teaching and spreading joy in your life or establishment.   Good luck Rocco

I have watched the Resturant program for the past few weeks.  I can only say that I am not impressed at all by Mr. DiSpirito's business acumen.  Quite the contrary, I find him to be self-absorbed, conceitedm and more concerned with his public image on telivision than that of his employees.  He is certainly not a role model that I would want to emulate as a small business operator.  

Mr. DiSpirito, this is NO way to run a business.

Get over it! Rocco is brilliant and as all NEW and BETTER ideas - he is taking heat for offering an alchemy of traditional and fusion, paper and silver, casual and 5 star dinning to his guest and all his \"inexperienced\" employees and critics are doing is leveling him back down to the \"norm\" range...well the guy is a genius...who among us will ever forget Coors, Vespa, AmX OPEN [A dead brand until Rocco] and the Mitsubishi being towed away...I am totally digging a Mitz and I drive a Bimmer....He is  on the cutting edge and sometimes the blade gets a little too close...but you idiots have a rare opportunity to see the inner workings of a creative visionary [the fact that he is a Hottie doesn't hurt] but beyond his sex appeal the guy is  brilliant. Ask any restauranteur...staff is not the bell weather...but media attention is...Rocco is not allowing the media to perform  a post mortem examination of his vision...he is letting you and me and his rivals view the conception from an intimate vantage point - that many mistake a bump in the road for failure when it is actually the creative process in motion...maybe this is a clear illustration of why there are so few \"creative\" people in the world...Rocco - Continued Success. Love the show.

I was watching Sara Moulton Live, on the Food Network some time ago. Rocco was on making Meatloaf. As an amateur cook myself, what better than having a real pro like Rocco offer a recipe on a basic like this? I couldn't wait. I am always looking to improve my cooking.....

When he started loading in the romano cheese, I started to get worried. I was thinking if this is a famous pro and his Meatloaf is so wacky, what hope does he have? I was really disappointed. I must be too much of a purist; certain things should not be messed with. Emeril is guilty of this, too, which is why he is just about the worst chef there is.

Then, I watched Rocco's show. The most narcissitic person I have seen in a long time. I get so frustrated watching him, I can't sleep afterwards. The level of incompetence, for which he is responsible as the owner, gives me nightmares. He should start downstairs, get it together there and then go upstairs and kiss the groupies. And he should also fire his chef: the reason the food is always cold, is because that guy can't organize the orders. I give that place another month and I'm sure Rocco covered himself moneterily.

Hmmm after reading everybodies comments from the \"i hope rocco reads this and emails me teri, to Mr Anonymous PhD I sit back and think of all the restaurants I have worked in and ate at, TGIFridays (closest thing to the way Rocco acts is the managers i had there), Tumbleweed (great food fun place to work, horrible clientele that don't know how to tip, Perkins (nothing to say about that place, drunks that can't tell a ten from a 1 great tips), Ryans (its a buffet what do you expect).

I was looking forward to this show from the previews I saw to every episode(haven't missed one yet) I want to go eat at this place, just so I can critique everything from the service to the food, I know they had a \"restaurant critic\" but who better to judge than an average american.  The way the waiters get treated and the slow rate of the food if I was eating there and saw the owner to busy talking and making out with customers to get my food to me, that from what all the customers are saying is expensive, I would be furious.  

He needs to get the restaurant running first and then worry about kissing every girl.

Just my 2 cents, I drive a Camaro and Im going for my associate degree in Law right now.  Not a PhD and Not a Bimmer.

Jeaze, TV, that portal always makes something not quite real. You can not tell what's real from inside a tube. So I give up judging what is really going on at Rocco's! I just watch the show as it appears, and it's very interesting that way. 

I think the guy is doing a great job of making a real-tv dramma. Will this resturant make-it? (as far as we can tell in our little tube?) I think that's all that matters to me at this point. (but it IS only TV, so lighten-up!)

I do in no way think Rocco is some great guy who is a victim of bad editing.  If you just look at how the guy operates, and the decisions he makes regarding his employees.  For example, he has everyone come in early to get makeovers to fit his restaurant theme.  Once they have been there for a couple of hours and are finished having 15 bottles of hair spray put in their hair, he deems it an appropriate time to let some of them know they are no longer employed.  I am sure noone was getting any compensation to be there in the first place.  I would tell Rocco to kiss my ass if I was the girl who got canned after she had to go through all that crap.  I sure hope it did not interfere with Rocco's coffee break to tell them they were fired after making parading them about like barnyard animals.  Arrogant pompous narcisist.  The place doesn't look to sanitary either.  I wouldn't trust eating a package of saltines from that place.  The guys who edit the footage see everything.  I am sure they decided it was time to pick on poor little Rocco.  He is an ass repeatedly.

As a person with quite a bit of restaurant experience under my belt (tray) I've come to find the ethos of an eating establishment is a top-down proposition.  Rocco's (the place) reflects this in the way the goodwill and wonderful energy of his staff was sqaundered by Rocco's (the person) egotistical pursuit of fame, fortune and women -- all at the expense of the very humanity food could/should celebrate.  Rocco, both place and person, left a very bad taste in my mouth.

2003-09-24 02:40:00
I've watched the show for a few weeks and I must say:  Rocco you are super-gay.  Your b!tchy attitude, high maintenance, desire for chaos and drama are just too much.  And you are a 36 year old single male chef. C'mon!  Not that anything is wrong with being gay, it's just that I think you would be a better person and let that lil girl inside of you out into the world.  

As for your restaurant, I think the critics (NY Times, NY Post, etc.)  have pretty much signed the death certificate for your restaurant.  Since I am a graduate from J&W and a food/sanitation inspector, I can't even begin to list the health, sanitation and labor violations your restaurant has committed.  As for Laurent (Le Frog), retourné a France s.v.p.  

Wish for the best because you're gonna need it.

I religiously watch the show and I truly hope Rocco reads these comments from time to time so this is writen directly to him...

Rocco,

I understand your love for food and wanting to own your own company and Bravo for it! However, your management is taking your company along with your actions down very quickly. I am a manager and I would never treat your staff the way you and your management do. I am going to play devils advocate for one moment here. I do feel you handle somethings appropriately and your staff tends to think they have more say than they really should UNLESS! You have made them to believe they do have a say, then in that case it is completely your fault. I truly hope that your restaraunt rockets and you do well for yourself and I would love to be a part of your staff (unfortunately I am in Ohio) but you have to boost the morale quickly and you have to get your ass in the kitchen and start cooking and stop flirting with the ladies all the time, I don't care if you are the owner, people are there to enjoy Rocco's cooking too!

Ciao

Ahhhh, so I am just now catching all the episodes on Bravo!  I avoided watching this show on Network TV due to the 15 years I spent working in Restaurants.... 7 of that in the kitchen in one capicity or another *linecook, catering, pantry, broiler, bartending, banquets* and the balance on the floor *cocktailing,table service* It literally makes me ill to watch this... Not because Rocco is a terribly bad guy (actually he's pretty typical, even tame compared some owners/chefs I've worked for... but because of the drama..... DRAMA! They aren't far off the mark from reality here...Tantrums, backstabbing, accidents, walkoff's, arguments... I used to come home and it would take me hours to calm down after every shift.... I think I probably \"opened\" 10 restaurants and it is EXACTLY like this...
This is a typical run at getting a restaurant started... He'll do fine in the end.... for awhile, anyway.  
PS.. I find Rocco a bit on the gay side and he is clearly compensating for that with all his fondling of the patrons but I've never met one that wasn't exactly like him... How boring...

I bought a focaccia at the Union Square farmers' market Monday on my day off, and last night Todd and I had some pretty good pressed sandwiches with some of the leftovers from our feast on Sunday. Todd had mozzarella, roasted pepper and proscuitto, and I had eggplant, squash, mozzarella and proscuitto. I wasn't sure it would work, but the focaccia got really crisp and thin. I heated my cast-iron round grill pan for a while (cast-iron is a slow conductor of heat, I've heard, so I knew it would hold the heat for long enough to cook the sandwiches). Then I heated my round nonstick skillet, put the sandwiches in, topped them with the hot cast-iron pan and pressed down to compress the sandwiches. The cast-iron pan fit perfectly inside the other pan and both the top and bottom of the sandwiches got toasted at once.

Clotide - It's a recipe I got from Epicurious.com (chocolate-dipped coconut macaroons; http://food.epicurious.com/run/recipe/view?id=11607). The first time I made them I was looking for something special to dip in chocolate fondue, so I made the basic macaroons. I use a little less sugar than the recipe calls for, 1 cup instead of 1 1/3, and I bake them on a silpat. Awesome and chewy, especially when they're dripping with warm, melted chocolate.

I like your site. You reminded me that the Chocolate Show in New York is coming up. Maybe it'd be fun to go.

Lynn - I've never made mulligatawny, but I'd love to try your recipe. Do you have other recipes you tend to return to again and again? I have a chocolate pudding from, believe it or not, the Cooking Thin cookbook, and a really easy bread pudding that I frequently make when I need to use up stale bread. Buttermilk pancakes from the Better Homes and Gardens cookbook, biscuits (my husband's specialty), a dough for pizza, some snack cake recipes, but nothing dinner-y. A spinach, chickpea, garlic and pasta combo that I made for dinner tonight. Seriously, I need to start repeating some recipes.

Kim - Thanks for pointing me to the recipe! It's *very* tempting!

I'm glad you like my blog. By all means, do go to the NY Chocolate Show, and tell us all about it! It might alleviate the grief over the oven, too... :)

This dessert was so easy to make, and very pretty (it's kind of hard to tell with the white-on-white, but it was so soft and silky looking, and such a pure white). My first time with unflavored gelatin; I don't really like jello but this has an entirely different texture. Sprinkle one packet (about 2 teaspoons) unflavored gelatin over 2 tablespoons water and let it sit for 10 minutes for the gelatin to soften. While that's doing, put 1 cup whipping cream and 7 tablespoons sugar in a saucepan, then, over medium heat, get the cream hot and dissolve all the sugar into the cream (don't let the cream boil). Add the gelatin mixture and stir until it dissolves. (I still had a few lumps, but it doesn't matter at this point.) Let that sit for about 30 minutes to come to room temperature, then add 2 cups buttermilk and 3/4 teaspoon vanilla. Pour the mixture through a strainer into a 4-cup measuring cup with a spout, then divide the mixture between the various custard cups and ramekins you have available (I used 3 custard cups, 3 mise-en-place bowls and 2 ramekins). Refrigerate at least 6 hours. Unmold by dipping the cups in warm water for 30 seconds, then loosening the edge with the tip of a knife. I had to push the knife in a little further along one side to get it to release. I served it with macerated strawberries; it's wonderful stuff, creamy, tangy, rich and cool. Todd said it almost tasted like lemon, and it did even though there wasn't any lemon in it.

Hi, Kim--

Great blog.

A couple of weeks ago, I bought some Northern Spy apples at the Ann Arbor Farmer's Market and made a pie with them. The apples made a wonderful pie.

I think the secret to a good pie crust is to use just enough water to hold the thing together and not to work the dough too much. Working it just activates the gluten and makes the baked crust tougher.
Kim
2003-10-25 07:42:00
Yeah, I think you're right. I'm always disappointed when I roll out my crust and there are big blobs of butter all over, but they all melt away during baking and make the crust flakey. I just need to work on getting my blobs a little smaller. 

My dough is always so moist to begin with, I rarely add much water at all. I'm especially bad with the food processor; I've discovered I like my mother-in-law's method of cutting in the butter with a pastry blender, then using a fork to stir in a tiny bit of water at a time. Maybe by the time I'm 50 I'll have perfected the crust part. 

I've heard Northern Spy makes great pie; a coworker of mine always uses a couple different types of apples in her pie, and I think she named Northern Spy as one of them. Just think of all the apple pies being baked across the country just in this one weekend alone! It makes me want to get out the rolling pin.

I just went to your site and saw that you make your own sausage - it sounds terrific, and a great family activity. I just can't imagine the Whipple family (my family) doing something like that.
danr
2003-10-26 08:34:00
That's exactly how I make my pie crust! :) The pastry cutter works well because the blobs come out the right size. If you cut the butter into the flour with a food processor, the blobs are too small, I think.

Some friends came over for lunch yesterday with their new baby, Sofia, who is just shy of 1 month old. She mostly slept through the afternoon, only waking for dinner around 3 or 4. While she was asleep, we had our own meal. I had roasted some zucchini, squash, eggplant, green beans, onion and a variety of bell peppers the day before, then tossed the beans and onion together. The other veggies were topped with balsamic vinegar and capers. We also had mozzarella balls with garlic and parsley, pickled veggies, cornishons, proscuitto and cheese, a baguette, and two \"salads\" that I prepared: gingery marinated garbanzos and a vegetable couscous salad. The garbanzos were made the day before and marinated in a mixture of red wine vinegar and oil with minced garlic, red onion and ginger and seasoned with salt and pepper. The couscous salad was a recipe from The Naked Chef, and it used an interesting technique for the couscous. Make a lemon vinaigrette: 5 tablespoons olive oil, 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, salt and pepper. Mix in 9 ounces of plain couscous, then add 1 cup cold water and let it sit for 10 mintues. Meanwhile assemble the other ingredients: chopped bell peppers (the recipe called for roasted, but I used fresh since we were already having a platter of roasted veggies), 2 chopped tomatoes, half a small red onion, diced, half a diced jalapeno, seeds removed, torn-up basil leaves, the juice of a lemon, a couple tablespoons of red wine vinegar, salt and pepper. You have to let this mixture sit for about 15 minutes, and then you add the couscous and mix it all together. I also made a buttermilk panna cotta, which I'll write up separately.

Last night we went to a gallery opening (the photography exhibit was called Enchanted Evening, and a lot of famous photographs and well-known photographers' works were on display) on 22nd and 10th and then took the bus over to Bread Bar at Tabla. We had been to Tabla in January and I was kind of disappointed, although the dessert I had was fantastic (a Meyer lemon souffle with sour cherry compote). At Bread Bar, which has a lot of small dishes that you share tapas-style, Todd panicked that he wasn't going to get enough to eat so we ended up ordering way too much food, all of which was pretty good. The chutneys really made the meal, though. Part of the reason Todd panicked is because we ordered a summer vegetable frankie, which turned out to be spicy summer vegetables (mostly summer squash) wrapped in a thin egg pancake and served with a smooth mint chutney, which managed to be spicy and cooling at the same time. He ate the egg and gave his veggies to me. We also had quail with chunky kumquat chutney and microgreens, aloo parantha, which is a puffy bread like naan that has chunks of potato, and onion rings. The aloo parantha was my favorite; we ordered a spicy tamarind chutney to accompany it. The onion rings were made with chickpea flour and they had a substantial, dry crunch that made them kind of different from traditional crispy onion rings. They were served with a homemade ketchup that was very good. Alas, we were too full for dessert. But I definitely want to go back and try some things we didn't get to have, like the lamb sausage with mint and ginger and the saag paneer pizza.

It's funny because it's really not that big of a deal, but I always think of a water bath as a major pain. I should try it next time. I wonder if you have to bake it for a lot longer if you use one. The cheesecake did tend to sink a little, all over, which closed up the cracks (you can kind of tell in the photo because of the raised edges).

It actually wasn't bratwurst, it was spicy beef sausage, but we were going for a German theme, so I'm calling them brats. We had some aged Cheddar cheese, beer and a nice potato salad from Rachael Ray's 30 Minute Meals 2. To make it, I boiled red pototoes cut in chunks, then tossed them while hot with diced green pepper and red onion, salt, pepper and red vinegar. Once the potatoes absorbed the vinegar I added oil and chopped leafy celery tops. It sat around for about an hour before we ate, allowing the flavors to develop nicely. Just broiled the sausages, so it was a pretty easy meal, and kept me out of a hot kitchen, which is always a goal these days.

It's one of the first things I make when the weather gets too hot to turn on the stove: a salad of white beans, canned tuna packed in oil and diced red onion. Using some of the oil from the tuna, I make a vinaigrette in the bottom of a big bowl, then add the above ingredients and some rubbed sage. Had it over lettuce Monday night, in a pita for lunch yesterday and on crackers for lunch today. Obviously not single serving, but a small enough amount that it's gone and I'm not utterly sick of it yet.

This recipe sort of comes from Gourmet. It was an appetizer recipe in there, served on little mini arepas, but I modified it to be a main course and use the ingredients I had available. The recipe took up a whole page, but broken down over the course of 24 hours it didn't seem that labor intensive. Saturday night I cut a red onion in quarters and sliced them into thin quarter-rings. Then I tossed that with 1/2 cup vinegar, a diced jalapeno and some oregano and salt and left it all the fridge. Sunday around noon I diced up some garlic, mashing it with salt to make a paste, then added cumin, oregano, allspice and pepper (I'm not giving amounts because I think I should've added more--maybe a good tablespoon of each?). Mixed it into equal parts orange juice and vinegar in a baking dish, then added three 3/4-inch-thick pork chops and put it in the fridge, covered with foil, to marinate. A couple hours before dinner I popped it in a 325 degree oven. To make up for no arepas, I mixed up cornbread batter and spread some in the bottom of this inane muffin-top tin I picked up off the giveaway table at work. I added a layer of shredded mozzarella and then topped it with more cornbread batter. Baked it for 10 minutes in 425 degree oven after I took the pork out to make these big, flat corn cakes (the muffin-top tin does have another use!). While those were baking I shredded the pork in its baking dish and mixed it with the remaining liquid in there. We ate the corn cakes topped with shredded pork and the pickled onions. I would've liked more spice, but the bite of the vinegary onion was a good contrast to the subtlety of the other flavors. And I really liked the technique for the shredded pork.

Yesterday Todd and I tried a place we've passed hundreds of times but have never gone into: Kati Roll Co. on Macdougal Street. I had seen it in New York Magazine's 75 under $20 issue about a year ago but, even though Todd goes to NYU part-time and is always looking for a quick place to get dinner, we had never tried it. It's a tiny shop a flight of steps up from the street. No posted menu, but there are only about 10 options so if you're a regular you don't even need a menu. All they serve are these rolled-up thin pancake-like things, called \"parantha,\" filled with chicken, beef or paneer (a tofu-like Indian cheese). Todd had a chicken tikka one, and I had a paneer one; they were both spicy and mine included what the menu called \"pickles,\" red onion and green bell pepper that was a sharp, fresh contrast to the earthy spiciness of the cheese. With our sodas the whole meal was $10.50, and we were both pleasantly full when we were done. Todd's pretty excited to have found a new quick bite near school. I'm jealous that he's going to be in the neighborhood regularly and I'm not. (The same thing happened with BB's, the not-quite-a-real-Philly-cheesesteak shop on West 3rd. They're cheap and delicious and I never get to have them because Todd gets them on the way to class all the time, then when we're in the neighborhood together he doesn't want it because he's sick of it.)

We went to our friends' apartment in Brooklyn to watch the East River fireworks from their roof. (I was skeptical about their view until I got there, and then I decided it was one of the best rooftops I've been to: When you're in Brooklyn or Queens, the Manhattan skyline is the backdrop for the fireworks display, which beats the big neon Pepsi sign that you see from the Manhattan side any day. Plus, it's one of New York's best kept secrets, so there's no jostling 40,000 other people and trying to wheedle your way past vigilant doormen trying to put the kibash on July 4th roof parties.) Our host made some great salmon burgers and a cherry granita from Martha Stewart that I'm definitely going to have to track down (it was almost chewy from the cherries, with a beautiful deep red color and a vibrant cherry flavor). I took a panful of brownies from a recipe I cut from Cooking Light. These really are fantastic, fudgy brownies. One of the best things about this brownie recipe is that all the ingredients are things you probably have in your kitchen already (except maybe the espresso powder, but that's a good baking staple to have). Set the oven for 325 degrees. Then you beat 1 cup sugar and 2 eggs with a mixer on high until it's pale and thick (about 5 minutes). Add 2 teaspoons of espresso powder that has been dissolved into a tablespoon of water, 1/4 cup melted butter and 1 teaspoon of vanilla, and mix until combined. Next mix 1 cup flour, 2/3 cup cocoa powder and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Add that to the sugar mixture (the batter's really thick), and spread it in a 9-inch square baking dish coated with nonstick cooking spray. Bake for about 25 minutes, checking at 20 minutes to see if it's cooked through. They're fudgy so they may never look \"done,\" but the center should start looking a little dry like the outer edge. It's hard to describe what I mean, but it's probably better to undercook them a little rather than overcook them.

Once I buy any kind of bakery bread, it's like a sprint to finish it off before it's rendered inedible by the passage of time. And this weather always makes me feel like gnawing on a baguette and some fruit and cheese instead of preparing something more elaborate. I guess it's just that, to me, that type of meal feels like a picnic, and it's been picnic weather lately. So I've been eating on a baguette all week, culminating with bread salad last night.

That was my favorite part of the pie, too. It came from this cookbook I've been thinking about throwing out (Basic Baking by Lora Brody), but now I think I have to keep it (I made a pineapple upside down cake from it that was also pretty awesome).

Walnut Crumble Topping
1/2 cup walnut pieces
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup oats
6 tablespoons butter, chilled and cut in small pieces

Mix the first three ingredients together, then cut in the butter with a pastry blender (I actually used my fingers to mush the butter into the dry ingredients). Then you just spread the topping over the pie filling before you bake it.

I think two of the cookbooks I'm informally testing are keepers. (Although did anyone who knows me really think I would be getting rid of anything?) We had Oatmeal Pancakes from Elizabeth Alston's book yesterday, and I was very pleased with them (they'd be good for people who are trying to avoid refined carbohydrates, too, I think, except for the sugar - I wonder if you can leave it out?). You start by pulverizing 2 cups of uncooked oatmeal into a flour in the blender or food processor along with 1 tablespoon brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon salt, 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon baking soda. Then you add 2 eggs, 1 cup plain yogurt and 2/3 cup milk and blend until smooth. The batter's really thin at this point, but you leave it set for 5 minutes and it thickens up nicely. The finished pancakes have a pretty brown color and a nice, hearty texture without being the kind of pancakes that sit at the bottom of your stomach all day. I went ahead and made the extra batter into pancakes and froze them. I just pop them in the toaster when I feel like having them for breakfast. On Friday, I used Bittman's technique for pan-frying salmon fillets and then finishing them in the oven, and, although the apartment smelled like fish all weekend, we did like the crispy results. I'll try a different spice mix, though. I used 5-spice powder and really didn't like the flavor.

It's been so hot here: Hello summer! We put our air-conditioner in last night, but not before I made dinner, so I made a no-cook meal, a Thai-inspired noodle salad with strips of thick-cut roast beef from the deli. It starts with two packets of ramen noodles, which you soak in hot water for 10 minutes (it really works). While that was soaking, I cut up a red bell pepper, a cucumber, some lettuce and mint. I also chopped some unsalted nuts, cut the deli roast beef into strips and made a dressing from peanut butter, rice vinegar, soy sauce, a pinch of cayenne and some sesame oil. Drained and rinsed the noodles, tossed them with some of the dressing and arranged it all on plates with some lime wedges. Todd took a photo that I'll post tonight. It's pretty. Huge amounts of food, too, so we're having leftovers for lunch.

We have not put our air conditioners in the windows yet, so I've been trying to make dinner without turning anything on. Fortunately, it's an annual tradition at Woman's Day to have an article on no-cook meals. Lots of sandwiches and cold soups, but tonight I'm going to try this Thai-inspired beef noodle salad that you make with deli meat and by soaking ramen noodles in warm water for 10 minutes. We'll see. Last night I made another no-cooker, a couscous salad, with all the leftovers in the fridge. I nuke the water to get it boiling (although supposedly that's a no-no; see why below), then dump in the couscous and cover it for 5 minutes. This time I added tomato, roasted red pepper, diced mozzarella, salt, pepper and kalamata olives. Why you shouldn't boil water in the microwave (although I do it anyway): Apparently the hot water can unexpectedly spurt up when you take it out of the microwave because the air that's trying to bubble up has nothing to form bubbles around, then when you slosh it when you take it out, the bubbles all form along the sides of the container and burst out of it; since the water reached the boiling point without bubbling, it's hotter than the boiling point when it spills all over your hands. I've seen others recommend putting a string or wooden pick in the water, breaking the surface, to allow the bubbles to form along that. I just use a really big, really old pyrex container with lots of scratches for the bubbles to form on.

Hi Kim!
Have you ever made Baklava?  Last Christmas I made it for the first time- and although it was time intensive, I enjoyed the process.  It was a big hit, with even Angelo in my office (who was a baker in Greece for 30 years) eating 2nd and 3rd pieces! 
I'm going to try the chocolate banana triangles with my leftover Phyllo this year!  Great idea!

My supper club made baklava during our Greek night - I just can't have a whole pan of that around or I end up eating the whole thing. When we moved out here we first moved to Astoria, which has a Greek population. So the first time I had baklava was in a Greek coffee shop in Queens. Big fan now, though. With a really strong cup of coffee.

This includes two things Todd won't eat, mushrooms and crepes (only because crepes \"aren't real food\"), so it was perfect for last night, and the leftovers tasted even better today. I made half a crepe recipe, which was enough for last night and lunch today, with 1/2 cup milk, an egg, 6 tablespoons flour, 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil and salt. I whisked it up and left it to sit while I made the ragout. Sauteed half a small onion in a little butter, added about 10 medium quartered crimini mushrooms and cooked that for 5 minutes, until the mushrooms started to brown. Then I added a couple good squirts of tomato paste, poured in about 1/2 cup water and stirred to dissolve the paste. Boiled that down until the sauce was thick, then stirred in some dried rubbed sage. It all tasted good right then, but the flavor of the sage really fully developed by the time I ate this for lunch today. I used a 1/4 cup measure to scoop out the crepe batter and only filled it about 3/4 full. Brushed the hot pan with oil, then poured the batter in and swirled. Ended up with something not really round. I need to work on my crepe technique. When the edges started to get dry and browned I flipped it and cooked it for a little bit, then made the next one. I folded 4 crepes in quarters and overlapped them in a row on a plate, then topped them with the mushroom ragout. Good. I just wrapped the leftover crepes in a paper towel (they didn't even stick).

You know how Julia Child boils an egg? She doesn't. She puts the eggs in a pot, covers them with water, brings the water to a boil, turns the heat off, covers the pot and then lets the eggs sit in the water for somewhere around 10 minutes (I'd have to look up the exact amount of time). Perfectly hard-cooked eggs, no green ring around the yolk. Mark Bittman uses the same technique for cod or other white fish fillets in the Cod Cake recipe I tried last night, and, while I didn't particularly like the cakes (I used too much potato), I did like that technique. I had a whipped fish spread at Craftbar that I've wanted to reproduce, and I think this recipe may be a good start. If I used less potato, added more seasoning or maybe some really good olive oil, I may have something. It's basically just cooked potato and cod mashed with ginger and scallions, salt and pepper, and a pinch of cayenne. Kind of a delicate flavor, which is good, but it needed more. Maybe some rosemary instead of the ginger and scallions. We'll see.

i've hard-cooked my eggs like this for years: a perfect method. but i ALSO use it for boned, skinned chicken breast (what we call kipfilet)...covered in water in a pan with a tight-fitting lid, brought to a good boil, and then turned off, and left to cool in the liquid. it makes for moist, velvety chicken, perfect for salads especially...

I'm always poaching chicken breasts for something (I got a new Tex-Mex cookbook recently and a lot of recipes call for shredded chicken). How long do you leave it in the liquid? Until it has completely cooled?

yeah. completely. well, till lukewarm at least. i think it might be a bit risky otherwise. but it's always worked for me.

I know, I'm baking with toxic-colored berries, but it wouldn't be the classic without the neon-red cherries on it. So I donned my frilly apron, my string of pearls and my high-heeled pumps and started baking. This is called a Pineapple Upside-Down Cake in Laura Brody's book, but the testers in the kitchen at work said this type of cake used to be called a plate cake, and I like the assonance, so . . . This recipe has kept Basic Baking in the running, although I'm not 100 percent behind this one. My main objection is to the two sticks of butter that are used; the first stick is melted and combined with 2/3 cup brown sugar and poured into the bottom of a 9-inch round cake pan to make the topping. Then you arrange the pineapple and cherries on top. Pretty sweet. The cake part of this, though, could stand alone. The crumb was perfect, not too dense nor too light, with a hint of sweetness and perfectly moist on its own. It starts with three eggs, 3/4 cup sugar and 2 teaspoons vanilla, whipped together. Then the second stick of butter, melted, is added. Then you sift in 1 cup flour with 1 teaspoon baking powder and 1/2 teaspoon salt and fold until it's all combined. Spread over the pineapple, then 350 degree oven for 35 minutes and let it set in the pan for 10 minutes before you invert it on a plate. The butter-brown sugar mixture soaks into the top part and sides of the cake, a sweet, buttery richness that requires a glass of milk. Almost too rich for me, but Todd was very enthusiastic. (I almost couldn't get him to stop eating and take another picture.) The cake part is definitely a keeper, though. I might experiment with other toppings, or no toppings, for it.

I enjoy 30-Minute Meals, the Food Network show with Rachael Ray, a lot (I rush home to watch the show when I can - it's on at 6). She's so easy and enthusiastic, and the recipes really are quick and practical. (I like Sara Moulton, too, but on one show, entitled One-Pot Meals, she dirtied a total of about 11 pots and pans making two dishes. That is not my idea of a one-pot meal.) So I was pretty excited when the food editor came over to invite me to a \"Meet & Eat\" with Rachael Ray at the Food Network studios. She was exactly as she is on TV, giggly and friendly, but much smaller than I thought she'd be (a common experience for me; I once saw Rosie O'Donnell on the street and even she looked small to me). The food was Rachael's favorites from the show and was great: sausage-stuffed mushroom caps, skewers of ginger beef, chicken wrapped in pancetta with a balsamic reduction. It was a \"Christmas in June\" theme, to illustrate that you can entertain with quick recipes. I was a big geek and had her sign the cookbook they gave us. She gave us suggestions for where to eat on our upcoming trip to Orlando. On the cookbook front, I tried Mark Bittman's Pork and Turnips and it was pretty good. Why have I never cooked with turnips? They have such an interesting flavor and are pretty hearty. I think Bittman's book may turn out to be a keeper.

I have too many cookbooks, and I've just had an infusion of more (the kitchen cleaned out their library), so I have to decide to get rid of some of the ones I have. There are three that I've put on probation, and I've been cooking from them for the last couple of days: Mark Bittman's The Minimalist Cooks at Home, Laura Brody's Basic Baking and Elizabeth Alston's (she used to be the food editor here at WD) Pancakes and Waffles. I chose five recipes to try from each book and then I'll assess whether they've earned a bit of my precious bookshelf space.

Every time I walk by the Olive Garden that has gone into the new building on 6th Ave in Chelsea, I've struggled with the two animals living inside of me: the snob and the violent hater of snobs (which leads to a healthy dose of self-loathing from both sides). It makes me so sad to see the same old chain stores in Chelsea that you find in depressing strip malls in the rest of the country. The article in this week's Dining In section of The New York Times brought up all those feelings again. Going into the Outback in Queens Center gives me a sense of nostalgia and makes me feel like I'm going home again, back to Colorado where my family is. But I just went home, literally, a couple of weeks ago: I hopped on a plane and ended up in Denver. I don't think I want one of the ugliest parts of where I'm from transplanted here. I've grown to love the portions of New York I frequent for what they are now. I never understood those who long for the days Times Square was unsafe, but now I'm beginning to get a tiny inkling. Comments like Tim Zagat's in the article, though, make me really want him to be wrong, wrong, wrong, simply to put that snotty foodie attitude in its place. In some ways, though, I share that snotty foodie attitude. I am all ambivalence. It seems to be my natural state these days. I think we should be subversive: Hold up the Olive Garden as the hip new place to score a table, order expansively, eat none of it, then stop by the falafel stand on the way home.

This isn't really a single-serving recipe (they rarely are), but the leftover pancakes are pretty good warmed up, so consider this lunch the next day, too. The recipe is from Mollie Katzen's Sunlight Cafe, her newest cookbook, which is all \"breakfast\" foods (although these don't seem like breakfast to me). They have wild rice, scallions, mushrooms and goat cheese, so were the perfect candidate for a night when Todd was at class. I cooked the wild rice in the microwave following directions on the box, except that I had to keep adding water because it kept boiling away mid-cooking: 1/4 cup wild rice and probably about a cup of water in the microwave on high for about 20 minutes, stirring it every 5 minutes and adding more water if it needs it. The times probably vary depending on the microwave, too, but since this isn't really rice, and doesn't get sticky and gross if you mess with it, it's easier to play it by ear (or by taste and touch). While that was going on, I salted and sauteed the mushrooms for about 10 minutes, then added a minced garlic clove and a squeeze of juice from half a lemon. Then I beat 2 eggs until mixed and added 2 generous tablespoons flour and some salt. Mixed that until uniform, then added the cooked wild rice, a large sliced scallion, goat cheese crumbles, pepper and the mushroom mixture. Heated oil in the same skillet I cooked the mushrooms and used 1/4 cup of batter per pancake. Flipped 'em after 2 or 3 minutes and finished cooking on the other side.

Hi Kim,  

What fun to read your website!  It was truly refreshing to read such an optimistic outlook on what had to be a very challenging situation with the black out.  You truly have a gift for seeing \"the good in the bad,\" as my Mama always says.   

Next time you're home for a few days, you simply have to teach us how to make pasta.  I've waited forever for a class in our area and am convinced it will never happen.  Now what would it take to convince you to give your Mama, Jeana, and me a private cooking classs?!  (Sorry, I never can spell Jeana's name correctly!)  I'm sure it would be great fun and I would be delighted to host the class, furnish all the supplies, and host dinner for everyone in your family at our home.  Hope you'll think about it!

Hope Todd and you are doing well.  Look forward to seeing you when you're home again.

Warmest regards, Linda 
(Your Mom's best buddy! -smile-)

Lynn, that sounds great. I could make a whole meal out of that kind of thing, although Todd would be rummaging around in the cupboards or buying ice cream from a truck 20 minutes later. 

Linda, I would love to teach you all what I learned, although I'm not sure I'm qualified. It's pretty easy, though, and I love getting my hands dirty. (It doesn't even make that much of a mess.) I haven't bought a pasta machine yet, but it's on my list. I think I'll be home sometime around the holidays.

It was overcast and rainy, but the lines were still long at the Big Apple Barbecue Block Party that Todd and I went to yesterday. It was out in front of Blue Smoke, and 27th street was blocked off between Park Avenue and Lexington. Live jazz, crowds, smoke and some good barbecue. The organizers had invited award-winning barbecuers from North Carolina, Illinois, even Nevada. We bought 15 tickets ($1 per ticket with each plate costing $6; the food booths wouldn't take cash) and started at the shortest line, sharing an order of Chipotle Chicken Wings and Potato Salad from Blue Smoke. The sauce was good, smokey and spicy, but the wings were kind of anemic. While we ate that, we stood in a long line in the rain for pork shoulder and baked beans made by Big Bob Gibson Bar-B-Que from Alabama. The shredded pork, served on seeded buns, was the softest meat I've ever had, but it needed the sauce for flavor (which it definitely had). Then I had to run back to the booth for more tickets while Todd stood in another long line so we could try the food from Kreuz Market from Lockhart, Texas. (These lines were such a tease, because they all snaked right up next to the smoke pits where the booth cooked the food you were standing in line to try.) I'm glad we did because the sausage with onions and sliced sweet n sour pickles on Sunshine white bread (I love it when what seems like a basic national packaged food becomes fundamental to a recipe for something fantastic) was the highlight of our day. The rain had stopped, so we squatted on the sidewalk to eat. Biting through the soft bread and then the crunchy skin of the spicy sausage, we listened to jazz with fellow urban dwellers willing to brave the rain for a bit of smoke on a city street.

Thanks for the Huevo Ranchero Recipe- I had never had them before, but after I read your article I had to go to the store!
I baked the flour tortilla and it turned out pretty well- not as good for you as the corn variety but not as bad as a fried flour tortilla  (although you have to prevent that puffy stage)!
Thanks for the great recipe ideas- and I really enjoy jumping on and getting updates on your life there!

Yesterday as I was leaving for work, the sky suddenly got dark and the thunder rumbled. Perfect soup weather, so I picked a recipe from the magazine. It's a 15-minutes-or-less type recipe. I made it even quicker by leaving out the spinach and garlic, and made some substitutions, as well. I dumped one 15-ounce can Italian seasoned diced tomatoes in a saucepan with a canful of water and half a bouillion cube. Brought it to a boil, then turned it down to a simmer. Then cracked an egg into the boiling liquid and left it alone for 4 minutes. I toasted a slice of Amy's Bread organic whole wheat, put it in a soup plate, placed the poached egg on top, ladeled the tomatoes and broth on that and shredded Parmesan over the whole thing. I ate it with a knife and fork and never had to get out a spoon because by the time I was finished all the soup had been soaked up by the bread. Another blogger I read regularly, In the Kitchen, mentioned ribollita today. I had never heard of it, but it sounds similar to the soup I made. In the same family, anyway. There were lots of tomatoes and broth left, so I'll have that tonight with a grilled Cheddar sandwich (I can't resist the tomato soup/grilled cheese combo).

Am I supposed to start screaming and crying when my very first cheesecake does this? I swore to myself that I wouldn't get upset when (not if) this happened. I even told a coworker that I didn't care if it cracked, as long as it tastes good. But I'm sure the neighbors did hear my shriek when I saw what had happened to the center of the cappuccino cheesecake I made this afternoon. The thing is, it was already cracked a little when I turned off the oven (15 minutes early, I must add). So I thought that would be it, not too bad. You can still see the small cracks along the sides, even though they're dwarfed in magnitude by the enormous crater in the center. I know I did everything wrong, though, so I'm definitely going to try again: I used a mixer to beat the batter, which incorporated a lot of air that turned to steam in the oven and needed a way to escape (apparently a food processor works better); I didn't use a waterbath (the recipe I had didn't call for one); I think I started it in a too-hot oven (the recipe called for a 450 oven for the first 10 minutes, then down to 200 for an hour, which seemed weird from the beginning, but who am I to question it?); and I overcooked it (there was no jiggly middle when I checked on it 15 minutes before it should be done). I added some embellishments to try to camouflage the mess for the people I might ask to eat it: Tomorrow we'll see. It has to chill for at least 8 hours before we can eat it. As long as it tastes good, I won't have to cry.

We had a couple slices tonight and it was pretty good. Some friends are coming over tomorrow to help us eat it, so I'm going to use your idea. I'm not even going to let them get a look at it whole. 

It's dangerous for us to have a whole cheesecake in the fridge. I have quite a sweet tooth. Looks aren't everything, I guess.

I think you should try it with a waterbath. My mom used to get this problem ALOT. Then she started using the waterbath all the time, and it solved the problem.

I also had this problem recently baking my very first cheesecake. But I used a waterbath, so I think my cracks were caused by over-beaten egg whites.

So my lovely new wife and I are hoping to find a place to go peach and raspberry picking this upcoming weekend to obtain my two favorite fruits so we can perhaps make a cobbler or a pie.  When I typed \"peach, pick, and new york\" into google, I was delighted to see this great blog show up as the 5th site listed.  Now, if we can actually find a place in the tri-state area to pick peaches in august, I hope we can try the peach ice cream with our extra peaches-it sounds delicious and yes, i too really do love summer.  (By the way, Kim, those Greek meatballs were fabulous-I haven't forgotten to comment, just waiting until we have my friends over for dinner next weekend-we're going to make your meatballs as part of an all-Greek themed meal.  We'll let you know how it goes. Glad you enjoyed our baklava.)

Hi, Eric
Ooooh, I am jealous of you. Todd and I went apple picking last year with Julie and David, but he hates that kind of thing because picking apples used to be one of his chores. Let me know where you ended up going, how you liked it, and if they have anything left. I might have to persuade Todd to take me sometime.

I even told a coworker that I didn't care if it cracked, as long as it tastes good. But I'm sure the neighbors did hear my shriek when I saw what had happened to the center of the cappuccino cheesecake I made this afternoon. The thing is, it was already cracked a little when I turned off the oven (15 minutes early, I must add). So I thought that would be it, not too bad. You can still see the small cracks along the sides, even though they're dwarfed in magnitude by the enormous crater in the center. I know I did everything wrong, though, so I'm definitely going to try again: I used a mixer to beat the batter, which incorporated a lot of air that turned to steam in the oven and needed a way to escape (apparently a food processor works better); I didn't use a waterbath (the recipe I had didn't call for one); I think I started it in a too-hot oven (the recipe called for a 450 oven for the first 10 minutes, then down to 200 for an hour, which seemed weird from the beginning, but who am I to question it?); and I overcooked it (there was no jiggly middle when I checked on it 15 minutes before it should be done). I added some embellishments to try to camouflage the mess for the people I might ask to eat it: Tomorrow we'll see. It has to chill for at least 8 hours before we can eat it. As long as it tastes good, I won't have to cry.

cry? why on earth would you cry? this looks DELECTABLE. if you slice it into wedges and lay them decoratively onto little plates...NO-ONE WILL EVER KNOW.

We had a couple slices tonight and it was pretty good. Some friends are coming over tomorrow to help us eat it, so I'm going to use your idea. I'm not even going to let them get a look at it whole. 

It's dangerous for us to have a whole cheesecake in the fridge. I have quite a sweet tooth. Looks aren't everything, I guess.

I think you should try it with a waterbath. My mom used to get this problem ALOT. Then she started using the waterbath all the time, and it solved the problem.

I also had this problem recently baking my very first cheesecake. But I used a waterbath, so I think my cracks were caused by over-beaten egg whites.

Some friends came over for dinner last night; they're both vegetarians and Todd is a sworn carnivore, so coming up with a menu was kind of challenging. It's been raining around here, so I opted for chili. I think I was the only one I know who was delighted when Thursday rolled around and the sky was still gray. I couldn't serve chili on a sunny spring day. I also made fruit parfaits for dessert (hedging my bets about the weather a little, I guess).

Hi there, 
I've just discovered your blog, and am loving it. I have friends who live out in Forest Hills and rave about Cheeses of the World ;) Anyway, there's nothing wrong with your madeleines getting sticky the next day - it's what happens with all madeleines the day after they've been baked. They're sort of like baguette in that they taste and feel different the day they're made and mildly deteriorate after that.

My brother graduated from Colorado State on Saturday, so Todd and I flew in to help him celebrate. It gave me the opportunity to prepare a spread for a group of family and friends, which was fun. (My mom is firmly of the \"get a six foot hero and a veggie platter from Sam's\" camp, so I think I stressed her out by wanting to prepare the sandwiches myself.) I have this problem with sleeping on vacation. I am not one of those people who go on vacation to sleep: I tend to be up at the crack of dawn (or at least 7:30 EST, which in Colorado translated to 5:30). But it was lovely to be in my mother's kitchen at 5:30, staring the coffee for the sleeping family, popping an apple braid in the oven (from the freezer) and assembling sandwiches and platters. I love cooking in my mom's kitchen (it being quite a bit larger than the standard NYC kitchen I usually have to work with).

Hi Kim!

I just found your cooking comments, and enjoy them greatly. 

 I just found a recipe online for anise pepper liquer.  This is sometimes called aquavit.  It seems pretty simple - just soak star anise and crushed peppercorns in vodka for a time, add some sugar to taste, strain the thing when you think it tastes done.  I made other liquers by soaking fruit and spices in vodka, straining out the fruit, and adding sugar syrup to taste.  You might like to try some of this stuff, it's easy to do and came out very nice.

Are you really a Swede?  I am half Swedish, and would like to learn more about my culinary heritage.  Thankyou, MC

Rachael Ray of Food Network's 30-Minute Meals is always saying, \"My mom invented this when she had a bunch of (blank) left over, and now it's a family favorite.\" Well last night I threw together a bunch of ingredients that were nearing the point of expiration and the results were pretty darn good. I had poached an extra chicken breast when I made the enchilada casserole, so I cut that into medium-sized chunks and mixed it with some purchased aioli that is a week away from the end of its one-month shelf-life. Salt, pepper and Todd diced up some nearing-flabby celery (still crisp enough to provide some crunch when it was diced small, though) and chopped walnuts. Then was the best part: blue cheese left over from lunch one day when I ordered one of those custom-made tossed salads with walnuts, blue cheese and beets, and the guy added so much blue cheese that I saved a full cupful to use later. So we've been sprinkling blue cheese in everything. I think Todd's decided it needs to be a Walker Kitchen Staple. Put the chicken salad on toasted bread with a lettuce leaf. Todd ate the leftovers on the left over half of my morning bagel. Now the cupboard is approaching bare, except for some Hawaiian bread, strawberries, a chicken breast and an Italian turkey sausage in the freezer. Think I can come up with something out of that?

Todd and I went to Otto last night. Tuesday, 6:30, and we didn't have to wait, although when we were leaving we noticed quite a few people waiting. Fortunately, it has a big, nice waiting area with tall tables where you can stand and sip your drink (maybe even order a snack?). They've placed a lot of the tables for two in a corridor area near the kitchen, though, and that's where we ended up. (I looked around, and most of the other areas of the restaurant only had tables for four or more.) Not great seats, but not as bad as it sounds. We ordered antipasti: cauliflower ($4), spicy artichoke hearts ($4) and swordfish ($8). They came out on a tray in these little tan crocks with spoons and a wax-paper packet of bread. The cauliflower with capers and artichokes with almonds were good but a little too similar to each other; the chunks of swordfish were my favorite, in this wonderfully fruity olive oil and with sweet, sweet fried fennel. The pizza, which was the pizza of the day, a meatball and mozzarella one with tomato sauce ($13), was kinda boring. Cute, with tiny little meatballs and a flat, flat crust that was too soggy in the center to eat out of hand. I think the type of crust they use is probably better with the less-traditional toppings. I saw an asparagus pizza I might like to try if I can get Todd to go back. We saw some interesting things go by; the gnocchi of the day was big strips of fried pizza dough, and I wanted to try a celery root and citrus salad. The best part of the meal was the gelato ($7); I had ricotta gelato with wine-poached figs and candied walnuts and Todd had two kinds, butterscotch with crunchy toffe and pistacio (we could have shared, it was so rich, but then I wouldn't get the kind I wanted). I wonder if it'd be OK to skip the pizza next time we go, and load up on the salads and antipasti?

A cooking marathon on Sunday, when I made the chicken enchilada casserole and this. The strata is supposed to chill for at least 8 hours or for a day, so I made it on Sunday for dinner last night. First I sauteed half a diced onion in butter. I bought a bunch of baby spinach and just shredded it by cutting across it without even taking it out of the bundle. Rinsed it well, twice, then nuked it until it was soft and squeezed all the liquid out. Then I mixed it with the onions, plus salt, pepper and nutmeg. (The recipe actually called for frozen chopped, but I was shopping at the vegetable stand, not the grocery store, so I got fresh.) Then I put three of these layers in my casserole: stale bread cubes (about 4 cups total), spinach mixture, shredded parmesan cheese (about 3 tablespoons) and shredded Montery Jack (about 3/4 cup; the recipe called for Guyere, which I'm sure would have been better, but I used what I had--this is, after all, a recipe for leftovers). Chill for 8 hours or overnight. Let it come to room temperature, about 30 minutes, and preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Bake for 45 to 55 minutes until set. While mine was baking, I could hear the neighbor in the hallway complaining that he could smell gas. Well, yes, the oven does use gas. It made me wonder if he has ever turned his oven on. He finally got the super, who came up and rang my bell to ask about the gas smell (although I had heard the super tell the neighbor that he didn't smell anything; I should have put an end to the whole conversation sooner). By the end it smelled like baking bread and melty cheese.

My mom made a great chicken enchilada casserole when I was growing up, but (horrors!) the recipe used a couple of cans of \"cream of\" soup. I hunted down a recipe that didn't use the canned soup but had similar, creamy results. This one was pretty good, and you make the chile sauce from scratch (sort of; you do use a can of diced green chiles). Cook half a diced onion and a minced garlic clove in 2 tablespoons olive oil until they're soft, then stir in 2 tablespoons of flour. Add 1 1/2 cups chicken stock (I poached chicken breasts in water with a bouillon cube and reserved the liquid to use for the stock) and stir until it starts to thicken and gets bubby. Then add 4 oz diced green chiles and 1/2 cup sour cream. Put a little of the sauce in the bottom of a square baking pan, then layer 2 quartered corn tortillas (wrapped in damp paper towels and heated in the microwave to soften; the recipe softens them in boiling oil), a generous 1/2 cup shredded chicken (from the poached breasts), a handful of shredded Montery Jack cheese and 1/3 of the sauce. Repeat layers two more times, and top with more cheese. Bake in a 350 degree oven 25 to 35 minutes until bubbly.

From now on, I am keeping cubes of Hawaiian bread and a bag of semisweet chocolate chips in my freezer. I made individual servings of chocolate bread pudding last night from Cooking Light that Todd declared were \"the best thing you have made so far.\" So, in case I lose the recipe, here it is: Toast 2 cups of 1/2-inch cubes of Hawaiian bread (a slightly sweet white bread) in a 350 degree oven (I skipped this step because my cubes were stale). Mix 2/3 cup milk, 1 egg, 2 tablespoons sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons cocoa powder, 1 tablespoon flavored liquer (the recipe called for Kahlua, but I used Grand Marnier) and 1/2 teaspoon vanilla in a 4-cup glass measure or a medium bowl. Mix in the toasted cubes and chill for at least 30 minutes or up to 4 hours. Split half the bread cubes between two 6-ounce ramekins, layer 1/2 tablespoon chocolate chips into each, then layer the remaining bread cubes over the top and sprinkle each with another 1/2 tablespoon chocolate chips. Bake in a waterbath in a 325 degree oven 35 minutes until set. We ate them warm.

my friend ralph makes a super thai curry with bok choy (it's called pak soi here): he stirfries the sliced thicker stalks with diced chicken and lots of garlic, scallions and then thai green curry paste, adds coconut milk, lets it briefly bubble, then throws in the tender leaves and lots of basil. it's simple but SO delicious. it's on the table in like 5 minutes and it receives hours of compliments...
Kim

So tonight I need to use up the rest of the bok choy. I think I want to try it raw, though, although the Asian-influenced dishes you two mentioned give me some ideas. Maybe a ginger dressing with red pepper strips and scallions? I guess I'll experiment a bit tonight (husband's going to be in class).

My coworker just came by and told me how she makes her healing ginger tea (no amounts, though): chop fresh ginger and simmer it in water for \"a long time\" (I think it took less than an hour for her to make), then add a Lipton tea bag and steep for a normal amount of time. There weren't any bits of ginger, so I don't know if she strained them out or used cheesecloth while steeping the ginger, but the liquid was cloudy, so I'll probably try the first technique. Add honey and lemon and you're done. I'm sure it'll take a lot of experimentation for me to get it right in my own kitchen, but it's worth it. It's spicy-hot with ginger and you can feel it blooming warmth in your chest as you drink it. Great stuff.

Another coworker has been trying to get the recipe and technique right for two years, and he finally has it. He said things go pretty much as I said, but use about a liter of water and boil the ginger (scrubbed and sliced but not peeled) for about 30 to 45 minutes. He also said it takes copious amounts of honey, so keep adding and tasting until you've got it right.

My coworker just came by and told me how she makes her healing ginger tea (no amounts, though): chop fresh ginger and simmer it in water for \"a long time\" (I think it took less than an hour for her to make), then add a Lipton tea bag and steep for a normal amount of time. There weren't any bits of ginger, so I don't know if she strained them out or used cheesecloth while steeping the ginger, but the liquid was cloudy, so I'll probably try the first technique. Add honey and lemon and you're done. I'm sure it'll take a lot of experimentation for me to get it right in my own kitchen, but it's worth it. It's spicy-hot with ginger and you can feel it blooming warmth in your chest as you drink it. Great stuff.

Another coworker has been trying to get the recipe and technique right for two years, and he finally has it. He said things go pretty much as I said, but use about a liter of water and boil the ginger (scrubbed and sliced but not peeled) for about 30 to 45 minutes. He also said it takes copious amounts of honey, so keep adding and tasting until you've got it right.

Polenta is something I've only discovered recently, thanks to the cooks in the test kitchen at work. They introduced me to the prepared tubes of polenta that can be sliced and then heated in a variety of ways. That, in a backward way, led me to the creamy polenta I can make with the ordinary cornmeal in my freezer (yes, my freezer, with my different types of flour and butter; it's the only storage space I have). So Monday night I made creamy polenta (bring 4 cups water to boil, add 1 cup polenta gradually while whisking, stir over heat for 2 minutes, simmer covered over low heat for more than half an hour, stirring occasionally, then add butter, salt, pepper and lots of Parmesan). I also sauteed some bulk turkey sausage and then added sliced garlic (which burned while I wasn't paying attention so I picked it all out and threw it away) and some broccoli. Then we ate the sausage mixture over the polenta. We have lots of leftover polenta, which has probably hardened up, so I'm going to toss cubes of toasted polenta with roasted red peppers, Parmesan and chopped kalamata olives for dinner tonight. We'll see. I have no idea if it'll work or be good.

I've been sick with a bad cold lately, so I haven't been cooking much that's interesting. In fact, I practically slept through the last four days. Then when I came into work today, a coworker made a mug of her famous ginger tea for me. The tea's cloudy with what I think must be some form of ginger has some kind of citrus, but it's sweet, with the strongest ginger flavor that clears you right up. If I can get the recipe from her I'll put it up here. I was stunned when I came to my site and discovered I'm going on a week without writing anything. I really have been very lazy about cooking lately. Here are a couple of things I did make that didn't seem to suffer too much from the shortcuts I took. First there was a quick chicken parm from Martha Stewart's new Everyday Food magazine. I'm finding that I turn to that magazine a lot when it's dinnertime; the recipes are all written so concisely and they're in this cute little booklet so they tend to come across as very accessible. Whether they're good is sort of another matter, but I did like the chicken (Todd and I both gave a curried shrimp recipe the thumbs down, though). We bought cutlets, so it was simply a matter of dredging them in beaten egg then bread crumbs (purchased, yes, so sorry--I was sick) seasoned with a lot of freshly grated Parmesan cheese. Panfried for a couple minutes on each side, then slid into a pan with a layer of marinara on the bottom. Topped with fresh mozzarella and put them under the broiler for just shy of 5 minutes. Ate the leftovers today on a roll. Also had a berry crumble that was just a bag of frozen mixed berries (unsweetened from Trader Joe's) with a crumb topping of oats, brown sugar, walnuts, butter and flour. Todd put his superb skills to use cutting the butter into the mixture (his breakfast specialty is lighter-than-air drop biscuits). Then we spooned the hot berries over vanilla ice cream. I was elated (it may have been the cold medicine, but the crumble was good, too).

I personally think he is a real jerk.  He came across as a really nice person when the different TV channels were interviewing him and when I watch his show I know I could NEVER work for a so called person like him.  I realize that he has alot of responsibility on his shoulders but he doesn't have to be such an _______.
Donna

The longer I watch this show I really wish that everyone of his waiters and the rest of his help would tell him what a ___ up he is and walk out on him.  It is not the waiters fault when the kitchen help screws up.  He is to interested in flirting with all the girls than he is about what is going on in the resturant.  Then he has to have him MOM go and try to smooth things out for him.  He is a big JOKE.  If he doesn't change his attitude I hope he fails big time.

THIS ROCCO IS A REAL PIECE OF WORK, OH I MEAN S#$t!!!  OK, HIS DEDICATED WORKER FALLS AND BREAKS HIS ARM IN HIS BUSINESS AND HE SENDS HIM HOME.  DOES HE NOT KNOW THESE PEOPLE ARE WORKING FOR HIM TO EARN A LIVING, NOT BECAUSE THEY IDOLIZE HIM, AS HE OBVIOUSLY THINKS.  I HOPE HE FALLS ON HIS A@$, AND LOSES EVERYTHING.  AS A BUSINESS OWNER MYSELF, I CAN BELIEVE HE COULD HAVE STAFF IF HE TREATS THEM SO BADLY. REMEMBER, WHAT COMES AROUND GOES AROUND!!! HE WILL GET HIS, AND HE NEEDS IT. WHAT AN ARROGANT SOB!!!  NOT TO MENTION, HIS FOOD OBVIOUSLY SUCKS, WHEN ALL THE HYPE FROM THE SHOW IS GONE, HE WILL BE TOO!!!

I watched the show for the first time today and thought that the owners behavior was not that great. Looking at it in another perspective, it is difficult to run your own business. Also, the show has hours of footage that they condense into a half hour time slot. There might be many positive reactions that are not shown.

Where does one begin? I am a classically trained professional chef who has been working throughout the Beverly Hills area for 14 years. I must say that I originally ADORED Rocco on the Food Network's Melting Pot program. Now, it's next to impossible to even think about him as a true talent, let alone ever watch a program involving him EVER again. Not to mention the fact that I shall never set foot into one of his restaurants and support him. He is a cad, stumbling over himself and his big, fat, undeserved attitude and arrogance. His capitalistic attitude, constantly referencing his deep-pocketed sponsors, Am-Ex & Coors are truly offensive and distastful. And his disbelief of the injury sustained by his waiter on HIS property is not only disturbing, but opens him up to the world's biggest lawsuit. What an absolute idiot! And bringing his mommy around to the fuming customers was laughable and pathetic. The most repulsive was him sticking his tongue in a customer's ear and letting her pet him under the table, as he refers to his growing excitement over this matter. How dare he blame his overworked, underpaid waitstaff for his and his kitchen's unpreparedness? How dare he? He has to remember that he should be grateful for having kind and talented enough waiters to deal with his system that clearly doesn't work. He spoke down to them and told the \"children\" to quiet down as they voiced their displeasure with the myriad restaurant problems. I agree with the previous writer that indeed he is a big joke. He's digging himself an early grave and it's well deserved.

I keep forgetting to watch the show, then I'm kicking myself on Monday morning, but now I don't feel that bad about missing it. (Unless it's fun to watch him go down in flames?) The kitchen manager, who on the first show seemed really great and grounded, appeared to be very happy to be working for Rocco. I think I'd watch just to see how he's taking it all (seeing someone he admired - Rocco - brought so low).

Rocco's has so much potential, and could be a very successful restaurant. I think Rocco, needs to tone it down a bit, his manager should be taking the slack off his back. Rocco is the \"host\", his manager needs to do the running, serving, making sure food is cooked on time. I have been in the restaurant business for 10 years. I have worked in the front of the house, back of the house, serving, cooking, hostessing, managing, bartending among other tasks. I have brought business up in every restaurant I have ever worked in at least 90%. God the things I could do with this place are absolutely amazing. I wish I could be there and bring it out of the water, but in the mean time I guess watching will have to be satisfying. Good Luck Rocco. Nicki G.

I watched the show for the first night tonight.  I am wowed for many reason.
As a resturant manager, it's exciting for me to know that the public gets to see the behind the stage action.  Working in a resturant is not easy, and I am hoping the viewers will be be enlightened by the show.  At the same time it's a very stressful show, I wanted to jump through the TV and fix things.
However, you have to keep in mind this resturant has a added factor most businesses do not - a TV SHOW!  It has to add more drama - it helps the ratings.  Rocco has to be out on the floor - selling himself - it brings the guest and the rating count up.  He has a team of managers that should be able to hold the place together.  
I'm shocked by some of the ways issues are handled, like hiring back the bartender - Pure Stupidity - He should have known she would walk back in the joint and show of her promotion and favoritism.  She showed she was in no way professional enough for a management position.  Never reward a quitter.  The staff's reaction is justifable, but I still think some of them have a small case of The Drama queen syndrome.

Rocco is unprofessional. Taking the quitter bartender on a jaunt and giving her a scooter was assine. She should have been canned immediately - because bragging was meanspirited. From now on I will be more patient with waiters etc. I had NO idea this kinda stuff went on in restaurants.  Their jobs are extremely hard to do!  Most of the people in this place are dedicated and do a very good job!

First of all to all those people who are putting the restaurant and/or Rocco down.  You don't know who this person trully is, you see what's on t.v., and like one of the other commentors stated there are probably hundreds of reams of film and they are showing only what pertains to that actual show.  So, in essence if a show that Sunday is about the staff getting upset or blah, blah ,blah, than that's what they will show.  If that episode is about the staff being happy and joyful and blah blah than that's the footage they will use.  It's all about the ratings for a t.v. show-HELLO!?  To sit there and state that you think he is a _________ and he's a this and he's a that... do you kow him personally? do you know what's he's like under pressure? I know I am not the same person when I am under pressure, attitudes change and people react differently.  Just remember it's not the wait staff whose name is on the canopy outside the restaurant, it's Rocco's and if it fails than it's on him.  His managers need to step it up and take some of the pressure and the stress off of him and get the wait staff in check.  Working in a restaurant is stressful and they will experience growing pains... my advice to the wait staff is to suck it up and do your job, stop bitching and if you can't- move on! They are loads of wait staffers in New York who would give there right arm to be working with such a wonderful chef as Rocco DiSpirito.

In a \"small correction\" note to a fellow poster dated 8-11-03 @ 9:01 a.m. US Eastern Time:

Dear ***,

       While I agree that the idea of bribing an employee back to work with a ride on a scooter, is an absurd idea, I think that you are misinformed.  Rocco did not give the bartender a 'ride' on the Vesba.  He gave her, the Vesba.   I think it's sad how the gay man went through so much stress, in deciding on whether or not to quit, so that he could get his very  own SUV on the rehire bribing tip, when we know Rocco isn't going to give him anything like that. Rocco did that on a panicked spur of the moment.  He freaked, made a bad decision (as he's known for), and that was that.  Very unprofessional indeed.   What also was unprofessional,  was that bartender not keeping her trap shut.  I don't think she bragged to be mean, I think she is just immature and didn't think before she opened her big mouth.

Also,  I watched the show for the first and last time last night.  I did notice right off, his flirtatious nature with the ladies, and how he described it as \"being with his guests\". What about the rest of them, Roc?
My mother who watches on a regular basis says \"Well of course it's not going to run that smooth, it's only been open a week\".  Dear Mother, Rocco has two other restaraunts open, and he should know by now, what works and what doesn't.  Clearly he does not.  And by this, we would think that the other two stores are not running too nicely, either.   \"It's the staff\".  If it's the staff, he should have picked his staff more carefully, thus to run a more clean and smooth restaraunt.  Rocco is a child, playing an adult game.  This is Rocco, turning his own dream into a nightmare.

As a Culinary Institute of America grad and chef myself, will someone please help me understand why Rocco refuses to stop flirting with the guests and get into the kitchen especially when the food is coming out \"piping cold\" and from what I can see not very appealing to the eye.  Sure it is important to be in the front talking to the guests, but there will be no customers to schmooze with if the food continues to sucks and they stop coming in!!

I'm glad I had the opportunity to see what all this hype was about relating to Rocco's.  The buzz has been extreme.

A Doctor from California who is coming to NYC for the US Tennis Open was asking me what I knew of it and I just really didn't know anything about it at all...it wasn't on my list of nice places.  So I told her that I had no idea and couldn't say one way or the other.  But did recommend the TV program to her.

Well, who knows?  Maybe it is a nice place most of the time.  But after that little peek inside this operation and seeing things occur as they did, I can only come to one conclusion.  I probably will never know.  I don't see me going there any time soon to be totally honest.

As an alternative to Rocco's... I do have another suggestion.  Should you find yourself in New York City on the isle of Manhattan go to Homestead, instead!  This operation rich in history and quality would be my personal first choice between the two:

Having watched this show from the beiginning I am relieved to see that FINALLY Rocco has gone into the kitchen for a night. He is after all a Chef, and from the pr5esentation of the food a good one at that. He should leave the running of the front to his Managers and come out to see how it's going a few times a night, but spend less time being a celebrity and more time as a Chef. From one Chef to another it makes a difference!

I had high hopes for Rocco, but with each passing episode, my disappointment and disgust grows exponentially.  It all started with how he treated Gideon then continued with how he repeatedly mishandles the other kitchen midadventures and his staffing problems (most of which were self-created).

I hate to point out the painfully obvious, but can someone give this guy a swift kick in the pants and send him back to the kitchen where he belongs ?! Let Mama do the shmoozing !  She's better at it anyhow.  The food will drastically improve, the customers will be happier and so will the staff. Why call it Rocco's when Rocco's no where near the kitchen  ???

One last thing.  Laurent is useless.  How is this man earning his paycheck - that's assuming he got one ? (I won't even get into the labor standard violations and dangerous working conditions for the kitchen staff).  Hope dear 'ol Rocco's got lots of insurance, he's gonna need it.

First of all, I know I'm going against the obvious negative vibe that has been firmly established on this page, but what that hell, ambiguity affords such pleasures.

Gideon is an idiot.  His arm is not broken PERIOD.  I'm a doctor, if his arm was broken, it would have been secured with a cast and not put in a 50-cent sling.  While I'm quick to judge Gideon (due to the fact that...like I just said...he's an idiot) I don't think I can black robe and gavel the rest of the crew.  Editing does amazing things to perceptions, and I for one, don't feel obligated to allow some college kid to forge my opinions of some with his witty editing skills.  Rocco is doing as good as he can with what he has.  Give the guy a break.  At least he’s out there making things happen; giving losers like us something to discuss and debate.  Once you’ve grown the meatballs to start your own business while the entire country watches then you can talk to me about Rocco’s skillz.

I've been following this show since its premeire,as entertaining as this new concept of reality tv is, I can only walk away from it every week feeling the same thing- sorry for poor Rocco! As charismatic as he is, it might not save his dream of running his own restruant, not if he continues on the path that he's on. Yes, yes, it's easy to criticize from the outside, but when something isn't working, whether it be a result from poor hr management skills, to actually not being in the kitchen to oversee the food as he should be - hello he's the chef- something has to give. I hope Rocco gets a clue soon and comes up w/ some permanent slouable solutions to his ever growing lists of problems, or his dream will no longer be !

When the show started, I thought it would be most interesting to watch and I allowed myself to get wrapped up in it.  I'm over it now.  What a dissapointment!  I understand that what we are permitted to see is only a part of what really happens, but what I have seen is enough to really turn me off.  And I know that the resturant business is highly competitive, and it's a \"dog eat dog\" mentality.  But you don't degrade and whip those who started out on your side, like Rocco has done with his staff. When he does acknowledge a mistake, his apologies are a quick after-thought, not in the least sincere. I feel sorry for his mom, she is being played like a fine tuned violin.  Rocco saw this \"survior\" type show as a way to make a name for himself, and therefore his resturants.  There was big $$$$ to be had, and he is banking that the publicity will see him through financially.  That's what it's all about, isn't it?  There are those who aplaud Rocco for doing this.  It's all about $$$$.  And those gruppies who wanted the chance to be on TV and get the \"special treatment\" from Rocco...get a life!  Is this what it's like in most resturants?  Give me an small old fashioned diner anytime!

I have watched this show since the beginning. I too am Italian. This concept of French bistro surroundings and paper boats don't cut it. If he truly is a good or even great chef, he needs to get in the kitchen. As for the Manager - fire him. He is supposed to take all the crap. I can do a better job. As for the food, keep it hot. Rocco stop flirting. Good luck

I think millions of people are hoping this loser Rocco crashes and burns. I think the network probably looked for a spoiled, arrogant, self-important restauranteur, so that we would all cheer when he falls on his ass, like 90% do. I realize that the show is edited for effect, but does anyone really believe that Rocco is a nice guy on the floor of the editing room?

Hmmmmmmmmm
Paper plates and silver?
Ego the size of Michigan?
Mommy bailing Rocco out of PR incidents?
Hiring back the bartender?
Calling people \"baby's\" for lying?
Token feigned empathy for overworked and underappreciated employees?
Kitchen Mgr. too preoccupied with sucking up to boss and cameras?
Kitchen located so far from floor that food gets cold?
Rocco serving? (for a few minutes at least)
Flies in the kitchen?
Kitchen fire and restaurant stays open?!?! (FYI :: health code violation in case toxic fumes were released and fire extinguisher emitted contaminants)
Sweaty chefs dripping in food?
Sending injured and offended worker home after working to fulfull Rocco's dream?
Cold food...constantly?
Unpaid bills and payroll?
Inexperienced weekly attempts at a reorg. that might produce results?
Etc. etc.

What would I do?
Take bus. Mgt. 101 to start.
Get into counseling to lose the ego.
Fire the kitchen Mgr. ... oh! You can't because he's a friend and you owe him a favor?
Listen Listen Listen to your employees and validate them. And...LISTEN!!!!!
Don't micromanage.
Get back into the kitchen where you're supposed to be to let the Mgr. Laurent do his job.
Pay your bills.
Let your mom relax and teach the chefs how to.
Listen Listen Listen.
Get a better pest control service.
Take fewer reservations and don't bite off more than you can chew for greed sake.
Take back the Vespa.
Go get the gay waiter back and double his wages.
Lose the paper products. It might fulfill your fantasy but frankly, it cheapens what you're doing no matter what you may think. Sure, you serve it (force it) to the patrons long enough they'll accept it but Army Ants have the same philosophy about moving around an object.
Use an ice cream scoop (measured to your portion) for making meatballs instead of measuring every one....come oooon! 
Quit sucking up to the patrons, it won't keep the food warm nor change their devistated and horrendous feelings of disappointment.
Find a way to install a food elevator with warmer.
I could go on forever but start with those for now.

The good side of Rocco? 
He's a good chef...and...he loves his mom, that's obvious.

What can I say, that has not already been said?
Poor Rocco has no management skills YET!  He will have to become more aggressive to make it!  The three cooks that lied and did not come to work will now have formed  a track record for themselves.  Their knives will never get well seasoned because they are not TEAM PLAYERS.  You have to have a passion for the hospitality industry to survive and make it prosper.  If you do not have one coming in you should not be there. This not only includes the owner but the staff that is working for you
Passion for food, people, and the team you are working with.  This is taught by the owner and chef himself.  Rocco has to grow up a bit and learn to look in the mirror and create some wellness within himself to he can spread that to his staff.  Being a Master Chef is not the first step to teaching and spreading joy in your life or establishment.   Good luck Rocco

I have watched the Resturant program for the past few weeks.  I can only say that I am not impressed at all by Mr. DiSpirito's business acumen.  Quite the contrary, I find him to be self-absorbed, conceitedm and more concerned with his public image on telivision than that of his employees.  He is certainly not a role model that I would want to emulate as a small business operator.  

Mr. DiSpirito, this is NO way to run a business.

Get over it! Rocco is brilliant and as all NEW and BETTER ideas - he is taking heat for offering an alchemy of traditional and fusion, paper and silver, casual and 5 star dinning to his guest and all his \"inexperienced\" employees and critics are doing is leveling him back down to the \"norm\" range...well the guy is a genius...who among us will ever forget Coors, Vespa, AmX OPEN [A dead brand until Rocco] and the Mitsubishi being towed away...I am totally digging a Mitz and I drive a Bimmer....He is  on the cutting edge and sometimes the blade gets a little too close...but you idiots have a rare opportunity to see the inner workings of a creative visionary [the fact that he is a Hottie doesn't hurt] but beyond his sex appeal the guy is  brilliant. Ask any restauranteur...staff is not the bell weather...but media attention is...Rocco is not allowing the media to perform  a post mortem examination of his vision...he is letting you and me and his rivals view the conception from an intimate vantage point - that many mistake a bump in the road for failure when it is actually the creative process in motion...maybe this is a clear illustration of why there are so few \"creative\" people in the world...Rocco - Continued Success. Love the show.

I was watching Sara Moulton Live, on the Food Network some time ago. Rocco was on making Meatloaf. As an amateur cook myself, what better than having a real pro like Rocco offer a recipe on a basic like this? I couldn't wait. I am always looking to improve my cooking.....

When he started loading in the romano cheese, I started to get worried. I was thinking if this is a famous pro and his Meatloaf is so wacky, what hope does he have? I was really disappointed. I must be too much of a purist; certain things should not be messed with. Emeril is guilty of this, too, which is why he is just about the worst chef there is.

Then, I watched Rocco's show. The most narcissitic person I have seen in a long time. I get so frustrated watching him, I can't sleep afterwards. The level of incompetence, for which he is responsible as the owner, gives me nightmares. He should start downstairs, get it together there and then go upstairs and kiss the groupies. And he should also fire his chef: the reason the food is always cold, is because that guy can't organize the orders. I give that place another month and I'm sure Rocco covered himself moneterily.

Hmmm after reading everybodies comments from the \"i hope rocco reads this and emails me teri, to Mr Anonymous PhD I sit back and think of all the restaurants I have worked in and ate at, TGIFridays (closest thing to the way Rocco acts is the managers i had there), Tumbleweed (great food fun place to work, horrible clientele that don't know how to tip, Perkins (nothing to say about that place, drunks that can't tell a ten from a 1 great tips), Ryans (its a buffet what do you expect).

I was looking forward to this show from the previews I saw to every episode(haven't missed one yet) I want to go eat at this place, just so I can critique everything from the service to the food, I know they had a \"restaurant critic\" but who better to judge than an average american.  The way the waiters get treated and the slow rate of the food if I was eating there and saw the owner to busy talking and making out with customers to get my food to me, that from what all the customers are saying is expensive, I would be furious.  

He needs to get the restaurant running first and then worry about kissing every girl.

Just my 2 cents, I drive a Camaro and Im going for my associate degree in Law right now.  Not a PhD and Not a Bimmer.

Jeaze, TV, that portal always makes something not quite real. You can not tell what's real from inside a tube. So I give up judging what is really going on at Rocco's! I just watch the show as it appears, and it's very interesting that way. 

I think the guy is doing a great job of making a real-tv dramma. Will this resturant make-it? (as far as we can tell in our little tube?) I think that's all that matters to me at this point. (but it IS only TV, so lighten-up!)

I do in no way think Rocco is some great guy who is a victim of bad editing.  If you just look at how the guy operates, and the decisions he makes regarding his employees.  For example, he has everyone come in early to get makeovers to fit his restaurant theme.  Once they have been there for a couple of hours and are finished having 15 bottles of hair spray put in their hair, he deems it an appropriate time to let some of them know they are no longer employed.  I am sure noone was getting any compensation to be there in the first place.  I would tell Rocco to kiss my ass if I was the girl who got canned after she had to go through all that crap.  I sure hope it did not interfere with Rocco's coffee break to tell them they were fired after making parading them about like barnyard animals.  Arrogant pompous narcisist.  The place doesn't look to sanitary either.  I wouldn't trust eating a package of saltines from that place.  The guys who edit the footage see everything.  I am sure they decided it was time to pick on poor little Rocco.  He is an ass repeatedly.

As a person with quite a bit of restaurant experience under my belt (tray) I've come to find the ethos of an eating establishment is a top-down proposition.  Rocco's (the place) reflects this in the way the goodwill and wonderful energy of his staff was sqaundered by Rocco's (the person) egotistical pursuit of fame, fortune and women -- all at the expense of the very humanity food could/should celebrate.  Rocco, both place and person, left a very bad taste in my mouth.

I've watched the show for a few weeks and I must say:  Rocco you are super-gay.  Your b!tchy attitude, high maintenance, desire for chaos and drama are just too much.  And you are a 36 year old single male chef. C'mon!  Not that anything is wrong with being gay, it's just that I think you would be a better person and let that lil girl inside of you out into the world.  

As for your restaurant, I think the critics (NY Times, NY Post, etc.)  have pretty much signed the death certificate for your restaurant.  Since I am a graduate from J&W and a food/sanitation inspector, I can't even begin to list the health, sanitation and labor violations your restaurant has committed.  As for Laurent (Le Frog), retourné a France s.v.p.  

Wish for the best because you're gonna need it.

I religiously watch the show and I truly hope Rocco reads these comments from time to time so this is writen directly to him...

Rocco,

I understand your love for food and wanting to own your own company and Bravo for it! However, your management is taking your company along with your actions down very quickly. I am a manager and I would never treat your staff the way you and your management do. I am going to play devils advocate for one moment here. I do feel you handle somethings appropriately and your staff tends to think they have more say than they really should UNLESS! You have made them to believe they do have a say, then in that case it is completely your fault. I truly hope that your restaraunt rockets and you do well for yourself and I would love to be a part of your staff (unfortunately I am in Ohio) but you have to boost the morale quickly and you have to get your ass in the kitchen and start cooking and stop flirting with the ladies all the time, I don't care if you are the owner, people are there to enjoy Rocco's cooking too!

Ciao

i am sorry you have alot of stress i dont know how i would react under those terms but i do know this on tv the nurse said it was fractured yet under his pain he wanted to work no matter what. you could have showed some compassion yet there was none on your face. you could have given him a job or offered something but you just sent him home. please try to learn from this and grow as far as the waitres well she deserves to be let go but that is your call i think your doing the best you can i will pray for you and your mother in this stressful time in your life. i pray this will help you and you will grow from it. i also pray that when someone gets hurt in your resturant you will do better than you did with your waiter. god bless just count to ten and calm yourself only you can make your mind feel the stress. love ya

Ahhhh, so I am just now catching all the episodes on Bravo!  I avoided watching this show on Network TV due to the 15 years I spent working in Restaurants.... 7 of that in the kitchen in one capicity or another *linecook, catering, pantry, broiler, bartending, banquets* and the balance on the floor *cocktailing,table service* It literally makes me ill to watch this... Not because Rocco is a terribly bad guy (actually he's pretty typical, even tame compared some owners/chefs I've worked for... but because of the drama..... DRAMA! They aren't far off the mark from reality here...Tantrums, backstabbing, accidents, walkoff's, arguments... I used to come home and it would take me hours to calm down after every shift.... I think I probably \"opened\" 10 restaurants and it is EXACTLY like this...
This is a typical run at getting a restaurant started... He'll do fine in the end.... for awhile, anyway.  
PS.. I find Rocco a bit on the gay side and he is clearly compensating for that with all his fondling of the patrons but I've never met one that wasn't exactly like him... How boring...

Carrot soup last night. I have a coworker who will blend any pretty-colored vegetable into a soup, and this is one of her favorites. I love the thick, creamy texture of it without the guilt of cream. (Although I'm sure cream would be nice.) It's so easy, too, and I made a big enough batch to have leftovers for today and for the freezer (Todd won't eat carrot soup). It's easy enough to make just one serving, though. Just cut down on amounts. I diced one medium onion then sauteed it in butter in a large, deep skillet. Then I halved lengthwise a pound of baby carrots from a bag and added that to the skillet with a palmful of cumin. Stirred it around to toast the cumin, then added 4 cups of water and a veggie bullion cube (I think the Knorr cubes are just fine). Brought it to a boil and let it simmer, covered, about 25 minutes. Added cayenne and then pureed it in the blender in batches, mostly the carrots with just a little of the broth. I thinned the soup later with the broth left in the pan (it had all the cumin-cayenne flavor, too). That way you have more control over the thickness of the soup.

Let me know how you two come out with it. I was contemplating a recipe that uses dill instead, but I've come to the conclusion that I don't really like the idea of dill and carrots. I know it's a classic combo and all, but . . . . Maybe that'll inspire one of you and you can let me know how it is.

I still have a batch of this in the freezer. One of these days I'll have to bring it to lunch and see how it weathered the chill.

carrot soup is a family favourite here: i add a couple of quartered tomatoes to the pre-zap veggies...that tends to neutralize the sweetness of the carrots (my offspring doesn't like their soup too sweet)..and i use freshly-ground coriander seeds to flavour. if it's to be a \"meal soup\", i add little meatballs and some creme fraiche. we're not big cooked-carrot eaters in our house, but this never makes it to leftovers!
dill? no...wouldn't go for that either..

The meatballs sound good, too. I had a butternut squash soup once with large pieces of kale in it, and I liked the contrast in textures. Sometimes a big bowl of the same texture gets boring after a while.

Pizza dough is one of my favorite things to make. I'm still intimidated by yeast, but pizza dough seems so forgiving: the flat, thin final shape solves my main breadmaking problem, which is that the dough flattens out in the oven instead of holding the shape I made it and rising upward. I know I could solve that problem with a breadpan, but I like the freedom of a free-form loaf. Anyway, the pizza dough:

Last night I made a dish that's becoming an old standby. I like the sear/braise combo with single-serving pieces of meat because I feel safe that they won't dry out and become tough, but they will be cooked through. I'm not sure if I can really call it a braise if it's cooking in the liquid for less than an hour, but it seems like the easiest way to describe the technique. Last night it was pork chops (about an inch thick, no bone just because that's what was on sale). I seasoned them on both sides, then browned them for three minutes on each side, took them out of the pan, added 1/2 cup white wine, a heaping tablespoon mustard and about a 5-second drizzle of honey, mixed it up and scraped up the yummy brown stuff on the bottom of the pan, bubbled that down for a few minutes, then added the pork to it, closed the lid, and let it simmer for 12 minutes, turning the pork halfway through. (Why do I feel the need to get the whole recipe out in one sentence?) Then I served the sauce on top. I sliced up and toasted some bread and topped it with the leftover bean-tomato mixture from the night before. These are Todd's favorite kind of meals: a piece of meat, a veggie and a starch. I find them kind of boring (although the above comes out great; tender and sweet with some bite from the mustard). He hates casseroles (he does make an exception for enchilada casserole, but I don't have an old-standby recipe for that).

I had the prettiest little dinner last night (my last night of a long stretch of dinner alone). I sliced up a small yellow squash lengthwise, blanched some green beans and sugar snap peas, and hard-boiled an egg that I sliced in quarters lengthwise. Arranged on a plate squash-beans-egg slices-peas with a little dipping cup of aioli (garlic mayonnaise, which I bought fresh at the Amish Market, which does not seem to really be Amish) and some hard, thin breadsticks. Made me wish Todd didn't carry his camera with him everywhere. The green and yellow were so bright I would've liked to take a picture. Some prosciutto would have been nice, too.

Another night without Todd. He's back from Minnesota but now he has class. In fact, we figured out last night that he won't be home for dinner for another week (next Friday will be the first time). Saturday was his last meal at home, so he's going to be going on about two weeks without a homecooked meal. He doesn't seem to mind. Should I take it personally? I had a small fillet of some type of fish left over from making the fresh cod cakes (the fishmonger didn't have cod and so suggested a suitable substitute, then proceeded to give me too much of it). I bought a small head of radicchio, tossed it with sugar and salt, sauteed it in some butter, then put the fillet on top, put the lid on the pan and left it to steam. When it was finished cooking, I topped the fish with some leftover fig & olive tapenade. The fig in the tapenade went a ways to counter the bitterness of the radicchio, but not far enough for me. I think the radicchio needed more butter, sugar or maybe a little lemon juice to counter the bitter flavor. Maybe more cooking time. Me and my thoroughly American palate.

I think the radicchio needed more butter, sugar or maybe a little lemon juice to counter the bitter flavor. Maybe more cooking time. Me and my thoroughly American palate.

I made pasta salad Tuesday night (another night alone; Todd has a busy week). Lots of leftovers, so we both took some to work for lunch on Wednesday. I wasn't going to write it up, but Todd raved so much about it last night that I thought I'd share: Boil up some mini tortellini. While that's cooking, chop roasted red and yellow peppers (I had some left over from a steam-table lunch the other day when my eyes were way too big for my stomach), cooked ham, scallions, and artichoke hearts (I used unmarinated; I find the marinade overwhelming). Make a vinaigrette in the bottom of a big bowl, and then toss everything together in it. Easy, makes a lot, and I think it was better the second day. We used to eat pasta salad all the time when we were newly married and really poor. Maybe Todd's raving was nostalgia. Of course, this could go in any direction: Greek, with feta, olives, oregano; antipasto, with diced salami, marinated veggies and cheese; nicoise, with olives, tuna, green beans, red onion; southwestern with diced cheddar, scallions, cilantro, chicken, cumin. I think you'd have to vary the type of pasta you used.

Yes, do. We used to do a lot of southwestern-style cooking when we first moved out here (from Colorado). A corn and bean salsa  was my standby picnic potluck dish. Never thought to toss it with some tortellini, though. I bet that would be good. Let me know.

Last night I was all alone again, so I made spoonbread, something I always wanted to try but that Todd would say was not \"real food.\" I've never had it so I don't know if I got the right texture, but I can't imagine what texture would be better than the creamy, fluffy softness I ate for dinner. Every bite I changed my mind: egg dish? cornbread? The diced ham had infused it all with a faint salty smokiness and the scallions added a bite that kept the whole dish balanced. And it was easy to make a large serving for one: Soak 1/4 cup cornmeal in 1/3 cup water in a saucepan for 5 minutes, then add another 1/3 cup water and cook over medium heat for 2 minutes, until it starts to thicken, stirring frequently. In a separate bowl, mix together 1 egg, 1/3 cup buttermilk (my usual substitute is a mixture of nonfat plain yogurt and milk), salt, pepper, a heaping tablespoon freshly shredded Parmesan, and diced scallion and cooked ham. Add that to the cornmeal mixture. I baked it in a deep oven-safe bowl at 350 degrees for about 45 minutes (the recipe said 30, but I kept going until the center was set; when I took it out mine was still slightly jiggly but firm when I touched it). This would be a fun brunch dish, with smaller individual servings made in oven-safe mugs (as the recipe, which I took copious liberties with, suggested). The cookbook, Little Meals, recommended sauteed apple slices as a side, but I ate my apple fresh.

I subscribed to Gourmet about 6 months ago and have become a bit disillusioned with it after trying a few recipes that have come out pretty bland. I made fresh cod cakes from the Gourmet Everyday column last night and was disappointed. I think it may be my fault, though. My parents followed the Pritikin diet when I was a child, which was low-sodium among other things, so I'm very stingy with the salt (out of habit, not some attempt to be healthy). I also tend to cook things from the Everyday column since the recipes are less ambitious; I wonder if that has influenced my experience for ill. Some of my favorite recipes from Epicurious, I just realized, are from Gourmet (Bulgur \"Risotto\" with Spinach and Bacon, Chocolate-Dipped Coconut Macaroons), and I do have one keeper from my subscription (Cincinnati-Style Chili), so maybe I'm writing it off too soon. Perhaps I've just made some bad recipe choices. I'm going to eat the leftover cod cakes on a roll with some lettuce and mango chutney, which I bet will salvage them.

That crumble topping looks awesome! What's the recipe for that part?
Kim

That was my favorite part of the pie, too. It came from this cookbook I've been thinking about throwing out (Basic Baking by Lora Brody), but now I think I have to keep it (I made a pineapple upside down cake from it that was also pretty awesome).

Walnut Crumble Topping
1/2 cup walnut pieces
1/2 cup packed brown sugar
1/2 cup oats
6 tablespoons butter, chilled and cut in small pieces

Mix the first three ingredients together, then cut in the butter with a pastry blender (I actually used my fingers to mush the butter into the dry ingredients). Then you just spread the topping over the pie filling before you bake it.

Friday we had soup weather here in New York, so I pulled out a recipe that I've made before: Baked Potato Soup. (Yesterday and today, though, have been beautiful. Yesterday we went to an afternoon Yankees game--my first time at Yankee stadium--and it was pouring rain all morning but had cleared up beautifully by afternoon. And the Yankees won 5-4 against Tampa. The hot dogs were exquisite, but the pretzels were basically bread with a lot of surface area.) Anyway, Friday's soup: I baked 2 potatoes in the microwave since I just discarded the skins anyway, and mashed them up roughly with a fork. Then I scattered 1/3 cup flour in the bottom of my Dutch oven and slowly whisked in 3 cups milk (no heat). Then I turned on the burner to medium and cooked until the milk started to thicken (less than 10 minutes), stirring. Add the potatoes, season with salt and pepper, then add about 1/2 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, finely chopped scallion and diced ham. Top each bowl with more chopped scallion and shredded cheese. Pretty simple. (You won't find much complex cooking here.) It gets very thick, especially the leftovers, which end up the texture of twice-baked potato filling. Todd has left for Minnesota, so I get to make whatever I want for dinner (I'd rather he were here, though). Tonight it's fresh cod cakes, then tomorrow I'm going to try spoonbread with ham (this Little Meals cookbook instructs you to bake the spoonbread in large mugs, which I thought was cute but can't do because I don't have any mugs that size).

It was good, although I'm still on a quest for the perfect peanut sauce. We mixed all the ingredients together to take to lunch the next day, but I think it was nicer with all the ingredients separate. It seemed fresher, cleaner. I'll post the picture tonight.

Have you ever gone to the market with a list and a plan, only to find that the main event is not available? I wanted to roast a pork tenderloin on Sunday, but couldn't find one. The butchers at the markets in my area seem to get knife-happy with this cut and slice it up into chops as soon as it arrives. So I didn't have a pork tenderloin. I did, however, have a chunk of pork loin that had such an odd collection of bones in it that it is impossible for me to identify. Seemed like a good braising candidate, though.

I think the world is divided evenly into those who love the pudding skim and those who hate it. I, unfortunately, fall into the latter camp, but I have all kinds of weirdness about pudding anyway: I have to eat it in tiny bites because I don't like a mouthful of pudding, it can't have things in it (tapioca, yuck), there can't be too much there. Although I will eat a slice of pudding pie, which is basically pudding combined with other textures. A giant dollop of whipped cream does wonders, too.

I went shopping this weekend and bought a couple of books that are relevant to these pages: Salt, a World History and What Einstein Told His Cook. (I also bought a belted knit top, a pair of pants and a light dress to celebrate the advent of spring--I should have bought earmuffs instead.) I've started reading the Einstein book, which was written by Washington Post columnist Robert Wolke. The book follows a basic formula: A reader poses a question, and Wolke answers it by simplifying the science so it's understandable to a layperson. He's already answered two things I've wondered about in the last week: Is hominy really soaked in lye, and why are the fleshes of different animals different textures and colors? Alton Brown-type stuff, with recipes. It's an interesting book, and one I'm planning to keep as a reference at work. So ask me a sciency-type food-related question, and I'll see if the answer is in the book.

I hope it doesn't embarrass my mom if I say that she didn't do much cooking from scratch when I was growing up (neither did my dad, although he could make a mean Bisquick breakfast). One thing we often had was tacos, made with ground beef, preshredded cheese, store-bought shells and one of those taco seasoning packets. I'm not saying I went out and bought a tortilla press or anything, but I decided to reproduce the seasoning packet experience from the spices I have in my kitchen. I also substituted store-bought flour tortillas for the hard taco shells we used to have. If I had felt more ambitious last night I could have fried my own corn tortillas (which I've seen Cooks Illustrated do) and made my own pico de gallo, but I was trying to work with what I had on hand. Simple meal, really. I used ground chuck, sauteed it, salted it, then transferred it to a paper towel lined bowl to drain the fat. I wiped the skillet out and toasted my preground cumin, cayenne and ancho chili pepper. Then I added the ground beef and some water (like you do with the seasoning packet), then simmered it for a while to meld the spices and get a saucy but thick texture. Served on flour tortillas with shredded cheese and lettuce and some salsa (we used Muir Glenn Organic, which has a nice little punch of lime juice). Not sophisticated, but Todd was pleased (it had beef in it). Next I want to try to recreate my mom's lemon cheesecake bars with a crumble topping, which uses a lemon cake mix as the base, without the cake mix. (I made a batch with the original recipe last week when I first ran across it again and found that they're addictive to me in some sort of pre-formative sense. I crave them in a way I can feel bodily.)

i've hard-cooked my eggs like this for years: a perfect method. but i ALSO use it for boned, skinned chicken breast (what we call kipfilet)...covered in water in a pan with a tight-fitting lid, brought to a good boil, and then turned off, and left to cool in the liquid. it makes for moist, velvety chicken, perfect for salads especially...
Kim
2003-06-18 08:13:00
I'm always poaching chicken breasts for something (I got a new Tex-Mex cookbook recently and a lot of recipes call for shredded chicken). How long do you leave it in the liquid? Until it has completely cooled?

yeah. completely. well, till lukewarm at least. i think it might be a bit risky otherwise. but it's always worked for me.

OK, I am inspired by all of you bloggers. Inspired and determined to record my own culinary adventures. I am of a peculiar brand of food enthusiast, though. Not the kind who tries the same recipe over and over again, honing it to perfection. Rather, I never make the same thing twice. I have a huge binder full of recipes that I have cut out or printed out and have never tried. Planning a meal sends me into a state of anxiety not because I have no options, but because I have too many options, every one of them new to me. Frankly, I think it drives my husband crazy. He's the kind of guy who orders the same thing at his favorite restaurants every time we go there. Steak and fries at Steak Frites. A fried chicken sandwich at U.J.'s Diner. Ham steak and eggs at Austin Street. Whenever I ask him what we should make for dinner, he answers \"taco salad\" (Fritos covered in beans, ground meat, lettuce, cheese, etc). After 7 years of marriage, it's kind of a joke (the kind of joke that can send me into a screaming fit; see above anxiety). I think it's because I view every mealtime as an opportunity to eat something great and can be depressed for hours when a meal is mediocre. But I'm not a food snob. A cheesesteak from B.B.'s or a slice of greasy pizzeria pizza can leave me quite content. Last night's pleasant repast was toasted rosemary bread with fig-and-olive tapenade and an orange. I can't do meals like that often, though, since my husband, Todd, is a big guy (tea- or tapas-type meals are not real meals). He's picky, too: no squash of any kind, mushrooms, corn off the cob, tofu, eggplant, kumquats, fruit with meat, things in his rice, casseroles. . . you get the idea. He's in business school part time, though, so on Wednesday and Thursday nights, when he has class, it's all about me (and only about me, which can be challenging, too, cooking for one). Tonight I'll make somen noodles with snow peas and peanut sauce. I have yet to find the perfect peanut sauce; tonight I'll try one I found in a book called Little Meals. Haven't decided whether to add some shrimp. I know chicken's the usual meat for that dish, but I'm kind of anti-chicken right now. I just can't stand the sight of those bloated breasts in the supermarket. Maybe there is something to be said for organic.

OK, I am inspired by all of you bloggers. Inspired and determined to record my own culinary adventures. I am of a peculiar brand of food enthusiast, though. Not the kind who tries the same recipe over and over again, honing it to perfection. Rather, I never make the same thing twice. I have a huge binder full of recipes that I have cut out or printed out and have never tried. Planning a meal sends me into a state of anxiety not because I have no options, but because I have too many options, every one of them new to me. Frankly, I think it drives my husband crazy. He's the kind of guy who orders the same thing at his favorite restaurants every time we go there. Steak and fries at Steak Frites. A fried chicken sandwich at U.J.'s Diner. Ham steak and eggs at Austin Street. Whenever I ask him what we should make for dinner, he answers \"taco salad\" (Fritos covered in beans, ground meat, lettuce, cheese, etc). After 7 years of marriage, it's kind of a joke (the kind of joke that can send me into a screaming fit; see above anxiety). I think it's because I view every mealtime as an opportunity to eat something great and can be depressed for hours when a meal is mediocre. But I'm not a food snob. A cheesesteak from B.B.'s or a slice of greasy pizzeria pizza can leave me quite content. Last night's pleasant repast was toasted rosemary bread with fig-and-olive tapenade and an orange. I can't do meals like that often, though, since my husband, Todd, is a big guy (tea- or tapas-type meals are not real meals). He's picky, too: no squash of any kind, mushrooms, corn off the cob, tofu, eggplant, kumquats, fruit with meat, things in his rice, casseroles. . . you get the idea. He's in business school part time, though, so on Wednesday and Thursday nights, when he has class, it's all about me (and only about me, which can be challenging, too, cooking for one). Tonight I'll make somen noodles with snow peas and peanut sauce. I have yet to find the perfect peanut sauce; tonight I'll try one I found in a book called Little Meals. Haven't decided whether to add some shrimp. I know chicken's the usual meat for that dish, but I'm kind of anti-chicken right now. I just can't stand the sight of those bloated breasts in the supermarket. Maybe there is something to be said for organic.

Oops. I ended up having sashimi out tonight (a drink always turns into a pricey dinner with Emily). Guess I'll have to try the peanut noodles tomorrow.

There are only two of us, so I'm always looking for ways to use leftovers. One weekend I shredded leftover pork tenderloin to make pork tacos. Pork Tenderloin Todd's sister bought me programmable thermometer with a timer for my birthday, and it has really made roasting meat much easier. I rubbed a 1 to 1 1/2 lb pork tenderloin with a mixture of cumin, chili power, salt and pepper, inserted the thermometer in the middle of the thickest part of the tenderloin, put it in my flat-bottom skillet, and cooked it in a 350-degree oven until the internal temperature reached 150 degrees. Then I took it out of the oven and let it rest about 20 minutes. (The internal temperature went up to about 160 degrees while the meat rested. Don't take the thermometer out or all the juices will run out of the hole.) While the meat rested I baked some corn bread that I had ready to go. When the corn bread was done, we sliced up about half of the pork to eat, and I shredded the rest for the tacos. Pork Tacos To warm up the shredded pork, I mixed it with some salsa and extra cumin (we love the stuff) and heated it in a small saucepan. I wrapped the tortillas in foil and warmed them in the oven, and put out diced red onion and red pepper, shredded pepperjack cheese, and salsa. You could saute the onion and pepper, but Todd and I liked the crunch of the raw stuff. If red onion's too hot, you could use scallion tops, avocado and limejuice, tomato, or whatever your favorite toppings are.

I love RR. I don't catch her cooking show too often, but I usually watch $40 a Day. On one trip to central California, I even ate at all the restaurants she suggested in the Monterrey area. They were all excellent.

First I was addicted to the empanadillas, pastries filled with shrimp, chicken, or beef picadillo. Then I started stealing bites of Todd's ropa vieja (spiced shredded beef) and arroz con pollo (I also love the paella so much I made Todd's dad share his leftovers with me.) But then Todd got a craving for Cabana on a hot summer day and I tried one of their lighter dishes, a citrusy salad with greens and a salmon fillet. They also have an avocado salad and house salad that are pretty good, refreshing and filling. Good appetizers and desserts, including my favorite in NYC - banana fritters with banana ice cream and chocolate sauce. There's one out here in Forest Hills and one around 61st and 3rd in Manhattan.

This is my favorite brunch spot, when we're treating ourselves. It's in the basement of the Whitney, but the front of the 1st floor of the museum is open and large windows make the restaurant a bright, airy space. White tablecloths, good coffee. I always have cornmeal pancakes topped with honey, sour cream, pumpkin seeds, and raisins. Yum. Todd's had omelets, and they're fat, neat, and filled with traditional ingredients well-prepared like thick tomato-saucy salsa. The omelets and eggs come with baked goods and Sarabeth's own jam. I'm planning to celebrate my birthday breakfast there! At the Whitney Museum of American Art

What did you have to offer? Your palate! Where would a chef be without someone to appreciate her cooking?  For these chef's, you were the most important person there.

Indian-Spiced Roast Salmon Combine 1 tsp each ground cumin and coriander, 1/2 tsp each ground turmeric, dried thyme, fennel seeds and black pepper, 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon, and 1/8 tsp ground cloves (I didn't have turmeric and used curry for spice). Spread it thick on one side of salmon (non-skin side), then push the excess off (a lot should stick to the fish). Heat 1 tsp olive oil in pan; add fillet, skin side up, and cook 5 minutes or until the spices form a crust. Turn fillet skin side down and put the pan in 400F oven for 10 minutes or until you can flake fish with a fork. I cut a fillet in half to share with Todd, with a salad and some couscous. Sesame-Crusted Salmon Sandwich Mix 2 Tbsp hoisin sauce, 4 tsp soy sauce, and 1/2 tsp dark sesame oil. Sprinkle skinned tail-end salmon fillets with salt and pepper, then press a few tsps sesame seeds onto both sides of fish. Heat nonstick skillet coated with cooking spray; saute fillets 4 minutes on each side until fish is finished. Spread hoisin mixture on large, split round rolls (1 per person); top with watercress, sliced tomato, alfalfa sprouts, the fish, and then top of roll. Both recipes are from Cooking Light.
