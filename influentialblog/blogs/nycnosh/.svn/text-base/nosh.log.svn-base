 2008 may have brought some sad news on many fronts, but it also held some culinary developments well worth remembering. Now, the year's best: 1. Best Excuse to Eat Eye-Popping Amounts of Pork: The annual metzgete pork-a-palooza at Trestle on Tenth. We first wrote about this pig fest last January, when Swiss bistro Trestle on Tenth offered its take on the Alpine Swiss winter tradition that uses every last bit of the pig following the season's slaughter. A year later, we are still dreaming about the \"home-made bratwurst, liver sausage and tumescent, Dirk Diggler-esque blood sausage, all piled high atop mountains of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and covered with slabs of slow-braised and fat-stippled pork belly.\" No news yet on whether Trestle chef Ralf Kuettel intends to make the metzgete an annual tradition at the restaurant, but if he does, we call dibs on the squeak. 2. Best Cold Weather Antidote: A bowl of the Shiromaru Classic tonkotsu ramen at Ippudo. Ippudo has become somewhat of a fixture on the burgeoning New York ramen scene since we reviewed its opening in March. At the time, we called this light, soy-flavored broth, boiled with pork bones and seasonings for fifteen hours, \"a contender for the most sophisticated bowl of noodles in the city.\" Ippudo's loyal, predominantly Japanese crowds show we weren't the only ones who saw the beauty in their broth. 3. Most Appetizing New Use for The Bread of Affliction: Vosges Haut-Chocolat's chocolate-covered matzoh. Not very much can make a holiday all about austerity enjoyable, but Vosges manages the job admirably, adding a treat to the Passover arsenal that we would happily eat any time of year. 4. Website Most Likely to Make You Question Your Ability to Use Frosting: Cake Wrecks. We described the site in October as \"an online rogues gallery of bakery disasters,\" and as its popularity increases exponentially by the week, the cakes get more and more tragic. A friend of ours wrote in to tell us that she \"laughed so hard looking at Cakewrecks that my landlady's daughter, who lives below me, called to ask if I could please get a grip on myself so she could get some sleep.\" We would love to see a dream team pairing of Cake Wrecks and the Trachtenberg Family Slideshow Players-just imagine the results: songs like \"Hapy Brtdae\" and \"Sexual Harassment: NO!\" 5. Best New Excuse to Walk West: Nova Café's Croissants. Seriously, if you have not yet made the trip up Tenth Avenue to 54th Street to Christophe Barbier's little café, you have deprived yourself of one of the best baked goods in the city. When we wrote about Nova Café last February, we called his pains aux raisins among the best we have eaten in the US. But after a few more months of delicate butter horns and sugar-dusted almond treats, we are ready to call this match officially: Barbier outshines even local fave Claude.

 2008 may go down in history as the most eventful year of the decade. The year in food was no exception, and with that in mind we bring you our two-part look back on the year that was. First, the bad news: 1. Biggest Disappointment in the Smallest Package: The shuttering of Sushi Jun. Perhaps the city's best intimate date restaurant, Sushi Jun was, simply put, a miracle. Just consider the facts: In Sushi Jun we had a moderately priced Japanese restaurant that served an ample array of sakes and beers, a cozy atmosphere with some of the friendliest service in town, not to mention superior sushi and sashimi that rivaled restaurants charging four or five times as much. The tender, buttery yellowtail was enough on its own to propel Sushi Jun into the Hall of Fame. But with only four two-tops and ten seats at the bar, volume was never going to be this restaurant's lifeblood. Universal Plaza's high rent and a dwindling trickle of savvy, wealthy Midtowners sealed the deal in November: Sushi Jun sold out to new owners. Its replacement, Ichi Masa, is cheaper, busier, and about as good as a visit to the Gristede's sushi counter. R.I.P., Sushi Jun. 2. Worst Business Model: NYC Icy (Manhattan). We waited. And waited. Then, when all was said and done, we waited some more. Finally, mid-summer, nearly a year-and-a-half after they announced their opening, NYC Icy made good on its promise to serve up frozen treats on Tenth Avenue. Sure, the interior of the shop looked as if it had been slapped together in a weekend-from its stark, primer-white walls and the peeling graffiti decal decoration, to its barely-there sales counter and disposable furniture. No marketing blitz, no press opening, no lessons learned from champion shop-openers GROM, nothing. Just a door plastered with signs and reviews from their long-shuttered LES shop and a whisper-quiet debut, followed by months of excruciatingly little business. Even on the hottest day of the year, we got a cone in 3 minutes. We predicted NYC Icy wouldn't last, that they would close the Manhattan shop to focus on their more sustainable (read: cheaper, with fewer disappointed locals) Brooklyn store. As of today, that is exactly what has happened. Eh, we'll live. 3. Luxury Product with the Worst Timing: Lambda Olive Oil. A $400-per gallon pricetag may have appealed to a few status-seekers over the past few years, but as Wall Street crumbles, is there anyone willing to shell out $50 for a bottle of this decent-but-not-extraordinary oil? Even in this economy, we still recognize that paying a premium for some excellent products is a smart decision, but Lambda's flat, characterless flavor profile makes it the kind of luxury that we would ditch first to save a few bucks in a recession economy. 4. Worst (Possible) Overreaction to a Google Alert: The firing of Islero's kitchen staff. We knew the staff had spotted us taking photos, even as we tried to be discreet, so it was no surprise when the manager whispered to me three times on our first visit, \"I'll be waiting to see what you write about us. I think I know who you are.\" Yet when we hit the 'Publish' button, none of us expected the guillotine chop that followed. Within hours of our mixed review of the restaurant-and to be fair, after several earlier negative write-ups in print media that preceded our first visit-the entire kitchen staff at Islero was summarily dismissed and given a police escort out the door. Ouch. And hey, we did like the pumpkin churros. 5. Worst New Noodle Bar: Kambi. We will be the first to admit that we have been celebrating the East Village's ramen revolution. The past year has seen the arrival of some truly wonderful Japanese noodle shops, as that increasingly thunderous slurping noise coming from First Avenue proves. Clearly, the ramen bar has been raised-which is why when we read that Minca's new sibling, Kambi, was opening in the neighborhood, we expected great things. Sadly, we found the noodles as bland as the dull, watery broth. Countdown to a new Duane Reade Express: Ten months.

Toloache - Look Out Below!

***CONTENT
 Toloache is a Midtown oddity: a very decent restaurant situated smack in the middle of block-upon-block of Theater District humdrummery. Surrounded by its overpriced and underwhelming peers, Toloache (pronounced toe-low-AH-chay), open now for a little more than a year, is all the more remarkable for its clear overarching goal-to take the humble Mexican food of the taco stand and South American street cart to new culinary (and pecuniary) heights. With a few exceptions, it achieves this goal well through the use of unusual indigenous ingredients like huitlacoche, a surprisingly toothsome fungus that grows on corn. It also does not hurt that Toloache's flattering lighting and polished décor help make diners feel like they are eating something special, even if it made of something nicknamed 'corn smut'. Really, the huitlacoche dishes are among Toloache's best-and the waitstaff are good at convincing even unadventurous eaters to give them a try. When asked, servers explain delicately that huitlacoche is similar to a mushroom, which is certainly less off-putting than calling it by its salacious-sounding nickname. [The only chef in town who could pull off serving a dish like that is Kenny Shopsin, who would undoubtedly turn Smutty Tacos into one of his biggest sellers.] Whatever you call it, you can find huitlacoche on what seems like every other dish: from tilapia to salmon, as well as on tacos with cactus and double cream, and-most brazenly-layered into a huitlacoche salsa poured over a corn quesadilla with black truffle shavings and manchego cheese (pictured above right, $13). This indulgent, savory dish is on the small side, but it is rich and nuanced enough to make up for it. The same cannot be said of the chicken enchiladas (pictured above left, $20), an uninspired concoction of dry chicken breast, floppy enchilada dough and pico de gallo sauce. The additions of dried fig and a spicy apple salad ought to help, but they do not provide the one thing the dish needs to save itself: moisture. On the other hand, the shredded pork, carnitas de lochon, in the form of the roasted suckling pig, (pictured right, $26) are much better. The entire dish reminds us a bit of vinegary North Carolina pulled pork barbecue, but with its complex, smoky flavor imparted not by smoke but by guajillo peppers and a habanero-inflected sour orange salsa. Stretchy, crunchy chicharrones offer the perfect complement to elevate the dish to another level. Toloache also gets props for its guacamoles and ceviches, both of which are available in tasting trios for between $21 and $27. The guac trio (my personal favorite) includes a cool, mild variation, a medium guacamole with a sprinkling of sweet pomegranate seeds, and a spicy tomato-based version that is addictively tangy. With rapidly-replenished baskets of chips, it is dangerously easy to fill up on appetizers alone. The two-tiered dining area presents another, albeit non-culinary danger: Tables on the second level balcony are separated from the customers below by an open wrought-iron fence. On a recent visit, my over-eager reach for a dip into the guacamole swept my eyeglasses off the balcony and directly into the meal of a none-too-happy couple below. For their sake and my own, I was grateful I hadn't knocked the guac. Toloache, 251 West 50th Street (between Broadway and Eighth Avenues), 212-581-1818.

 Lots going on behind the scenes at the Noshpad and the Noshpad North. Sometime soon, we will tell you the story about how, this month, we almost became vintners on a farm 100 miles north of the city. Despite any new adventures we undertake, one thing remains constant with us: Our love of seasonal culinary traditions. One of our most cherished is, of course, the latke (potato pancake). At this time of year, if you are very quiet, you can almost hear the sound of several million box graters working overtime. Ours certainly are. Fittingly, one of our most popular posts from the past three years is our half-mashed, half-grated restaurant-style latke recipe; it has been reproduced elsewhere many times since we first published it (with permission and without), but in case you missed it and are looking for a mind-blowingly incredible potato pancake for your Chanukah celebration, we offer it to you once again, in its original festive context. Enjoy!

Reputation Rehab at Hummus Kitchen

***CONTENT
 Middle Eastern food has a bad reputation. Some of this is easy to trace back to a Midtown full of greasy fast-food falafel carts and grimy storefronts hawking greyish gyros, no doubt. But some of it also boils down to an imprecise and inaccurate culinary calculus that we, as American eaters, are guilty of performing. Its central axiom: if chickpeas, then downmarket. Hummus Kitchen, a new Israeli café in Hell's Kitchen, has found a gentle way of shifting thinking about Middle Eastern food. The first line of attack is through décor-with exposed brick walls, comfy pillows and a shop-long lacquered banquette, as well as flooring that melds Art Nouveau-esque squiggles and traditional patterns, the restaurant feels extremely well put-together. While we do not generally place much emphasis on design-for us, food is the eternal sine qua non-the fact that Hummus Kitchen has paid such careful attention to its interior gives a little insight into the breadth of its subtle reputation rehab project. Thankfully, the kitchen pays the same obvious attention to detail. In our several visits to the restaurant, we have eaten or drunk nothing that was not at least solidly good, along with several items that were truly wonderful. Among these is the mint-lemon granita lemonana (pictured left, $2.50)-a cooling, sinus-clearing drink that might be a bit out of season right now, but will be the first thing we order when the sun comes back to town. The restaurant's eponymous dish (pictured below left, $3.95) was certainly worth naming the restaurant for, especially its texture, which is smooth yet substantial, and just garlicky enough to give a little lilt to the chickpeas. Interestingly, the hummus is served not only with a palm-sized round of perfect pita, but also with a green hot sauce that we suspect to be the kitchen's version of skhug Temani, a zippy purée of coriander, peppers, garlic and vinegar-an unusual and very welcome addition to a plate of hummus. Among the Mazze (small plates, all $3.95, no Frankie Beverly), we are big fans of the toothsome roasted cauliflower with green tahini, as well as the super-simple, super-savory feta and beet salad. The mixed platter of six or more mazze is the best way to taste several of the items, none of which disappoints. We also favor the 'Super-Healthy Salad' (pictured on Flickr, $6.95), and while we won't make any claims about the health benefits of a quinoa and dried fruit salad, we can say that the textural contrast between soft butternut squash wedges and creamy, yogurt-slathered quinoa is pretty special. In the few months since Hummus Kitchen opened, this has become our new favorite lunch. Among the house-made desserts, the traditional orange-infused knaffe and the crisp-tender baklava (pronounced by the staff as bach-LAU-ah) are our favorites (all three pictured on Flickr, all $4.50), especially eaten with a cup of very hot mint tea. Sure, all of this sounds like classic Middle Eastern fare, and indeed, it is. But what is truly different, and even a little transgressive, about Hummus Kitchen is the panache with which every meal is executed. Everything about the experience feels like a tremendous upgrade from other Levantine restaurants serving similar food at this price point. If the staff keep this up, both in Hell's Kitchen and at the forthcoming Upper East Side location, they might just be able to pull off one of the best-and most well-deserved-reputation makeovers of the decade. Hummus Kitchen, 768 Ninth Avenue (between 51st and 52nd Streets), 212-333-3009.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Zingerman's Delicatessen. When HungryMan was asked to travel to Ann Arbor this week, my heart fluttered. \"Zingerman's!\" I insisted, \"You have to eat at Zingerman's Deli.\" One overstuffed, cheese-and-mustard Ménage à Turkey sandwich later, I added a convert to my list. If you are not familiar with Zingerman's, just picture a business that blends the best elements of Katz's Deli, Wichcraft, Ronnybrook Farms, and Fairway, all just a stone's throw from the University of Michigan campus. My personal favorite arm of Ari Weinzweig's growing empire is the Zingerman's bakery that produces some of the best sweet breads I have eaten in the US, not to mention their own addictive savory creation: parmesan pepper bread ($15.00 per 1-1/4 lb. loaf). Lucky for those of us not in Michigan, Zingerman's does a reliable and speedy mail-order business. They even offer a package called the Nosher Triple Cake Temptation-what's not to love about that? 2. Persimmon season. Speaking of Fairway, we spotted the display shown above on a late-night visit this week. As excited as we were about the groaning stand of fist-sized persimmons, we had to laugh at the sign posted there. \"Just bite in.\" it reads, \"It's [the persimmon] mildly sweet and won't make you pucker like its cousin, the Hachiya persimmon.\" No arguments here, except that the persimmons for sale there were all Hachiyas. Still, we love the idea of urging Gothamites to eat more persimmons, especially at this time of year, when they are so abundant and ripe. Our new favorite way to serve them-a recipe given to us by a local pastry chef-is to peel and cube them and toss them with cubed marshmallows and a squirt of lime juice. This tart-sweet dessert is what the poor Thanksgiving candied yams secretly all wish they could become. 3. 1800 Tequila Essential Artists line. Whenever I start to feel a little down about the changing weather, wishing for something more temperate and balmy, I make tequila drinks. As cooling as they are in summertime, they also possess an herbaceous background flavor that reminds me of warm succulent plants, no matter what the weather is outside. Add a little citrus and the illusion is complete. This year, we found yet another reason to buy tequila: 1800's Essential Artists bottles (approx. $50). Dosa Kim's dark, manga rabbit hunt (pictured left) bottle is not only mesmerizing to look at (even before a drink), it is a great example of how packaging can sometimes genuinely enhance a product. It also doesn't hurt that the Agavera Carnichines silver tequila inside makes a superlative margarita.

Thanksgiving Stuffing Bread: Best Toast Ever
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2008-11-24 23:04:00
***CONTENT
 By quite some distance, our favorite thing about Thanksgiving is the stuffing. Whether it is cooked inside a turkey or prepared á la carte as a side dish-which technically makes it dressing, not stuffing-nothing beats savory cubes of herbed bread and sautéed onions. As a child, I cultivated a reputation for being able to polish off a pound or two of the stuff over the course of a long weekend. Then, as a young adult, I discovered a seasonal treat that, to this day, still makes me miss Chicago: Jewel-Osco's stuffing bread. Essentially just loaves of white bread with stuffing herbs baked in, Jewel's loaves were always the highlight of my Novembers. Designed to be used in the preparation of fresh stuffing, they were also perfect for sandwiches-I found that tuna, as well as turkey, worked especially well with the bread, and that the bread was just as good toasted and spread with butter. Unfortunately, not only has Jewel stopped selling its stuffing bread in the vast majority of its supermarkets, they have no East Coast equivalent. Sure, something called 'stuffing bread' is readily available in grocery stores now, but this is either simply unsliced white Pullman loaves or day-old bread. So, determined to recapture a bit of that November magic, I set out to re-engineer Jim Lahey's brilliant no-knead bread recipe and create my own perfect stuffing bread for Thanksgiving. I began with the essence of stuffing: sage, rosemary and onion, tinkering with proportions and methods of really diffusing the sage aromas throughout the loaf. I discovered that the best way to do this is to: (1) use a substantial amount of thinly-chiffonaded fresh sage (about 1/3 cup), which seems like a lot, but some of the flavor fades over the course of the rising time; and (2) steep half the sage in the water to create a 'tea' to spread the flavor into the entire loaf. I also doubled the salt and increased the yeast by about 30%, as rosemary and onion can inhibit the growth of yeast in the right conditions. A few loaves (and a few dozen sandwiches) later, I have what I expect will be a new Thanksgiving tradition at the Noshpad and beyond: A loaf of crusty, oniony bread that makes a superlative leftover sandwich, and better still-one that tastes like November. Stuffing Bread 1/3 c. fresh sage, chopped into a thin chiffonade 2 T. fresh rosemary, finely chopped 1/3-1/2 medium Vidalia or other sweet onion, finely diced (1/4\") 1/2 t. salt 1/2 t. ground black pepper 3 c. all-purpose flour plus more for dusting, as needed 1/3 t. instant yeast 1-2/3 c. water cornmeal Infuse 2/3 c. of the water with half the sage by heating the water and sage together on the stovetop or in the microwave until just simmering. Let steep for 10 minutes at room temperature. Squish sage leaves in the infusion to release their flavors. Then add this water back to the other 1 c. of water to cool it down. Set aside. Combine flour, yeast and salt in another large bowl. Add herbs and onion. Stir until blended. Dough will be very sticky. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 12-18 hours at room temperature. Lightly dust a work surface with flour and place dough on it; sprinkle it with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once or twice. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes. Coat a kitchen towel generously with cornmeal or flour. Gently shape dough into a ball, using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking and place seam-side down, onto the kitchen towel. Dust with more cornmeal or flour and cover with another kitchen towel. Leave to rise for two hours, or until doubled in volume. Dough is ready when it is no longer springy when poked with a finger. Heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Place a very large oven-safe bowl or heavy covered pot in the oven as it heats. When dough is ready, slide it off the towels, seam-side up into the bowl or pot. If the dough looks sloppy, that is fine. Cover with the pot's top or a cookie sheet and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the cover and bake another 15-30 minutes, or until the top of the loaf is browned. Remove from pot or bowl and cool on a rack. 2008 nycnosh.com

Lastday. Rouge Tomate. Carousel Begins.

***CONTENT
 The café's dining room is what really triggered my déja vu-I spent at least an hour wondering how, in Rouge Tomate's flashy new Bentel & Bentel-designed East 60th Street digs, I could feel such strong nostalgia. At the midway point through my meal, it suddenly hit me: the cavernous, ultra-modern space and waitstaff dressed in red tunics were, together, an uncanny recreation of the Logan's Run set that haunted my childhood dreams. If I half-closed my eyes, I could almost see Michael York and Jenny Agutter dodging laser blasts as they ran down the stairs into the restaurant's main dining room. Even the bill at the end of the meal listed our server as Susan 402-eerie. Fortunately, the restaurant's focus is on healthful dining, not machine-pressed protein pellets and plankton. The Belgian-born chain's motto is 'S.P.E.', which, depending on which of the franchise's many explanations you read, stands for 'sanitas per escam' ('health via nutrition'), 'sourcing. preparation. enhancement', or 'santé, plaisir, équilibre' ('health, pleasure, balance'). Despite the abbreviation's leaky meaning, the general culinary philosophy is sound: ingredients are local, clean and seasonal, with no frying or grilling. It sounds austere, but Rouge Tomate does a remarkably fine job working within its restrictions, even managing to produce dishes-and fully alcoholic cocktails-that do not taste Road to Wellville-esque. Case in point: HungryMan and I were both taken with the tequila-carrot-citrus combination in the Out of State ($14)-a light and demi-sweet mixed drink that was as lethal as it was rich in beta-carotene. We both also enjoyed the fresh combination of chunky cuts of chicory with tender pears and Gorgonzola cheese in the chicory salad appetizer (pictured above left, $12.00)-nothing revelatory in such a salad, but the freshness of all the components was apparent throughout. But when we come back for a quick bite to eat, we will skip the salad and go right for the op-art terrine with tiny baby carrots and couscous (pictured top, $15.00), not so much for the whimsical presentation, but for the deft matching of savory and sweet flavors in the terrine itself and its couscous accompaniment. The terrine made a perfect complement to my main dish of striped bass with a light, oniony vegetable stew. I do have to wonder how the seared bass skin does not violate the no-frying dictum, but the dish was a pleasure to eat, so I did not worry too much that my santé might be partially compromised by a little extra lipid. We are also a little suspicious of the aromatics on the roasted chicken (pictured left, $21.00), which glistened like they had been sautéed before being added back to the serving dish with the disassembled chicken. No complaints though, as the bird was very moist and seasoned smartly, with just enough salt. Frankly, this was every bit as good as any roast chicken we have eaten in a restaurant this year-even better that it was, ostensibly, a healthier version of the dish. And it is here that the similarities to Logan's Run end. After all, Rouge Tomate's ethos is all about extending life, not extinguishing it, even for a couple of geezers who are well past our official Renewal dates. Rouge Tomate, 10 East 60th Street (between Madison and Fifth Avenues), 646-237-8977.

 Nothing is more heartbreaking than losing a memory card, especially one with photos of your favorite annual food event. But thanks to the sensitive fingers of our dry cleaner, we not only got our memory card back, we got a quarter and a ten-pence coin out of the lining of a favorite blazer. We popped all the photos onto our Flickr site post-haste, and we hope you take a gander. Of all the dishes we ate at the event, our favorite was not made by a New York chef. Instead, it was Tom Aikens (of the eponymous London restaurant) who absolutely floored us with his silky, subtly herbal salt cod brandade (pictured above right). It was the best mouthful of food I have eaten in months. A very close second was Le Bernardin's thick, decadent brown butter cream-almost a pudding-with sweet potato caviar and red wine reduction. I went back three times, I confess. So, London for mains and New York for dessert? Seems just about perfect.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Tonight's New York Magazine's annual New York Taste event. This has become our very favorite food shindig of the year, the point around which our autumn calendar pivots. Not only is the event a fantastic charity fundraiser for the very worthy City Harvest, it is a slick night of some of the city's best nibbles. Best of all, it is not too late to make plans to attend, as there will be a small number of tickets available at the door at Skylight (Hudson and Dominick Streets). See you there! 2. Insieme's tortelli di zucca ($10 as an appetizer, $19 as a lunch entrée), quite possibly the best pumpkin pasta we have eaten in years, and certainly our favorite stuffed pasta of the season. What makes Insieme's take on the classic pumpkin ravioli so special is the crunch from the amaretti biscuits, the bittersweet flavors from the mostardi fruits, and a subtly musky hit of fried sage. If only every Fall lunch could be like this. 3. The pilaf resurgence. Doing more with less does not always mean sacrificing flavor. Where risotto once ruled, pilafs-which require less expensive rice and are generally much more forgiving of overcooking-are now staking their claim. We're happy to see it, especially since it means that one of our old Russian/Uzbek favorites, plov, an ultra-garlicky version of the dish, stands a real chance of making its way onto a few local menus. The name will need a little tweaking to make it sound as appetizing as the dish really is, but the idea is right for these economic times.

Kambi Proves that Noodles Are a Slippery Business

 If Tokyo can support a few thousand ramen houses, surely Manhattan can play host to a dozen without creating the perfect conditions for a Starbucksian surfeit of choice. Already, there are a few whose presence we would miss if they disappeared: Setagaya and Ippudo, chief among them. We have even been known to duck-quite happily-into Rai Rai Ken or Minca when the weather is oppressively cold and there are no taxis on the streets. So when we heard that Minca's owner, Shigeto Kamada, had his sights set on opening another ramen joint in the East Village, we figured that there was enough market share left to support another decent noodle house. But perhaps we made one too many assumptions. Foremost, that Kambi would be as good as its sister, Minca. This is not to say that Minca is more than just decent, but it is is consistently satisfactory, and a few dishes, like the intensely porcine tsukemen dipping noodles, are often wonderful. At Kambi, these same dishes-many nearly identical to their Minca counterparts-falter. Not to pick on the poor tsukemen (pictured left, $11.50), but it is as disappointing as ramen gets, with a bland, almost fishy broth that, when mixed with the springy noodles and their toppings, tastes more of preserved ingredients than of slow-cooked pork. The chicken broth wahoo ramen (pictured on Flickr, $9.50)-served mixed as a soup and not available as a dipping platter-suffers just as much from a stale, flat flavor profile that makes eating it a bit of a chore. Nothing is as damning as eating an indulgent meal like ramen and feeling after a few bites and slurps as if you would rather be eating a salad. Unfortunately, even the special kimchi miso ramen (pictured right, $14.50) is inferior to a big plate of undressed mesclun. Just like Kambi's other ramen dishes, the kimchi miso offers no real punch of flavor, too little seasoning, and most surprising, no spicy zip whatsoever. The most flavorful item in the bowl is the corn. Of all the dishes we have eaten at Kambi, just one stands out as truly excellent: the radish salad appetizer (pictured below left, $4.00). Served in a gigantic, softball-sized mound, the salad is deceptively simple-just freshly julienned daikon radish with a generous ladling of sesame-soy dressing. All the elements of the dish, from the subtle pepper notes of the daikon to the heady, nutty dressing, balance beautifully. Better still, eating this dish right now, in the middle of peak daikon season, no doubt improves its flavors a few hundred percent. Kambi is no starter-savant, though. We found the shrimp gyoza (pictured on Flickr, $5.75 for four) to be tough, overcharred and dry, not to mention seared in a manner that flayed most of the dough from their exteriors, leaving behind chewy prawn and burned black ash. We have eaten better gyoza cooked on a camp stove. Sadly, that sentiment is the rule, not the exception at Kambi. This city really should be big enough for another ramen house, but we do have standards. Kambi, 351 East 14th Street (at First Avenue), 212-228-1366.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Cake Wrecks, an online rogues gallery of bakery disasters, some so tragic they leave us wheezing with laughter. We love it for its exhaustive attempt to catalog the dozen ways to misspell \"congratulations\" (our favorite: \"cangrtalation\"), as well as for its round denunciation of the fused cupcake cake. But most of all, I now know what to bring to my next office gathering. 2. Soba Totto's fresh green beans with crushed sesame dressing (pictured right, $7.00), a cool, nutty bowl of bite-sized green bean pieces that reminds us of how special green beans can be. The dish uses a very light, gently savory coating of crushed black goma to contrast and highlight the natural sweetness of the green beans-an absolute haricot revelation, and unlike anything anywhere else in the city. 3. Steven Shaw's Asian Dining Rules: Essential Strategies for Eating Out at Japanese, Chinese, Southeast Asian, Korean, and Indian Restaurants, out this week in paperback, a perfect vademecum for any diner venturing out to explore authentic Asian cooking. Shaw's tone is accessible and informative, and he really hits his stride with the book's superb primer on Korean cuisine-the book pays for itself with this chapter alone. But it is not all about the basics; there is something here-whether it is Indian dopeaja fish stew or Cambodian salor kor-ko sap, a sweet-sour coconut milk soup reminiscent of Thai tom yum-for even the most advanced Asian nosher.

Lazzara's Pizza on Ninth Leaves Hip-Hop Behind

***CONTENT
 Restaurants in the Garment District, one of the borough's last remaining gritty, industrial patches, have perhaps the toughest row to hoe in Manhattan. Not only must they lure diners in without the advantage of any real architectural appeal, they must also survive in an area that offers little residential space. Imagine a dirtier Wall Street, populated with zipper sellers instead of investment bankers, and you have the idea. At the same time, the neighborhood has always offered rents low enough to attract risky, creative food ventures that might never have a chance elsewhere-Macaron Café and Go-Go Curry are two of the best examples of this. Lazzara's Pizza, hidden upstairs in a nondescript stone building on 38th Street, is another. But, in the strangest synergy imaginable, Lazzara's on 38th exploited its bargain Garment District rent even further by cleaving half its business into a recording studio that lives upstairs from the dining room. This, quite literally, is what they call vertical integration. The downside to serving food from a GD address, especially one that requires climbing stairs, is that it is hard to build up a clientele of devoted patrons, no matter how good your chef is. So a few months ago, Lazzara made its move to a second location in the space left behind by Sawa BBQ on 9th Avenue, between 43rd and 44th Streets, right in the heart of booming Hell's Kitchen. No matter that the storefront is narrow and features just three barstools and a slim wooden counter for diners-takeout and delivery are what this location is all about. Indeed, the décor, while inviting with its exposed brick and chunky dark wood detail, is so sparse that all attention inside is directed to the counter. No hip-hop beats to keep you hanging around, no tables or waitstaff to bother you. Come in, order your pizza, and go somewhere else to eat, it says quite plainly. This message should not dissuade you, however. The pizza at Lazzara's 9th Avenue location is quite possibly even better than at the Garment District location, and absolutely worth a visit, even if it means finding a local resident willing to host you while you snack on a few slices. Sold in rectangular, thin-crust pies, Lazzara's pizza looks like a crossbreed between Sicilian and Neopolitan styles, with crunchy, pleated edges and a tender, almost pasta-like base crust. At the (slightly further) uptown location, the pies all seem to be a bit crisper and with less of the bottom char that sometimes marred the pies on 38th. Of the several dozen toppings on offer at the 9th Avenue storefront, we have a few firm favorites: the Alorna (pictured above, $18/pie), a deconstructed meatball pie covered in peppers, Italian sausage, and ground beef; the vodka sauce and spinach pie ($16.50/pie), a piquant and very savory gloss on a 1970s pasta favorite; and the Tony's Anchovies with a Twist (pictured right, $16.00/pie), where the 'twist' is succulent, sweet pan-fried onions that temper the intense saltiness of the briny anchovies-also quite easily the best anchovy pizza I have eaten all year. Yes, there are appetizers, pastas and heros on the menu, but ignore them all, apart from the perfectly adequate salads and a super-gooey chicken parm. Really, Lazzara's curious little oblong pies are the only thing that deserves your attention-and they only seem to be getting better. Which makes us wonder: If starting over sans recording studio improved the pizza as much as it seems to have done, what might losing the rest of the menu's culinary dead weight do? Lazzara’s Pizza, 617 9th Avenue (between 43rd and 44th Streets), 212-245-4440.

Eating the Clinton Global Initiative

***CONTENT
 Just in case you missed it: Those traffic jams eight or nine days ago were due to the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI for short)-one of the most exclusive do-gooder confabs this city produces. Each year, former President Bill Clinton convenes several thousand of his closest and most jargonophilic friends to \"catalyze for action\" in areas of education, health, climate change and poverty. It's a wonderful cause that Nosher and I strongly support, even if-as neither Matt Damon nor the installers of 1,000 solar panels in an Ethiopian village-we never seem to get an invite. Our well-connected friend Noshingtonienne did, however, and by living vicariously through her, we got the chance to experience the best part of the CGI: The goody bag. And because Bubba does nothing by half measures, attendees walked away with enough swag to fill a bag the size of a collie. Tucked inside every smart, brown microsuede duffel was all manner of organic, cruelty-free, renewable, wind-powered goodness. There was a candle made from micro-climate soy, sustainable lip gloss, a 'Planet Earth' board game-even one of Apple's new 8GB iPod nanos. Yet of course, all we could focus on when Noshingtonienne tossed the bag on the floor of the Noshpad was the food, very little of which would have come to our attention had it not been for the producers' involvement with the CGI. Among them, we were most taken by two of the sustainable noshables: Vere Organic Chocolate: 75 percent cocoa, single origin dark chocolate, from Ecuador. We tried the raspberry-lemon flavor and found it bitter-only Nosher likes his chocolate with this much bite-with the fruit notes struggling to peek out from under the aggressively tannic flavors. As a pure bittersweet chocolate bar, this would work well, but Vere needs a little milk to allow its fruit aromas to penetrate the candy. Available at Amish Market, Whole Foods, Garden of Eden and other locations. www.veregoods.com Organic, whole-grain 'Forbidden Rice,' imported from China by Lotus Foods. This came as one of a quartet of rices, each originating from small, family-run \"terroir\" rice farms that use new low-water methods for grain cultivation. The Forbidden Rice appears black, but releases a rich purple tint as it cooks. We prepared some in a risotto and found it to have a much nuttier taste than a typical arborio or carnaroli rice-a very pleasant contribution to the flavors of the dish. Because the forbidden rice is a whole grain, it takes twice as long to cook and produces a chewier texture. All rice may be ordered online at www.lotusfoods.com. Finally, there's Rwandan Farmers Coffee, a fair trade, carbon neutral coffee company wholly owned by a collective of growers in Rwanda. We sent this back with Noshingtonienne, because unfortunately, it is only available at Sainsbury's supermarkets in the U.K. Even though the coffee comes pre-ground, we'll still grab a canister if it shows up stateside, primarily because, if the coffee is good, we'd like to see a small Rwandan farm benefit. And really, what kind of Scrooge can argue with the idea of saving the world when it involves risotto, chocolate and a cup of coffee?

Sloppy, Runny and Goopy: Five Napkin Burger's Three Dwarves

***CONTENT
 Single mindedness rules on the corner of 45th Street and Ninth Avenue. Out of what used to be the over-draperied rococo mess that was Jezebel have emerged two discrete restaurants that both take their names from a single dish. The Jezebel business has been scaled down to about a tenth of its former size and has re-emerged as Piece of Chicken, a table-free kitchenfront that sells $1 portions of ribs, greens and fried chicken. Some might view the move as a decline into reduced circumstances, but the focus has done Jezebel's kitchen a world of good-the food is consistently wonderful, and now that it has no seating (nor piano player, nor porch swing), its overhead is laughably low. All of this adds up to a profitable business that adds real value to the neighborhood. The teensy kitchen's new neighbor-actually the occupant of its former space-is a familiar one. Five Napkin Burger is another collaborative effort from Andy D'Amico and Simon Oren, the Nice Matin duo that brought first Marseille and then Nizza to the very same block of Ninth Avenue. If this were Monopoly, the pair would be buying hotels right now. Five Napkin Burger differs from its siblings in its rejection of a regional theme of any sort-the menu features the eponymous ten ounce chuck burger alongside sushi, pork chili, and Tunisian salmon tabbouleh. You could broadly call the food Amerasian Fusion Plus, but above all else, the restaurant's repertoire always comes second to its mammoth burger (pictured top, $13.75). This hierarchy is just about right: The signature dish is Five Napkin Burger's best, and despite its copious goopiness (pictured below right) it is worth a visit on its own. We are especially fond of the caramelized onions and aromatic rosemary aioli, even though they lubricate the bun so much that it is hard to even keep the sandwich intact enough to take a first bite. On our initial visit, we spotted a neighboring table anchoring slippery bun to patty with toothpicks, which is a tactic that works, but simply cutting the burger into quarters achieves the same results without the danger of puncturing a cheek. Indeed, burgers make up the best items on the menu: the Italian turkey burger ($10.95), prepared with tomato sauce and peppers, reminds us of a very decent meatball sub, and the Ahi tuna burger (pictured left, $13.95) benefits from the contrast between the sweetness of the soft, brioche roll and the savory soy and wasabi mayonnaise. As much as we enjoy Five Napkin's medium rare tuna burger, the tempura onion ring really ought to be served as a side-it adds nothing to the sandwich apart from more calories. Most other dishes on the menu are adequate but not very special, especially the bland smoked tomato grits with shrimp (brunch only, $14.25) and the greasy, heavy pork chili (brunch or starter, $12.75). Similarly, the sushi, a puzzling companion to a hamburger-focused menu, is only satisfactory and probably ought to be ditched in favor of more light salads. We would also love to visit once when the waitstaff did not try to upsell us so wantonly at every stage of our meal. But really, the timing could not be more perfect for Five Napkin Burger. Hell's Kitchen has needed a casual, pretty reliable American bistro for quite some months-a gaping market void that can be traced neatly back to the day when Film Center Café got its extreme chrome makeover and suddenly decided it was Cookshop North. Sure, Five Napkin Burger could be 20% better than it is right now with very little effort, but with all signs pointing in the right direction in its early days, D'Amico's kitchen should have plenty of time to revise and edit-as long as they leave their delightfully messy burger alone. Five Napkin Burger, 630 Ninth Avenue (at 45th Street), 212-757-2277.

Falling Back into Chocolate, With Help from Max Brenner

***CONTENT
 HungryMom has, for two long years now, harbored a roaring bonfire of a crush on Max Brenner. You can just imagine the scene when we broke the news to her that her dream date chocolatier was, in fact, a fictitious character, named after the two Israeli founders of Chocolate By The Bald Man, Oded Brenner and Max Fichtman. \"Are you sure about that?\" she scowled. Then, pointing to a line drawing of a head at their East Village shop, she announced, \"It's a shame, because he's so cute in his pictures.\" Really, it is hard to argue with that assessment-just as Betty Crocker before him traded on her wholesome adorability, Max Brenner possesses a certain sophisticated, Kojak-esque sexiness about him, making him seem like a cross between Willy Wonka and Michel Foucault. This urbane persona seems particularly well-suited to a New York City candy man with two thriving shops south of Union Square and, more recently, an online retail business. When Max Brenner contacted us to let us know about their online store and to find out if we'd be interested in trying some of the new products they would be selling on their website, we called HungryMom and arranged a tasting. What follows here are HungryMom's tasting notes on our favorites of the items we were sent: *I loved the Dark Chicao 75% dark chocolate thins ($12.50). Eating one jogged my visual memory of big vats of inviting chocolate near the front of the Max Brenner restaurant. Have you ever taken a chocolate bath? No? That's what this was like. The thins were crunchy and a little bit nutty (probably from the Ecuadorian cocoa bits). I also really liked the decorative tin, and I can imagine giving it to someone as a gift, but only if I took out the chocolate first. *The white chocolate enrobed candied apples ($12.90) also came in a really lovely tin. Even though I enjoyed the cinnamon-rolled cubes, I would not have a hard time giving them away. I would just rather eat dark chocolate. What did you guys think of them? [HungryMan and I both thought the apples were fantastic, especially the fondant-like character of the white chocolate. A few of these next to a cup of hot chocolate or milky coffee would make a gorgeous seasonal snack.] *[This is just to say, I have eaten the entire box of milk chocolate 'Brand New Baby' cubes with praline and pecan filling (pictured above center, $6.90) and did not let HungryMom or HungryMan taste even a bite of them. Forgive me, they were delicious, so malty and so toothsome.]

Eight and One Notes About Eighty One

2008-09-14 22:04:00
***CONTENT
 A few months ago, I was ready to post a Tuesday evening review of Upper West Side newcomer Eighty One when HungryMan walked into the room and asked, \"Have you seen the Times tonight?\" I knew precisely what he was implying: We had been scooped by Bruni. We read the review and, largely agreeing with the two-star assessment, put our own post into suspended animation until a few further visits brought us new information and inspiration. Which brings us to this weekend, when we both decided that it was time to revisit Eighty One, albeit in a format that uses our earlier photos along with some old and some new thoughts on Chef Edward Brown's little side-street gem. 1. Both Brown and chef de cuisine Juan José Cuevas take seasonality seriously. Not only does the menu change very frequently, as you would expect in a moderately expensive Modern American restaurant with access to excellent markets, but prices change to reflect seasons as well-and not just in an upwards direction; this summer's calamari á la plancha, for example, dropped from $17 in April to $16 this month. 2. The interior, with its saturated, sometimes gaudy colors, does suffer from overly bright lighting that creates an effect better suited to a big-box retailer than a dining room. Easily fixed with a sturdy dimmer switch. 3. When we first visited, we found the wine list to be a little too unfocused, on the whole, and this has not changed in the past few months. At the same time, the restaurant offers a very respectable selection of Spanish wines, including a few Toros and Catalayuds, and we would love to see this emphasis expanded-it is the list's strongest suit. 4. Pastas, like the gnocchi with carrots and ramps (pictured top, $15) and the raviolis ($17-18) are among the best dishes at Eighty One-tender and cooked to yield the tiniest resistance in the mouth, they are sauced beautifully and left us wishing they were served in larger portions. 5. Speaking of portions, the Times review describes Eighty One's occasionally recurring 'tasting collection' as a list of featured dishes, when it is really a grouping of medium-sized plates that fit somewhere between starters and mains. One of these, the arctic char with Osetra caviar (pictured above left, $39) comes with an entrée-sized price tag, but it is too small to constitute a main. Too bad, as we would happily give up half our portion of the golden caviar in exchange for a fatter tranche of the lush and zesty fish. 6. Cod-if you are not boycotting it-is worth a try. Offered early in the season with lentils and couscous (pictured above right, $29) and currently with potatoes and salty sopressata ($32), the fillets are always flaky and moist inside. 7. Bruni's criticism of the restaurant's penchant for doubling and tripling the preparations of each dish seems to have hit its mark, as Brown and Cuevas no longer offer their dishes more than one way. Gone are the duos and trios of lamb, and in their place are more confidently prepared meat dishes such as the rich and flinty black angus sirloin (pictured on Flickr, $38) and the Colorado lamb with chard ($39). 8. Eighty One is very fortunate to have John Miele in charge of pastry; his deconstructed, Bauhaus chocolate and hazelnut millefeuille (pictured above left, $12) was probably the best chocolate dessert we ate in a restaurant this spring. His fruit desserts aren't too shabby either, especially his frozen citrus soufflé with lemongrass panna cotta (pictured on Flickr, $12), served with a terrific little scooplet of blood orange sorbet. 8+1. Cocktails, while pricey ($13-14), are fantastic, especially the aromatic Down For Brown and the Star 81, an unlikely concoction of Pimm's No. 1 Cup, sake, anise, sparkling sweet white wine, and peach bitters that tastes like the signature drink Michelle Yeoh's Bond femme fatale should have been sipping in Tomorrow Never Dies. Better, because the restaurant is part of the adjoining Excelsior Hotel, it is easy to find a spot to sit and have a drink, even if you do not intend to eat a full meal. As a result, Eighty One winds up achieving everything the Royalton's Brasserie 44 tried so hard to do-and if that is not enough, they made it look easy. Eighty One, 45 West 81st Street (near Columbus Avenue), 212-873-8181.

Captive Dining at the US Open

***CONTENT
 Every year, our US Open piece is among our more popular posts of the summer. Since our first one three years ago, we have gotten enough e-mail from readers to know that: (1) nobody likes a sub-par lobster roll, (2) $4.00 for a non-alcoholic drink is pushing the envelope of acceptable pricing, and (3) hungry fans will eat just about anything when hard-pressed, and not always willingly. So this year, we took a slightly different approach at the Open, forgoing the lobster rolls in favor of a thoroughgoing search for the best two dishes on offer at the tournament. And as with most concessionary food, what constitutes 'the best' here is not on par with what you might find in Flushing, right outside the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center's gates. At the same time, it is clear that someone in the Open's event team has started thinking more seriously about the quality of the food. Yes, there are still missteps like the nightmarish beef and mozzarella churrasco Franken-crepe and the more mundane, but equally dry and terrible 'deli style' roast beef sandwich. But among the dreck, there are a few new and quite decent options, like the shrimp and lobster salad with citrus vinaigrette (pictured below, $18.75), a large, well-composed romaine salad with very fresh grape and cherry tomatoes and a lightly-dressed seafood salad that contains nearly as much lobster as shrimp. Even better, the vendors have kept the price of their lobster roll stable at $17 and have eliminated their teensy crab cake sandwich. Our second pick is one that we suspect is being test-marketed at the Open. The tomato and mozzarella panini (pictured above, $9.50) are available only in two Italian Experience stalls, both of which are inside Arthur Ashe Stadium, which means that only visitors with reserved seats in the massive, 23,000 seat arena can access them. But it is also not too difficult to sneak into Ashe, especially late in the afternoon, after the final day match there has been played. If non-traditional panini, made on sweet, naan-like flatbread sound compelling, then a little crafty rule-breaking might in order. Just do anything to avoid having to eat that churrasco crepe.

Hampton Chutney Company: Dosa Does It

***CONTENT
 How does an American-run Indian dosa joint stay open in New York City, home of the avenue-long taxi-driver curry queue? Especially a restaurant that has roots in Long Island, not Karnataka, or Hyderabad? That Hampton Chutney Company continues to find success almost eight years after it first opened in New York City (and 11 years after the opening of the original Amagansett, Long Island location) speaks as much to an abiding interest in culinary adventurousness as it does to the tiredness of other Upper West Side casual dining options. And yet, there is something charming about this little South Indian simulacrum. Hampton Chutney was founded by Gary and Isabel MacGurn, an American couple who met at an ashram in India in the 1970s. On their return to the U.S., they decided to bring the dosa, one of the staples of South Indian cooking, back with them to the States. Their version is a classic rice-based sourdough crepe, poured out flat and sizzled into a massive, crispy disk, then folded around a savory filling to resemble an over-sized cigar- one so big its open ends extend far beyond the boundaries of the plate. In India, the dosa is commonly a breakfast dish, and in southern India where it is most popular, it is served with a variety of vegetarian fillings-most often potatoes, onions, tumeric, chili, and a mix of spices that gives it its other name, masala dosa. Hampton Chutney offers two versions of this south Indian classic, a plain masala dosa ($7.95) and a masala deluxe (pictured left, $10.45), filled with the traditional dosa stuffing, plus American-style extras like spinach, roasted tomatoes, and Monterrey Jack cheese. Either way, this is a great dish-much to our great surprise-the deep flavors of the turmeric and spiced potatoes play well with the savory, slightly spongy dosa envelope in the traditional variety, and even the cheese and tomatoes add their own sweet and gooey charm to the multi-culti variety. There is also a choice of chutneys, including a sweet/sour and bright yellow mango chutney, an intense tomato version, as well as more unlikely peanut and cilantro variety. We also like that, despite its Brobdignanian proportions, the dosa is not an excessively large meal: most of its visual volume resides in the dosa's open space-the filling offers no more food than would a sandwich or wrap elsewhere. In addition to the masala version, there are ten other dosas on the menu, ranging from a curried chutney chicken ($10.95) to cilantro and tuna ($11.95). All are available as dosas or as flatter, more compact uttapams, nothing more than the dosa unfurled and with its contents piled on top. Uttapams are more sponge-like and less crisp than the dosas, which works well with chewier toppings. A smoked turkey and spinach uttapam (pictured right, $10.95) may not be the most representative of South Indian cuisine, but it the best uttapam on the menu. There are other reasons Hampton Chutney may have made it so long in New York. For one thing, at the West Side location at least, the owners have gone out of their way to make the space kid-friendly. There is a small play area near the front, and there are cookies and brownies-no pista burfi and pera-for snacking. Plus, once the kids are lured in by the toys and sweets, the dosas keep them satisfied-imagine how excited you would have been at five years old to eat a pancake as large as your leg. We are less convinced that the earnest new-age philosophy-a small sign near one wall informs us that the name of God is repeated as a mantra while the food is being prepared-served alongside the food has much to do with the restaurant's enduring success. Sure, there is something very Eat, Pray, Love, something unabashedly bourgeois in a very Amagansett style, about this aspect of the business, but we'll practice a little spiritual tolerance and ignore it, because honestly, the dosas aren't half bad. Hampton Chutney Co., 464 Amsterdam Avenue (at 82nd Street), 212-362-5050. Other locations at 68 Prince St. (between Broadway and Lafayette) and Amagansett, Long Island.

 Nobody, and we mean nobody, makes a better open-faced sandwich than Ida Davidsen does. No surprise, given that her family has been making the world's best smørrebrød and serving them from their family restaurant in Copenhagen for more than a century. When HungryMan and I visited her in Denmark this past week, we ate ourselves into a smoked salmon coma, drank more than our share of Red Aalborg, and discovered an unexpected connection between Ida and NYC-and not just the fact that her lengthy menus remind us of Shopsin's, another family-run business we hope makes it to the century mark. Even if an overseas visit isn't on the horizon, you prepare many of Ida's recipes at home, as we have been doing for a few years now, after tracking down a copy of her wonderful cookbook on eBay. Once you taste a few of her sandwiches, you might even be tempted to ignore the weak dollar and head across the Atlantic for a little liver paté and fried onion delight. In the meantime, you can view a slideshow of pictures of our visit on our Flickr photostream as you listen to our podcast. As with all of our podcasts, you have the option either to download the audio file (just right-click that link to save the file to disk) in order to listen on your mp3 device, or if you have a speedy Internet connection, you can stream the podcast by clicking the ‘play’ button on the audio player below.

JoeDoe: What's An Opening Night Jitter?
***AUTHOR

2008-08-09 12:28:00
***CONTENT
 Many restaurants are nearly completely shambolic on opening night, sometimes even after weeks of successful soft-opening service. The prospect of declaring your restaurant officially open has a peculiar way of inviting disaster: once polished dishes suddenly seem like they are still in a crude state of development, staff shows how untrained they are to deal with actual human diners, the kitchen runs out of food, the coffee machine or some other critical piece of machinery stops working, etc. Case in point: Cookshop, whose opening night testified to every one of these potential gaffes, despite the fact that the place then proceeded to develop into a decent, if largely unspectacular restaurant. But baptism by fire is not the only way to open. Just ask JoeDoe. A small bistro on a sedate stretch of 1st Street in the East Village, JoeDoe opened for a few ‘food preview’ sittings last week, but only this Thursday threw open its doors to the public. Now, we understand the rationale behind waiting for a few months before reviewing a restaurant–consistency, rhythm, staff stability–but if anyone off the street can wander by and enjoy–or be subjected to–the food, the place really ought to be fair game. What’s more, opening nights can be a window into more subtle things like how well a kitchen operates under pressure, or how staff reacts when things go wrong. And in the early days, things always go wrong. At Joe Doe’s however, what is remarkable is how few flubs were visible. Yes, there was neither booze, nor a BYOB accommodation (it promises a temporary BYOB policy from next week), and yes, a few kinks in some of the dishes. But these are small, compared with the number of things Joe gets right: very attentive and intelligent service, no auctioning (i.e., “who had the burger?”), appealing plating, and a majority of items that were quite enjoyable. In part, JoeDoe pulls this off because both the space and the menu are so small. Chef Joe Dobias (formerly a sous at Savoy) and his partner Jill Schulster offer just six starters and six main dishes, a fact which allows you to dispense with long minutes torn away from conversation as you scan through a long menu. Better yet, even smallish parties of three or four can come away having tried most of the dishes. When you read JoeDoe’s classification of its food as ‘neighborhood American,’ it is easy to assume they mean this neighborhood, from the ‘Irish style’ cod dish to a chopped liver and challah starter that–in spirit, at least–wouldn’t have been out of place in this same, immigrant-rich location fifty years ago. There are some real winners on the appetizer menu, like a refreshing salad of green summer squash (pictured top, $9), barely blanched and paired with an aromatic fava bean pesto, a dollop of creme fraiche, and ultra-sweet fresh corn kernels. Or like a disc-cut scallop (pictured above left, $12), cured with acai berry-based liqueur VeeV and meant to be slathered with a perky garlic- and galangal-accented mayo that reminds us of a French rouille. The liqueur lends a subtle sweetness to the scallops and pairs well with the savory, crunchy croutons and fresh handful of sunflower sprouts nestled nearby. We found main dishes to be generally solid, and perhaps the part of the menu that needs the most tweaking. A dish of ‘chicken in chicken’ (pictured on Flickr, $24) turns out to be a recursive interpretation of turducken: white meat chicken stuffed with dark meat, served in an intense chicken broth. The sheer amount of poultry in this dish can be overpowering, which is why the tender quarter-bulbs of roasted fennel ought to be made a featured player in the dish–a simple matter of replating. A generous veal chop (pictured left, $29) is more immediately successful, prepared medium rare and sitting on a slick of thick Greek yogurt that cuts the richness of the meat wonderfully. Here, though, we found the accompaniments a little disappointing: slightly tough pea gnocchi and an entire hedgerow of purslane and mint, where half the greenery would have sufficed. Then there’s that Irish-inspired cod (pictured above right, $26), a marriage of sweet and savory composed, with equal contribution, of cabbage leaves so sweet they are easily mistaken for onions, and tender clams swimming in an umami-rich bacon and ale broth. Just one small problem–that the cod was slightly overcooked–kept this from being the best dish of the meal. A mushroom streusel (pictured on Flickr, $23)–actually a strudel–the only vegetarian option on the menu, was decent enough, but needs to be reconfigured to allow the heat from the harissa sauce to move from barely registering to really kicking. Happily, dessert was, with one exception, worth staying for (all desserts, $8). Our chocolatey banana bread sundae with vanilla ice cream was a wonderful, gooey mess, made even better by the addition of caramelized bananas and a dusting of powdered sugar. And despite its mannered presentation, the plate of milk and cookies was an unsubtle bonanza of lemon and ricotta–in the best possible way. The cookies were light as pillows and still warm from the oven. Our only dessert quibble was with the wildflower honey custard–and not so much with the custard itself, which was lush and not too sweet, but instead with the sprinkling of smoked black sea salt that imparted an unpleasant Vulcanized flavor to the dish. Each bite left us tasting Band-Aids. Fortuntately, this was an aftertaste easily erased with a spoonful of the sublime banana bread sundae. Had we not been waved inside by our eager waitress breathlessly chatting about the restaurant’s first day, we might easily have assumed that JoeDoe had been open for months, not minutes. There is an easy assurance here, both in the service and in the homey, generally high-quality cooking. And for a first night, that’s not too shabby. In fact, it’s pretty nearly miraculous. Joe Doe, 45 East 1st Street (between First and Second Avenues), (212) 780-0262.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Betty Fussell's classic American culinary history-cum-cookbook, Masters of American Cookery: M. F. K. Fisher, James Beard, Craig Claiborne, Julia Child. Published exactly twenty-five years ago, Fussell's book examines the long shadows each of these four American gastronomic luminaries cast over our modern kitchen habits. But in the end, it is Fussell's prescience that makes this book worth tracking down a copy-through her analysis of the changes in the American palate, she indirectly predicts the advent of the free-range poultry movement and even offers her own no-knead bread recipe. She may always be better known for her often arch, exhibitionistic memoir-the lingering image of her coming home to find her then-husband Paul Fussell in an erotic tussle with one of his male graduate students is one that I cannot help but associate with her-but it is this book that really deserves to live on as Betty Fussell's legacy. 2. Red Jacket Orchard's fresh apricots (pictured above, $3.99 for a 1.25 lb. punnet). Out at their 650-acre Finger Lakes farm two weeks ago, Brian Nicholson's team started picking these little flame-colored gems and shipping them to Red Jacket's own Brooklyn distribution center. If you start munching now, you have two more full weeks before these superb little local treats disappear, so grab as many as you can. Next up for Red Jacket are three varieties of peaches, as well as Japanese plums and a North American rarity: greengages. 3. Ching-He Huang's lively and informative Chinese Food Made Easy, now airing on the BBC. It won't be long before Ching has her own television show in the US, either on BBC America or elsewhere-she is smart, affable, and an absolute joy to watch. Plus her recipes, all of which focus on tasty-yet-healthful versions of traditional Chinese dishes, are a snap to prepare. Although all of the web video on the BBC's program site is region-restricted (i.e. it will not play Stateside), there are text versions of nearly all the content to tide you over until the BBC decides to balance out Gordon Ramsay with someone a little more sanguine.

Wondee One If On Foot, Wondee II If By Phone, and Wondee III?

***CONTENT
 Ask a Hell's Kitchen resident to point you in the direction of the best Thai restaurant on Ninth Avenue, and chances are pretty good that you'll soon find a Wondee in your field of vision. There is no denying that Wondee Siam has flourished in the eleven years since it opened-in 2002, the flagship restaurant spawned a sibling (Wondee II) across the street, and then this month, a third Wondee (Wondee III) appeared ten blocks south on a rapidly developing stretch of Tenth Avenue. But since when is another restaurant in a chain news? Despite their common names, locals will tell you that the two original Wondees are far from interchangeable twins: Wondee I, even with its scruffy décor, is where table service is best, and where some people (not us) say New York's best Thai food lives, while Wondee II's food tends to be prepared spicier and with less oil, and therefore holds up better to carryout or delivery. Whether this differentiation is part of executive chef Phimploy Likitsansook's master plan or is simply a happy accident, each restaurant maintains its own, quite distinct, role on a street stuffed to bursting with competitors. All of which begs the question: What might Wondee III become? After a few meals at the new location, we are starting to think that 641 Tenth Avenue might be the Wondee where you wouldn't be ashamed to take a date. Most of the menu is the same as at the other two locations-only a few noodle dishes appear to have been dropped or given new names, and nearly all the traditional Thai classics are still on offer. The kanom jeeb (pictured left, $4.95 for four), for example are every bit as uninspiring at Wondee III as they are at the other Wondees. We keep hoping that one of the cooks will amp up the flavors in these bland and heavy little mixed-meat nuggets, but for now, they remain a last resort on a menu where nearly every other option is at least decent. Much better is the som tum (pictured right, $8.95), a shredded green papaya salad, made extra salty with dried shrimp and plenty of fish sauce and lime juice, and with enough red chili to cut through the salad's strong umami overtones. If there is a better version of this, our favorite Thai salad, in the area, we have yet to taste it. And suspiciously, Wondee III's som tum tastes exactly like Wondee II's did until recently; we wonder if there hasn't been a little kinky inter-restaurant chef-swapping going on among the Wondees. A conspicuously light touch with the oil on our kee mao noodles with squid (pictured left, $9.95) also makes us suspect that Wondee II's former chef might have decamped for the new restaurant. This dish has always been one of our favorites, and it is heartening to see it prepared with generous handfuls of basil, slightly firm noodles, and most importantly: without an excess of grease. The curries, especially the green curry (pictured on Flickr with shrimp, $11.95) still seem to be a work in progress: The bamboo shoots can sometimes be a bit too acidic and sour, especially since they are intended to offer more of a textural contrast to softer ingredients like cooked peppers. Nevertheless, Wondee III's rich coconut curry broth is still solid and manages to keep the dish enjoyable. Few diners attempt the country style curry (also $9.95-$11.95), but, when ordered extra spicy, it is a great example of how one spoonful of food can provide an oscillating circuit of fiery heat and soothing coconut. While we do not recommend trying the hottest dish on a menu when on a blind date, we do love how the new Wondee's 1970s-inspired color palette and neverending tricolor leatherette banquette give the place a quirky, Via-Emilia-on-quaaludes appeal. If the first Wondee is too gritty a spot to bring a new friend, and ordering in from the second is too intimate, the strange, sleek charms of the third might be just the perfect solution. Who knew there was enough room in the city for another Wondee? Wondee Siam III, 641 Tenth Avenue (between 45th and 46th Streets), 212-245-4601.

At Red Egg, A Fusion of Disappointment

***CONTENT
 It is a tradition in China for parents of newborns to distribute brilliant red-dyed hard boiled eggs to friends and family-the eggs symbolize fertility and cycles of birth, while red represents prosperity. The tradition of passing on good fortune is supposed to bring luck to everyone involved. If only new Chinatown restaurants, especially ones named after this tradition, started their lives the same way, perhaps a lucky egg or two might have helped avert the culinary car wreck on Center Street. Red Egg, technically a Peruvian-Chinese fusion eatery, certainly looks promising. Decked out in natural wood and red leather and lit by large, red, metallic globes suspended from the ceiling, the space the space looks retro-modern, with a little bit of an attitude. The dining room also features quirky, but charming design elements like the cluster of several funky circular booths that give the restaurant a sense of having a center stage where the featured players are the diners and, of course, the food. Yet the rule of thumb that in this part of town, any restaurant that features anything more than a passing nod to décor has probably not dedicated enough attention to its menu holds absolutely true at Red Egg. At a recent outing to the restaurant earlier this month, our small group started off our meal by ordering from the all-day, no-cart dim sum menu and wound up with a greasy and disappointing order of sui mai (pictured left, $4), and a plate of flavorless, if crispy seafood dumplings ($5 for three) that would have been just as good if they came as unfilled packets of fried dough. That a new, slickly packaged Chinese restaurant has disappointing food is not news. That it simultaneously manages to botch Chinese and Peruvian specialties alike seems a sort of bizarre achievement. Each the Peruvian plates we tried were each just as deeply flawed as the lackluster Chinese starters. A dish of camarones con huacatay (pictured right, $8) sounded promising to our friends who had never tried the Andean herb before. Huacatay tastes vaguely like mint and can be an excellent companion to fish and meat. Here, however, the herb was pounded into a thick aji salsa that was so overwhelming it obliterated the watery and entirely unadorned shrimp lumped nearby-the experience was a bit like eating unseasoned, microwaved shrimp dipped in Listerine. Our main dish of shredded chicken with aji (aji de gallina, $12) was a lumpy mess, and tasted like a badly made, too-creamy attempt at a Chilean pastel de choclo. Peruvian influences make sense, given the large Chinese community in Peru, but Chilean? At the end of the day, this wide-net approach to fusion is what kills the entire menu: The kitchen churns out Chinese plates, Peruvian food, Cantonese dim sum and, bizarrely, the occasional Thai dish (including a practically unpalatable seafood pad thai for $13 that we ordered and quickly abandoned). There is more than a whiff here of an overstretched kitchen, with a management that is attempting to be all things to all people, or at least to hedge its bets-never a good move in a market where diners reward restaurants at the top of their niche and shun the rest. Red Egg's sole hope for survival is to hunker down and focus in on learning to prepare better, more consistent versions of a handful of signature Peruvian-Chinese dishes. And if there are a few lucky eggs on the menu, all the better-Red Egg needs all the help it can get. Red Egg, 202 Center Street (near Howard Street), 212-966-1123.

 If someone invited you for a meal at a restaurant owned by a man named Wladis, you might let your belt out a few notches in anticipation of a greasy meal of kielbasa and fried potatoes, never expecting to find monkfish with endive and duck risotto on the menu. But between Nonna and his Charlotte, N.C. chain of Fuel Café pizzerias, Jeremy Wladis has built himself a solid, Italian-themed culinary resume. Add to that a chef (David Rotter) stolen from Village Venetian joint Gonzo, and suddenly, Campo's farfalle and antipasti start to make a lot of sense. Housed in a Morningside Heights space big enough to make Len Blavatnik jealous, Campo's muted color palette gives off a sedately sophisticated vibe, setting the restaurant apart from nearby bargain sushi and dollar vodka shot joints. At the same time, Campo knows better than to get too uppity-the space is large, in part, to allow the restaurant to service the massive Columbia crowds that overtake the area during the school year. This is undoubtedly smart business, especially given the neighborhood's legendary lack of solid dining options-north of 100th Street, there is an eager, captive market for a well-prepared risotto or wild boar ragu. So far, it seems that Campo is up to the task. When Chilena and I visited recently, we especially enjoyed a special arugula and watermelon salad with ricotta salata (pictured above, $7.90) and a super thin, grilled pizza-a cross between Mario Batali's unique Otto pies and the oblong Nice-style pizzas at Nizza. Our margherita pie (pictured top, $9.50) was crisp in places, chewy in others, and overall, a good little one-person main dish, although it would have been greatly improved by a few more slices of the fresh mozzarella cheese and a more generous hand with the sauce. Another dish that was mostly excellent was the linguini with clams (pictured right, $13.50), featuring a lovely balance of savory and sweet elements, not to mention plenty of juicy Manila clams. Had it not been for several burned and bitter slices of garlic, this would have easily been one of the best pasta dishes we have eaten so far this summer. It is also hard to go wrong drinking a glass of wine from the quite reasonable, mostly Italian wine list, while nibbling on the bar snacks and side dishes, our favorite of which are the truffled parmesan fries (pictured left, $4.90)-hot and steaming, packed with umami flavor, and the perfect foil for a glass of Sangiovese. Sure, you might have come expecting to be sipping Sliwowitz and eating pierogi, but don't complain-just count your blessings and grab another slice of sopressata. Campo, 2888 Broadway (between 112th and 113th Streets), 212-864-1143.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Gayla Trail's DIY modern gardening extravaganza, You Grow Girl. For starters, anyone who grows her own nettles and makes soup out of them wins our respect. But we love the gorgeous photography and the site's populist, urban-friendly tone most of all. And because Trail's own roots are in Toronto, most of her growing tips work well here in the Northeast. 2. Poseidon Bakery's rustic Italian loaf. When a little, be-Sharpied announcement announcing the arrival of 'Rustic Italian Bread' went up in the window of Poseidon Bakery recently, we had to stop in for a taste. We will also be the first to 'fess up to our low expectations-Poseidon is a Greek bakery, after all. But Paul Fable's $5 whole wheat pane rustico is crusty, with a dense, elastic crumb that stands up to the summer's juciest sliced tomatoes in a way that large-bubble ciabatta or a tender baguette never could. Nevermind the Hellenic signage, because as Fable himself puts it, \"Greeks and Italians are pretty similar-they are both Mediterranean. Why shouldn't we make a little of their bread?\" No argument here. 3. Blue Hill's lemon madeleines. Served with coffee or tea, these fragrant, buttery little treats are among the only real constants on Dan Barber's ever-evolving menu. And with good reason. We'll spare you the obligatory Proust reference, but after popping a few of these warm mini-cakes, we began to see how transportative pastry really could be. Call ahead to make sure the madeleines are fresh-you will not regret it.

A Brief Summer Fling with NYC Icy

 Sixteen months is a very long time to wait for an ice cream cone. But it has been nearly a year-and-a-half since we first reported that Hell's Kitchen was about to get its own little piece of frozen dessert heaven, courtesy of East Village refugee NYC Icy. Then weeks and months passed with precious little work done to the shop's new digs. More troublingly, after summer of last year ended, even the banners were removed from the window, and worse, around December of last year, it looked as if NYC Icy was going to amount to nothing more than just another cruel tease. But something interesting happened-on one of our regular February walks past the storefront, we saw signs of construction being done. Then a few months later, we started to hear rumblings that NYC Icy would indeed open at the end of June 2008-and to our astonishment, it did. So we paid a visit, then another, and another, and after licking and slurping a dozen flavors of their sorbet and 'cream ice,' we confess to being more than a little smitten. Our favorite style is the cream ice-an Italian-style confection that tastes like a cross between ice cream and gelato. Of the cream flavors, we think the pumpkin pie is tops, an aromatic, spice-infused concoction dense with sweet pumpkin and nuggets of pie crust. It is the best pumpkin pie-flavored food we have ever tasted, bar none. The banana and chocolate malt cream ices aren't too shabby either. And among the sorbet flavors, we love the mango and mango-basil flavors, along with the fresh-squeezed OJ (pictured above with the banana cream ice in the background) and the pink grapefruit (cups range from $2.50-$3.75, depending on style and size). At the same time, we are very consciously enjoying NYC Icy while it lasts, because all the signs are there that this very buzzworthy dessert shop has...well, screwed itself. Not only did it miss a second consecutive chance to open for a full spring-summer season, it opened this June without re-building any kind of momentum or excitement. There are no lines wrapping around the block, as there were with Grom's openings-lines that on the Upper West Side remained for six months after the shop opened-instead, there is a local nonchalance that NYC Icy finally made good on its promise. One Tenth Avenue neighbor told us, \"Eh. We've learned to live without it. They got us all worked up last year, but we have moved on.\" Ouch. For a shop that is already in the red for sixteen months of rent while the space sat empty, there is no worse omen than the indifference of the locals. Moreover, the storefront appears to have been given the kind of makeover that would take a competent contracting team sixteen days, as opposed to sixteen months-the floor has been tiled over like a bathroom, a graffiti mural covers one stark white wall, and the place has been furnished with three rolling ice cream freezers, a blue countertop and five orange IKEA chairs. Imagine what HGTV might do if they converted a florist to an ice cream shop in 24 hours, and you've got the idea-after all this time, NYC Icy looks like it was opened in a rush. Perhaps this is why the owners chose to hedge their bets and open a Ditmas Park outlet this year as well, a shop that is apparently garnering all the neighborhood interest that NYC Icy deserved, at least, had it opened as promised back in April '07. As much as we adore the icy snacks, we can smell the apathy in the air on Tenth Avenue and are counting the days until NYC Icy closes its doors and makes Brooklyn its permanent home. But for now, at least we have this summer. NYC Icy, 628 Tenth Avenue (between 45th and 44th Streets), no telephone.

Steak! In Time for the Fourth

***CONTENT
 It's a common enough problem in New York: You have invited a crowd over for a Fourth of July BBQ, cooked on your fire escape hibachi, back stoop grill, or stovetop, but then the thought hits that you have no idea where to shop for a few dozen pounds of solid meat. You could head to your local supermarket, but when you are picking up more than a single sirloin, you might have questions about quality and freshness. That might send you to Whole Foods, but it is easy to imagine yourself waiting in the lines that snake around the store and give up quickly on that idea. Or, you could take advantage of a local butcher's new service and just have your huge order of steaks sent to you at home. Apart from one downside, it's an increasingly attractive option. The new kid on the home delivery block is DeBragga & Spitler, and as a business, they are not so new. They've been providing steaks to New York restaurants from their Washington Street location for years and have only recently expanded their business to include Internet-based retail, a move that may wind up becoming the savior of one of the last remaining butcheries in Manhattan's Meatpacking District. The online store offers special Flintstones-sized bundles of Japanese or Australian Wagyu beef, American lamb, hot dogs and pork chops for between $125 and $240, all designed to feed between 8 and 12 people. You can also buy four-packs of American rib eyes for between $57 and $77, depending on weight. To see how DeBragga's steaks stand up to backyard Manhattan grilling, we invited Zach from Midtown Lunch and a few other friends for a tasting. The steaks, all part of a DeBragga Sunset Strip pack ($245), came express delivery, packed in among frozen gel packs, two days after we ordered them. Each of the Angus beef strip and Australian Wagyu steaks arrived individually, sealed in airtight packaging. We grilled the steaks on a roaring gas grill and paired the them with a pungent, Asian-inspired steak sauce made from fish sauce, hoisin sauce, rice wine vinegar, finely minced garlic and shallots, Sriracha, cilantro, mint and ginger. Our tasters sampled both kinds of steak, unsauced and sauced, and what emerged was a slight preference for sauced Angus strip and the unadorned, earthier Wagyu. Both meats were juicy and tender, and the marbling on the Wagyu was astounding, its fat contributing immensely to its rich, ferrous flavor. The only potential downside to ordering from DeBragga is the cost, but top-grade steaks are not cheap anywhere, and DeBragga's prices are competitive, especially for their Wagyu varieties. Delivery adds another $19.95 per box within 100 miles of New York City and $27-60, depending on order size, within the continental US. Ultimately, these are the kind of steaks you order when you are feeding people who know their T-bones from their tenderloins, and if you, like most New Yorkers, are butcherless, it is hard to beat the convenience of having a Meatpacking District institution choose and trim your meat and ship it to your door.

Got the Whole Breakfast in My Hand

 My relationship with breakfast is a dysfunctional one-one month I'll eat nothing but high fiber cereal as I read my morning e-mails, and the next I'll find myself piercing five runny yolks every working week. I enjoy the variety, but it is a by-product of a constantly changing A.M. schedule. However, the upside to this is that I have been able to sample my way through pretty much every palm-sized morning treat north of Union Square, and along the way, I have found a few favorites. Two of them come from Sullivan Street Bakery on 47th Street between Tenth and Eleventh Avenues. The shop's owner, Jim Lahey, a man whom you may recognize as the originator of that no-knead bread recipe, is an Italian bread savant. His pugliese loaves are without peer, but in the morning, I have grown very partial to his two seasonal fruit pastries. One, the brioche alla frutto stagionale (pictured in rear on right, $2.50) is a sticky, glazed affair made with tangy mascarpone cheese and sliced fruit (green plums, apricots, cherries), all piled onto a sweet dough base and sprinkled with slivered almonds. The other Sullivan Street pastry of my affection is the flaky torta sfoglia stagionale (pictured in foreground on right, $2.50), a gooey little round piece of fruit pie that leaves me covered in crumbs every time, but which is worth every little doughy fleck I find on myself. Also made with fresh, seasonal fruit, this pastry seems to contain messier, gloppier soft fruits better than the brioche does-hence the occasional appearance of berries and rhubarb in the filling line-up. And then there is my other favorite, Café Zaiya's almond yaki manjyu (pictured left, $3.95 for four), a crumbly, toasted almond confection filled with a dense and perfectly sweet red bean paste. Surprisingly, the nutty manjyu pairs better with a strong cup of coffee than anything Starbucks sells. A hot cappuccino and two almond manjyu might not be a match that anyone predicted would work well, but when I cannot make myself a bigger, healthy breakfast, it is a combination splendid enough to keep me smiling until lunchtime. Sullivan Street Bakery, 533 West 47th Street, 212-265-5580. Café Zaiya, 18 East 41st Street (between Fifth and Madison Avenues), 212-779-0600.

Joe Allen: The Optimism Killer
***AUTHOR

***DATE

***CONTENT
 If there were a DSM-IV listing for Unwarranted Optimism Syndrome (UOS), its symptoms might include returning to eat on Restaurant Row while fanning a secret flame of hope that, due to its dire culinary context, there might possibly be something good there that has gone unnoticed. Consider us officially diagnosed, because we keep going back to the little stretch of 46th Street, even after being burned so badly before. After all, the cluster sits right at the pivot point of our neighborhood. And really, can an entire block of restaurants really be that bad? Well, after living with UOS for more almost five years, I am ready to say: Perhaps. Leaving the always excellent Sushi of Gari and the occasionally inventive Pomaire out of the equation, there are few restaurants on the row that even merit a second look. Barbetta and Orso both do a decent steak, Firebird has its flashes of competence, but those are the paltry high points. Yet, when friends from elsewhere ask us to meet them on 46th for a bite to eat, thanks to our unbridled optimism, we rarely refuse. And every time, we wind up disappointed, as we did when we recently caught up with Uncle Heraclitus and friends at Joe Allen, an upscale pub that sits on the easternmost edge of The Row. The rigatoni with Italian sausage and ricotta salata (pictured above, $18.00) was the best dish of the seven we ordered, and while it was filling, it was undercooked in places, almost crunchy. Meats and grilled items, nominally Joe Allen's specialties, were often sloppy and occasionally stunningly awful. The salmon and asparagus special (pictured top, $19.00) was underseasoned, undersalted, and so slick with oil that it fell off HungryMan's fork several times as he tried to eat it. At first, he called it \"bar mitzvah salmon,\" but after pushing his plate away halfway through, he admitted that coming of age never tasted that bad. The grilled half chicken (ordered with a baked potato) (pictured above, $19.00) arrived redolent of lemon and garlic, but it was cooked to the consistency of a memory foam mattress. Egg dishes suffered from similar problems, from a grease-soaked chorizo and fried egg tostada (pictured on Flickr, $13.00), to my own frittata (pictured left, $13.00) that arrived oily and tough, seasoned with pepper but mysteriously no salt whatsoever and presented with two halves of an english muffin. One half was toasted dark brown, and another below was so crispy that it looked as if it had been pulled from the mouth of Krakatoa. This, at the end of the day, was diner food, not pub food-and poor diner food, at that. With the Westway and Renaissance Diners just blocks away on Ninth Avenue, both serving food that is orders of magnitude better, there is only one reason to pay twice as much to eat a substandard meal on 46th Street: Joe Allen's classy, dark wood décor. But the bottom line is that even the white tablecloths and exposed brick walls cannot make up for Joe Allen's culinary misdeeds-no matter how deep your vein of unbounded optimism runs. Joe Allen, 326 W. 46th Street (near 8th Avenue), 212-581-6464.

Talay: A Different Kind of Harlem Globetrotting

***CONTENT
 Harlem is probably the last place in New York City where you would expect to find a Thai-Latin fusion restaurant. Such culinary blending seems like it would find a natural home in a place like Sunnyside, Queens, where it is possible to purchase a café con leche and a bottle of fish sauce at the same little corner shop. But executive chefs Phet Schwader and King Phojanakong are gambling that Manhattan is where the concept will flourish. Talay, which means 'waterfront' in Thai, occupies a massive space with views of the Hudson River and the Henry Hudson Parkway; the building plays host to three bars, stacked one atop another, and a bamboo-and-bling sunken dining room where most of the room's light comes from blazing blue and green LED tracks that ring the space. Every inch of the restaurant, from the foyer to the bathrooms, feels like a nightclub. And perhaps this is the intention-the loudness of the ambient music and the pounding seismic bass rhythms certainly do give the impression that Talay's primary focus is drinking, not dining. Thankfully, the food makes up for much of the discomfort of having to shout across the table. Talay's menu is split into large and small plates, with all food delivered at once-no traditional courses, no traditional pacing. This works well if you can create your own meal tempo by ordering dishes that require a bit of a wait, like the smoky-sweet arroz valenciana (pictured left, $24 as a main dish), a delightful Filipino-influenced take on paella, loaded with savory sausage chunks and plump shrimp; along with a few others that take less time, like the tart and ultra-garlicky Thai beef salad with shredded green papaya and green apple (pictured on Flickr, $11) an acid-trip hybrid of a fajita and som tum. Or even the simple, crunchy wok roasted bok choi (pictured on Flickr, $8). The unusual non-rhythm of the meal made us realize early on that, if you are not careful, it is possible to order an entire meal and have everything served to you within five minutes. For diners in a hurry, this works out beautifully, but if lingering is more your style, we'd recommend hanging on to a menu and staggering the meal, tapas-style. One dish that arrived quickly was the crispy shrimp with fried plantain discs (pictured right, $12), a winning combination of tender, sugary plantains with several super-crunchy deep-fried shrimp. While the shrimp were intended to be the stars of the small plate, the plantains were the best thing about this dish. We would love to see the quantities inverted, especially as the plantains really do emphasize the Latin elements of the menu, elements that are sometimes tricky to locate. One example of this is the ginger cod and rice noodle special (pictured left, $19), a large plate featuring a generous eclair-sized fillet of marinated cod atop a pile of toothsome rice vermicelli. Staring at the plate, none of the three people at our table could figure out the Latin influence in the dish, but one bite of the buttery, moist cod and we spotted the adobo rub, albeit one made with a generous handful of aromatic Asian spices. On the other hand, the Thai elements were there for the smelling-it is hard to ignore the mule-kick of an intense ginger-galangal broth as rich and concentrated as the one drizzled over the cod. Not that you would want to; all the flavors worked splendidly together, even down to the unexpected and tart garnish of two pickled ramps. Even though this dish was one of the evening's specials, and not a permanent menu item, it typifies what Talay is ultimately all about: creative and playful fusion food that does not take itself too seriously. It is a concept that pays great dividends-despite a venue that reads as more Limelight than lime leaves. Talay, 701 W. 135th Street (at Twelfth Avenue), 212-491-8300.

Jean Claude and the Bistro Blahs

***CONTENT
 If Dante had taken a few extra years to really flesh out his levels of hell a bit more, there might have been one reserved for the most venal French chefs, one where they spend eternity preparing nothing but steak frites and mussels for an unending stream of demanding American diners. Hell's Bistro might be a particularly painful place to cook, but it is the sort of restaurant that many New Yorkers wish they had in their neighborhood, someplace where the food is reliable and, above all, a known quantity. We imagine that William Prunty, Jean Claude's chef, senses this duality rather acutely, especially after his five-hundredth creme brulée every month. And as much as Prunty and J-C Iacovelli, the restaurant's owner, have created a slightly modified, seafood-oriented gloss on traditional bistro fare, the menu has changed so rarely in the past dozen years that we would be amazed if the chef didn't go a little glassy-eyed every once in a while. One of those times happened Monday night, when HungryMan and I stopped in for dinner after meeting up with a friend on Houston Street. Our order of quail with glazed pears, fennel and frisée (pictured left, $9.00) arrived overcooked and tough. Tiny birds are delicate creatures, and even an extra minute on the heat will dry them out. Ours tasted as if it had spent eight or nine extra minutes in the fire. The sweet, fruity sauce with its hefty vinegar kick was a great pairing with the heady flavors of the little game bird, but the texture made the entire dish a chore to eat. Our spiced squid salad with roasted pepper sauce (pictured on Flickr, $9.00) had similar consistency issues-half the squid pieces were cooked beautifully, while half were rubbery and agonizingly chewy. The dish also suffered from a serious seasoning problem: The North African flavors matched well with the cilantro-infused vinaigrette, but every element of the dish, from the sauce to the seafood, was undersalted. This same underseasoning problem cropped up again in the roasted codfish main (pictured right, $18), but to a much more severe degree. The basil mashed potatoes tasted as if they had not been salted at all, which left them far too sweet. The thick fillet of cod, while cooked well and very moist, was again underseasoned and rather greasy. Only the hanger steak with sautéed zucchini and a shallot sauce (pictured left, $20) was an overall success. The steak itself was cooked a bit less than we had requested, and once again, nothing was salted properly, but the rich, buttery sauce, with its minerally red wine aromas, made up for the slightly under-done meat. Nearly a great dish-and we'd wager that the first few hundred thousand of Jean Claude's hanger steaks were indeed excellent. But now, after the Groundhog Day experience of making the same bistro dishes for more than a decade, the kitchen staff's fatigue is starting to show. So perhaps it is time to make a few changes-Prunty, after all, was a saucier of some repute at Bouley before he came to Jean Claude-the man can handle a little complexity. Just a couple of new dishes might renew the staff's interest and attention to detail. Menu changes might not represent a complete salvation, but perhaps the hope of a culinary purgatory will keep the poor souls in the kitchen from succumbing to the infernal creeping bistro blahs. Jean Claude, 137 Sullivan Street (between Houston and Prince Streets), 212-475-9232.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. (Although it's anything but local) the chiles rellenos at Chope's Town Cafe in La Mesa, New Mexico. We have eaten more than our share of Mexican food-some of it very fine, some of it awful, and the vast majority of it somewhere along the highest summit of the (taco) bell curve. It was not until this week, when we were lucky enough to eat a sublime chile relleno (pictured below and marked with the green arrow, $2 each or $1 with a meal) out in the middle of nowhere, that we realized we were missing something important in our lives. Credit for the success of Chope's chiles goes, in part, to the foamy egg batter used to coat the very mild, cheesy Sandia peppers before deep frying them to a tender, omelette-like consistency. La Mesa may be 45 minutes outside El Paso and Las Cruces, but if you are anywhere within a 100-mile radius, Chope's gritty little restaurant is absolutely worth a side-trip. 2. Kathryn Hughes's sweetly affectionate biography, The Short Life and Long Times of Mrs. Beeton: The First Domestic Goddess. We have been slowly savoring this book for a few months now, drawing out the experience long enough so that we might be able to finish the last pages on a beach somewhere. But in the end, Hughes's arresting story forced us to the book's end. If you are not familiar with Mrs. Beeton, just imagine the Victorian-era equivalent of Martha Stewart, with an even more interesting private life-in just three decades, Beeton suffered through an abusive marriage, financial ruin, a plagiarism scandal, and a bout with syphilis. Yet none of it deterred her from writing a book that would, years after her death at twenty-eight, become the authoritative volume on domesticity. Kathryn Hughes's retelling of Mrs. Beeton's saga has all the drama of a great beach read, with a pinafore or two thrown in for good measure. 3. Chive season. More than that, we're especially loving that many of the chive plants we've seen, including the ones we have growing in our little patio garden, are in full bloom right now. Not only do chives add onion- and garlic-esque high note flavors to foods, but the blossoms are also edible. We love to make a simple pasta with olive oil, garlic, pancetta and a few mushrooms, and toss in a handful of fresh chopped chives as the pasta sautées. Then, right before serving, we add another handful of the soft starburst flowers. It's a simple late-spring side dish that works well with a glass of dry white Bordeaux, and it is even better if you can find a stoop or a table where you can eat outdoors.

A Different Cup of Joe at Jack's Stir Brew

***CONTENT
 Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door. That certainly could be the title of the most recent chapter of Jack Mazzola's life. Jack, a former actor, has made a small name for himself as the inventor of the stir-brew, a coffee machine that stirs the grounds as they're brewing, supposedly adding oxygen to the process and removing biterness and acidity. We can't vouch for the science behind the stir-brew, but we can recommend the taste, which is indeed a good deal less acidic than your average Starbucks cup of drip coffee, and a fair bit smoother too. There's little of the bitter aftertaste to the coffee as well, whether it's in the drip coffee or in the lattes or cappuccinos that the folks at Jack's will make to order. Jack is a strong believer in organic, fair-trade coffee, and the shade-grown variety are the only beans you'll find in the stores, roasted in small batches. This philosophy extends to the milk and even the sugar, where everything you want to put in your coffee is organic. Even better than the coffee are the baked goods, which come mostly from the folks at Westville and include an incredible updated (and oversized) version of the humble Oreo with crumbly, cocoa-dusted chocolate wafers and a sticky, sugary creme filling. But it's Jack's chocolate chip cookies that are really worth coming back for. Billed as 'Aunt Rosie's cookies,' the recipe originated with Jack's aunt, though we're told they are now baked by a distant cousin. Whatever their provenance, these cookies are among the more moist and chewy we've tried lately, and hold up to those on sale at City Bakery, Levain, Insomnia Cookies or even Ruby et Violette (Jack's are pictured, at left). If you're hungrier than that, the Front Street location has sandwiches brought in from Bridgewater's down the street. The only downside to Jack's is that, despite the friendly atmosphere (the Village location has live music and shows 16mm movies on weeknights) the staff can betray a bit of attitude to the customer who has bumbled in off the street looking for a regular cup of coffee. Hauteur is perhaps an occupational hazard of those working at urban, independent coffee shops, so this is not completely unexpected. Still, it takes away from the experience and seems unwarranted, even if you are the much-lauded inventor of the stir-brew. Jack's Stir Brew, 222 Front Street, between Beekman Street and Peck Slip (212) 227-7631. Other locations in the Village at 136 West 10th Street, between Waverly Place and Greenwich Avenue and in Nolita at 292 Elizabeth Street, between Bleecker and East Houston Streets.

Joe's Ginger: A Pell Street Dilemma

***CONTENT
 Joe is clearly doing something right. After all, Joe's Shanghai, which bills itself as the 'Home of the Soup Dumpling', still attracts huge crowds every night of the week more than a dozen years after it opened its Chinatown location. Business was so good for many years that the owners opened Joe's Ginger, a sibling restaurant serving an identical menu just a few doors away on the same street-but crucially, just far enough away to prevent the two eateries from sharing a kitchen. And this makes all the difference. When we took HungryMom to Pell Street this weekend, we set out to visit Joe's Shanghai, a restaurant whose soup dumplings we have always enjoyed (both in Manhattan and at their Flushing branch). However, the Sunday evening queue had already hit the 25-30 minute wait-time mark when we arrived, so we decided to follow the overflow crowd down the hill to Joe's Ginger, where three tables sat empty. As we took our seats, we quickly realized that we would be able to order precisely the same meal we would have ordered up the street. Unfortunately for Joe's empire, the problem with serving almost identical menus is that it becomes impossible to prevent comparisons across restaurants, and inevitably, only one of the two restaurants comes out the beneficiary. In the case of our recent meal, that restaurant was not the one where we sat. Had we stopped at the soup dumplings ($6.65 for an order of eight), however, we would have discerned very little difference between the two Pell Street restaurants. The similarity, according to the staff, comes from the fact that all the soup dumplings for both locations are prepared in the same kitchen, so the little crab and porkmeat bundles at Ginger are the same as those at Joe's Shanghai. Great news if all you want from your visit is a snack, as Joe's xiao long bao are admittedly quite wonderful: savory and dripping with light, barely tangy broth, and filled with tender shreds of pork. But once Joe's Ginger takes on the greater task of preparing a full meal, it develops its own independent-and inferior-identity. We found our order of braised beef noodle soup (pictured on Flickr, $4.65, served only with vermicelli) to be a real disappointment: full of poker chip-sized discs of gristly and veiny beef that gave off an unpleasant musky aroma, all floating in a broth that tasted of little apart from salt. The seafood noodles (pictured above, $13.95) were a bit better-covered with plenty of squid, shrimp, sliced fishcake, one small crab, and a few clams here and there. But the entire dish suffered from being drenched in an oversweetened black bean sauce that only got more cloying as the dish cooled. Similarly, our order of yellow fish fingers with dried seaweed (pictured left, $14.35) tasted strangely sweet, as if the chef had coated the tranches of fish with seaweed-flecked doughnut batter. Every bite made me think wistfully of New Green Bo's (now Nice Green Bo) vastly superior version. Of course, New/Nice Green Bo is also often filled to capacity, and with good reason. Just like Joe's Shanghai, it serves consistently high-quality Shanghaiese food, and in the bargain, manages to turn every one of its tables at least once during most evenings and still has to turn away prospective patrons. Those stray diners need somewhere to go, somewhere to spend their money, somewhere where the mains are as good as the dumplings. Joe's Ginger has the potential and audience to be a destination in its own right, but until it figures out how to do more than steam buns, it deserves to remain the last resort on Pell Street. Joe's Ginger, 25 Pell Street, 212-285-0999.

 It is a rare day when we find ourselves in the Upper East Side at lunchtime, not because we don't appreciate views of the East River and the tram to Roosevelt Island, but simply because getting there from the west can be a chore. But this week, after a long morning of meetings on Lexington Avenue, there we were, peckish and ready for something hearty. A quick phone call to Tab, a savvy neighborhood local, left us with a simple, Parker Brothers-esque directive to \"Walk to Butterfield Market on Lexington and 78th. Don't stop until you get there. Head right for the sandwiches.\" So we did as we were told and paid a visit to the ninety-three-year-old upscale grocery and zeroed in on the bakery, where the sandwiches awaited. As we made our selection from among about a dozen varieties, we talked with the staff about the handmade sandwiches and heard perhaps the smartest comment on bread we have heard at a deli, ever: \"Some of our bread comes from Eli's, some of it comes from Sullivan Street, some if it comes from other places. We don't lock ourselves in to one baker. We pick the best bread for each sandwich.\" And it shows. Our tuna salad sandwich on fresh challah ($5) was a perfect example of how Butterfield's kitchen staff put real thought into the pairing of their super-smooth, almost whitefish-like tuna with a great roll. So too the smoked turkey breast with cranberries and apples ($7), a thinking person's combination of fruit and meat, sweet and savory, crumb and crunch that made HungryMan's eyes roll back in his head with pleasure. The cinnamon raisin bread gave the whole package just the right amount of slightly sticky spice. And before you ask about eating turkey and cranberries in May, we should point out that the crisp, dime-thin slices of acidic Granny Smith apple gave this sandwich plenty of timely relevance. Plus, with very little fat anywhere, this sandwich should fit right in with Memorial Day swimsuit aspirations. Butterfield Market, 1114 Lexington Avenue (between 77th and 78th Streets), 212-288-7800.

 3 treats we're loving this week: 1. Pichet Ong's yuzu-lime flowers (pictured right, $1.95 each). Two elements make this Batch gem one of the best cookies in the city now: (1) The butter-and there's plenty of it in these shortbreads; and (2) the interplay between the sharp citrus flavors and the subtle saltiness of the pastry. If biscotti are coffee's perfect partner, this might just be the dream date to make tea swoon. 2. Cupcake Café's seasonal blackberry crumb cake (pictured left, $2.00 a slice). Really, \"slice\" is an understatement-this is coffee cake served in blocks as large as some European cars. For two bucks, you'll get enough of the tender cake to share between two very hungry snackers. We especially love how the rich blackberries that top each slice practically melt and fuse into a gooey icing. Cupcake Café's blueberry crumb cake is good stuff-better than their cupcakes- but the blackberries are sweeter and extra-tart in all the right places. Grab a slice before the summer season ends. 3. City Bakery's peanut butter cookies (pictured on Flickr alongside their similarly excellent bakery muffin, $1.50 for two). Traditional peanut butter cookies do not spread much when they bake, which is why they retain the crosshatch pattern from the tines of a fork. But City Bakery takes bakery shape-retention to a whole new level with peanut butter cookies that look like scoop-shaped Pompeiian ice cream artifacts, frozen in time. The trick, we suspect, is freezing the dough solid before baking, but no matter how it is achieved, the cookies benefit from being baked in semispheres, rather than rounds, as it is tough to find a burnt edge anywhere, and inside the center of the cookie, the super-short pastry ends up crumbly and soft. Just a small change in shape gives this classic a new dimension. Consider us converts to the scoop.

Brooklyn's Malfatti Decade, Courtesy of Al di La

***CONTENT
 A friend of ours, while talking about getting together for a recent meal at Park Slope's Al di La, told me that her mother had once accidentally referred to the restaurant as 'La di Da' and had yet to live it down. It's a telling solecism, because nearly ten years after the restaurant opened its doors for the first time, it can be still legendarily hard to snag a table there-and this is Brooklyn. Thanks to lots of favorable press, Al di La has become so popular that husband and wife team Anna Klinger and Emiliano Coppa still have to turn away prospective diners during almost every single service. And yet, the locals don't seem to mind much. Every time we go, we find ourselves wondering: For what other Brooklyn restaurant would diners cheerfully wait an hour, an hour-and-a-half, or more in order to eat a meal? The wait derives largely from Al di La's egalitarian no-reservations policy-whether you're a celebrity, a luminary, or even an old friend of Anna's, prepare yourself for a wait-either outside Al di La's crowded Fifth Avenue doorway, or at the Al di La wine bar around the corner (the two rooms connect via the very busy kitchen). And if waiting for a la-di-da table in the main dining room, with its brick walls and red-and-white circus print drapery gets to be too much, diners can opt to eat from the full menu in the wine bar itself. As an added bonus, eating in the wine bar offers access to a wine list that extends beyond the Italian-only selections of the main dining room. But we are the sorts who like a table, and still, the wait is worth every minute. Almost everything we have ordered at Al di La, over many visits, has been both remarkable and remarkably consistent. A few items even make you sit up straight and take notice: for instance, the swiss chard and ricotta malfatti (pictured left, $13), a crowd-pleaser that has been on the menu for years with good reason. These soft, slightly chewy gnudi are simply emerald mounds of cheesy, doughy pleasure, made all the more enjoyable by a light sauce of sage and brown butter. Truffle and ricotta tortelli (pictured on Flickr, $18) demand equal attention, with their sweet sheep's milk ricotta and strong but not overpowering hit of black truffle shavings. Rounding out our favorite pasta dishes is an gnocchi special made with a beef cheek ragu (pictured on Flickr, $15) so savory it seems purpose-built for a glass of hearty Sangiovese and a mopping-up with some of Al di La's sturdy bread. While favorites like the malfatti, the beet and ricotta ravioli, and the braised rabbit and polenta are deservedly year-round menu residents, certain specials also earn their more seasonal places on the restaurant's rota. Chief among these are the cichetti (pictured top, $14)-Venice's version of tapas-which can include anything from tender roasted octopus to a wonderful baccala with pickled onions and fried polenta wedges. The frequently changing side dishes are also a treat: on our most recent night, an order of unprepossessingly named 'greens' (pictured above right, $5) yielded a hot pot of of savory, soft, creamy cranberry beans (borlotti beans) and nearly greaseless broccoli rabe. Main dishes are nearly as good as the starters. A recent special of wild striped bass (pictured above, $26) shines brightly with a supple, moist texture and sides of nutty sautéed Jerusalem artichokes, green garlic and oyster mushrooms. A plate of calf's liver (pictured right, $15) is prepared in a traditional Venetian style with reduced red wine and balsamic vinegar, allowing the deep, ferric richness of the liver to play against a sweet and acidic background. And here too, fried triangles of creamy polenta make a very welcome re-appearance. If there are any small disappointments at Al di La, they come at the end of the meal, for the desserts, while quite good, are less original and exciting than the breathtaking pasta, ravioli and gnocchi. An apple galette dusted with with powdered sugar and crowned with vanilla ice cream is refreshing, but something we've seen many times before. A trio of gelatos is restorative, but with the only the most predictable flavors: vanilla, hazelnut, and chocolate. All perfectly lovely, just not quite as magical as anything the restaurant makes with cheese or basil. Still, eating at Al di La is almost always a great experience, with a consistency and quality of cooking matched by few other restaurants. Al di La's seasonal variations on its Venetian and Northern Italian theme have held up so superbly-even evolving into more perfect versions of themselves over the course of a decade-that it is no surprise that half of Brooklyn seems to show up at the restaurant for every meal it serves. And if they do have to wait an hour or two once they arrive, a few bites of Anna's malfatti ought to make them forget all about it. Al di La Trattoria, 248 Fifth Avenue (at Carroll Street), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 718-783-4565.

Durian Training Wheels, Now in Cookie Form

***CONTENT
 Durian is a hard sell, we know. Any fruit that tastes like a cross between a banana and an onion, with a smell like a natural gas leak is doomed to be an acquired taste. Nevertheless, on the other side of the initial cringing and nose-wrinkling lies a creamy fruit pulp that, in a single ingredient, perfectly straddles the sweet-savory boundary. And given the recent trendiness of salt-sweet hybrids, we figure it's just a matter of time before chefs start holding their noses and reaching for a few of Chinatown's hanging mesh bags of spiny durian. Before that happens, we would like share a product we found recently that might help ease your palate gently into the world of durian: Rhinoceros (no affiliation with Marc Ecko) brand Durian Flavour Sting Cookies. Ridiculously inexpensive at $1.99 for a 9.5 ounce bucket (at Hong Kong Supermarkets in Manhattan and Sunset Park, Brooklyn), these little Vietnamese cookies are made with whipped tapioca starch and are pressed out into long, meringue-light shapes, then baked. The 'sting' in the cookies' name comes from their prickly surface markings-not from any sort of hidden heat or shocking surprise. The bumpy treats are perfect to set out in a dish at the end of a dinner party, and because their durian aroma is very subtle-the predominant flavor of the cookies is sweet coconut cream-it is easy to eat six or seven of the spiny little snacks before you even notice the nuances from the durian. And when you do, the aromas are soft and tempered by the sweetness and richness of the other ingredients. No sting here whatsoever, no matter what the label says.

Craftbar's Saline Grace

***CONTENT
 After two years as the pivot point of the Top Chef judging team, everyone from Sacramento to Savannah recognizes Tom Colicchio as a man who knows something about food. Yet despite a growing mini-empire that comprises nearly a dozen restaurants, relatively few people have actually eaten anything cooked in one of them. Colicchio's reputation as a critic is, for the vast majority of the nation, more salient than his reputation as a chef, and this does not necessarily work in his favor. Take our recent meal at Craftbar as an example: As HungryMan and I waited for an old friend to meet us, we overheard at least three groups of diners in the raucously loud dining room cattily mimicking a few of Tom C.'s recently televised barbs. If the old adage about glass houses holds true for restaurant owners, we cannot help but admire the guts it must take to provide diners with their own bread basket full of stones. As difficult as it may be to be impartial about Colicchio, it is impossible to ignore that the man has a gift for savory food. Craftbar's informal, enoteca-style menu, with its emphasis on cured meats and cheeses, is the perfect context to show off this skill-executed on a daily basis by Lauren Hirschberg, Craftbar's Chef de Cuisine. Indeed, our favorite dishes of the meal were ones where salty elements breathed life into the food. The best, a cold mixed baby beet salad (pictured left, $12), sounded pedestrian enough, but wound up tasting as sweet as fruit, thanks to a crumbling of pungent blue cheese and a balanced vinaigrette-the choice of a saltier, sharper cheese made all the difference. So too, in the chickpea fries with black olive aioli (pictured on Flickr, $7), a bar snack with a tender, almost custard-like interior. Alone, the fries tasted a bit like crunchy planks of tamago sushi, but when dipped in the olive spread, they acquired a fragrant peppery flavor that made them a wonderful partner for a glass of red wine. Only one dish was perhaps a bit too savory-the orecchiette with fennel sausage and ricotta salata (pictured top, $10). But even this dish, with its aromatic spicing, was still quite decent and required just a little judicious culling of a few of the stiff white cubes of aged ricotta. Another main, the daurade with brussels sprouts (pictured right, $21) was surprisingly filling, thanks to a generous portion of soft and smoky brussels sprouts that looked as if they had bloomed into papery green layers from dollhouse-scale cabbages. Thanks to the bacon, this was another salty dish, but one where all the components worked well together. Our friend's crispy polenta with mushroom ragout (pictured on Flickr, $16), one of the two vegetarian main dishes, seemed a bit out of step with the season and probably better suited to an autumn menu. It was, unfortunately, also too oily and ended up being the only plate of food we did not finish. And we had plenty of time to try-our server left our table uncleared for nearly 45 minutes. Still, even the lapses in service did not deter us from ordering the brown sugar cake with roasted pineapple and rum vanilla ice cream ($10). All three of us agreed that the pineapple and the potently alcoholic scoop of vanilla bean ice cream were superb. The cake itself also was not bad, by any means-just a bit too sweet and, ironically, missing one thing that would have made it really wonderful, something we bet Tom himself would not hesitate to toss in: A little more salt. Craftbar, 900 Broadway (near 20th Street), 212-461-4300.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Food for Design's novel and visually intuitive FOODPAIRING website. Displaying relationships among and between foods on spidery, cladogram-like starbursts, the site offers new ways of thinking about ingredients. We have used the site to create a few wonderful dishes we never would have considered before: a dill and sambuca aioli crab salad, and a roasted cauliflower side dish made even better with crushed, roasted almonds. 2. Icelandic chocolate from Noi Sirius (sold domestically at Whole Foods Markets). We have written about excellent Icelandic candies before, so we knew the little island nation made some great sweets, but Noi Sirius's premium bar chocolate-available in milk and dark-surprised us with its ultra-smooth, grain-free texture. It also makes some of the best chocolate frosting we have eaten...and it's not too bad for snacking. 3. Miolo Vineyard's 2006 Pinot Noir, probably the best $10 bottle of red wine you'll buy this year. And it won't be that inexpensive for long-this fruity, moderately tannic red is only a bargain because of its provenance. Winemakers from the Vale dos Vinhedos have applied the hard-earned South American viticultural wisdom of the past three decades and have quietly started producing some stellar wines. Sure, Brazil might not be the first country you think of when you shop for a pinot noir, but if the country keeps producing wines with this kind of structured acidity and balance, Napa and the Yarra Valley might have some stiff competition in the New World.

Table Tales for Everyone

***CONTENT
 Add another worthy lunch destination to the expanding list of eateries in and around the old South Street Seaport. Table Tales, the diminutive storefront to caterer Grace Clerihew's expanding operations, opened stealthily two years ago, just north of the Seaport on Water Street and after some early-stage growing pains, is now really hitting its stride. Not very long ago, getting a taste of Clerihew's food required an VIP invite to a Hugo Boss event or a seat at a catered board meeting at one of the nearby financial service companies on Wall Street, but now, her satisfyingly homestyle food is available to anybody wandering through the neighborhood. Don't think for a second we're missing our chance. At lunchtime, the range of hot and cold sandwiches rarely disappoints. We love how the buttermilk chicken sandwich (pictured left, $8.50) elevates the humble -and surprisingly moist-breast with a crispy coating of buttermilk and flour, along with a tangy, 'cajun' mayonnaise studded with red and yellow peppers. Then there is the savory pressed ham 'prosciutto cotto' sandwich (pictured below, $8.25) busting with thin slices of sweet-savory ham against a schmear of goat cheese. This might be a perfect pork coldcut sandwich, were it not for an occasionally aggressive application of mustard-ask for a gentle hand with the dijon. Better than both of these is the delightfully messy corned beef reuben ($8.25), made the traditional way with sauerkraut, swiss cheese and zesty Russian dressing on rye, then modernized by pressing it flat and crunchy in a hot sandwich press. If there were a pastrami version, we might never eat lunch elsewhere. As good as the sandwiches can be at Table Tales, the side dishes are notable enough to order on their own. Particularly meritorious is the potato salad - made with sour cream and a strong hit of dill, it is like a distillation of Stockholm in springtime. Baked goods are another strength-especially the gooey, chunky chocolate chip cookies that miraculously never seem to fall apart. One minor downside to Table Tales is that at the end of the day, it can't hide its status as adjunct to the much-larger catering operation. Judging from the number of people moving in and out of the shop, there is clearly plenty of action happening behind the door to the kitchen, which we suspect of being twice the size of the dining room. This has a practical consequence for diners, in that if you arrive too late-much past 12:30 on a weekday-the four small tables and the communal eating area are filled with hungry customers. So until Clerihew redeploys some of the real estate from the catering side to the restaurant, we recommend you get your order in before noon. Otherwise, there just won't be any Table Tales left to be told. Table Tales, 243 Water Street, between Fulton Street and Peck Slip, 212-766-2370.

Hey! You Got Your Bread of Affliction in My Chocolate!

 For some people, Easter baskets signal the beginning of spring; for some, it is the blooming yellow forsythia; and for others, it is matzoh. While there may not be anything inherently seasonal about the ingredients in hard, crunchy unleavened bread, matzoh's pride of place in the spring Passover celebration makes it as much a hallmark of the coming warmth as any daffodil. At the same time, matzoh is not particularly appealing on its own. Sure, its cracker-esque snap feels great in the mouth, but even slathered in butter, matzoh tends to be among the world's blandest foods. Vosges Haut-Chocolat chocolatier Katrina Markoff's brute force solution-to cover the tasteless matzoh with such large quantities of dark chocolate that the matzoh's flavor becomes almost academic-might seem extreme, but it works. To be fair, we have fallen for this trick many times before, as we found ourselves blissfully scarfing down thickly enrobed prunes, haystacks of fibrous lemongrass, and once, long ago, ants. No surprise then that a little Jewish hardtack would benefit from the same treatment. Where Vosges's concept really takes off is when another element is added to the dark chocolate mix-in this case, charoset, another Passover staple made from apples, cinnamon and walnuts. The result tastes like a Willy Wonka trail mix of nutty and fruity flavors, all set against the prominent backdrop of ultra-rich chocolate. And just as we were making plans to purchase a few of the 3 ounce containers ($14 each) as holiday gifts, we discovered the ultimate irony: These snacks are not kosher for Passover. A pretty cruel twist, but at least the chocolate matzohs keep well for three months, which leaves plenty of time to enjoy them after the week-long holiday ends. Plus really, who really wants chocolate fingerprints all over the seder plate? Vosges Haut-Chocolat, (SoHo and UES branches: See the Vosges website for addresses and hours).

Franglais in the USA at Macaron Café

***CONTENT
 No one could ever accuse Garment District newcomer Macaron Café of inauthenticity; on our first visit to the tiny, brightly lighted shop, we were offered a bowl of the day's 'oignon soup'. Then a few days later, the be-ascotted owner asked us if we wanted 'milk or sucre in our café'. And then yesterday, as Midtown Lunch Zach and I convened for a midday snack, we learned that the day's special was a healthy eight-grain crêpe with plenty of 'laitue.' Yet, this is not a bad thing: When the restaurant's eponymous pastry is as tricky to get right as is the macaron, the guttural 'r' sounds of a sirop-thick French accent are precisely what you want to hear from the staff. After nibbling our way through more than ten flavors of the shop's signature item, we'll go out on a limb and just say it: These are the best and certainly freshest macarons in town right now. Every variety we have tasted possesses its own distinct charms, but our favorites feature flavors that highlight unexpected aromas and sensations, like the rose litchee macaron, a brilliant, iridescent pink meringue disk (pictured in foreground, above) so subtly floral that it elevates and amplifies fundamental flavors of butter and salt in the ganache. Or the cinnamon macaron, with an aromatic zip that makes the crunchy top and bottom layers of the treat postively crackle when it is chewed. At $1.75 for each half-dollar-sized macaron, these are not inexpensive treats, but with dozens of nuanced varieties and hues-enough to make Pantone jealous-they are undoubtedly worth the splurge. At the same time, the little café, with its range of exquisite $5.50-$6.50 sandwiches is the site of one of Midtown Manhattan's best lunch bargains. Prepared fresh at the back of the shop, Macaron Café's French-Italian sandwiches are all made on artisan bread from venerable Hunt's Point wholesaler, Il Forno, and are big and chunky-some even large enough to share. Seated at the rear of the restaurant, at the tall leatherette bench, Midtown Lunch Zach and I did precisely that, splitting a Capri (pictured right, $5.50) and a Norvegien (pictured below, $6.50) between us. The Capri sandwich, filled with thick rounds of fresh goat cheese, apples, raisins, and toasted pine nuts, was sweet and tangy, with just enough fat from the homemade mayonnaise to bring all the flavors together-this was a sandwich that reminded me of something I might make to take along to a picnic, the kind of lunch that could be carried in a basket for hours and still emerge with a little crunch, hours later. In a more urban context, it is the ideal sandwich to buy and store in your desk until that interminable noontime meeting finally finishes. The Norvegien, on the other hand, a sultry, smoked salmon and capers sandwich on thick slices of Pugliese-style bread, was the sort of lunch that demanded immediate consumption. We were glad to oblige. While ours was slathered a bit too generously with the pepper and 'persil' sauce (parsley-not to be confused with actual Persil), the Norvegien still managed to be the highlight of my day-after all, I am a little bit of a sucker for any sort of savory treat that is served with a big jug of water and a glass of ice. As Zach and I watched the late-lunchtime droves snap up everything, down to the last crumbs of bread, from the shop, we discussed the café's growing crowds-up at least 50% since my first visit last month-and the imminent changes that will come when the café gets the attention it deserves. And as much as we would both like to keep the place a secret, it is far too good for that. We both suspect the layout of the shop will change to maximize interior space and prices may climb a bit, but as long as the sandwiches remain stellar and the macarons top-notch, I will be perfectly happy to stand in line with the crowds for my déjeuner. Macaron Café, 161 West 36th Street (near Seventh Avenue), 646-573-5048.

Brunch Between Provence and Mexico: Danal

***CONTENT
 Brunch at Danal is a high concept-affair. Just as Peter Mayle might have imagined a casual meal in a faux French estate: Chintz on the walls, yellow and blue tablecloths on the mismatched wooden tables, pillows casually placed on benches-cum-banquettes. Yet it all feels too phony for its own good-less a restaurant than a service to an American vision of Gallic leisure and gastronomy, a weird gloss on French countryside meets lower Fifth Avenue. Like the first Laura Ashley shop, Danal is one of those places that would have been new and unusual in the 1980s; it might even have inspired lines out the door. Today, the restaurant, despite a recent move from a truly diminutive space in the East Village to a much larger, bi-level space near 13th and Fifth, feels distinctly like it's going through the motions, or worse, marking time. When three good friends joined me for brunch at Danal last weekend, we first took notice of the reasonably priced menu: everything, including non-brunch items like the salade nicoise and the meatloaf, is priced below $15, and many items are $12 or $13. Keeping with the general theme, coffee is served in a French press-but impressively, one large enough for the table to share. And the coffee is indeed excellent, albeit rarely refilled. Unfortunately, brunch items are at once too much and too little, and with the inexplicable Ibero-Hispanic fusion, also a bit unsettling. The breakfast burrito (pictured left, $13) is, to begin with, a strange choice on the menu for an generally French Provencal brunch. It is also the first sign that the Latin-leaning identity confusion might well indicate that Danal does not really know what it wants to be. Worse, with eggs, chorizo, peppers, sour cream, and onions, there are simply far too many components on the plate for the burrito to resolve into a coherent whole. A smoked salmon omelette (pictured right, also $13) on the other hand is far too simple and lacks any burst of flavor. The swiss cheese and tomatoes do nothing to enhance the flavor of the of the salmon, steering the omelette perilously close to becoming a salty wash-out. The only thing of interest here is a stew of spiced apples, raisins and walnuts that reads curiously like that Passover staple, charoset. Could there be a displaced Latin-Jewish tribe living somewhere in the south of France? The only brunch entrée to pack a punch of flavor is the quesadilla (pictured below, $13) with shrimp, tomatoes and cheese which, while again not particularly French, beguiles with a mildly spicy seasoning and a tartly-dressed side salad. Service at Danal is not its strongest suit: It is often hurried and impersonal, with easily distracted staff who do not seem to be able to cope well with the sizeable brunch rush. We would have preferred more time with our server, or at least more than a perfunctory check-back, especially when all of our glasses were empty and we were sucking on the grounds in the bottom of our French press. The restaurant's move from a cramped location to a much roomier one ought to have invigorated the staff and the cooking, but that that seems not to have happened. Instead, the chilled-out décor and the harried staff just reinforce Danal's strangely split personality-casual, Provencal clichés do not mix well with frantic servers and lackluster Spanish-accented French dishes. We don't know the diagnosis for this disease, but we certainly know the cure: Danal seems a good candidate for professional help, preferably from a Freudian with a good palate. Danal, 59 5th Avenue (at 13th Street), 212-982-6930.

In Season: I Sodi

***CONTENT
 The first time I visited Italy, it was precisely this time of year-a season when the Tuscan dirt had finally lost its wintery crunch and café tables just started to reappear on sidewalks. It was also then, as if synchronized by the ringing of a thorny green alarm clock somewhere in Rome, that every restaurant in the nation started serving the year's first baby artichokes. Apparently the West Village is in the same culinary time zone, because as our old friend DJB, HungryMan and I scanned the menu at Rita Sodi's new West Village bistro, we spotted artichokes in more than half the dishes. Not a bad first impression, especially from a restaurant run by a first-time restaurateur. After a bittersweet, Aperol-rich Caroussel Negroni-a house specialty ($12), we got into the spirit of the seasonal menu and ordered two artichoke starters. One, the insalata di carciofi ($11), a shaved salad of raw baby artichokes, lemon juice and Parmigiano cheese, was the most dangerous dish on the menu. This high-risk salad works only if the baby artichokes are super fresh and immature-even an extra day or two of growing gives the little carciofi a woody character that renders them unsuitable for serving raw. I Sodi's version was a really fine attempt that was only occasionally undone by a couple of too-fibrous leaves. That said, we admire their unwillingness not to use the sneaky chef's cheat of par-boiling older artichokes and trying to pass them off as raw. Better still-and quite possibly the best thing we ate all evening-was the carciofi fritti, a side order of fried artichokes ($7) that was soft, nutty, and intensely salty. As long as the artichokes are in season, we'd love to see this dish paired with lemon juice and a little mustard and promoted from contorno to appetizer; it deserves it. DJB continued the artichoke theme through to her main, the lasagne carciofi (pictured on Flickr, $16), a classic layered pasta dish with béchamel and strata of rich, smoky-sweet rough artichoke purée. The full portion was hefty, but still quite manageable. HungryMan's full order of pappardelle al cinghiale (pictured on Flickr, $16) was another substantial plate of pasta, and one worth going easy on the appetizers for-the aromatic wild boar ragú, with its aromas of game and rosemary had everyone drooling. This is the sort of sauce that only works with thick ribbons of pasta, and the pappardelle did not dissapoint. Even though we tend to think of this as more of a winter dish, it still worked well on a nippy late March evening, regardless of what the calendar might have read. My risotto frutti di mare ($18 for a full order) was also hearty and even a little sweet-although that may have been the lingering effects of my earlier gorging on artichokes as much as the flavor from caramelized onions in the dish. No matter-the effect was lovely and worked well with the creamy short-grain rice and plump chunks of octopus. The dish was so filling that I realized halfway through it that I probably ought to have ordered a half-portion. Next time, for sure. We capped our meal with two desserts: a trio of gelati-hazelnut, blood orange, and dark chocolate-and a serving of the restaurant's chocolate salami-a compressed faux-sausage of rich chocolate dough and crushed biscotti flecks. We all enjoyed the gelati, brought in from Capogiro in Philadelphia and typical of the high-quality, upper-tier products they sell in their shop, to restaurants, and through mail order. But we were all mesmerized by the dense, brownie-like sweet 'salami', with its buttery cookie nuggets; it left us with a lingering taste of something unique, and more importantly, with a real desire to come back for more. If Chef Michael Genardini's very wise and very well-executed adherence to a seasonal theme continues, we'll be back in a few weeks when the weather shifts again-asparagus anyone? I Sodi, 105 Christopher Street (near Bleecker Street), 212-414-5774.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Laura Schenone's page-turner, The Lost Ravioli Recipes of Hoboken: A Search for Food and Family-part sleuth story, part love song to the elasticity of flat sheets of pasta, and part sociocultural examination of how Italy's pre-WWI economics shaped how we eat today. More to the point, it'll make you crave anything filled with ricotta. 2. Ippudo's Shiromaru Classic tonkotsu ramen (pictured right and more photos on our Flickr photostream, $13 for a large bowl)-with its intense pork aroma and filament-thin hakatamen, this is a contender for the most sophisticated bowl of noodles in the city. The light, soy-flavored broth is boiled with pork bones and seasonings for fifteen hours, a process that gives the translucent soup an astounding depth of flavor. When the tender cloud ear mushrooms, roasted pork belly and scallions are added to the mix, it is easy to see just how refined a bowl of noodles can be. 3. Dessert delivered to our front door, courtesy of Insomnia Cookies. If you are lucky enough to live in the strip of Manhattan from Broome Street north to 14th Street, you fall within the delivery catchment area for the first non-university branch of Seth Berkowitz's cookie bakery. Already winning the hearts of overworked junior legal associates and management consultants shackled to their desks, Insomnia is also benefiting from plenty of positive neighborhood buzz, thanks to its low prices ($0.90/cookie and $1.00/brownie) and late hours (the 8th Street & 6th Avenue shop is open daily until 3 o'clock in the morning). And really, is there a better solution than a chocolate mint brownie when you can't sleep at 2:15 a.m.?

Bzzzt! It's a Park Avenue Monsoon at Franchia

***CONTENT
 Mosquitos were only part of the reason why our recent meal at Franchia goes down as the worst so far of 2008. We readily admit that the bizarrely out-of-season experience of being nibbled on indoors by bloodsuckers during one of the coldest days in March had us a little nonplussed, but, as you must know by now, we are willing to overlook a lot for the sake of good food. Really, we tried. Hard. But from the moment we were served one of Franchia's soju cocktails, the green tea-based Awakening ($8.00), a watery, flavorless concoction with practically no alcohol, we started wondering if we shouldn't start looking for a better place to eat. Our guest, MiniRabbi, tried hard to be positive about the meal, but even his enthusiasm flagged halfway through our greasy and flaccid, too-sweet appetizer of corn and cilantro pancakes ($8.95). And then I got bitten for the first time. Moreover, I had plenty of time to figure out where the infestation problem was coming from, as we waited at least 30 minutes between starters and mains. During this time, one couple seated about ten feet away from us actually got up and left, telling the waiters on their way out the door that eating at their table was like \"sitting inside a bug zapper.\" So I shifted my chair as far away from the hot zone as I could, tried to pull my collar up around my neck and scanned the menu for OFF!. Not that I really expected it to be there; Franchia is, after all, a vegan restaurant, and in tune with its all-lives-are-equal ethos, those buzzing parasites had as much right to be there as we did. Of course, that didn't stop me from murdering a few with the back of a menu when the waitstaff weren't looking. Yet despite all of this, we kept open minds and hoped for the best with our entrées. Franchia, while technically Korean, serves a selection of dishes that blend many Asian influences, so we opted to order dishes that reflected as many of the component cuisines as possible. HungryMan's order of pumpkin noodles ($9.95) even came close to being good-the interplay of sweet pumpkin in the pasta and the savory soy glaze on this Korean-Chinese hybrid was wonderful-but the dish was undone by excessive oiliness and the ice-cold core at the center of the mound of noodles on the plate. MiniRabbi's pad thai (pictured on Flickr, $9.95) also arrived a little tepid and generally free of any kind of flavor whatsoever. Even if we chalk the failure of this dish up to the absence of non-vegan ingredients like fish sauce, there is still plenty that can be done with tamarind purée, galangal, kaffir lime leaves and chili. Yet at Franchia, the spiciest ingredient in the kitchen seems to be the carrot. The same unyielding blandness came through in my own main, the curry soy 'chicken' rice bowl ($12.95), a bibimbop-style dish served in a dolsot, a traditional Korean stone bowl that was, by a few hundred degrees, the hottest thing on the table. Unfortunately, there was not much curry flavor in either the potato, soy meat and carrot stew, nor in the rice underneath. Even the crusty rice lining the dolsot was a disappointment without more intense flavors-well, any flavors-seeping down from the toppings. All I got was crunch and wound up leaving most of it behind. The sight of all of that crisp, golden rice at the bottom of my stone bowl was more of an indictment than my bug-bitten arms, neck and even earlobe were, because it is easy enough to turn a blind vegan eye when the exterminator comes in to clear out the bugs, but it is far, far more difficult to perform the kind of gut rehab that Franchia's menu desperately needs. Franchia, 12 Park Avenue (between 34th and 35th Streets), 212-213-1001.

 Drinking during the week that follows St. Patrick's Day is a dangerous game: It usually involves plenty of avoidance behavior and at least one hair-of-the-dog sampling of the weekend's leftover whiskey. So when a friend of ours stopped by for a drink yesterday, we started thinking about how to usher in the last half of March without making any reference whatsoever to this Monday's knees-up. Immediately, we thought of the season's best fruit: the blood orange. We have been enjoying this year's fresh and bottled sanguinello juice for a month now, so it seemed a natural choice. And once we had blood orange on our hands, we new we would have to introduce coconut to the mix-one of our favorite flavor pairings. Even though it separates slowly in the glass, we still prefer to use well-shaken coconut milk, as its mellow creaminess contrasts so well with any sort of citrus. Plus, if drinks are prepared and served right away, coconut milk will stay in suspension just long enough to give you a chance to finish off the cocktail. Just remember not prepare a full pitcher of any drink that combines cold coconut milk and ice-you will need to shake each batch of these cocktails separately, as needed. If you do need to mix up a batch in advance, you can substitute fully-soluble coconut water-now available throughout the city in Tetrapak containers-for the coconut milk, as long as you double the dose. Finally, for a bit of subtle complexity, we added Green Chartreuse. Green works better than yellow, as it takes less to achieve the same nuances of herbal flavors, and we also find that the honeyed aroma of the Yellow Chartreuse does not pair as well with coconut and orange aromas. Moreover, there is something fitting about adding a symbolic splash of something green to the drink, just as the weekend's haze clears and a new season's flavors begin to arrive. Post-Clover Sunrise 2 oz. white rum (do not use dark) 1/2 oz. Green Chartreuse 1 oz. coconut milk 1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice 4 oz. blood orange juice fresh passion fruit seeds and sprigs of mint for garnish Fill a shaker with ice. Add rum, coconut milk, Chartreuse, lemon juice and blood orange juice to the shaker. Shake vigorously-at least twice as long as you would normally shake. Then strain and pour over ice in rocks glasses. Finish with a few passion fruit seeds and a sprig of mint. Serves 2. 2008 nycnosh.com

Mess With Islero, Get the Horns

***CONTENT
 **In case you have not heard, within hours of our posting this piece last night-and unconnected with anything we have written here-it was announced that Islero's entire kitchen staff has been fired.** If naming a restaurant after the central figure in a gory bullfighting double tragedy strikes you as melodramatic and more than a little bit morbid, chances are good that you are not Spanish. The bloody, brutal death of matador Manolete has become so much of a cultural touchstone for Spaniards that albums, novels, and even two movies (one starring Adrian Brody) have been made about the toreador and his demise. Yet with the exception of car manufacturer Lamborghini, almost nobody seems to have memorialized the mortally wounded bull whose last goring was a historical one. That is, until Chris Bianchi reclaimed the name Islero for his new Modern Spanish/Hispanic restaurant, even going so far as to offer guests a brief bovine biography on the front cover of the menu. Fortunately, bull skewers do not feature on executive chef (and Boulud protégée) Jessica Floyd's menu; instead, the focus is on small, medium, and large plates that can be ordered tapas-style or as appetizers and mains. On a recent visit with two of our friends, HungryMan and I ordered a few dishes from each of the menu's three categories and found some to be genuinely wonderful. One of our very favorites, the arroz cremoso negro (pictured top, $7) was very similar to a nutty risotto, flavored with heady winter truffles and tangy goat cheese. Better still was the color-a deep, inky black, nearly the hue of a squid ink risotto, but without any of that dish's muskiness. Also excellent was the ensalada calamar (pictured left, $10), a medium-sized dish of fire-roasted Basque peppers, arugula, cumin-crusted squid, all drizzled with an almond-rich romesco sauce. This dish succeeded on the strengths of its complex interplays between sweet and hot, sour and savory, crunchy and tender. We could have eaten this all night long. Mains were, on the whole, also winners. Of these, we loved the pato (pictured on Flickr, $24), a duo of molasses-rubbed duck preparations, a meltaway black bean cassoulet and crispy strips of duck bacon. HungryMan found the braised duck leg to be much moister than the breast, but both were still worth finishing. So too were both the cordero (pictured on Flickr, $25)-another duo, this time of lamb with pungent, smoky onions and a lovely golden brown toasted manioc (farofa) crumble-and the carne (pictured on Flickr, $19)-a sherry-infused steak with a crunchy garbanzo hash and burnt basil vinaigrette. My order of bacalao (pictured right, $18) may have been the most unusually-presented main of the evening, but the coil of 'curly mashed potatoes' atop my cod looked and tasted like a week-old funnel cake. While we understand the motivation to introduce a little textural contrast to the soft fish, these fried swirls of mashed potatoes were too tough and chewy to provide anything more than an obstacle to finishing the otherwise decent fish. Fortunately, only one dish was a complete misstep: the crunchy okra (pictured left, $7), an emphatically non-Iberian, non-Latin salad of battered okra nuggets, black hijiki seaweed, sesame and lotus root. None of the four of us could eat more than a tiny bite of this flat-tasting, oily appetizer-nor could we figure out how such a clearly Asian-inspired starter found its way onto Islero's menu. One of our two desserts, the peanut butter spoons (both desserts pictured below, $7)-a salty-sweet trio of chocolate and peanut butter treats-prompted similar questions about provenance. The richness of both the PB molten cake and the PB S'mores also left us thinking that such palate-coatingly rich sweets might be a bit out of step with the rest of the menu. The pumpkin churros ($7), on the other hand, made perfect sense both ethnically and culinarily, as did their spicy cocoa accompaniment. As we polished off the last of our wine and discussed the meal, it became clear to us quickly that Islero’s considerable strengths derive mainly from one source: Floyd’s intellectually playful take on Iberian/Hispanic flavors. Indeed, the restaurant's tragi-romantic bullfighting motif works well to contextualize a menu full of Manchego, sherry sauces and jamon. It would be a shame to spoil the theme with a spoonful of Jif and a few strands of seaweed. Islero, 247 East 50th Street (between Third and Second Avenues), 212-752-1414.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Tuesday's Choice Eats event in the Puck Building. Not only was Village Voice food critic Robert Sietsema's labor of love the first food event we have attended that made a serious attempt to showcase a true range of eating in the city-restaurants ran the gamut from Queens Peruvian legend El Anzuelo Fino to Meatpacking's Fatty Crab-but the price of admission ($25, including alcohol) was low enough to draw a heaving crowd of 1100 over the course of four hours. Our dish of the night was Madiba's gorgeously rich South African bread pudding with creme anglaise (pictured right): A phenomenally custardy mouthful that had closing-time lingerers lined up across the back room for a second helping. And did we mention that the event never ran out of beer and wine? 2. Kim Sunée's candid reflection on food and belonging, Trail of Crumbs: Hunger, Love, and the Search for Home. Half memoir, half cookbook, Sunée's story is Tender at the Bone's more depressive Asian cousin-and it wins points not just for its willingness to explore themes of adultery and anomie, but also for its stark first-person narrative voice. Come to think of it, someone ought to get Ruth Reichl and Kim Sunée together for a meal and a few bottles of wine. 3. Koryodang's Mini Pie Bread (pictured left, $2.75), a tender hybrid of white bread, a Parker House roll, and a croissant, this little, eight-inch loaf is one of our new favorite breakfast treats-especially when it is toasted lightly and smeared with fresh butter. The loaf's dense and elastic crumb also holds up well to cooking, which makes this a perfect foundation for a grilled cheese sandwich with enough crevices and layers to hold as much cheese as you can fit between two slices. Koryodang makes only a few loaves every day, so call ahead (212-967-9661), just to be sure we haven't cleaned them out already.

Thai Market: It's the Taro, Stupid

***CONTENT
 Now that they are neither novel nor exotic any longer, Thai restaurants, just like Chinese restaurants thirty years ago, have turned an important corner in their popularity. Once lemongrass and fish sauce started popping up at ShopRite and Stew Leonard's, it marked the end of an era when a lazy, uninspired Thai restaurant could survive its own mediocrity. Today, Americans, especially urban Americans, are learning to tell the difference between their green and red curries, and with this growing sophistication, we suspect that the next few years will bring a Darwinian wave of restaurant closures-especially to the overcrowded Midtown West/Hell's Kitchen neighborhood, where right now you cannot walk fifty feet without stepping in someone's leftover pad thai. What's more, right now is a time of real opportunity for the best new Thai chefs to take advantage of a restaurant-going population no longer afraid of a little galangal and ready for something genuinely special. To a great extent, Far Upper West Side standout Thai Market has done precisely this. With a menu that features solid versions of all the classics-like our savory, crunchy som tum (pictured left, $5.00), seasoned with plenty of chili and fish sauce-as well as lesser-known Thai dishes such as daikon radish cake ($5.00) and milder versions of some of the Isaan salads we raved about at Zabb Queens, Thai Market sends a clear message that its chefs are not asleep at their woks. On a recent visit, we sampled several dishes that stood out as some of the very best Thai we have eaten in Manhattan. One of our favorites was the Kui Tiew Koa Ped (pictured right, $10), a sautéed duck and flat-noodle main dish that achieved an excellent balance of peppery heat and gentle sweetness from the soft red onions and deep mahogany sauce-all of which emphasized the duck's natural richness. We also fell head over heels for Thai Market's version of khao soi (called kow soy on their menu), a Chiang Mai curry soup with al dente egg noodles and chicken. On the night of our first visit, we were also offered a shrimp khao soi (pictured on Flickr, $10), which we think is a brilliant variation, as picking the tender shrimp meat out of the shells forced us to slow down and really savor the zingy broth. That said, the dish still did not last long after we doctored up our bowl with plenty of the accompanying condiments, especially the pickled cabbage and fresh lime. Perhaps the biggest and most important indicator of how Thai Market has raised the culinary bar is that it serves a dessert that is actually worth ordering-something that can be said for perhaps two other Thai restaurants in Manhattan. The black sticky rice and taro cake (pictured left, $5)-a refined version of the banana leaf-wrapped rice dessert found in several Woodside Thai restaurants-offers lush contrasts between a soft, malty and almost chocolatey taro cake and sweet, chewy black sticky rice. We would love to see the restaurant serve a few more homemade sweets, but the sticky rice and taro cake is a superb start-just the thing for a restaurant whose creative, authentic cooking positions it perfectly to swim in the coming flood while its competitors struggle just to stay afloat.

Glad to finally see Thai Market get the recognition it deserves - and a nod that yes, there are restaurants north of 96th worth visiting - some damn good ones, in fact. I'm not a dessert eater but will now have to try the black sticky rice and taro cake. Living a couple of blocks from Thai Market is just one of many reasons I enjoy living on the upper upper west side.

Recession Special, No Papaya at Burger Shoppe

 How do you know Wall Street is facing the pointy end of a recession? If the massive layoffs from the major banks and brokerages aren't evidence enough of a slowdown, if the precipitous drop in sales of multi-million dollar condos to twenty-four year old bond traders isn't proof enough-just witness the opening this week of the Wall Street Burger Shoppe. It is a sign of Wall Street's straitened circumstances that in early 2008, the restaurant opening everyone south of Fulton Street is talking about is not a $30-an-entree steakhouse, but a humble and conspicuously retro burger joint-a duplex diner serving gourmet burgers for $4 and hot dogs at two for $5. And if the crowds at Monday's opening lunch service can be read as augury of the future, Burger Shoppe has chosen its moment well. The atmosphere among customers at the counter waiting to pick up their orders resembled that of an early-80s East Village mosh pit: a group of thirty to forty men in their 20s, heaving and impatient as they jostled one another for space at the register. Burger Shoppe was so crowded that the staff seemed unable to keep up, leading to opening-week snafus that pushed wait times to nearly twenty minutes, and by the afternoon, the restaurant was forced to close early due to a shortage of food. Still, if you can get past the crowds and the long wait-and we expect Burger Shoppe will sort out its service kinks in short order as it introduces table service on the restaurant's second floor- the food does offer a kind of nostalgic, caloric satisfaction. Burgers come in several variations, including the Shoppe Burger ($4) with lettuce, tomato, a spicy mayonnaise-based sauce, and a good char on the patty. The Becky Burger (pictured left, $5) is the same, but with cheddar cheese. Both are smaller than the average restaurant hamburger: about twice the size of a slider and just the right size for ordering two at a time. Naturally, there is a special two-pack on the menu-the 'real deal, which offers two Shoppe Burgers, fries or onion rings, and a soda for $10. Unfortunately, all burgers are wrapped snugly in heat-trapping thermal paper that keeps the burgers warm but often steams the buns to a soggy, patchy mess. Burger Shoppe's onion rings are also a bit disappointing. They are made fresh throughout the day, but the batter is uninspiringly bland, and its sheer bulk overwhelms the onions like a thick winter coat. On the positive side, the shakes and malts are creamy, fresh and very thick, and come in flavors ranging from vanilla to banana-rum walnut to a sweet, malty Guinness-spiked shake. The vanilla and chocolate Black and White (pictured right, $4) is particularly good. On this menu of burgers and fries, it is also possible to order healthier options. A 'chop chop' salad with grilled shrimp ($9, $6 without shrimp) offers romaine lettuce, cucumbers, green peppers, a tangy, pleasing dressing. However, ours contained only three small, grilled shrimp. Three bucks for three tiny crustaceans makes sense in some venues, but not here-even when salads are not the main event, they shouldn't feel so second-rate. In spite of its opening-day jitters and occasionally hit-or-miss menu, Burger Shoppe remains a sound addition to the neighborhood. Excepting a strip of restaurants on nearby Stone Street, the area immediately surrounding Burger Shoppe is a desolate canyon of office towers, Subway sandwich shops and an occasional deli. Moreover, Burger Shoppe seems to understand the locals better than many lunch spots do-with deals like the Party Monster, an order of 100 burgers for $365 (one hour's notice required), someone seems to have had the vision to imagine how to feed an entire cube farm of traders and analysts in the surrounding banks and financial companies. Well, the men among them at least-during our visits during opening week, men outnumbered women nearly nine to one, giving the place the air of a fraternity dining hall. A romantic spot to bring your date this is not, but at the end of the day it is difficult to beat the prices, and Burger Shoppe fulfills its promise of cheap fresh food, cooked to order-and once the crowds thin, waiting for a new burger to come off the line will be the best hedge against the soggy bun problem described above. And really, there aren't too many places downtown where two people can eat a decent, sizable meal for under $10 apiece and (when the upstairs opens officially) find a pleasant place to sit. Recession or no, we can think of many worse places to hunker down while we watch the dollar fall. Wall Street Burger Shoppe, 30 Water Street (between Broad and Coenties Slip), 212-425-1000.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. This year's extended Meyer Lemon season. Over the past several weeks, we have been enjoying some of the best Californian Meyers in recent memory, and if our luck holds out, there should be plenty left to last us until the cold snap ends. One of our favorite ways to use these sweet citrus hybrids is also one of the simplest: take a toasted slice of sweet brioche, squirt with the juice of half a Meyer lemon, drizzle with melted dark chocolate and sprinkle with toasted pine nuts. Skip zesting a Meyer though, as its skin is much less aromatic than a regular lemon's would be. But really, this treat doesn't need it. 2. The Splendid Table's year-long Locavore Nation experiment. Just about a month old this week, the project follows 15 bloggers from across the country as they work towards the admirable goal of eating a diet made up of 80% local, organic and seasonal foods. What we love most about the idea is that it forces participants and readers alike to confront some important questions: Why can we not come to a consensus on what sustainable means? Is eating locally only possible in warmer regions of the country? And importantly, what needs to happen before eating locally is a viable economic option for everyone, not just the country's most affluent 5%? 3. L. Mawby Vineyard's Crémant Brut (about $22, including shipping, from Winebuys.com or direct from the vineyard). As French as it might sound, this is an American sparkling wine-made using the strict methode champenoise that would qualify it to be called champagne if it were Gallic. Most surprising of all is that this plummy, gently acidic wine is made not in California, but on Michigan's Grand Traverse Bay. Mawby's Crémant is good enough to convince even the most skeptical enophile that viticulture is alive and thriving in the Wolverine State. Color us convinced.

Lambda, the $400-a-Gallon Olive Oil

***CONTENT
 Imagine for a moment that you were given a $100 bill and told to buy ingredients for a romantic dinner for two. With your C-note, you could do quite a bit, even in NYC-purchase a few lobsters, a loaf of artisanal bread, a very decent bottle of wine and even the ingredients for a chocolate cake; maybe grab a Niman Ranch steak or two and a bundle of asparagus. Or, thanks to Giorgos Kolliopoulos and Corinna Michaelidou, founders of the Speiron Company, you could blow the whole thing on a single liter of their signature product, Lambda olive oil. At $52 for a 500 ml bottle (prices vary with the euro/dollar exchange rate), Lambda, apparently the world's first 'ultra premium couture olive oil', is certainly among the most expensive cooking oils on sale anywhere. When a Speiron press release arrived in our inbox a few months ago, we knew that we had to give Lambda a test-drive and see for ourselves if it lived up to its own considerable PR hype. After all, we have no qualms about paying for superior quality, but we also think it is important to point out when food manufacturers are punching above their own weight. Visually, Speiron gets it all right: Lambda's bottle is a sleek, compressed and smoothed glass lozenge that showcases the oil's straw and pale green shades. Every element of the graphic design is also pitch-perfect. But olive oil is not like a restaurant interior-unless the bottle is placed on the table with the meal (certainly an option), clever package design has little or no effect on a meal. What really matters are what Speiron pseudoscientifically calls the 'organoleptic properties' of the stuff: In other words, its sensory qualities. So we popped the cork and tasted Lambda in several contexts: Neat (sipped at room temperature), in an uncooked vinaigrette for a tomato and fresh marjoram salad, whisked into and drizzled onto soft polenta, in a saffron-rich risotto Milanese, and finally, used to pan-fry a halibut fillet. In our first three tastings, ones where the oil was never heated beyond about 150 °F, Lambda performed best. Its very low acidity (0.3%) lent the raw oil a honeyed sweetness and grassiness-we even caught an occasional whiff of tarragon-that faded as heat was applied to the oil. We thought the oil really came to life in the tomato salad, in the presence of acid from citrus and vinegar, which made us wonder if too much of the oil's natural tang had been removed. In the warm polenta, Lambda was again very good and still fruity, although we did not think it was better than our favorite Gata-Hurdes Spanish olive oil ($15.99/liter). In the dishes where we heated Lambda to a high temperature for frying or sautéeing, the oil stood up well, never smoking and never turning acrid or bitter. In the risotto, we could still taste a bit of its vegetal character, although much of this was lost after 20 minutes of cooking. So too with the halibut, where after about ten minutes at a high temperature, the oil's nuances had disappeared. These are not surprising results, as olive oil's volatile esters always burn away when it is heated-Lambda is no exception. Yet even in its uncooked, fully complex state, we still cannot justify spending $400/gallon for this oil. The subtle flavors and gentle green aromas are genuinely lovely, but no more so than those in a bottle of Fairway's Extra Virgin Pugliese ($14.99/liter) or even Raineri Gold Unfiltered Extra Virgin (about $25/liter). Those bottles don't make the visual impression that Speiron's gorgeous Hellenic packaging does, but they deliver an otherwise equivalently wonderful 'organoleptic' experience at less than a quarter the cost. And hey, with a romantic dinner on the agenda, is your olive oil bottle really where you want the focus to be?

Thank you for the review of the oil. I have not tasted it yet but, as someone who regularly reviews olive oils on my blog, I'm interested to see how this olive oil fares in the marketplace. Unlike wine, where people do spend lots of money on single bottles but can store them for longer periods of time, olive oil slowly and steadily degrades in the bottle.

Nova Café, By Any Other Name

 Christophe Barbier is nothing if not persistent. A transplanted Normand with a passion for French bakery classics like pain aux raisins and croissants aux amandes, Christophe came to New York several years ago and opened up a small casual café in Cobble Hill. This first business, Delicatessen, was soon followed by Nova Café, a catering and sandwich shop on nearby Verandah Place in Brooklyn Heights. Neighborhood residents became loyal fans, but people never seemed to remember the name of either eatery, calling them variously: Deli, Red Café, Christophe's, Nova Court... . Then, in 2004, Barbier made a ripple in Brooklyn's culinary tidepool when he made the decision to shut both restaurants down and follow his wife to China. Now, nearly four years later, Barbier has returned to Gotham, this time planting the seeds of his resurrected Nova Café and Catering in new ground: Tenth Avenue, on the western edge of Hell's Kitchen-a stretch of Manhattan that looks uncannily like Court Street did fifteen years ago. Nova Café's small tiled dining space is bright and clean, with no more than a handful of small tables and a wobbly red leather banquette-this is uptown function over form. The rest of the interior is given over to a cavernous kitchen that looks as if it could be used to prepare a meal for a hundred guests without shifting a single piece of equipment. But forget the size of Nova's grill and ovens-it is what comes out of this space that is so remarkable. Yes, the chocolate chip and cocoa chocolate cookies are wonderful, but-watch your back Claude-Nova makes some of the very finest puff pastry in the city: Crisp and buttery croissants with what seems like a billion silken layers of pastry; sticky, buttery pains aux raisins; and best of all, almond croissants with a perfect custardy balance of almond paste and pastry (all $2.00-$2.50). Barbier's pastry case is not his only asset, however. Nova's made-to-order sandwiches, salads and pizzas are superb and, because they are all prepared à la minute, they are always fresh. One downside is that the average wait at the counter is longer than it would be at Pret a Manger or even Café Zaiya, but if you bear in mind that slower food pays greater dividends, it makes waiting for a sandwich on homemade bread a little easier to manage. We are partial to the egg salad sandwich ($7), layered with freshly sliced cucumbers and chopped dill, as well as the turkey, ham and swiss toasted sandwich ($7.75), slathered in a spicy, peppery 'mojo' sauce that transforms an ordinary turkey and ham panini into a juicy French-influenced Cuban sandwich. And then there is the most classic panini: tomato, basil and buffalo mozzarella ($7), which works so well at Nova because of the crunch from the yeasty bread that elides into a meltingly cheesy center. No surprise also that the pesto tastes as if it has been zipped up in the Cuisinart seconds before. If sandwiches aren't quite enough for you, there are even bags of house-made potato chips for sale in small pouches of greaseproof paper ($2): pleasingly crisp, savory and like what every Ruffles hopes it will grow up to be. For Barbier though, the café is just a side project; Nova's walk-in lunch counter is a front for a much larger catering operation that organizes lunches and dinners for large events. The catering menu goes on for pages, covering a vast spectrum of cooking: items range from bagels and roasted brussels sprouts to braised boneless beef short ribs and Moroccan spiced chicken. We would love to see one or two of Barbier's more refined dishes added to Nova Café's daily specials menu-this might even bring in diners who want more than a sandwich or a pastry. Still, the truncated counter menu and the phenomenal croissants are enough to set the locals atwitter-friends in the neighborhood have asked us if we have visited \"Red, you know, the place with the red awnings\" and \"Nova Restaurant\" yet. It seems no matter how far west you move in this city, some things never change. Nova Café and Catering, 820 10th Avenue at 54th Street, 212-977-8900.

Mia Dona: Reincarnated, and It Feels So Good

***CONTENT
 By the time you read this, New York City's best BYOB restaurant will probably be just a memory. It didn't really last long-just a few weeks-but if Mia Dona's first, liquor license-free meals are any predictor of success, the restaurant is well on its way to becoming the best mid-priced Italian eatery on the Upper East Side. Mia Dona is a reboot of the collaboration between self-taught rising star chef Michael Psilakis and fellow uptown restaurateur Donatella Arpaia-a re-creation of their dearly missed UES joint, Dona, but one that takes greater culinary risks and offers greater payoffs than their previous successful collaboration. Psilakis, best known for his Greek cooking at Onera, Kefi, and the Michelin-starred Anthos, has toned down the pan-Mediterranean accent of Mia Dona's menu, instead turning Italian provenance into the dominant theme. This new clarity makes the kitchen's Hellenic nods rarer occurrences, and when they do appear, they are more striking for it. When we visited this week, we had to work hard to find dishes with explicit Greek influences. One in particular, the grilled octopus with a leek and potato salad ($9), managed to declare its dual loyalties beautifully. The grilled octopus was tender and moist-and with the roasted potato salad alone, this could have easily been a Sardinian specialty. But with the astringent punch of some very Greek green olives and crumbled feta, this dish became truly special, not to mention craveable. Our gnudi with truffle butter sauce and crisp shavings of speck ($10 as a starter, $16 as a main), a holdover from Dona's original menu, were similarly wonderful. HungryMan described them as \" little creamy pillows slathered in aromatic sage and smoked pork\". The dish was so delicate that we could even taste hints of the gin-like juniper flavors from the crisped speck. They were also the perfect prelude to Mia Dona's other pork standout, the roasted chop with lardons and an dribbly-yolked fried egg (pictured below, $19). The dish featured a clever blend of textures-crunchy frisée contrasted with the toothsome chop and the caviar-like eggplant-that made it an incontrovertible winner. My own main, the olive oil poached cod with mussels and broccoli rabe (pictured on Flickr, $21) was also quite good, even with a few stray singed bits of garlic thrown in. Yet what was most impressive about this particular entrée was the luscious slow-braised broccoli rabe, cooked to a point where it retained none of its raw fibrous character or bitterness. The greens alone were inspiring enough to send me to the market the next day for a pound of broccoli rabe with which to attempt my own version (bottom line: slow-braising takes hours...leave it to Psilakis). Our apple and almond napoleon with almond gelato (pictured on Flickr, $7) was an ideal wintertime finish to the meal. And while the origins of this particular tiered dessert may not be Italian, the pastry cream and glossy shaved almonds reminded us of nothing more than a rich zabaglione. And we will admit it: we relished Mia Dona's license-free window of opportunity to drink what would have been a $70 bottle of Dolcetto D'Alba with food that cost us just a bit more than that. But most of all, we love that this time around, Donatella and Michael's partnership has produced a menu that has been edited with care, a menu where dishes are served because they are truly excellent, and not simply because they blend two culinary idioms. Soon, you too will be able to raise a glass (of something you didn't bring yourself) and toast to a very felicitous reincarnation. Mia Dona, 206 East 58th Street, 212-750-8170.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Omido's citrus-miso glazed salmon (pictured below, $17), a crispy dish that plays beautifully on tang and umami, salt and sweetness. It is also the rare main that works well as a bite-sized appetizer-at a recent press event at the new AvroKo space, we were surprised to see our favorite Omido entrée reimagined as a nibble, and even more surprised when we realized that it was just as good in miniature. 2. The newly renovated lower level of Bacchus Wine Made Simple at 71st & Broadway. The airy room retains design elements from the original wine cellar, but with a very non-subterranean lighting scheme. Most especially though, we love the Enomatic tasting stations and the small-producer wines Bacchus uses to stock them. 3. Heston Blumenthal's captivating BBC series, In Search of Perfection, now in its second season in the UK. The program follows the culinary braniac behind the Fat Duck-a man considered by some to be the world's No. 2 chef-as he takes on classic British dishes like chicken tikka masala, fish and chips, and even roast chicken, in an effort to refine them into their ideal form. Until BBC America comes to its senses and adds the show to its schedule, you can take a gander at Blumenthal making some of the best recipes from the second season on the program's homepage. And if you find yourself inspired by Heston Blumenthal's intellectual approach to cooking, both of the show's companion cookbooks are available domestically. We'd be willing to bet both books are on Wylie Dufresne's Amazon Wishlist.

Going Seasonally Affective at Ideya

***CONTENT
 My friend Jonathan owes his happiness to a light bulb. The dark gloom of February and March put him into such a funk that only the restorative power of a twenty-minute session underneath a halogen light therapy lamp can fool his body into believing that the sun is actually shining. Jonathan's made-to-order, $325 bulbs might be pricey, but they keep his seasonal affective disorder at bay, and as he says, they are still cheaper than a trip to Florida. For those for whom a bit of metaphorical sun will do the trick just as well, there is an even more convenient option: Ideya, a pan-Latin bistro on the edge of SoHo, with its whitewashed brick walls and accents in shades of lime green and neon blue. Samba pulsates through speakers by the door and around the sleek, minimalist bar. A drinks menu, replete with tropical fruit concoctions, might as well come with its own umbrella. If there's any place that might make you forget the season, Ideya is it. Unfortunately, despite a few brave exceptions, Ideya's power to perk up your taste buds is more disappointing than its sun-drenched Latin vibe. Take one of Ideya's special appetizers, its seafood tacos (pictured here, taquitos de mariscos, $9), billed on the menu as crispy flour tortillas filled with mixed seafood. While the bias-cut, architectural presentation wins points, the filling is oddly tasteless, more filler than shrimp or salmon, which are the only identifiable ingredients. The best thing about the dish is the pool of red, arbol chile sauce which provides some needed heat and flavor, but only if spooned liberally over the tacos. The tomato and mango soup ($7) is much better-a warm and savory paean to the out-of-season tomato, enlivened with a kick of coriander (cilantro) oil. Overall, this dish works better, but misses out on greatness because the pureed mango flavors remain bashfully in the background. Main courses, some of which show glimpses of brilliant cooking, suffer from a surfeit of ingredients. Sometimes less is indeed more. A case in point is the unseasonably-named salmon otoño (Autumn Salmon, $19), a tottering tower of aggressively seasoned fish, kale, and a cloying little boulder of apple-pear chutney. Despite the fact that the kitchen knows how to cook a fillet of salmon to order, the dish as a whole is bogged down by too many ingredients and an overcomplicated spice crust. The Cuban pork chop ($20), very decent on its own, also suffers from a clutter of accompaniments: an orange and tomato salad, black beans baked and spiked with rum and honey, and a very dry, crumbly triangle of jalapeño cornbread. And no matter what your server suggests, the chop does not need a side of the gluey cilantro-fueled mashed yucca ($5)-a dish that sounds more flavorful (and less sticky) than it actually is. Still, there is a lot to love at Ideya, especially if you stick to the bar's imaginative drinks, which include the expected mojitos and margaritas (the mojitos, while excellent, do not quite live up to the menu's billing as 'best in Nueva York') and the unexpected (ginger margaritas, guanabana batidos with rum). All work well with the restaurant's chilled-out vibe and help ease you into the music as you nibble on the free-and wonderful-fried plantains. Sure, Ideya's main menu may be ho-hum, but the cheery little bistro's drinks offer the best concentrated dose of solar magic in town. No light bulbs required. Ideya Latin Bistro, 349 West Broadway, between Broome and Grand Streets. (212) 625-1441.

Despite their striking-and yes, garish-visual impact, the season's brilliant scarlet goodies let us down so often because they tend to be made from poor-quality ingredients and are sweet enough to rot every tooth in your head. Neither of these calls to mind feelings of love and passion. So we started thinking about a way to use great ingredients to make a Valentine's Day cocktail with all the eye-popping appeal of a screaming red velvet box of chocolates, but without the insipid flavor of the candies inside. Our work was cut out for us. We decided to start with vodka as a base, since it blends so well with herb infusions and fruit juices alike. Christiania, the vodka shown here ($50 for 1 liter at Union Square Wines), was our first choice for the drink, thanks to its very pleasing, flinty finish. Then we moved on to pomegranate juice, which is sweet without being cloying, not to mention intensely crimson. Because we have been on a bitters kick this winter, we knew immediately that we would cut the pomegranate juice's sweetness with an aromatic, herbal ingredient. We considered orange bitters and even Becherovka, but ultimately, Campari won the day, thanks to its color and its nuanced and complex flavor profile. To lighten up the drink and give it a few bubbles that snap gently in the mouth, we finished it with a guzzle or two of sparkling pink lemonade, although you could substitute any clear fizzy soda. The end result is a light, semi-sweet drink that works well before or after dinner-but more importantly, one that says \"I love you\" without delivering a lethal dose of sugar or FD&C Red No. 4. My Bitter Valentine 2 oz. vodka 1/2 oz. Campari 4 oz. pomegranate juice 3-5 oz. sparkling lemonade Fill a Boston shaker with ice. Add vodka, Campari, and pomegranate juice to the shaker. Shake vigorously, then strain and pour over ice in rocks glasses. Finish with a few ounces of sparkling lemonade and the garnish of your choice (fresh mint works well). Serves 2. 2008 nycnosh.com

i like campari as well, but i just thought u might want to know that it may well have fd&c red #4 or some such artificial color in it. http://www.chowhound.com/topics/407351 also, in keeping with your bitter theme, perhaps using sage instead of mint? that sounds pretty tasty. or dare i say a leaf of endive or radicchio? great site guys, i have favorited you in my delicous!

Hi Ilya, Good point on Campari. We know it is artificially colored, but we also would be willing to wager that the amount of artificial coloring is hundreds of times less in 0.5 ounces of Campari than in a box of dyed white 'chocolate' hearts. Sage is a great idea to bring in a new, savory aroma to the drink. Let us know how it works out for you!

Brown Café: No Smoke, No Fire

***CONTENT
 My first apartment was a boxy, 400 square foot single room with a kitchen recessed into the rear wall-the sort of apartment that appears liveable to no one, save a recent college graduate whose dormitory living space was even tinier. Despite its faults, I loved nearly everything about that little Art Deco-era box, with one glaring exception: the apartment's miniature kitchen had no cooktop. There was an ample oven, a sink and a microwave, but nowhere to heat up a pan or a pot. The landlords blamed the gas company, the gas company blamed the landlords, but the bottom line was that anything I wanted to sear or sautée had to be cooked in an oven-baked cast iron skillet that I blasted in the broiler for 15 or 20 minutes. After playing Hephaestus and burning my palms and countertops for the fiftieth time, I gave up, put working burners at the top of my wishlist for my next apartment, and started baking. Alejandro Alcocer's Brown Café shares a few important things in common with that little flat: The dining space in the restaurant is not much bigger than my cozy studio was, and most importantly, there isn't a flame to be found anywhere in Brown's kitchen. Instead, this restaurant's every kilojoule comes courtesy of two industrial-sized steel ovens. No cooktop, no problem. Going flameless is a huge risk for a restaurant, especially one on a desolate block of Hester Street that straddles the border between Chinatown and the Lower East Side-a part of Manhattan where foot traffic is sparse at all hours of the day. Yet the little café and its neighboring sister businesses, Orange Epicerie and Green Catering, still keep plugging along, fire or no. We suspect that Brown's charming, woodsy cottage interior helps to lure diners in, but we have to confess that we don't fully understand why so many of those patrons have become such ardent devotees of the place. This is not to say that Brown does not serve good food-some dishes we sampled were wonderful. We especially enjoyed the aged goat cheeses that made up part of our cheese board (pictured top, $9 for three cheeses), even though we were charged for the full charcuterie plate. The tarragon aioli-dressed squid and octopus salad (pictured above, $12), a baseball-sized mound of tender calamari rings and baby octopus mixed in with frisée, red potatoes, grape tomatoes and chives, was pleasantly garlicky and very well-balanced overall. Unsurprisingly, we also found baked desserts, such as the apple tart with fresh blueberries and honey (pictured on Flickr, $6) to be some of the best items on the menu. On the other hand, the white-striped bass with mushroom and corn compote (pictured above, $18) looked rubbery and grey, like something out of the recipe section of a Cold War-era copy of Family Circle. It was here that the restaurant's lack of searing power really became evident-just a little brown crispness or a smidge of char would have improved the bass tremendously. And it was not just the fish that suffered-the sweetness of the accompanying compote with cippolini onions also would have paired much better with a more caramelized fillet. Similarly, the flank steak with potato gratin and shallots ($19) bore all the hallmarks of a throwback to mid-century broiler cooking, with its excessively tough texture and flavorless, barely browned exterior. We loved the gooey gratin, but it was not enough to save the rest of the dish. Had our meals been disastrous, it would have been easy to dismiss Brown Café entirely, but the restaurant comes tantalizingly close to living up to its potential. Moreover, it is hard to dislike a café that offers a reasonably-priced menu with an explicit focus on local produce and organic, free-range meats. But until Alcocer invests in a few powerful portable induction burners (or until the gods of Con Edison bring the gift of gas flame to Brown's kitchen), we'll stick to the baked macaroni and cheese ($13) and hold out for dessert. Brown Café, 61 Hester Street (near Ludlow Street), 212-477-2427.

East Japanese Restaurant's Middle Child Syndrome

***CONTENT
 If East Japanese Restaurant had a chance to choose its 55th Street digs all over again, we bet it would not take the restaurant directly next door to Yakitori Totto, one of the city's finest Japanese grills. Technically, East was there first, but no matter. By now, the poor izakaya must be in desperate need of therapy, as it sits side-by-side with its direct competitor, playing Jan Brady to Totto's Marsha. A good friend of ours once told us that this particular branch of East (one of several in the city) has earned the reputation for being Totto's overflow room-when there are no tables in the adjacent building, people end up at East. It's enough to make you feel a little sorry for the place. While East admittedly tries too hard to do too much-sushi, noodles, grilled food, bar snacks-some of its better dishes are actually very good, as HungryMan and I discovered recently. That said, it pays to be strategic about eating at East. The restaurant hosts theme evenings throughout the week: \"Let's Eat Tuna on Wednesday,\" for example, and these nights are often the best time to eat the signature dish, since there is so much of it in house that evening, and from what we have tasted during our visits, the theme ingredient is usually fresh. At the same time, a bit of counterintuitive strategy pays off here: Don't, despite what your drunk friends may have told you, eat sushi here. This is not to say that East's sushi is not adequate-it can be-but it never exceeds the quality of something you might be able to pick up from Whole Foods. Also avoid the noodle dishes, which are again, barely mediocre, if still edible. We found a recent order of the nabeyaki udon ($8.50) with tempura, sliced fishcake, and egg to be bland and rather greasy-a charmless bowl of soup, but a filling one. What East does well is izakaya snacks and soups. Our favorite dishes, the tuna kimchi nabe soup (pictured on Flickr, $8.50), a zippy bowl of savory broth that hides a thick chunk of broiled tuna, makes a lovely winter dinner. So too, the restaurant's very finest dish, the ika wata yaki ($7), grilled squid that has been marinated and braised in its own ink, soy sauce and a miso-mirin glaze. When I ordered the ika wata yaki for the first time, our server raised her eyebrows and asked me, \"You sure?\". When she returned fifteen minutes later to see that I had polished the entire thing off, she smiled and told me, \"Usually, only Japanese order this. It is too strong.\" Indeed, she had a point-to eat ika wata is to embrace squid's natural pungence, in much the same way that eating cuttlefish demands at least a passing tolerance for funk. And because the musky, umami-rich marinade lends the squid an extra stratum of earthy depth, diners expecting clean, flavorless calamari rings might be in for a shock. Yet, in a restaurant where nothing else is much of a surprise, perhaps punchy dishes like the ika wata and the kimchi nabe are East's best hope for making a real impression of its own, for setting a course towards emerging from the (literal) shadow of Yakitori Totto. Lord knows, it won't be the sushi that does it. East Japanese Restaurant, 253 W. 55th Street (at Eighth Avenue), 212-581-2240.

The 55th Street branch of East is a great-value, if unsexy, place. I agree that it's best to stick with the izakaya-type items. I love their $5 saba shio. When I was working nearby I used to stop by about once a week for a small meal and some sake, and I rarely spent over $20. The East card is a good deal for regulars, since you get 10% off and a gift certificate on your birthday. You pay $20 up front for the card, but you get that back in certificates.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Watching (agog) as You Are What You Eat host Gillian McKeith rips potato chip bags out of the hands of London pedestrians, screams at parkgoers sipping soda, and generally earns every milligram of her reputation as a real piece of work. Forget the sometimes unsound nutritional advice-what makes her BBC America/Channel 4 program so captivating is witnessing her stomp up and down like Rumplestiltskin as she has an aneurysm over a half-eaten candy bar. 2. Maîtres Laitiers 20% fat fromage frais. We know Gillian McKeith would blow a gasket over this, but we have been using this lush, fresh Normandy cheese ($5.29 for a 500ml container at Fairway) as a spread on a slice of crusty bread (or bagel) with a sprinkle of fleur de sel, a few red pepper flakes, and a few pinches of chopped flatleaf parsley. 3. The lemon oil cake ($4.00 for a colossal slice that feeds two) from Artevino, the newly expanded Arte Around the Corner-a tangy, grassy and fragrant baked confection made with an aromatic olive oil instead of butter or shortening. It is also the rare treat that goes as well with an espresso as it does with a glass of white wine.

The Red Cat: Better Up North

***CONTENT
 I have always secretly believed that Graydon Carter's original vision for his quasi-private Waverly Inn was to open a smaller, more elitist version of The Red Cat in a space that resembles an old Oxford pub-one practically next door to his apartment. Not only do the the two restaurants share many of the same patrons (some famous, some not) and a common urbane-yet-cozy vibe, their menus reflect an abundance of the same modern American culinary contours. But in the translation from Chelsea to West Village-if indeed that is what happened-The Red Cat's gentle Mediterranean influences were lost. It is a shame, because it is precisely these nuances that make the nine-year-old Red Cat a much more pleasant place to dine. Don't get me wrong, I get the the same sort of frisson as anyone when Susan Sarandon steps on my toe. I, too, smile admiringly when John Mayer bumps his head on Waverly's rough-hewn low beams, or when Hilary Duff walks in to the place with her angry little posse. But I can't help but think how the food reminds me of The Red Cat's-and makes me wish I were there instead. Part of the reason why The Red Cat has been so successful for so long is that it takes the concept of modern American cuisine and does not turn it into a monochromatic essay on starch and protein. Instead, chef Bill McDaniel looks at the idea of 'American' through the lens of its Mediterranean-mostly Italian-immigrant influences. And this approach works splendidly. Case in point: the oven-roasted cauliflower ($8), technically a side dish, but one we order as an appetizer, gets its allure from its freshness as well as its puttanesca-style dressing of anchovies, capers, chunks of tomato and garlic. Appetizers, even somewhat shopworn dishes like the beet tartar (pictured on Flickr, $12) and the fish cake (pictured on Flickr, $14) benefit from confident, deft spicing: the roasted beet cubes thrum with a peppery tingle, while the fish cake's bold yellow rouille highlights a delightfully smoky, musky aroma in the crisp little patty. On the entrée side, Red Cat's grilled pork chop tends to get all the attention, but the fish dishes are all solid. The grilled salmon with apple-parsnip purée and a light, clarified lobster vinaigrette (pictured on Flickr, $23) showcases McDaniel's ability to pair complementary flavors, although here, as with his calf's liver au poivre (pictured on Flickr, $20), he perhaps includes one too many elements. Even better is the pitch-perfect roasted cod with escarole and an anchovy-almond sauce (pictured right, $25), an indulgently savory filet of tender white fish that, if I were blindfolded, I would guess was poached in melted butter. Yet because of the European inflections-the almond, the paprika, the anchovy, even the escarole-the dish possesses a lush complexity. Cod does not get much better than this. When guests come to visit, as Moose Ma did this week, we could certainly take them out for the full pageantry of a meal at Waverly Inn. And for some of our less gastronomically inclined visitors, we could imagine no better destination than Graydon's place. But our really special guests, the ones whose trips to the city are guided by their tastebuds, get to skip the experience of being jostled by Chloe Sevigny and go straight to The Red Cat, where the palate trumps the paparazzi every time. The Red Cat, 227 Tenth Avenue (between 23rd and 24th Streets), 212-242-1122.

Year of the Pig at Trestle on Tenth
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Late winter in Alpine Switzerland is bitterly cold. With Christmas past and dozens more long, dark days of snow ahead, people often deal with the chill by crawling into their chalets until things warm up; but for Trestle on Tenth chef and owner Ralf Kuettel, the best anti-freeze is a traditional metzgete. Roughly translated as a 'butcher's feast' or more simply 'butchering,' the metzgete is a Swiss celebration of all things familial and porcine-it is what an American Thanksgiving might look like if every family in the nation slaughtered their own pigs. Through this weekend, Chef Kuettel, formerly of Union Square Cafe and the Chelsea Wine Vault, brings the mezgete to New York, and he was kind enough to take time out of his marathon sausage making to invite Candide and me to West Chelsea to give this classic Swiss meal a try. Since opening its doors a year and a half ago, Trestle on Tenth has matured into a popular neighborhood spot, albeit one that provokes New Yorkers with its hearty, fatty, French- and German-inspired fare rather than small plates or meat-free cooking. Furthermore, as Ralf is quick to emphasize, his is not a 'Swiss' restaurant-you will find no fondue or raclette on the menu here. What you will find is sausage, and lots of it. Our metzgete plates ($24 per person, which can be served individually or family-style) came with home-made bratwurst, liver sausage and a tumescent, Dirk Diggler-esque blood sausage, all piled high atop mountains of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and covered with slabs of slow-braised and fat-stippled pork belly. This is unapologetically artery-clogging, rib-sticking food at its best, with rich flavors in every bite. All Trestle's sausages are homemade except the blood sausage, which comes from Salumeria Beillese over on 28th Street. The reason for this exception is, according to Ralf, a simple one: 60 gallons of pig's blood isn't easy to scare up in NYC. Blood sausage really is a love-it or hate-it dish, and one that can induce squeamishness even among carnivores. Still, as our favorite food editor Nigel Slater writes in his upcoming book, Eating for England, What makes the black pudding [British blood sausage] so delectable, so deeply savoury, so toe-curlingly satisfying, is partly down to to good taste, and partly to the pleasure of knowing our respect for an animal’s life extends to the point where we refuse to let even its blood go to waste. There is something to this. And for those who love it, Trestle's sweet and ferric version did not disappoint. We found it more like a French boudin noir than a Swiss sausage, with tiny bits of pork jowl and other goodies mixed in throughout. Our only quibble was its sloppy consistency-too watery for our taste and with a tough casing that was too hard too cut-still good, but not nearly as fine as Kuettel's homemade links. The pork belly was also excellent-tender and sinfully fatty-and beautiful paired with Trestle's home-made applesauce and its bracing horseradish sauce. It also gave our mouths a needed break from forkfuls of the iron-rich liver and blood sausage nearby on the plate. At the end of the meal, assuming you can still stand, it helps to cut the fat with something light and sweet. We found the sorbet selection ($8 for three scoops) a good choice, especially the tart passion fruit and the orange sorbet, with its pleasing bits of peel inside. Diehard dessert fans who need something to chew on might fare better with the wonderful pear crisp, full of ginger and pecans. Better still as a capper to such a meal is Kuettel's own Trestle Bitter ($8 a glass), a vodka-based digestif infused with a secret combination of herbs, flowers, seeds and other botanicals. It is wonderfully sippable, with no trace of vodka's hard edges-just a minty, aromatic kick to settle your stomach and clear your palate after all that gloriously rich winter meat. Trestle on Tenth, 242 10th Avenue (at 24th Street), 212-645-5659.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1) Spending our off-hours in the kitchen trying to recreate David Chang's Ssäm Bar-licious brussels sprouts (pictured right, $11) at home. Nothing beats Chang's own version, of course, but after a few dozen late-night cravings, we decided to break out the fish sauce and sautée pans to have a crack at replicating the dish. Much to our surprise, we found that roasted, quartered brussels sprouts work just as well as pan-crisped sprouts. However, this discovery did not come without a cost: Don't even ask how stinky a kitchen gets when a fish sauce vinaigrette is added to a searing hot roasting pan. 2) Giorgio Locatelli's Observer Food podcasts. Locatelli, one of London's best Italian chefs, walks listeners through six fantastic recipes step-by-step. Our favorite, the monkfish with walnuts and capers, is a nearly identical re-creation of a spectacular dish we ate in his restaurant a few years ago. If you do decide to cook with Giorgio in your earbuds, be sure to download the iPod-enhanced photo guides with each recipe-they help enormously. 3) Our Australian Open-inspired passion fruit margarita, made in a Boston shaker with ice, passion fruit juice (3 oz.), lime juice (2 Tbsp.), lemon juice (2 Tbsp.), Grand Marnier (1 oz.), finely ground mahlab seeds (1/8 tsp.), and tequila (2 oz.). We have been using Partida Tequila in this recipe recently, especially the slightly oaky reposado variety, which we find adds a deep, almost savory dimension to the drink-perfect for a cocktail designed to remind us of summer and winter at the same time.

Dim Sum Go Go: Not Just for Breakfast Anymore

***CONTENT
 Feeling peckish after a big, boozy afternoon farewell party for a friend of ours last week, HungryMan and I started talking about a recent Chowhound thread bemoaning the lack of nighttime dim sum cart service. And as much as late-night dim sum might be a crime against authenticity, once you start talking about dim sum-especially when you have just imbibed more than your share of champagne cocktails-you cannot stop until you have eaten some. So we hopped into a cab and zipped down Bowery Street to Chatham Square, where, despite the hour, we knew we could still get a high-quality meal at Dim Sum Go Go. Only one thing was missing: the carts. Dim Sum Go Go, one of the few purely à la carte dim sum joints in Manhattan's Chinatown, has operated cart-free for years, building its reputation on its excellent food, rather than on the rolling dinner theater of its more experience-intensive cousins. For the most part, this has been a very wise move: Dim Sum Go Go is often every bit as crowded on weekend mornings as local superstars Jing Fong and Golden Unicorn, luring diners with food prepared to-order, and in the process, never leaving dishes orbiting the dining room in an endless loop. Our 10:15 p.m. orders of turnip cake and Abbot's Delight (both $3.95, or $3.25 during lunch) were just as hot and fresh as if we had snatched them from a circulating cart at our favorite dim sum restaurant, 88 Palace on a Sunday at noon. The turnip cakes were also sweeter than most we have eaten in New York-a fine contrast with the shreds of spicy lup chong sausage that flecked the interior of the cakes. Not having carts also gives Dim Sum Go Go the freedom to prepare delicate steamed dishes that often tend to wilt and go soggy in traditional dim sum service. Chief among these is pai gwut, steamed spare ribs with black bean sauce ($2.75/$3.45), a surprisingly light dish that balances the tender, gingery pork tips with the savory bite of black beans and scallions. While it is easy to put together a full meal from Dim Sum Go Go's eponymous specialty menu, a few dishes on their full dinner menu deserve attention as well. We are completely smitten with the stir-fried Chinese chives, Chinese celery, and candied walnuts ($11.95)-an entrée that features a subtle and extremely pleasant balance of aromatic flavors. We have always been instructed by our servers at Dim Sum Go Go to make sure we grab all the dish's elements in our chopsticks as we eat, and this is very sound advice, although ensuring there is a sweet walnut in the mix with the greenery will do the trick nicely. Also very solid is the spicy fat rice noodles with XO sauce and shredded shrimp, scallops, and pork ($8.95). The menu lists this dish as one that features pickled vegetables, but the shredded proteins are the real stars here. This intense, salty treat is hearty and packed with a healthy dose of zingy, peppery heat. Think of this as a cross between traditional dim sum ha chung fun (aka chow fun) and a spicy Italian papardelle. In short, exactly the kind of satisfying nosh that we tend to crave after a few drinks-and since we rarely end up in such a slightly tipsy condition in the early AM hours on weekends, it is nice to know that Dim Sum Go Go exits, no matter what time of day we need to fend off a hangover. Dim Sum Go Go, 5 East Broadway (at Chatham Square), 212-732-0797.

Chiles & Chocolate: Whack-a-Molé, If You Can Find One

***CONTENT
 Think of Oaxacan food and molé comes immediately to mind-that rich, unctuous sauce of pulverized dried chiles, sesame seeds and a bevy of fragrant spices that Mexican cuisine deploys over everything from meats and poultry to eggs. Molé oaxaqueno, a dark version made with pasilla and chilhuacle chiles and, often, chocolate, has the reputation of being like Mexico's take on Guinness ale-its color often verges on black, and it tastes so strongly that people tend to love it or loathe it. So when our good friend Dolin suggested brunch at Chiles & Chocolate, a wisp of a Oaxacan restaurant in Park Slope, I was excited to try their version of authentic Southern (Mexican)-style molé. Imagine our surprise, then, to discover that the restaurant, despite a menu that features a full complement of three distinct varieties of molé at lunch and dinner, leaves the spicy sauce out entirely at brunch. Molé with eggs is fairly common across Mexico, so it is a bit of a mystery why it's missing here. Still, with or without spicy, dark sauces, breakfast choices are numerous at Chiles & Chocolate, ranging from a sweet, Mexican-style French toast ('Oaxacan Toast', made with a sweet, brioche-style bread, eggs, cinnamon and chocolate) to omelets, eggs, and tortillas. One option, the Huevos Divorciados ('Divorced Eggs'), sounds like an inauspicious meal for a date, but turns out to be rather more tame: two fried eggs, one with green salsa and one with red. Dolin ordered the Omelet de Nopal (all breakfast items are $9), a thin, three-egg pocket hiding a ragout of cactus, epazote, sweet peppers and chiles. Too bad, then, that the exotic ingredients failed to stand out in this well-prepared, but rather unexceptional dish. If we hadn't known that this was a cactus omelet, we might have taken the ragout for a green pepper sauce. Even the epazote, a Latin American herb with licorice and parsley flavors, lost itself in the mix of other ingredients. Given their subtle tastes, we think it makes more sense to put these ingredients on top of the omelet, where the blander (and fattier) eggs cannot kill the exotic ingredients' nuances. In the end, what should have been a signature dish fell as flat as the tortillas being lifted off the tortilladora. My Torta de la Manana was a hearty layering of soft panini triangles with scrambled eggs, green chiles, rice and beans, and a choice of chorizo, ham, bacon or mushrooms. This was excellent while it remained hot, and the Oaxacan cheese provided a needed counterpoint to the heat of the chiles and the savory eggs, but because there was so much food on the plate, it cooled and quickly lost much of its vitality as the tortillas grew flaccid. Worse, the dish was unforgivably dry and practically cried out for some sauce. Molé, anyone? Two other specialties make a trip to Chiles & Chocolate worthwhile. The first is Mexican hot chocolate, which can be ordered with cinammon and almonds ($3) or laced with a pleasing hit of chipotle ($4). Portions are small, so order two if you are thirsty, especially if you go an a particularly cold day. Also worthwhile is the guacamole chapolin ($8), which can be ordered with chapolines (fried grasshoppers) for a dollar extra. This may not be everyone's cup of tea, but the little critters do provide a crunchy contrast to the smooth and creamy guac. It is fair to point out that Chiles & Chocolate is exceptionally small- the restaurant occupies a slice of 7th Avenue so narrow that it has fewer than 10 tables, including one so close to the door that customers must step around it when entering. Still, the restaurant's focus on unusual ingredients compensates a bit for the close quarters, and we do like seeing how owner Robert Lopez's mission to introduce a New York audience to Oaxacan food seems to be paying off in accolades from Park Slope locals. Just don't accidentally refer to Chiles & Chocolate as \"Mexican,\" because printed on the menu is a disclaimer that his is no Mexican restaurant. Rather, he insists, it is distinctly and proudly Oaxacan. And as long as we get a little molé at brunch, we are happy to play along. Chiles & Chocolate Oaxacan Kitchen, 54 7th Avenue (between Lincoln Place & St. John's Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn, 718-230-7700

We Give In to Mitchel London Pizza

***CONTENT
 Several months ago, immediately after Mitchel London Pizza first took over the storefront adjacent to its sister business, Burgers & Cupcakes, we started on a futile quest to eat something, anything, from the restaurant. First we stopped in during likely dinner hours, but during those initial few months, the shop seemed to be closed every night. Then, when we tried to have a pizza delivered to the Noshpad (about 12 blocks north), we learned that the restaurant only delivers from 32nd-42nd Streets-a very strange choice, given that this describes the least residential section of the neighborhood. So we made a decision to put Mitchel London Pizza on hold for a while, hoping that in the meantime, it would come to some kind of service equilibrium by the new year. So when we returned a few weeks ago, because of all of our earlier disappointments with the place, we were ready to hate it. Five pizzas and an enormous plate of antipasti later, we are happy we kept an open mind, because Mitchel London's pizza is great stuff. We kicked off our journey through the menu with a BYOB meal with our friends KT and Tigger, opting to start with a large, communal plate of antipasti ($9). Most of these dishes were salads or cooked vegetables: green beans with olive oil and mint, roasted carrots and lemon wedges, Israeli couscous, orzo and winter vegetables, and several more special selections that are offered seasonally. The only disappointing element of our huge platter of vegetables was the desiccated square of focaccia that accompanied it- far too stale to serve. Pizzas, on the other hand, were excellent nearly across the board. Baked in a dramatic gas-fired oven that lights up the entire block some evenings, each of the small pies we ordered possessed a crisp, dark crust with just a bit of char, and in every case, the pizzas were baked quickly enough to keep the sauce and toppings from soaking through the bottom crust. The Tre Colori (pictured right, $9.95), with its triple lettuce whammy, was not only the most visually arresting pie we ordered, it was also the best. We enjoyed the flavor contrasts of the sweet and bitter greens, as well as the textural complement from the chewy dough and crisp snap from the vegetables. Looking a bit like the love child of a salad and a pizza, this was a pie that left us feeling just a little virtuous as well as full. Not forgetting pizza's proper place as a pure pleasure food, we also ordered the decidedly less salubrious, sausage-and-pepper topped Romana pizza (pictured left, $9.95). This pie was every bit as good as the Tre Colori, and the combination of spicy heat and juicy, sweet red peppers reminded us of classic Italian-American carnival food, just done cleanly, with good ingredients. With the sole exception of the restaurant's too-oily, French-inspired gruyere cheese pies, we found all the pizzas at Mitchel London to be competent, crusty and well-prepared, especially the simple basil-anchovy Napolitana (pictured on Flickr, $8.95) with plenty of oozing fresh mozzarella, and the off-menu Funghi (pictured below, $8.95), with its paper-thin slices of porcini and button mushrooms. All of this said, the restaurant still suffers from a few bizarre service problems. On one visit, we were told that there were no servers whatsoever and that the manager would take care of us-which she did, reminding us five or six times that night that she absolutely, without a doubt, was not the server. Yet on another visit later that week, there she was once again, the only front-of-house employee in the place. We have also witnessed a bit of head-scratching when customers bring out bottles from the wine shop a block north of the restaurant-the staff (servers, managers...whatever) might need a bit of coaching to retrieve extra glasses and cups. The upside to this slightly hapless arrangement is that the restaurant does not charge a corkage fee-a great plus, as this is precisely the kind of pizza that pairs gorgeously with a bottle of Valpolicella or Primitivo. If the past few months of slow tinkering are any indication, Mitchel London Pizza will eventually take care of all of these issues. And once Mitchel and his management team realize that there are hordes of Hell's Kitchen residents living without good pizza north of the 42nd Street meridian, he might just turn a very tidy profit. Mitchel London Pizza, 456 Ninth Avenue (between 35th and 36th Streets), 212-563-7741.

I have passed this place on occasion and have opted not to go hear after peering at the menu and seeing greyere on the pies. Agree totally that this is a big no-no. It is fine to take liberties with pies but gyuyere?? Save it for a quiche. I like Mitchell's other joints and maybe I will go now to try the tricolore but oiut of principal, I am not sure I can bring myself to it!

I like Mitchel a lot personally, he never fails to take care of us loyal foodies. BUT I have to acknowledge that he is a *serious* curmudgeon. As a result, his staff at Fairway Cafe has always suffered from turnover and the service pretty much always sucks unless Mitchel is there to actively administer a metaphorical beating. And....that only encourages more turnover. So while his food is great (IMHO), there is rarely likely to be good service at his joints.

Our Big Seven of '07: A Retrospective
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2008-01-06 21:22:00
***CONTENT
 2007 was, in hindsight, a pretty fantastic year for nosh in the city. It has been a blast for us to write about, as well. Not only have we been lucky enough to watch our site continue to grow steadily throughout the year, we even got a chance to take our semi-anonymous show on the road with a few appearances on Martha Stewart Living Radio, ABCnews.com, and of course that now-notorious article and photograph in the Sunday Styles section of the New York Times. So to celebrate the conclusion of an eventful year, here are 2007's big standouts-both subpar and sublime. And of course, here's to an even better 2008 spent with you, our fellow hungry urban adventurer. 1. Best Coffee in Manhattan (revisited): North of Union Square, we have to call this one in favor of tiny Italian newcomer Zibetto. South of 14th Street, there's a winner on either side of the island: the Lower East Side's 9th Street Espresso pulls gorgeously strong and nutty shots, while in Tribeca, La Colombe's locally-roasted beans (all the way from Philly) make a divine cup of java. 2. Best Spot for Romance and Hamachi: Sushi Jun, with enough space inside for only about a dozen diners, might just be the best place in Gotham for a quiet date, especially when you consider that the sushi is excellent and moderately priced. And if all of that weren't enough, they make the best kinpira gobo (miso and mirin-sautéed burdock root and carrot) this side of San Francisco. 3. This Year's Most Popular Post: When we broke the story about the dearth of restaurant options on Roosevelt Island, we had no idea the post would get picked up by websites and newspapers alike. The post continues to garner several hundred hits a week, and we still get calls about RI's sad state of eating to this day. There is good news on the Roosevelt Island front though; Nonno's Foccacceria finally opened just this week as part of the private Riverwalk complex. If the island's governing body starts paying attention, perhaps they'll assist more restaurants to take over the dozen or more vacant, sub-$1,000/month retail spaces in Northtown. 4. Best Reinvention of a Baked Good: When we first met Holly DeSantis, owner and head chef at Bis.Co. Latte, in June of this year, we had no idea that within six months, she would have us so utterly addicted to her crisp biscotti that we would wind up bringing them along on every single road trip we took this year. All credit to Holly for taking an unexciting cookie and transforming it into more than two dozen different kinds of crunchy treats, all of which are worth a taste. Just as impressive is the fact that since Bis.Co.Latte's July soft opening, she has started serving an entire menu of fully homemade breakfast and lunch dishes, from farro soups and fritattas to a brilliant fig and fruit risotto. If walking to Tenth Avenue has never appealed to you, there's a very compelling (and crunchy) reason on 47th Street now. 5. Best Outer Borough Surprise: If six enterprising chefs, all natives of different parts of Italy, got together and opened a restaurant, you might imagine New York would sit up and take notice. It should. You should. But because the restaurant in question, Enoteca Maria, is run by a half-dozen grannies on Staten Island, Gothamites seem to be a little slow to recognize that one of the finest and most original restaurants in the city is a ferry ride away. Don't let that dissuade you though-these Nonnas can really cook. 6. Biggest Disappointment: Cone tease NYC Icy's giant-font announcement that their new shop on Tenth Avenue and 44th Street would be opening soon, because 'Hell has frozen over!'. Not so much with the freezing netherworld, apparently, as the store never opened, and nearly a year on, the storefront sits empty and shuttered. At least the cruel sign has been removed. 7. Best Insomniac Evening: Staying up all night to bake with the baguette crew at Amy's Bread might seem like an unusual way for two fully-employed adult men to spend a Wednesday evening/ Thursday morning, but it ended up being one of our favorite food experiences of the year. Nothing puts a labor-intensive product like artisanal bread into perspective like watching it go from flour and water to crusty loaves. We condensed the experience down into just 47 minutes, but we think you'll get as much out of it as we did. Well, without the tasty challah scraps, of course.

Zabb Queens: One Last Thai

***CONTENT
 Zabb Queens may be a tiny restaurant, but its reputation as one of the city's finest and most authentic Thai restaurants is absolutely massive. Everyone we have spoken to over the past few years who knows anything about Thai cooking in NYC, from chefs to Thai expats, names Jackson Heights's Zabb and fellow Queens outpost Sripraphai as destination eateries worth crossing a river or two to visit. And while we have become big fans of Sripraphai since coming to New York, we had, until very recently, never made the trip to Zabb. That is, until a co-owner of one of Hell's Kitchen's many Thai restaurants told us simply, \"If I want someone to remind me of home, I go to Zabb Queens. If I'm dying tomorrow, I'll eat at Zabb.\" The next night, we hopped on the E train. How could we not? We started with two of the restaurant's Esan (Isaan) specialties. HungryMan ordered the Yum Pend Yang (pictured here, $9), a spicy duck salad made with crisp green papaya matchsticks, onion, chili, plenty of heady dark duck meat, and lots of cilantro. While the dish delivered a powerful spicy kick, it also managed to retain a lazy, soft complexity that had us in awe and reaching for more. My own Som Tum with salted crab (pictured on Flickr, $7.50) was also marvelous-perhaps the finest version of this green papaya salad I have eaten anywhere. I was especially taken with the way Zabb's Som Tum delivered its savory, seafood flavors; the typical US/UK approach is to sprinkle the shredded papaya with dried shrmp, but at Zabb, the salad is mounded atop half of a brine-preserved blue crab. Not only does the tender crab meat (cooked only in the supersaturated salt solution) lend a textural contrast to the dish, but working the saline shreds of flesh out of the shell becomes an important tactile part of the salad-eating experience. Just imagine a Thai re-interpretation of a Chesapeake Bay steamed dinner, and you're halfway there. HungryMan's main dish, the Kee Mao Noodles with pork (pictured on Flickr, $7) took the classic drunken noodle concept and elevated it with very fresh and pointedly aromatic basil leaves, crunchy Chinese broccoli, and flat, wide noodles that remained satisfyingly firm throughout the meal. But the best, and messiest, thing we ate that night was my Pla Dua Pad Ped, a sautéed fried catfish dish with wedges of toothsome green eggplant, loads of lemongrass, and what felt to my lips like several generous handfuls of green and red chilis. And even with the substantial spicy heat of the dish, the flavors all stood out clearly: there was sweet and tangy, meaty and even umami. Once again, as with the salted blue crab, I had to dig in with my fingers to remove the catfish meat from the pinbones that ran like bicycle spokes throughout each slice, but this was no inconvenience at all-our server even brought extra napkins without being asked, just smiling as she set them down on the table. It was then, as I took in the range of explosive sensations from this dish, that I began to understand the high recommendation from our Thai friend. If I were doomed to shuffle off this mortal coil tomorrow, I would also want a meal like this, one with food that kicks all the senses into overdrive, just enough to make me feel truly alive. Zabb Queens, 71-28 Roosevelt Avenue (near 72nd Street), Jackson Heights, Queens, 718-426-7992.

On January 1st, A Greek Bread Has Its Day

 Eggy sweet breads are some of our favorite baked goods, and winter is their perfect season. We kicked off December with plenty of challah at every Chanukkah dinner we attended, and then worked our way through December with saffron-scented Swedish lussekatter, or Saint Lucia buns, in celebration of Christmas. And two days from now, on January 1st, we will have the Greeks to thank for another fine winter treat: vasilopita, also known as Saint Basil's bread. We bought our $10, foot-wide vasilopita from Bay Ridge Bakery, an excellent, mostly-Greek operation on Brooklyn's Fifth Avenue. Their New Year's bread is based on the same dough as its superb, everyday sweet, braided tsoureki, which looks and tastes nearly identical to a sesame-sprinkled challah. Tradition has it that the person who makes or buys the vasilopita must re-enact one of St. Basil's feats of generosity by inserting a coin into the sweet bread right before cutting into it, and in turn, the person who finds this little New Year's treasure in his or her slice is supposed to be blessed with good luck throughout the following year. If this whole ritual sounds familiar, it should: It shares the same origins as the tradtion of both hiding a bean inside a Twelfth Night pie, as well as placing a minitature toy baby inside a King Cake during Mardi Gras. No matter what holiday bread or cake you're eating though, one thing remains the same: look before you bite! Bay Ridge Bakery: Classic Patisserie, 7805 Fifth Avenue (at 78th Street), Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, 718-238-1779.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. David Kamp and Marion Rosenfeld's irreverant, tendentious, and often downright useful Food Snob's Dictionary. Really, who could resist a reference book that characterizes the raw food movement as \"bonkers\" and omakase as \"the closest gastronomical approximation of the escort-john experience.\"? We only wish they'd tackled \"foodie.\" 2. The dessert counter at Roti Boti Shaheen in Jackson Heights, most especially the fudgy pista burfi and the soft and buttery pera-both superb winter treats when paired with a glass of strong, hot tea. Best of all, all the sweets are a steal at $0.50 apiece. 3. Dim Geefay's Youtube channel. Along with her Moon Unit Zappa soundalike daughter Cathy, Dim teaches the basics of Thai cooking in an American kitchen, using widely available tools. Most importantly, she knows what she's doing. If a trip to Bangkok to learn how to make pad kee mow isn't in the cards for you, Dim's got you covered-just grab some fish sauce and a few kaffir lime leaves.

Adrienne's Pizzabar, Loved Too Much?

***DATE
2007-12-23 22:51:00
***CONTENT
 Most weekdays just before noon, a line of Wall Streeters starts to form at the door of Adrienne's Pizzabar, downtown's epicenter of square-pie pizza fanatacism. Even in wintertime, the number of people bunched up shivering inside the door is so great that the shop looks like an errant subway car from the Lexington Avenue Line; and in good weather? Well, the queue snakes so far out the door and down Stone Street that it sometimes stretches to the other restaurants in Peter Poulakakos's expanding empire: Ulysses, Harry's, Bayard's, Financier Patisserie. But in the end, all of this waiting pays off with a taste of some of the very best Sicilian pizza south of Canal Street, and dare we suggest it-possibly points beyond. Adrienne's success comes at a price, however: Tables are packed together so tightly that they must be pulled out as parties come and go; it is not uncommon to get elbowed and kicked by your neighbors during a meal; and the noise level, especially in a restaurant with so many hard surfaces, quickly reaches teeth-chattering heights. And all of this simply because Adrienne's growing clientele is loving it to death. To offset some of these problems, Adrienne's has adopted a strategy that includes an efficient, no-nonsense service staff who serve a minimalist menu of just four salads and three pizzas-this is the anti-Shopsin's. The pizzas-an 'old fashioned,' with tomato sauce, mozzarella and and parmesan cheeses; a marinara pizza studded with large pieces of garlic and tomato sauce but no cheese; and a white pizza, with ricotta and mozzarella and no red sauce-are all medium-crust, Sicilian-style square pies. All are priced at $16.50, with a range of toppings available for between $3 and $4 apiece. With more than two or three toppings, this sounds expensive, but the pizzas are designed to be shared, and even with two hungry diners on both sides of the table, they are tough to finish. So what seems at first like a pricey pie is actually one of downtown's best lunch bargains, especially given the quality of the food. On a recent visit, Candide and I ordered an 'old fashioned' pie with mushrooms, whole olives and a generous sprinkling of crumbly, sweet Italian sausage. This has, over the course of several visits to Adrienne's, become a regular lunchtime choice for me-at its best when it is very hot and just out of the oven, the 'old fashioned' is gooey and cheesy in all the right ways, with a decidedly sweet tomato sauce that works well against more savory toppings like prosciutto, pepperoni and eggplant. I have also found that it is best to eat Adrienne's pizza quickly: by the time you reach the last few slices, the pizza becomes denser, chewier, and loses almost all of its wonderful, doughy springiness. Then again, once the pizza starts to harden, it is the perfect time to start in on one of the restaurant's surprisingly good (and ample) salads. The arugula salad ($6) features baby arugula leaves mixed with diced and roasted green and yellow peppers, sun dried tomatoes, and is flavored with an addictively sweet mustard and olive oil dressing. Plus, the salad's crunch is perfect for drowning out the din from the dining room. Adrienne's does quiet down, especially at dinner, and with this downshift comes a completely different, more service-intensive menu: fresh fish, Italian-American classics like stuffed shells and eggplant parmigiana, and even a swap from square pies to round. But because the Wall Street Area is mostly deserted after six in the evening, most diners only know Adrienne's as an impossibly crowded Sicilian pizza joint. It would be easy enough to loiter around downtown for a few extra hours after work and pop in to the sundown Adrienne's to avoid the slings and arrows of a clamoring, over-popular restaurant. But with such marvelous square pies that only come out in the daytime, we'll risk a few jostles and save our private conversation for the walk back to the office. Adrienne's Pizzabar, 54 Stone Street (near Hanover Square), 212-248-3838.

I am a frequent Adrienne's visitor and would like to echo a few comments you made: firstly, don't expect anything resembling good service at this joint. While the service is neither poor nor rude, it is frequently just absent. Beverage glasses go unfilled, calls for assistance are met with deferrals and requests for any slight modifications from the menu are met with frank, yet polite, refusals. Despite a menu that lists pastas, these are no longer offered at lunch. Strictly pizza and salads. I find the salads fresh and well-dressed, not swimming in dressing like most pizza joints. The pizzas are good but, dare I say, perhaps less consistently dazzling than when Adrienne's first opened a few years ago. Occasionally crispy, sometimes soggy, usually a touch of char on the edges. Sauce is sweet, the cheese undistinctive. Yes, Adrienne's attracts large crowds of FiDi diners clutching their Crackberries as they eat. They are usually rewarded with decent pizza. However, I no longer think Adrienne's holds up to the better Napolitano pies around Manhattan and Brooklyn. And, yes, save room for a dessert at nearby Financier Patisserie.

Gin: The New Eggnog?

***CONTENT
 After attending more than our share of holiday parties so far this December, we have noticed that, when people talk about winter holiday drinks, eggnog, cocoa, apple cider and mulled wine are usually the first-and sometimes only-beverages mentioned. But we would like to make a case for the inclusion of gin on this list. And really, when you stop to think about it, how could a spirit that showcases the essence of juniper berries not feature on a list of drinks to be sipped when the city is decked out in snow and evergreen trees? If you don't know much about gin, here is the one-sentence summary: Gin is a high-alcohol spirit (40-60% alcohol) that has been infused with botanical flavorings ranging from clove to fennel to the most common: juniper. Because there is such a wide variety of infused flavors among gins, every one is different. This week, we got a chance to run a wintertime gin face-off between two small-batch gin formulations: Hendrick's, from Scotland, and Bluecoat, distilled less than a hundred miles away from here in Philadelphia. Hendrick's has gained some notoriety in the past few years, partly for its unusual, apothecary bottle packaging, but mostly for the high quality, unusual botanicals it contains-rose petals and cucumber are the oddest of the lot. On the other hand, Bluecoat, with its blue Jolly Rancher-esque bottle, is a more traditional-style dry gin that has built a reputation around Philly and, until just a few months ago, was not available outside of the Delaware Valley. For our tasting, we sampled both gins in three preparations: (1) a Santa Cohen, a fruit-based cocktail we created for last year's holiday season; (2) a dry gin martini, made with 1/8 teaspoon dry Noilly Prat vermouth; and (3) neat (i.e. nothing added). Our tasting notes follow in the table below: Hendrick’s Bluecoat Mixed drink with fruit base subtle, almost minty, integrates with fruit, very smooth clear juniper high-note, stark, buttery and smoky finish Dry martini flavor profile like an anisette martini, soft, clear floral tones classic martini flavor profile, smoky finish again, sinus-expanding aromatics Neat caraway, cucumber comes through here, a bit like very strong Pimm's Cup pine, flamed citrus peel, cool, regardless of drink temperature In the end, we appreciated both Hendrick's and Bluecoat, but for very different purposes. If a classic juniper-citrus gin is what you're after, Bluecoat is the clear choice-and we especially loved its undercurrent of smoke and butter. For mixed drinks where a strong gin flavor is not as desirable, Hendrick's is the winner-its soft complexity works very well with mixers. We also recommend Hendrick's as a great gin to serve to people who might be unsure of how they feel about the spirit. We loved both martinis, but they did taste quite a bit like two very different drinks. Bluecoat announced itself as a gin martini from the second it touched the tongue, whereas Hendrick's took its time, hinting at aromas more common to yellow Chartreuse. Our bottom line is this: Bluecoat is a citrusy gin-lover's gin that makes a fantastic martini, while Hendrick's is our choice for mixed drinks for a crowd that might be scared off at the mention of the word \"gin,\" no matter how seasonal it may be.

Awesome! One of my best friends husband is one of the investors in Bluecoat Gin (we're all originally from the Delaware Valley) and every time they come over for dinner he brings us a bottle. They all drink it neat and I have to say, it's pretty damn good! Love your site, btw. amy @ neverfull.wordpress.com

Bocca di Bacco: For Want of a Mouth, the Pasta Was Lost

 When Roberto Passon opened his eponymous restaurant in 2005, local food lovers credited him with raising the bar for Italian food in Hell’s Kitchen. Nearly every Italian restaurant that has opened since then has debuted in a more competitive market, and as a result, has been substantially better than everything else that came before. Il Melograno, with its very solid, rustic cooking, is a great example of one the nabe’s new players-good enough to take on a gang of stagnant Pietrasantas, Amarones, and even Cascinas without breaking a sweat. This is why, when news of RP’s forthcoming wine and Italian tapas restaurant, Bocca di Bacco, broke, people west of Eighth Avenue were understandably excited. Bocca underwent a few identity shifts early on: First it was a wine bar, then a tapas bar, and then a full restaurant. Today, it is a combination of all three, with a thirty-foot stainless steel Enomatic towering over the front bar, two long bar tables with stools immediately behind, and then a full dining room towards the rear of the open-plan space. It is hard not to love the rustic, wood-beam aesthetic-and it feels jarringly refreshing to see an interior not designed and kitted out by AvroKO, especially when it ends up looking this good. (With one glaring exception: the tacky mouth of Bacchus mounted on the restaurant's rear wall that looks like it was chosen by Carmella Soprano.) Bocca di Bacco's menu is based loosely on the cuisine of the Veneto region of northern Italy, but the restaurant is not exclusively Venetian-Sicilian bottarga makes an appearance on the menu, as do tropical mangos and luganega, a traditional sausage from nearby Trentino. Since the restaurant opened this October, HungryMan and I have worked our way through the menu and have come to one simple conclusion: Passon's food would be marvelous if his staff (and he) would get serious about tasting what they cook. And by serious, I mean that every single dish the kitchen preps needs to be checked and re-tasted for every service, as many of the problems we found could have been avoided with one tool: a spoon. The restaurant's bresaola and pear salad (pictured top, $14) is a great example-much of the beef's rich flavor was drowned out under a mouth-puckering sauce made with far too much balsamic vinegar. This same sauce also did no favors for the overripe bosc pear slices. The sardines in vinegar with golden raisins and onions (pictured above, $10) were also far too acidic and could have benefited from an inversion of the onion:pine nut ratio. Just a little bit of crunch could have dramatically improved this dish. The octopus salad (not pictured) is another good example of where a thoughtful tasting might have made a mediocre dish sing: here, a generous portion of crisp, grilled octopus hinted at greatness when eaten with one of the four or five tiny cubes of tomato on the plate. And sadly, without the tomatoes' sweet-tart flavors, the octopus hit a bland, flat note and quickly lost its appeal. Pastas and mains were no different: the homemade taglierini with zucchini and smoked salmon (not pictured, $14) disappointed because it was a bit greasy and badly undersalted-most likely because of the inclusion of smoked salmon in the dish. The grilled branzino (pictured left, $20) suffered from precisely the same faults as the taglierini and was consequently just barely passable, despite its soft, well-grilled flesh and tender roasted potatoes. Worst of all the dishes we have eaten at Bocca di Bacco, however, was the spaghetti bottarga (pictured above, $16), the truest emblem of what happens when dishes are not tasted. Here, the bitter sautéed broccoli rabe dominated the entire dish, utterly burying the taste of the rich and saline bottarga. We adore broccoli rabe, but if it is used in a dish with more subtle ingredients-and nearly all ingredients fit that bill-it has to be used sparingly. Yet, as much of a complete turn-off this spaghetti was, I can imagine it working beautifully with 10% of the broccoli rabe worked into the pasta. But making those kinds of adjustments requires plenty of tasting and sampling-something a restaurant named after a god's mouth ought to know. Bocca di Bacco, 828 Ninth Avenue (at 54th Street), 212-265-8828.

I ate here once. I had the roast chicken, which was served with nothing else - no veggies - nada. Which was weird and made me want to re-read the menu. Service was poor - with plenty of servers, but no particular organization. Also - the stools are too high for the long tables - so you tower over your plate. They have some kinks to work out - but the place has potential. But - as it was not particularly impressive, and there are a plethora of excellent eateries in HK - I don't have any inclinaiton to return.

I ate here last night. I was not crazy about the funghi bruschetta which was more like a thick sicillian slice of mushroom pizza. I was expecting more like a bruschetta toast. However both our pastas were very good. We had the one with ossobusco sauce which was fantastic, soft meat, wonderful flavor and I really enjoyed it. The other was with creamy gorgonzola sauce, peas and bacon, and walnuts I think. I had a taste and thought it was fine, a little too rich for me. My friend loved it. So hopefully improvement since you last went, but I am very happy that we went and will be back. Huge portions, half my pasta came home with me. Tartufo for dessert was only OK.

Christopher Norman Chocolates: Bringing Cherry Back for the Holidays

 Chocolate covered cherries were, for many of my childhood years, a holiday tradition of the worst kind-the kind I could never refuse. After downing one too many of my parents' favorite confections one year long ago, I swore them off forever. And until this month, I kept that vow. But Christopher Norman Chocolates tempted me back with their tart and jammy bittersweet chocolate Amarene cherries ($40 for an 8 ounce box). I absolutely adore these little marble-sized chocolate delights for their purity: they consist of little more than wild Italian cherries and a high-cocoa couverture. But what really won me over was how they showcase the fruit's natural flavor, especially a striking tang that instantly made me forget the cloying sweetness of any store-bought chocolate covered cherry I have ever eaten. No doubt these candies are pricey, but when the results are good enough to win over a confirmed chocolate cherry-phobe, it is hard to argue that they aren't worth every penny. Slightly more indulgent and every bit as luscious are Christopher Norman's chocolate buttercream, Poire William-infused gianduja truffles ($24 for a box of six large pear candies). With streaks of chocolate that resemble Spirograph art and a fluffy, intensely aromatic pear filling, this is what to bring as a host gift to that holiday party on your schedule. We have already laid in a supply of both the pears and the cherries to give as emergency holiday gifts, but quite honestly, I am secretly hoping that our friends get a little Grinchy this season so that I'll be able to keep a few boxes for myself.

I am lucky enough to work barely 50 meters from Christopher Norman Chocolates. I invent special occasions to visit their store, sample some seasonal specialties and bring home a box for the wife. This place is one of NYC's hidden gems. They feature an open kitchen, a rotation of seasonal flavors and reasonable prices. New St. is a small alley, difficult to find, but why not pay a visit to the Museum of the American Indian and then to Christopher Norman's?

Empire Diner is Out of This World, And Not in A Good Way

 With its chrome exterior and flashing lights, Chelsea's Empire Diner looks a bit like a spaceship that has landed on 22nd Street. A classic art deco Fodero diner, the Empire has been around since the 193os, and if its eerie lightshow weren't enough, the restaurant is also distinguishable from its neighbors on Tenth Avenue by the stylized Empire State Building sprouting from its prow. That model skyscraper presides over a restaurant with a lot of things going for it, like its location: perfect for West Chelsea clubbers, not to mention drag queens from the nearby bars. Empire Diner also has convenient hours (it's open 24-7), outdoor tables in warm weather, and upscale touches like candlelit tables and even a pianist on some evenings. In many ways, Empire seems completely unlike a typical 21st century diner, and it is easy to see how, for deco-era architecture buffs and bygone-age New York nostalgics, the Empire might jolt memories of a more hopeful, if not more innocent city. Unfortunately, for each of Empire's strong points, there is an equally important downside. Those clubbers sometimes invade the small space and suffocate the little restaurant with the odor of Polo for Men, the pianist seems to know little else other than the campiest of camp classics (fine for a John Waters soundtrack, but a little much for a long dinner), and those outdoor tables are made from the cheapest white plastic and buckle if you even think about tipping your chair in any direction. Even the classic art deco dining car ambiance often seems incongruous with the restaurant's schizo menu consisting of equal parts short-order grub and modern dishes like sesame noodles and tofu fajitas. Problems like these beg a question: is the diner trying too hard to be all things to all people? To get an answer, we visited Empire Diner last weekend with HungryMom in tow. Having visited Empire Diner a few times before in recent years, we went expecting decent traditional diner food: salads, all-day breakfasts, sandwiches and burgers; and perhaps somewhat lackluster fusion cooking. But what we got was indifferent food and lazy service all around. Case in point: A salad of apples, brie and mesclun leaves ($9) was dressed with what tasted like pure, unadulterated canola oil- no acid whatsoever to balance the oleaginous texture, nothing at all to give the dressing any sort of flavor. All that could be said about this topping was that it lubricated the mesclun beautifully. While a layer of chopped walnuts provided a pleasing crunch and a sprinkling of poppy seeds made this salad slightly different from the apple brie salads at countless other restaurants, nothing could make up for the dressing; this was a salad brought to a premature and oily demise. Omelets had their own problems: ours, with walnuts, avocado and goat cheese ($11 for two fillings, $2 for each additional), should have played off a balance of flavors, each with a unique mouthfeel-at once crumbly, crunchy and creamy. Instead, it was disappointing in its total blandness. Worse still, the walnuts tasted as if they had gone rancid. In the end, the combination of dull (and stale-tasting) ingredients, under a layer of slightly overdone eggs, made the omelet nearly inedible. The only winning dish we tried at Empire was the fried clam po' boy ($10), one of Empire Diner's 'Hedonist Sandwich' specials, which vary from lamb burgers to grilled steak sandwiches, but which are always of the large, supercaloric variety. Despite a few slices of wan tomato and a nearly stale bun, the combination of crispy fried clams and creamy tartar sauce was a successful one, despite itself. The clams were not delicately fried-the breading was especially thick in places-but somehow, by some miracle of batter and brine, it all seemed to work. Sadly, the Hedonist was, by far, the best thing we experienced at Empire Diner. As if to add insult to the mostly injurious cooking, the service we received was among the worst we have experienced all year. Though we were one of only two parties in the restaurant that night, we waited more than 15 minutes for the waiter to take our order, and even longer for our empty plates to be bussed. Our server was clearly more interested in the book he was reading by the counter throughout our meal than in delivering food, refilling water glasses, or even in checking to see if he had missed something from our order, like HungryMom's hot chocolate (which he did, twice). Our favorite interaction-if it can be called that-is when we signalled to him from our Siberian booth that we'd like our check, which he delivered, head turned 120 degrees away from us the entire time, in mid-sentence with his colleagues across the dining room. Had this been a geisha bar in Tokyo, we could have understood the lack of eye contact, but this is Chelsea, where even the drag queens look you in the face. HungryMom suggested that perhaps our waiter was one of the Empire Diner aliens, here in his deco spaceship to learn our strange Earth customs and bring them back to his people in a galaxy far away. When asked where he might hail from, she took one look at the dirty plates left behind on our table and quickly shot back, \"Planet Attitude.\" Indeed. Empire Diner, 210 Tenth Avenue (at 22nd Street), 212-243-2736.

After reading this review the restaurant sounds like it is from one of \"Gordon Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares\" My favorite line was about the rancid Walnuts! I would stay away from anything with clams - if the walnuts are bad the clams must be downright bloody moldy.

I work in the area & have been to Empire diner a handful of times. I agree that the service is indifferent, & in my experience down-right rude. I have been yelled at for requesting a booth for one on a slow, late, half-empty weekday afternoon while I could plainly see a booth with only one person. The food, for me, is no better than any other diner, yet at twice the price.

Thanks for saving me a trip to the Empire. I'm heading to the city this weekend and was thinking that perhaps I should try the place out, but now I think I'll hold off. As they say, too much food, too little time, so why waste it on a subpar place?

Bánh Mì Saigon Bakery Stumbles on Mott Street
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2007-12-09 22:42:00
***CONTENT
 Long one of the city's best-known bánh mì shops, Bánh Mì Saigon Bakery (fondly referred to by many simply as 'Saigon' or 'BSMB') is an object lesson in hedging bets, retail-style. The rear of the Mott Street shop is taken up by its deli sandwich business, with all the coolers and cutting boards you might expect, while the front of the shop is dominated by a glass-bead jewelry shop. Disregard what the awning says about this being a bakery-the necklaces and bracelets eat up 75% of the store's interior. But really, Saigon's split personality has always been part of its charm-even when the bakery occupied far dingier digs off East Broadway back in the 1990s, the assortment of non-foods on the shelves made the often miserably lengthy wait for a sandwich almost tolerable. Of course, the real allure has always been the sandwiches-and if it can be said that one shop really seduced New Yorkers with pork and paté baguettes, it is Saigon. Our most recent few visits to BMSB have been disturbing, however. This summer, in a bid to win a British friend over to the charms of bánh mì, we took her to Saigon, where we ate three blandly average classic bánh mì sandwiches ($3.25)-even the 'very spicy' sandwich tasted more of bread than anything else. Another visit last month confirmed our suspicions that something was awry on Mott Street, so HungryMan and I headed to Saigon this week to take some photos and attempt to get to the bottom of what might be the gravest fall from culinary grace south of Houston Street. We started with the traditional pork bánh mì ($3.25), a sandwich loaded with chopped roast pork, julienned daikon and carrot, cilantro, and cucumber. Far too much cucumber-chopped into thumb-wide wedges, we found enough cucumber on a single sandwich to reconstitute half a cuke. In a salad, so much cucumber might even be an advantage, but in a sandwich, so much of the watery, tough-skinned vegetable made biting the already overstuffed sandwich a real challenge. BMSB hasn't always jammed so much poorly chopped cucumber into their sandwiches-this seems to be a recent trend-and an unfortunate one. Their normally vinegary daikon/carrot mixture also seems to have lost much of its old kick in the past few months. On both of our sandwiches (and every one we have eaten at Saigon since June), the julienned mixture was bland and sometimes even a little limp. All told, the BMSB classic bánh mì seems to have become a shadow of its former self. The vegetarian 'Buddhist' bánh mì chay ($3.95) also left us scratching our heads. This is a sandwich that, when it was introduced about a year ago, was one of our favorite vegetarian meals in the city. Rather than replace pork with meat substitutes, BMSB created a sandwich with its own raison d'etre, filling it with savory, soft braised mushrooms and tofu. At its best, the sandwich reminded us of the experience of dipping crusty bread into the leftover juices from a hearty mushroom stew. Yet once again, something has gone horribly wrong in the past few months, leaving the veggie-friendly sandwich we ate there last week with the dubious distinction of being the only bánh mì sandwich we have ever thrown into the garbage. Ours was once again jammed to the hilt with too much cucumber and then waterlogged with a ladling of the now bland, loose, and gruel-like mushroom mixture. Once a fine sandwich in its own right, this vegetarian option today tastes like nothing more than wet bread and salt. It would be a real shame to see BMSB disappear due to such sloppy, careless cooking-and really, we have no doubt that the business is capable of righting its own ship with a little more attention to quality control and perhaps a taste of what they make before serving it to customers. Then again, Bánh Mì Saigon Bakery is covered; if the sandwich business goes down the tubes, that just means more space for bracelets and baubles. Bánh Mì Saigon Bakery, 138 Mott Street (between Hester and Grand Streets), 212-941-1541.

Hi Nicole, Yes. We think the best bánh mì in the city is at Ba Xuyen in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. There's also Viet Bánh Mì So No 1 very close to Saigon, and these days, it beats Saigon-not always the case! We've written about both places on the site, so do a search for Vietnamese and you'll find them both.

I'd second the recommendation of Banh Mi So No 1. It's always been my fave in that area. Bakery was good, the BBQ meat was the real star, but there's something I always liked the ratio of ingredients at No 1 more, and the place is a nicer visit since they fixed it up.

One more thing! If you're in the nabe anyway, check out Despana the Spanish market a few blocks west of No 1 -- it's got great Spanish sandwiches, and lots of Spanish specialties to sample like Iberian ham and such!

I haven't gotten a banh mi at Saigon Bakery recently, I'll have to check it out. Do you know what happened? Change of ownership perhaps? Paris Bakery: I don't really recommend this place. The banh mi is small, they don't use the same juicy stewed pork. In fact, I'd say it's a different kind of banh mi all together.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Nigella Lawson's enchanting new cookbook, Nigella Express: 130 Recipes for Good Food, Fast, despite what the Times may have said. The recipes are fantastic, and the tone and pacing are pure caution-to-the-wind Nigella. It's the sort of cookbook that makes you wonder how food television might have turned out differently, had it been published ten years ago, in a pre-Rachael Ray America. 2. Sushi Jun's extraordinary aji-nambazuke special, a single, lightly battered and fried Pacific Spanish Mackerel (in season right now), served whole and drizzled with a zesty soy-rice vinegar dressing. For $5.00, this is one of the best seafood bargains in the city right now. And it won't last. 3. What might be the world's most perfect holiday office gift, Lambertz's 1 Meter Dominos, available at Food Emporium for $16.99 (and on sale at some locations this week for $9.99). The meter-long box of German confectionery contains 100 chocolate covered triple-decker cubes of soft, spicy gingerbread, apple jelly, and parzipan-a delicate cousin of marzipan made from apricot kernels instead of almonds. Yes, you might struggle a bit to get the box on the subway, but once your co-workers crack it open, you'll be glad you did.

Buffets and The Big Apple: A Mismatch Made in 718

***CONTENT
 Cultural trends, from art to food, are among New York City's biggest exports. Call it stubbornness, superiority, or just ignorance, but this economy of ideas tends to flow in just one direction, leaving Gotham completely oblivious to what much of the rest of the nation is smitten with: mega-churches, outlet malls, even Nascar. Keep in mind that ours is a city that only got around to accepting its first big-box retailers a matter of months ago. Another late 90s/early 2000s suburban trope that has mostly passed NYC by is the reinvention of the all-you-can-eat buffet restaurant-a modern day marvel where whole families can unload their SUVs and stuff themselves silly for under $30. New Yorkers love their by-the-pound steam tables, but buffets take grazing and amp it up by at least an order of magnitude. Some buffets specialize in soup or salad, like the market sector's heavyweights, Sweet Tomatoes and Souplantation. Then there are mammoth, one-of-a-kind buffets like Shady Maple Smorgasbord in Lancaster, PA and and the beef-heavy Ryan's. But perhaps the country's largest chain is Old Country Buffet, with over 500 locations around the country, including a solitary one, rebranded 'Hometown Buffet,' located on Forest Avenue, Staten Island-well within the boundaries of NYC. Apart from the dismal Todai (formerly Minado), Hometown Buffet might just be the closest we ever get to sharing the rest of the country's passion for eating at the strip mall food trough. Curious eaters that we are, we paid Hometown a visit, along with friends Pescatore and Schnicksy, and their two children, Sleeping Beauty (age 5) and Tom Thumb (age 3). In a way, our trip was prompted by Sleeping Beauty, who, thanks to her grandmother, became an Old Country Buffet regular this summer in Virginia. Upon her return to the Lower East Side, the buffet was all she could talk about. 'It was the best place ever!,' she cried, turning up her nose at the Essex Street Market, Sugar Sweet Sunshine, and...well, portion control in general. With Sleeping Beauty in the lead and her slightly disturbed parents in tow, we all headed out to Staten Island. Writing about a place like Hometown Buffet demands an open mind in the way that few other restaurants in the city do-it is far too easy to point to the long counters of fried food and sugary desserts, roll your eyes, and declare the place the epicenter of the city's diabetes problem. The reality of the situation is a little more complicated, and while there are some real problems with the food (more on this later), there are also a couple of things that Hometown Buffet gets right. Among them: It's cheap. Lunch at Hometown Buffet costs an adult only $8.19. Children-a major demographic, if our visit was any indication-pay only $0.60 for each of their years. Our three-year-old ate for $1.80, and our five-year-old buffet devotee, on whom Hometown Buffet clearly lost money, ate for $3.00. It's Easy. Choose any table you see. Go back to the buffet as many times as you want. What the hell, even have dessert first, if the mood strikes you. With no service of any sort, the buffet starts to feel a bit like your own self-serve apartment kitchen. There is also no menu to pore through-if Hometown serves it, it's out on the line, in full view. It's Communal. Everyone eats here. Black and white, young and old (and yes, buffet restaurants are particularly popular among retirees), this is the kind of restaurant where you eat among your neighbors, not just alongside the subset with expense accounts. It's Kid-Friendly. The prices help here, and so does the selection at the buffet. Even the pickiest child is likely to find something enticing among the dozens of dishes. And as a bonus: eating at a buffet strikes a chord of familiarity with the cafeteria-dining demographic. As for the quality of what you and your kids end up putting into your own mouth: it could be worse. It is possible, despite all our expectations, to put together a healthy meal at the buffet. There is plenty of fresh fruit on offer, as well as a clean salad bar with more than nutrient-free iceberg lettuce, as well as lots of choice between sauced and unsauced vegetables. Our biggest finds were the beta-carotene rich baked butternut squash and a baked fish dish that, while on the dry side, had a lemon and pepper seasoning that, feeling charitable, Pescatore pronounced 'beguiling.' Unfortunately, such dishes were the rarest of exceptions. My own plate of 'hand-battered' fried chicken, mashed potatoes and cornbread stuffing was representative of the buffet's most popular offerings. The chicken yielded little in the way of white meat, but was nonetheless enjoyable, if only for its savory, crispy skin. Both Schnicksy and I remarked on the cloying sweetness of the cornbread stuffing, and the mashed potatoes possessed that ineffable, insitutional flavor that lets you know they were probably made in a bucket. Our whole table was also fascinated by the mini-corn dogs, small pockets of fried cornmeal dough with a single bite of hot dog in the center. After a few minutes on the warming table, they lost what little allure they might have had when they were scooped from their cooking oil. We picked and nibbled, and were never really tempted to gorge ourselves as watched as the two children revel in the experience, especially the soft-serve ice cream station. For them, there was something magical about Hometown Buffet's bounty, and in the end, there is nothing wrong with showing them that...once in a while. Just feed them a carrot or two before you hop on the ferry. Hometown Buffet, 1501 Forest Avenue (near Travis Avenue), Staten Island, 718-815-7666.

Community through Cheese at Casellula

 Nowhere else in Hell's Kitchen-or in all of Midtown, for that matter-can you find a menu that captions its offerings with terse, italicized adjectives like, \"Grassy. Popcorny,\" and \"Firm. Mustardy,\" or our favorite, \"Herbaceous. Hay-ey.\" But Casellula is in the business of breaking new ground in bringing casual cheese-tasting to the masses, so a few neologisms here and there are perfectly in order. The café, which takes its culinary cues from resident fromager Tia Keenan, seems, with its exposed brick walls and floor-to-ceiling glass windows, to be a postmodern, alternate-reality reinterpretation of what Starbucks might look like if it served artisanal cheese and unoaked chardonnay instead of cinnamon chip scones and frappucinos. Inside, you'll find what seems to be a home away from home for curd-lovers: many patrons seem to know one another, clinking glasses comfortably across tables, and everyone it seems, knows something about the gentle art of affinage. In every respect, Casellula appears to be a genuine Third Place for cheese lovers. To be honest, this can also make a first visit a little bit daunting, even if you know your rennet from your thistle. Casellula's cheese menu, a list that runs 45-deep, takes a little courage to navigate. The waitstaff at Casellula, for all of their expertise on the subject of curds and whey, do assume that diners have a bit of advance knowledge. \"Do you prefer cow, goat, or sheep?\" is one common opening query we have heard several times during our visits to Casellula, and it can be a loaded question-many patrons don't really know how to answer, so they guess. Fair enough. A better answer, and one that nearly everyone without an affineur's palate ought to try is this: \"Suggest something I might like,\" or better yet, \"What do you think would pair well with my wine selection?\" The ideal solution would be a larger list of pre-selected flights-Casellula has only four flights on the menu now. On a previous visit, we tasted the 'Lady Sings the Blues' sampler, loaded with piquant, moldy cheeses, each served with its own unique accompaniment. We think the pre-fab approach works well for both beginning and more expert cheeseheads, alike, and we'd like to see Casellula include more of these user-friendly options on the menu. However, this week, HungryMom, HungryMan, and I returned to do a little pick-and-mix of our own, opting to taste five cheeses (at $5 apiece), with an emphasis on bolder flavors. From mildest to wildest, running back to front, they are shown in the image above: Mille Trous D'Ariege (French, cow and goat), Försterkäse Krümmenswil (Swiss, cow), Romy (Egyptian, sheep), Le Sousbois (Swiss, cow), and Jasper Hill Farm Bayley Hazen (American, cow). As promised, all came with their own accompaniments, some of which lent a marvelous new dimension to the taste of the cheese they were paired with. Our favorite was the pickled green beans in the runny Sousbois cheese-it brought out the acidic taste in a cheese so gooey and fatty that it could have easily been a palate killer. The dark chocolate buttons served with our Bayley Hazen blue cheese were also an inspired choice, as the bitterness of the cocoa revealed a sweetness underneath the cheese's sharp bite. Less successful was the rose jam offered alongside the Mille Trous D'Ariege; its overwhelmingly cloying floral tones made the cheese turn bland and limp in the mouth, tasting more like a softened bar of something from the Roger et Gallet range. But this off-note was an aberration. In general, Casellula matches its cheeses to garnishes adeptly. The café's short snacks menu is also very well constructed. On previous visits, we have eaten and enjoyed the raucously-named 'Pig's Ass Sandwich' ($12), a modified version of a pork sandwich like the one you might find at Margon, piled high with Fiscalini cheddar, pickles, and of course, pork butt. This time around though, we shared the Happy Waitress ($18, for two), a deconstructed diner sandwich made with salad greens, savory croutons, crisp bacon shards, and a small wheel of hot, melting grilled Camembert floating on a lagoon of tomato coulis. Even shared among three people, this salad proved to be quite filling, especially eaten with a flight of cheeses. Yet with a bottle of very decent New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc open on our table, we ate just the right amount of food to keep us from getting tipsy. This is easier said than done, especially when the cheese courses are rather small. If cheese alone is your speed, we recommend wines by the glass-Casellula has several excellent ones. Otherwise, eat something a bit more hearty as you sip; you'll remember more, and if what we have seen holds true, you will be sober enough that you might even make a new cheese-loving friend at another table, someone to meet up with for something rindy when you return. Casellula, 401 West 52nd Street (at Ninth Avenue), 212-247-8137.

I have been to Caselula a few times and have found the cheeses delightful and the wines super good. Not so good is the poor ventilation, smell of burning cooking oil that pervades the restaurant and the overly dressed salads. Perhaps they got that taken care of? The miso mustard pickles are some of the best pickles I have ever had!

Rice Noodles and Power Chords: Bún Soho

 Not too long ago, hair gel and frilly shirts ruled this town. Back then, in the supersaturated neon years of the 1980s, you couldn't walk a block without running into a pop star-Madonna in the East Village, Red Hot Chili Pepper Anthony Keidis on the streets of Chelsea, and Howard Jones in front of his subterranean (and surprisingly good) West Village vegetarian eatery, Nowhere. Twenty years later, it seems like old times again with Duran Duran taking over 47th Street (and later 54th Street, after the stagehand strike displaced several of its gigs) not to mention ex-Duran guitarist Warren Cuccurullo teaming up with Michael Bao (Huynh) on a more permanent NYC installation: Bún Soho. The slick new small-plates restaurant seems much more Bao than Bow Wow Wow-so much so that it is unclear what Cuccurullo's involvement in the venture is, exactly. And judging from the distinctly not-safe-for-work Google hits his name brings up, this is probably a very good thing. Because Michael Bao's influence dominates, the menu is heavy on authentic South Asian preparations and spicing, an approach that works well. But the real proof is in the crowds: since its opening, the restaurant has become so popular that we are starting to think that bún-Vietnamese rice noodles-is on its way to becoming 2008's new culinary catchphrase in much the same way that, thanks to a few popular local eateries, gnudi and omakase recently steamrolled their way into the Big Apple's food lexicon. Bún's eponymous specialty is certainly worthy of such popular attention. Whether served Mekong style with flaked crab meat in pho broth (pictured left, $10), piled high with strips of seared pork belly and grilled shrimp (pictured right, $10), or rolled into a savory fresh roll of duck meat and lettuce leaves (pictured on Flickr, $6), we found each serving of bún we ate to be both slightly firm and tender-enough to make for perfect slurping, which, as in any Asian noodle situation, is de rigeur. Grilled dishes were also generally excellent, especially the sizzling cast iron pan of cuttlefish (pictured below, $12) tentacles we sampled-so fresh that it bore only a hint of the creature's signature, sometimes overwhelmingly intense muskiness. Paired with a 'salsa verde' made with plenty of aromatic, sharp and basilic rau rum, Michael Bao's version is probably the best cuttlefish we have eaten in New York. His poultry isn't too shabby either, especially the nem-grilled meatballs that are quite a bit like larger, rounder Japanese tsukune-of duck meat and foie gras (pictured on Flickr, $12). Not everything on the menu at Bún Soho is a success, however. The tiny fillet of crisp, pan-fried bass served atop a purée of parsnips and coconut milk (pictured on Flickr, $12) we ordered was completely undone by its drippingly greasy skin and gritty chanterelles. However, this was the only dish we did not finish. We also found service to be hit-or-miss. Hosts have not yet figured out the admittedly complex calculus required to estimate wait-times for guests without reservations: We were told 15 minutes, 20 minutes, 40 minutes, an hour, and then 35 minutes at various stages of our lengthy visit to the bar. In the end, none of these were correct; we waited 75 minutes. The simple solution to avoid this guessing game is to book a table in advance, a move that might appear out of step with the vibrant and spontaneous vibe of today's Soho-but unless you're a well-connected Top 40 alum of the 1980s, it's a necessary (and small) concession. Bún Soho, 143 Grand Street (at Lafayette Street), 212-431-7999.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. The seasonal glut of fresh cranberries in nearly every market in town. You already know how much we adore fresh cranberry sauce, but this year, we have been tweaking our traditional recipe, adding some Asian oomph to it with a few bruised kaffir lime leaves and a teaspoon of crushed, fresh ginger. It is fantastic over turkey, a seared pork tenderloin, or even on its own. 2. Cooking Mama 2: Dinner with Friends for the Nintendo DS. Not only does the game teach some obscure Japanese cooking techniques-ever made tokoroten from scratch before?-it is also an absolute riot for both adults and kids to play. The best part though is Mama's cringeworthy pigeon English that just begs to be turned into a ringtone, stat! 3. Halabi Gazala's extraordinarily tender, fresh-baked Israeli Druse-style pita bread. Walk past her restaurant, Gazala's Place, at 709 Ninth Avenue in Hell's Kitchen just prior to the lunch or dinner rush, and you're likely to see her in the shop's plate glass window, patting and rolling out pitas, then sliding them into the restaurant's kiln of an oven. Tear one of the thin rounds apart, dunk it in the restaurant's excellent tahini or hommus, and you might just forget all about turkey for a few hours.

A (Borrowed) Pie of One's Own

***CONTENT
 Anyone who has tried baking a Thanksgiving pie from scratch knows that making a decent pie crust is a real accomplishment. Everyone has their stories of failure-our worst involves a misprinted crust recipe from the first edition of Baking Illustrated that ignited a raging ovenside argument. That particular November battle led to tears, a fit of stressed-out dough throwing, and a vitriolic letter to Christopher Kimball (sorry, Chris!), which in turn led to a quick correction to future editions of the cookbook. Despite all the dangers, we return to our food processor every year for another round of pie-making-all because, in the end, a fresh, homemade pumpkin pie is an unbeatable holiday treat. Not to mention the inescapable fact that, even after sampling pies from bakeries across Manhattan and Brooklyn, we have never found a pie that did not taste conspicuously boxed. That is, until last week, when we got a chance to nosh on Belli's maple pumpkin pie ($20) with pecan brittle and vanilla bean whipped cream. Belli is owned and operated by Roberto and Monica Bellissimo. Monica's name might be familiar from her stint as pastry chef at David Burke & Donatella and Jovia. Her experience is obvious from the very first taste of her pie; biting into the flaky, short crust, I recognized the pastry instantly as double-baked, not to mention so fresh that I could almost hear the oven closing in my mind's eye as I chewed. The filling, a seductive custard of organic pumpkin, eggs, cream and maple syrup, was spiced traditionally (ginger, cinnamon, nutmeg, mace) with just a hint of black pepper that gave the pumpkin a zippy aromatic flavor. Better still, the high-note aromas and tastes were echoed again in the quenelles of whipped vanilla cream topping the pie. Despite our skepticism about the pecan brittle, we ended up loving the crunch it contributed to the pie-we could even envision a version of the pie covered completely with broken shards of the caramelized confection. For now though, Belli offers six other varieties of Thanksgiving pies, all priced between $20-25, each of which can be hand-delivered anywhere in New York City for $5 with two days lead time. So if you predict a hoilday tantrum on the horizon, you still have one day left to reserve a pie-one good enough to claim as your own. Belli, 543 Clinton Street (at Clinton & Nelson Streets), Brooklyn, 646-701-7047.

Bitching, Baking, and Tastemaking: The United States of Arugula

 When David Kamp's The United States of Arugula was released in paperback, we knew we couldn't review it objectively-after all, we had already sent copies of the book to several of our friends around the world. Rather than show our bias, we tapped our regular correspondent Doughboy and asked him to take a fresh look at the book. To nobody's surprise, he loved it (see below). And after a quick e-mail to the folks at Doubleday, we have several copies of Arugula to give away to you, too. If you would like a paperback copy of the book, send us an e-mail at nycnosh@gmail.com and tell about your favorite lesser-known NYC restaurant gem that we have not yet reviewed. Winners (chosen at random from all submissions) will not only get a copy of Kamp's charming book, they'll also get a chance to share their culinary discoveries with New York's smartest bunch of gastronomes: you. True story: when I began reading David Kamp’s The United States of Arugula: The Sun Dried, Cold Pressed, Dark Roasted, Extra Virgin Story of the American Food Revolution, I was actually eating arugula. Now, before you go an accuse me of pulling some weird synergistic stunt or flaunting my hifalutin’ tastes, let me say that arugula is the default green around my house and has been for a while. My partner and I like its flavor, its heartiness, and—to be perfectly honest—the way it can stay reasonably fresh in the refrigerator long after other greens begin the unpleasant process of putrefaction. Oh, and lest you think I was relishing the simple, peppery taste of each leaf, you should know that my salad also included leftover fast-food chicken fingers and a liberal dousing of ranch dressing. So much for gourmet… . But in a way, that’s what Kamp’s book attempts to explain—the means by which the concepts of cuisine and just plain food have intermingled in the United States, and the resulting uneasy equilibrium among two camps: those who seek out pure and fresh foods whenever possible, and those who embrace, knowingly or unknowingly, the garbage-food culture that thrives in every American city, suburb, and small town with a strip mall or street corner large enough to accommodate a drive-through window. Kamp’s book, though, is neither an apology for food snobbery nor a Michael and Jane Stern-esque paean to trashy food. In fact, it is often not about food at all. Instead, it examines the people behind the food and food trends—restaurateurs, chefs, cookbook authors, newspaper columnists, and food “personalities”—who have helped shape and reshape the American palate into the gloriously jumbled mess that it is today. Kamp’s focus for much of the book is on what could be considered a holy trinity of food evangelists: the lovably lumpen James Beard, the humorously prissy Craig Claiborne, and the original culinary diva, Julia Child. Much of the information about Child can be found in the fabulous My Life in France, but the Beard and Claiborne stories were new to this reader. (Be warned: there is an anecdote about Claiborne and his father that is still creeping me out, days after reading the book. Fear not—it isn’t food-related, but it will make your skin crawl more than any Survivor food challenge.) In fact, it is the stories about the movers, shakers, and bakers who have formed American tastes that make this book worth reading, whatever your level of interest in all things culinary. When Kamp describes the “bitchery” among various cookbook writers, you know you’re in for a breezy, dishy (no pun intended) read. There are numerous footnotes that keep the book from being a total Cookbook Babylon-type tome, but they clearly play second fiddle to the tales of feuds, power struggles, sexual politics, and toque-inflating ego trips that push the book along at a surprisingly fast clip and give the reader an arsenal of insider knowledge about celebrity chefs who have reigned over our taste buds and kitchens during the last century. Some may find the casual tone off-putting, as the title does suggest a slightly more intellectual and sociological bent to the text. But the majority of readers who pick up this book will not be disappointed. A sequel, focusing on the near-oversaturation of the mediasphere by cooks and chefs in the last few years alone (Food Network Confidential, anyone?), could probably be rolled out today and contain an equal amount of juicy gossip and cultural commentary, but until then, The United States of Arugula will give any food fan plenty of perspective on the stuff—dressing-soaked peppery greens included—that we’re shoving into our mouths day after day.

***CONTENT
 We'll let you in on a little secret- the great divide between Nosher and HungryMan is not a red state/blue state cleavage, nor even an uptown/dowtown schism. No, the real source of disagreement between us is over chocolate: Nosher likes dark and I like milk. To me, there's nothing better than a ganache made with lots of heavy cream or even the most simple melt-in-your-mouth milk chocolate bar. To Nosher, the slightly bitter, fruity, and arguably more complex flavors of dark chocolate, particularly those with higher percentages of cocoa solids and cocoa butter , send him over the moon. Happily, minor disputes like ours find their ideal resolution at events like this weekend's 10th Annual Chocolate Show, a gathering of over 50 of the finest chocolatiers and artisanal chocolate producers, all in one location at the Metropolitan Pavilion on 18th Street. Visitors to the yearly choco-fest can find everything from classic French truffles to fudge brownies to nouvelle cuisine concoctions filled with wasabi cream and curry. And in true Project Runway, style, the launch of the Chocolate Show included an over-the-top chocolate fashion show where models strutted up and down the runway covered in garments made from a minimum of 40% chocolate. Take that, Tim Gunn. You can view a slideshow of pictures of the event on our Flickr photostream as you listen to our podcast from the show. As with all of our podcasts, you have the option either to download the audio file (just right-click that link to save the file to disk) in order to listen on your mp3 device, or if you have a speedy Internet connection, you can stream the podcast by clicking the ‘play’ button on the audio player below. And whether it's milk, dark, or even white chocolate that turns you on, we hope you find something here to drool over.

Chandni, Where The Cabs Are

***CONTENT
 The old saw that cab drivers all know a city's best restaurants is an urban legend, but a time-sensitive one. Just like Cinderella's coach, when the clock strikes midnight, suddenly that bit of folk wisdom about taxi drivers becomes, for a few magical hours, gospel truth. Cab drivers on the night shift develop a perspective on the city that most native New Yorkers never get-drivers see where the night owls go when everyone else is in bed and know what remains open for business during the wee-est of the wee hours. So it makes perfect sense that nobody would know more about the best places in town to eat at 1:30 in the morning than a hungry cabbie. And this knowledge has a social component-taxi drivers who work alone in the dark all night quickly transform their late-night food finds into gathering places that often become so popular that entire city blocks are lined with nothing but parked yellow cabs. One such block is the stretch of 29th Street between Fifth Avenue and Broadway in Manhattan, a block with a few unremarkable Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi delis and one jewel: Chandni Restaurant. Chandni, which quite appropriately, means 'moonlight' in Urdu, is all business: décor is functional-glass and formica tables, vinyl seating-and ambiance that consists solely of a wall-mounted television playing a satellite news broadcast from Islamabad. Yet in waves, what seems like every single cab driver in Gotham-regardless of ethnicity-stops in for a snack during the night, and as the friendly chatter builds, the atmosphere starts to feel like it might in a multi-culti remake of Cheers. The crowd is no joke: on some visits, I have struggled to find an open seat in the restaurant at 2:30 a.m. The upside to the jam of starving taxi drivers is that it is easy to get a recommendation from them. The mutton and lamb with shrimp curries ($4.50 each) are among the more popular choices, although a surprisingly large proportion of cabbies opt for strictly vegetarian dishes. When I visited last night at two o'clock in the morning, I talked with Regis, a Haitian-born taxi driver who urged me to try Chandni's two vegetarian specials that had, in turn, been recommended to him earlier in the evening by his Pakistani friend, Mo. So I did as I was told and ordered the yellow lentil dal mash and the cauliflower, potato, and green pepper gobi aloo, both served together with a large naan ($5.00). The gobi aloo, a turmeric-infused stew, contained a very generous portion of seared cauliflower florets and tender, starchy potato halves-overall, a very solid dish. But the dal mash, with its sparks of red chili and floral coriander seed, was the sort of dish I would have been pleased with anywhere, anytime. The homemade naan, prepared just moments before, was also excellent: Crisp around its perimeter and springy inside, it was ideal for mopping up the spicy yellow dal mash. After my first few approving bites, my new friend Regis leaned in and told me, \"I come here only during my night shift. Never during the day. It just doesn't taste the same. I think they save the best food for later.\" Having sampled several dishes at Chandni during both times, I do not think this is the case, but what is missing during the day is a distinct sense of having discovered a secret pocket of gustatory bliss in the middle of a darkened city. And while it is unscientific and illogical, it does somehow manage to make the naan taste just a little better. Chandni Restaurant, 11 West 29th Street (between Fifth Avenue and Broadway), 212-686-4456.

I'm a strong believer in that most cabbies no nothing of good eating, whether late night or otherwise. They know what's cheap, what's quick, what can be eaten on the fly if necessary and in most cases, what is closely resembling food from their native land. See the line of cabs and cabbies standing outside Curry in a Hurry for proof.

Michael, I hear you. And at any other hour, I'd agree. But the line of cabs outside Chandni gives NYC's cabbies a little cred. You're also right about the ethnic angle-if it weren't for cabbies, we probably would never have stopped in for a meal at our local Haitian standby, Le Soleil. Now Curry in a Hurry-that's another story completely. I wish I understood its popularity. But don't blame the cabbies; it's a hit with the post-college set as well. Go figure.

Noshing for a Good Cause: New York Magazine's Taste of New York 2007

 One thing we have learned in the past three years is not to book a vacation during the first week in November, lest we miss out on our favorite food event of the year, New York magazine's annual Taste of New York charity benefit for City Harvest. The shindig took place last night in two of the Puck Building's biggest rooms, and even with a stragetically labyrinthine floor plan, the place was absolutely packed with the city's best chefs, mixologists, and an eager, hungry crowd. Despite having lost our tripod on the trip down to Houston Street, we knew we had to find a way to photograph it, and we did so with the assistance of a matchbook here, a plastic fork there, and in one instance, a big ball of lint from my suit jacket stabilizing the camera. MacGyver has nothing on us. You can view all fifteen pictures on our Flickr photostream, and if you want a little ambiance, you can also listen to the podcast we produced at last year's event. No matter what you do, be sure to check out the event's beneficiary, City Harvest-a very deserving organization that collects literally millions of pounds of unused food from the restaurant industry every year. Having sampled such delightful dishes as Dan Barber of Blue Hill's homemade V8 with panna cotta and farro crackers, and Payard's transcendental salted caramel and chocolate 'candy bar', we are relieved that the event raised so much cash, as we suspect that precious little of the food from this particular event wound up in a City Harvest van.

Crossing Borders at Nizza
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-11-04 22:57:00
***CONTENT
 Sometimes, borders are fuzzy and imperfect things. Just ask the German speakers in (officially) French Alsace, or more locally, the Cantonese, dim sum cart-pushing denizens of Manhattan's Little Italy, and they'll tell you all you need to know about leaky boundaries. Nizza, a new wine and tapas bar in Hell's Kitchen, takes one example of indistinct borders-Italy and France's cheek-by-jowl positioning on the Mediterranean-and capitalizes on it, zeroing in on the Italian influences in Nicoise cuisine, and vice versa. Nizza is how Italians know the French city of Nice, a town located a mere 20 miles from the Italian border. The city's cuisine is a Mediterranean cultural hodgepodge with ingredients redolent of the sea and a gentle climate: fresh fish and olive oil make frequent appearances, as do lemons, capers, olives, and anchovies, often in the form of their extraordinary anchoide. Nizza head chef Andy D'Amico knows this part of the world by heart, and he certainly knows how to sell it to New Yorkers. As co-owner of Marseille, Nizza's Hell's Kitchen neighbor, and as an alumnus of Upper West Side favorite Nice Matin, D'Amico has made a career specialty of French Riviera pastiche: French café posters, a zinc bar and a little Edith Piaf not only evoke an idealized Belle France, they also pack in the customers. Yet where Marseille and Nice Matin can feel a bit stodgy, Nizza never does, reflecting a more laid-back Italian sensibility that starts with a no-reservations policy at the door and continues with a mix-and-match menu of small plates with no apparent sequence. Diving right in, we found breads to be impressive, including a collection of lovely focaccete-hot pockets of fried dough (pictured top, $7) filled with a savory and nearly liquified dollop of Lombard crescenza cheese. These reminded us of the gnocco fritto found in the Emilia-Romagna region, and were every bit as good as these, if just a bit heavier and greasier. Less impressive was a small plate of stuffed Ligurian vegetables (not pictured, $7) which was underseasoned-little more than three limp and hollowed-out husks of summer squash and red onion, stuffed with red pepper, more onion, and loads of bland rice. With so much flavorless filler, this starter reminded us of the sort of food found at a school cafeteria, not a wine bar on Ninth Avenue. Also disappointing was Nosher's Bibb lettuce salad (pictured above, $9) with blue cheese and walnuts. Great in theory, the plate suffered from gritty lettuce and an overeager sprinkling of fleur de sel on an a dish featuring an already very salty cheese. Nizza offers some larger plates, including pastas, a grilled branzino and the restaurant's alarmingly named 'terror-stricken beef,' which our server informed us is so-called because the mayor of Nice decreed that, as killing animals is cruel, the term should apply to all meat served in the city. We do a significant amount of fact-checking before we write about restaurants, and unfortunately, even our best sources (in English and French alike) could not corroborate our waiter's story. On the other hand, we did discover that disgraced former mayor Jacques Medecin wrote a celebrated cookbook called La Cuisine du Comte de Nice. But nothing about the war against butchery terror. It is too bad the mayor did not declare a moratorium on uneven seasoning, because Nosher's San Remo pizza ($10) contained bites that tasted like pure tomato paste and others that were perfectly balanced with bits of olives and capers. The pizza also suffered from a surfeit of overly large, mostly uncooked slices of garlic. With a little tweaking, this pizza might end up being a winner, but until the garlic is sliced thinner and the tomato paste is seasoned, the San Remo is best avoided. My tomaxelle, stuffed veal rolls ($14), were better, showcasing another dish that does double duty in both Italy and France (across the border in Liguria, these are called bracciole). A heady mixture of finely chopped veal, pine nuts, anchovies and bread crumbs, this was a delight, enhanced by the slightly bitter taste and crunch of stewed broccoli rabe and a thin tomato sauce. Desserts are good, if unimaginative. We enjoyed an affogato (not pictured, $6), a large scoop of vanilla bean semifreddo studded with bits of crunchy pine nuts, and served with a bit of tableside flair as our waiter poured hot espresso over the semifreddo-a great blending of textures and temperatures. For a wine bar, Nizza's list of wines by the glass is relatively short-fewer than twenty choices, almost all of them from France and Italy. Despite this, the wines are well-selected, particularly the less expensive and lesser-known wines from Puglia and Sardinia, including a flinty Cannanou (Sardinian Grenache) that is a steal at $8. Primitivos and Dolcettos are also good bets-all under $10 a glass. Nizza's price point is, in general, about 10-20% lower than that of its wholly French brethren, which bodes well for its popularity with a younger crowd-and that American Apparel going up on the next block can't hurt either. We also suspect that the no-reservations policy will keep some of the pre-theater crowd at bay, which is never a bad thing for locals in need of a table at 7:00. True to its border-straddling menu theme, Nizza-in theory, at least-ought to appeal to a wide range of diners. But before it can mature into an uptown, slightly more Francophone incarnation of Otto, it will have to rectify some serious inconsistencies in the kitchen. Nizza, 630 Ninth Avenue between 44th and 45th Streets, 212-956-1800.

I have to tell you you are right about everything. The food has great potential but goes nowhere. I've been there three times, I live down the street. It's changed for the better. For instance the vegetable things where better, and the meat and cheese plates are looking alot sharper. One thing can be given a gold star, service. I find the staff to be really pleasant, happy, and attractive. The manager/maitre D who was there the past nights I've been there always remembers my name, even sent us some sort of after dinner drink. Our service is always happy. Frankly, it's what keeps me coming back.

Lobster Rolls in Low Fidelity: Ed's Lobster Bar

***CONTENT
 Ed McFarland certainly has a pair. After leaving a six-year stint as sous chef at Pearl Oyster Bar earlier this year, he struck out on his own by opening his own restaurant just a few avenues east of his former employer's, one that serves a menu that is so much like Pearl's own that his former boss, Rebecca Charles, filed a lawsuit against him for stealing her intellectual property. When the lobster knuckles started flying this summer, opinions from the press varied considerably, but nearly everyone writing about the story agreed on one thing: copycatting your boss is pretty brazen. This also wasn't the first time Rebecca Charles had seen Pearl Oyster Bar cloned. Four years ago, her ex-girlfriend and business partner, Mary Redding, decamped from Cornelia Street to open up Mary's Fish Camp just a few blocks to the west. The ethics of the move are a lot less dubious in the case of Mary's, as both women co-founded Pearl, and Mary's Fish Camp wound up being a nearly perfect mitotic replica of Pearl, at least in terms of its menu-the decor of Mary's, on the other hand, is much more rustic than that of its parent. Several years later, both restaurants have evolved divergently, so that Mary's is the place to go for fried fish and grilled lobster, whereas Pearl Oyster Bar makes superior baby lettuce salads and lobster rolls. With this in mind, we waited for the litigation dust to settle over Ed's Lobster Bar before we wrote about it, hoping that it, like Mary's, would begin to grow its own unique identity-and on a quicker timeline, given the intellectual property stakes. When we visited to eat dinner and to snap some photos this week, we found that, indeed, Ed's Lobster Bar has developed a dish or two that set it apart from its forbears. One favorite among these were the fried Ipswich Clams (pictured above, $15), a small plate of fat, juicy belly clams with a crisp, almost tempura-like batter. Best of all was the lobster pot pie (pictured on Flickr, $18), served in a softball-sized cauldron. The pastry topping was flaky and savory, a gorgeous counterpoint to the intensely mushroom-flavored broth and generous chunks of sweet lobster meat-quite easily among the best pot pies in the city. But for the most part, the restaurant's creative streak peters out there; nearly everything else on the menu appears borrowed directly from Pearl or Mary's, and this is a dangerous, as well as gutsy move, because it not only invites comparisons, it forces them. For example, our caesar salad ($7) looked and smelled just like the version at Mary's that we love so much, but Ed's dressing was far too garlicky and worse-skimpy on anchovies. Then there is the lobster roll-the sine qua non of a New England-style shellfish eatery. The version we were served was overstuffed, practically busting with lobster. Yet the lobster meat was coated in a practically tasteless, runny mayonnaise dressing that added fat without flavor and gave the entire dish an unfortunate heaviness that Pearl's and Mary's sandwiches never have. It is hard to imagine how someone who trained with Rebecca Charles could get a lobster roll so utterly wrong, but the evidence was on the plate-a plate I could barely finish. It was as if someone had taken Pearl's lobster roll, made one satisfactory yet slightly inferior copy in creating Mary's version, and then copied the copy to produce Ed's roll. Somewhere along the way, important details became blurry and indistinct, leaving Ed's Lobster Bar with a low-fi lobster roll and a lawsuit. And this is a shame, as it is clear from his pot pie and belly clams that Ed McFarland is a talented chef in his own right, at least when he creates his own unique dishes-he just needs a little self-confidence to go with his defiant boldness. Ed's Lobster Bar, 222 Lafayette Street (near Spring Street), 212-343-3236.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Aaron Woolf's agro-ethnography, King Corn, a film about how, when it comes to something as simple as farming, everything is complicated. The documentary focuses on two college friends, Ian Cheney and Curt Ellis who set out to follow a fundamental American crop, corn, from soil to table. Yet nothing really works out quite the way they expected, least of all the taste of their harvest. The film just ended a run at Cinema Village, but is slated to return to NYC soon, both in cinemas and on DVD. 2. The Halloween treats at Corrado Bread & Pastry (in Grand Central Market and on Lexington Avenue & 70th/71st Streets), especially the silky cocoa truffles and the miniature devil's food cupcakes-all adorned with skulls and black cats. Non-seasonal items like the Toll House Brownie, which is more like a slice of butterscotch cake, and crisp pistachio shortbread cookies are also well worth checking out. And they make a mean cup of joe, to boot. 3. Warm stuffed zucchini ripieni ($12.50/ lb.) from Buon Italia in Chelsea Market. Stuffed with cheese and roughly diced tomato, this is perfect autumn dinner party fare. It is also so good that we have been known to devour an entire container in a taxi on our ride home. So be prepared: Order extra.

 <img class=\"softframing\" style=\"float:right\" src=\"http://farm3.static.flickr.com/2229/1784092537_db06da13ef_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"145\" </a/> Six Italian grandmothers of St. George, Staten Island have got this whole restaurant business all figured out. By taking turns at the stovetop, each nonna gets to rule the kitchen one day each week, and no one has to work more than a few weekly lunch or dinner shifts. Everyone gets a chance to cook and nobody collapses, exhausted in the gnocchi-it is a win-win arrangement. But really, it's the lucky residents of St. George who are perhaps the most fortunate, as they get a glimpse into regional home cooking from a different part of Italy nearly every night of the week. As should already be clear, this is not your typical Italian restaurant: this is a place where meals are punctuated by frequent appearances from a well-proportioned older Italian woman who, in halting English, inquires at every table whether everything is \"bene.\" And the only real response is: Si. Unbelievably, the grandma rota works splendidly. On the afternoon when we visited most recently, we found Teresa, a no-nonsense nonna from Agrigento in southern Sicily, serving up a regionally appropriate, seafood-focused menu of mussels, octopus, calamari, whole branzino. But that was just Saturday-on a different night, you might just as easily find yourself in a carnivore's paradise, eating off a menu informed by the restaurant's resident grandmother from Milan or the one from Campania. Because the cuisine is somewhat of a moving target, telephoning the restaurant or visiting its website is more important than it is elsewhere. Even knowing the regular schedule isn't any guarantee, as the restaurant's website announced this week that a new 'nonna' from Trentino has signed up, and that Argentina, a chef from the Marche, has returned from an extended visit to Italy to grace the kitchen once more. These grandmas don't sit still for long. No matter who is in the kitchen when you go, each meal at Enoteca Maria begins with a generous and complimentary tray of antipasto (pictured top). As with most dishes, its components change daily. We enjoyed soft cubes of spinach, cheese and garlic; roasted red peppers potatoes and onions; tuna with rice and red beans-all served on little square plates accompanied by pieces of springy homemade focaccia. There are more elaborate antipasto options, including a selection of Italian coppa like prosciutto, sopressata, salami and speck as well as a separate selection of all-Italian cheeses (pictured above, $15), featuring a young and milky gorgonzola, a soft robiola made from cow's, sheep's and goat's milk and wrapped in brandy-soaked cherry leaves, as well as a wonderfully pungent taleggio. But best of all were the condiments: dried dates, spoonfuls of clover honey with walnuts, and an ethereal mostarda-a sweet fruit sauce with a pleasant kick of mustard seed. Teresa is also well known for her seafood salads. One, an insalata frutti di mare (pictured above right, $15), a cold and acidic mixture of octopus, calamari rings, shrimp, carrots and celery, suffered a bit from underseasoning. However, another, the insalata di baccala, a cod fish salad (pictured on Flickr, $15) was truly exceptional, with a sweet, tart dressing that brought out the flavor of the meaty baccala and carrots. It was simple, immensely satisfying, and unlike any dish we have ever seen served anywhere else in the city. We found pastas to be uncomplicated and extremely well-prepared. A plate of garganelli (pictured above, $10) featured the distinctive bias-cut pasta (like penne, but with horizontal, instead of vertical ridges) with a sweet tomato sauce so simple that only bits of basil showed through the tomatoes. You can also find canneloni stuffed with meat, green peas and the same rich, slightly sweet sauce. On Sicilian nights, if you are lucky, you mayfind sfincione, a puffy cheeseless pizza baked in an enormous square (pictured here, $10 for a generous slice). More like a massive block of focaccia topped with a hearty sauce of garlic, onions, tomatoes, black olives and roasted peppers, the sfincione's dough rises to two to three inches in height and ends up springy, light, and so massive that eating it requires a fork and knife. Desserts range from simple dishes-fresh fruit, nuts, homemade biscotti with vin santo-to more elaborate creations like the torta nutella ($10) we sampled, made by layering soft ladyfingers with Nutella, sliced almonds and Sambuca-infused whipped cream. A dusting of cocoa powder might put you in mind of a tiramisu, but this fantastic dish showcased anise and hazelnut flavors instead of coffee. This dessert alone made the ferry ride worthwhile. Of course, for some Gothamites, even the short voyage represents a psychological distance too far, and this is a serious shame, because Enoteca Maria is so terrific and with such an unusual atmosphere that, if planted anywhere in Manhattan, it would be overrun within seconds. Certainly, Enoteca Maria deserves to be better known, but perhaps Upper New York Bay is just the kind of barrier the restaurant needs to keep it from turning into a zombified PR darling or worse: a pre-theater bistro. As for us, we'd build an ark to get to Enoteca Maria-and besides, what's a little water when grandma's cooking awaits on the opposite shore? Enoteca Maria, 27 Hyatt Street, Staten Island, 718-447-2777.

***CONTENT
 Technically, the DB in the name of this mid-priced French-American restaurant refers to its owner and executive chef, Daniel Boulud. But spend a few minutes in the bistro's front dining room and it becomes clear quickly that \"db\" could just as easily stand for decibels. And on a recent Thursday evening visit, we were treated to a festival of dBs, courtesy of one soused party of eight Dutch business travelers arguing and typing on two laptops and a four-top of rowdy locals celebrating the release of one of their number's first novel. The volume question is a thorny one for any restaurant: When does an animated party of diners cross the line and become an irksome annoyance that demands intervention? The person to whom such decisions invariably fall is the front-of-house manager (maitre d', floor manager, captain, etc.), and while some are true ninja masters of the placating arts, others cower or just ignore the problem. During another dinner elsewhere, we sat, awed by the skills of one local captain who approached an extremely rowdy table and said, \"I can tell you are enjoying yourself very much, and I would love to join you for a drink in a little while. Just one request in the meantime: Keep the noise down so our other customers can finish their meals? Thank you.\" It was classic schoolteacher classroom management at work-firm, even-handed, and best of all: nobody felt chided. Yet at db Bistro Moderne, neither the noise, the spreadsheets, nor the squeal-inducing ass-grabbing we witnessed impelled our maitre d' to take action. On another night, had we been less hungry, we would have left, but seated as we were with a bottle of wine open already, we made the choice to stay-and in this we are complicit. We both began with appetizers: my heirloom tomato salad with ricotta salata (pictured top, $17) was very good, dressed in a light vinaigrette and accompanied by a few sticks of marvelously crunchy, deep-fried polenta sticks that tasted like a cross between a french fry and a savory churro. HungryMan's smoked salmon (called \"Daniel Boulud's Smoked Salmon,\" although our server could not tell us whether it was house-made or not) with celery remoulade and tiny potato pancakes was decent, if a little underwhelmingly seasoned. The dish played well with textural contrasts, but the salmon and the salad both could have used a solid hit of citrus. Our main courses were both very solid, especially HungryMan's squab en croute ($32), the dish of the day. The slight gamey flavors in the poultry and the toasted exterior of the flakey pastry made an especially lovely combination. The John Dory with leeks, chanterelles, and potato gnocchi (pictured on Flickr, $38) also impressed. The gnocchi that accompanied this dish were as good as any we have eaten in New York City and merit inclusion in the restaurant's short list of otherwise less interesting side dishes like brussels sprouts and pommes frites. Not to say that db Bistro Moderne should abandon its fries-such a move would be sacrilege at a restaurant whose reputation is built largely upon its $32 belly buster of a burger-foie gras, short ribs, sirloin, and black truffles, anyone? No, there is plenty of room on the already short menu for a few extra sublime sides. Getting your server to hear you order them in the dinnertime din, on the other hand, is a completely different story. db Bistro Moderne, 55 West 44th Street (between Fifth and Sixth Avenues), 212-391-2400.

Thursday Lunch in the Park at (and with) Jean Georges

***CONTENT
 After last Thursday, I am starting to think that there is more than one Jean-Georges Vongerichten. Is there any explanation other than cloning that explains how a celebrated restaurateur with seventeen successful restaurants can still make a lengthy dining room appearance during a mid-week lunchtime service? Sure, an occasional dinnertime peek-a-boo at a celebrity chef's flagship eatery is de rigeur-just to keep up the cult of personality-but fifteen minutes worth of tableside visits during lunch sends a clear message: Jean-Georges might have other interests, but his eponymous restaurant is his top priority. And it shows. Last Thursday, HungryMom and I took advantage of what some critics have called the best lunchtime bargain in Gotham, the $28 two-course prix fixe menu at Jean Georges in the Trump International Hotel. The meal, which can be extended with additional courses for $12 apiece or desserts for $8, features many of the same dishes that appear on the restaurant's dinner menu, only at approximately 1/4 the cost. Moreover, the quality of service is the same as it is at night: in a word, flawless. We started to see signs of this immediately after being seated, as our server walked us confidently and expertly through the menu options. All told, diners have twenty-one dishes to choose from on the Tastes of Autumn prix fixe menu, only one of which-the egg caviar-comes with a supplemental charge. Offerings range from a lettuce salad with tomatoes and kampachi to glazed short ribs with crunchy grits-a full array of vegetable, fish, poultry and meat dishes. As we learned, it is best to ask about portion sizes, as these are not standardized and some dishes, like the foie gras brulé with dried cherries, candied pistachios and white port gelée (pictured top), are rather substantial and filling, while others, like the sea urchin on black bread with jalapeno and yuzu (shown here) represent just a few tiny bites. Regardless of size disparities, we found both dishes to be outstanding. The foie was tawny and rich, benefitting fully from the barely bitter tastes from the sugar in the caramelized pistachio topping and the oakiness of the gelled port. My sea urchin was as fresh as any of the best uni I have been served by a sushi master: sweet and full of mineral flavors, all ignited like a firecracker with a slice of jalapeno so thin that it must have been cut on a microtome. Just as we finished our final bites and lay our forks down, our server reappeared to clear our plates. Never hovering but clearly always monitoring every table in the room, the front-of-house staff at Jean Georges struck an impressive balance between availability and invisibility. As we sat watching the staff silently choreograph tandem plate presentation to a few more tables, our own second courses arrived. HungryMom's smoked squab with candied tamarind and Asian pear (pictured above) was, once again, generously portioned. It was also excellent, with a playful balance between the crunch from the pear and succulently fleshy texture of the squab. There was one slightly gristly piece of squab in the dish, and while this was not a catastrophic flaw by any means, it was a small, unexpected disappointment in an otherwise fantastic dish. My own skate with Chateau Chalon sauce was similarly impressive and featured perhaps the most tender skate wing I have ever eaten, striped with a brunoise of zucchini and tomato. The decadently buttery sauce is one of Jean-George's signature concoctions, made with white Jura wine and pepper-a few dashes too much pepper on our visit. Fortunately, the extra kick from the sauce was not enough to ruin the dish, but it was enough of a surprise to make us wonder how the saucier could have missed such a mistake. Instead of opting for a third savory course, HungryMom and I went right for dessert, and with pastry chef Johnny Iuzzini-nearly as celebrated as Vongerichten himself-in the kitchen, skipping dessert was never an option. Sweets are divided into themes: market, berry, apple, and chocolate, where each dessert comprises three or four items that take their inspiration from that theme. I chose the market dessert, the main attraction of which was a tight fan of ripe pear slices, moistened with white balsamic vinegar glaze and topped with dollops of fresh farmer cheese, microgreen basil, and crunchy pistachios-such a wonderful amplification of fresh pear flavor that I spent at least ten minutes trying to deconstruct the dish to make it back at the Noshpad. Along with the pear were two other treats-a boozy brandied cherry soufflé and a quenelle of dark chocolate chantilly that were delightful alone, but even better when eaten in alternating bites. HungryMom's chocolate dessert selection (pictured on Flickr) included Jean-George's chocolate cake- a molten confection that made her head spin rapturously-along with a large scoop of vanilla ice cream. Alongside these classic sweets sat the most inventive dessert of the meal: two slices of toasted chocolate brioche with fontina and black olive. The savory flavors from the olive seemed somehow to transfer to the brioche, creating waves of fruitiness and nutiness on the palate. This was a knockout punch of a dessert-the chocolate plate was worth ordering for the brioche and olive toast alone. And Iuzzini's treats did not stop there; after our plates were cleared, we were presented with a trio of homemade marshmallows (pictured on Flickr-mint, cinnamon, and vanilla), a saucer that held six dime-sized macarons (lemon poppyseed, espresso, and brown butter), and a silver dish of chocolates (jasmine, espresso, and caramel). These tiny bites were an ideal coda to a spectacular meal with precious few flaws. It is a testament to Vongerichten and Iuzzini alike that their restaurant can produce such a magical weekday lunch a full decade into its tenure at the very pinnacle of New York City's restaurant scene. And with Jean Georges himself in the kitchen even on an unremarkable October Thursday at noon, we would not be at all surprised to see Jean Georges still on top in 2017. Jean Georges, 1 Central Park West, 212-299-3900.

 3 things we're loving this week: 1. Taking advantage of the last of this season's heirloom tomato crop. Our favorite use by far is in a simple, open-faced sandwich consisting of thick slices of tomato, fresh basil (still thriving in our outdoor stairwell containers, amazingly), sea salt, and cracked pepper, all layered atop a yeasty slice of Sullivan Street's pizza bianca con pecorino ($2.25 per slice). 2. Barry Glassner's frustrating and provocative The Gospel of Food: Why We Should Stop Worrying and Enjoy What We Eat, a sociologist's perspective on eating, nutrition, and social dogma. And while we only agree with about half of what Glassner says-the rest can be a bit bourgeois and elitist-the book challenges just about everything you have learned about food. It will either give you ammunition for your next cocktail party debate or an aneurysm as it works you up into such a lather that you end up screaming at Glassner in abstentia...or both. 3. The seasonal maple latte at Brooklyn's Gorilla Coffee. Combined with the smoky flavors of their custom roasted beans, the maple and full cream milk bring to mind campfire breakfasts of bacon and eggs-just without the chilly night spent in a wet tent.

You are so right about the Glassner book. It is a must read, yet no one could possibly agree with all of it. I'm closer to 75% agreement, and I've been recommending it to friends a lot.

300 Square Feet of Italy: Zibetto Espresso Bar

***CONTENT
 Gattopardo, our friend from Genoa, visits New York four or five times a year to woo new clients with his artisanal prosciutto. Until March of this year, he liked to stay in a hotel on the Upper West Side, but as he began telling everyone this summer, \"Now I stay as close as I can to Zibetto. It is my little nugget of Italy, and I could not stomach New York without it.\" When we heard an echt Italian pledge his love and hotel dollars so ardently, we knew we had to see for ourselves why. Zibetto is a closet-sized, white marble and tile room with a long, chest-high, L-shaped bar and nary a seat in the entire place. This is true a caffè Italiano, where espresso ($2/$3) is the default beverage and where breakfast means a cornetto with jam ($2.50). The restaurant's best drink is its simplest: a concentrated, slightly fruity espresso that is smooth enough that it really should be drunk unsweetened. But if you need a hit of sugar, there is plenty of the stuff on the marble counters-and no packets of pink, blue, or yellow in sight. Cappuccinos ($3) and lattes ($3.50) are also wonderful, as are the shop's caffe freddo (iced coffee, $3), prepared with crushed ice in a Boston shaker-quite possibly the best cold espresso we have ever had. On a recent visit, we asked Gattopardo to translate the name of the cafe, at which point he pulled us in close and whispered, \"It means a kind of cat from Africa that likes to...,\" and here he smiled and looked around the room, \"Make its own very special kind of coffee.\" We smiled back, perplexed, and nodded. But then it dawned on us-this \"cat\" must be the civet, and the coffee therefore, must be the infamously expensive kopi luwak. Chocolate pound cake ($2) is about as close as you'll come to civet pellets here, but if Zibetto's name is intended to link it conceptually with the absolute gold standard of java, they have the coffee to back it up. Zibetto, 1385 Sixth Avenue (at 56th Street), no telephone.

Thanks for the tip. Always looking for good coffee. Interesting about kopi luwak. We stay on the Upper West Side despite my protests. The recent large rate hike at the Newton will hopefully move us downtown.

Oh dear, that chocolate pound cake looks like a sinful blessing! Just wanted to say 'thank you' for your post on the honey-sage loaf at Arte Around the Corner a while back. It's become my favorite bakery since moving back to NYC recently! Everything I've had there, from lemon oil cake, ginger-pear bread, and of course, the various honey loaves, have been nothing short of bliss

Best Italian espresso I've tried in America. I don't even know why you even bother naming 9 street espresso. The have nothing to do with Italian espresso. They pull a 3 shot in a single espresso, with makes the espresso to burn because it has to much coffee. I'm noticing more and more Americans in zibetto, with makes me happy.

Midtown's Tumbleweed District

***CONTENT
 Midtown restaurants, even ones with questionable culinary reputations and puzzling décor issues, can usually manage to siphon off enough celebratory end-of-the-working-week business to make Friday nights a booking nightmare. This is doubly true of restaurants attached to hotels, as inertia and/or fear of the unknown sometimes keeps overnight guests close to their rooms during their stay. So imagine our surprise when we walked into District (attached to the Muse Hotel) and discovered that our humble party of three was quite literally the only filled table in the house at 7:30 on a Friday night-District was as eerily deserted as the Overlook Hotel restaurant in The Shining. The staff (who at one point outnumbered diners by four to one), all seemed to take the emptiness in stride. Some kitchen workers leaned on the pass-through and drummed with chopsticks, some chatted, while District's hostess stood isolated by the entrance, looking as monumentally bored as she must have been. We have never seen a staffer so happy to be handed coats; \"At last,\" she might have thought, \"Something to do!\" At the beginning of our meal, service was as quick as you might expect from such a favorable staff-to-guest ratio-we placed our orders and were served drinks in a flash. Our dining companion, K3, who made a special request to have an appetizer salad served without cheese, was told, \"Of course, sir. We'll be delighted to make the salad however you wish.\" And within what felt like milliseconds, our appetizers arrived. My tomato salad with burrata and smoked balsamic (pictured above, $14) was a dish that worked well in theory, but when constructed from inexplicably blanched and skinned tomatoes and sour-tasting burrata, was a complete flop. HungryMan's checkerboard patterned beet salad ($12) also looked gorgeous, but was unevenly seasoned and unpleasantly crunchy in spots. With no other customers for whom to cook, we at least expected our appetizers to be carefully prepared, but these dishes, along with K3's drippingly overdressed mesclun salad, displayed a sloppiness that surprised us all. Our mains were, on average, a bit better. Our favorite dish of the night, District's gloss on a linguini carbonara ($19), made with asparagus slivers, pancetta, and poached quail eggs, was salty, smoky, and unctuous, all in perfect proportions. The crunch from the asparagus also lent the dish a bit of textural complexity-something carbonara pasta rarely has. At the same time, both fish dishes we ordered were unmitigated disasters. My cod, served with a deconstructed ratatouille-style biyaldi terrine ($24) was decent-but only when all the components on the plate were jammed on the fork together. On its own, the fish was bland and so undercooked that it was completely raw inside. HungryMan's salmon with shellfish chodwer (pictured on Flickr, $25) suffered from the opposite problem: his fish was cooked into a tough and solid block of blackened flesh, while the sauce surrounding the dish was too salty and even gritty in places from improperly washed leeks. By the time we finished our meal, the restaurant had somehow managed to fill another couple of its two-tops, and we decided to see how things played out over dessert. Of the three desserts we ordered, all had splendid components and horrifying ones. The warm chocolate cupcake with mint ice cream (pictured on Flickr, $9) would have been a real treat, had it not been for a disgusting, quickly-oxidizing squirt of liquified avocado on the plate that blunted the impact of all the dish's strong flavors. The lemon chiffon cheesecake (pictured on Flickr, $9) was perhaps the best of the bunch, but it lacked real depth of flavor and was topped by a few sprigs of parsley-a vegetal, aromatic taste that belongs far away from the combo of strawberries and cheese. Yet by far the strangest dessert came in the form of what must have been a Wylie Dufresne-inspired plate: a brown butter and yogurt panna cotta with melon balls, champagne, and...pop rock granola ($9). As promised, the dessert crackled audibly, but that was its best feature, as it contained too many other uncoordinated elements, the least impressive of which was a completely out-of-place fine dice of sweetened celery ribs and yet more parsley. While we doubt that such confusing fusions of flavors are responsible for the dearth of fellow diners, they cannot help a situation that looks more and more dire by the day-each time we have passed by District, we have seen a similarly empty dining room. Consider this a warning flare, and someone, anyone, send help quick. If you need us, we'll be out back in the hedge maze. District, 130 West 46th Street, 212-485-2999.

Worth Its Weight in...Jam?
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-10-10 22:45:00
***CONTENT
 Our favorite jam is a simple concoction made by boiling together approximately equal amounts (by weight) of fresh fruit and sugar with a little vanilla or almond extract. It's loose and drippy, has to be kept in the fridge, and manages to find its way onto every surface in the kitchen, but nothing beats its purity of flavor. Certainly not store-bought jam, which often contains enough pectin or other thickeners to produce a stiff mess that spreads about as well as a gumdrop. Even expensive 'all fruit' blends tend to be dense and generally pretty flavorless. All of which is why, when we caught sight of a well-hidden display of La Trinquelinette jams at Fairway this week, we were skeptical-especially since the preserves all cost a very dear $8.99 per jar. Yet rarely has Steve Jenkins steered us wrong, so we left with a few jars of the stuff...some of the priciest jars of jam we had ever purchased. And it was it worth every cent. Reading the description on the labels, we saw immediately why-the ingredient list is about as short as possible, comprising just two items: 55% fruit and 45% unrefined sugar. If you think that looks remarkably close to the magic ratio we use to make our own fresh jam, you're right. La Trinquelinette jam looks identical to the loose compotes we love to brew up in our own kitchen-all the flavor, plus shelf stability to boot. Of the flavors we have tried, our favorite is the rhubarb: a sappy, pulpy confection that pairs well with pungent cheeses like Roaring Forties blue, an extra-stinky taleggio, or just all by itself on a few slices of toasted baguette-my new favorite midnight snack. In fact, we have been so completely won over that we are already clearing space in our pantry for a growing stockpile of the stuff-our own little fruit-flavored Fort Knox of nine dollar jam jars to tide us over until the arrival of 2008's fresh fruit. Yes, thanks to the work of a tiny artisanal confisseur near Dijon, we are ready to declare ourselves officially ready for winter. Now pass the cheese.

I looked for this jam at Fairway but to no avail. Do you know anywhere else in NYC that sells it. I've brought in Paris for years and years (ile st louis. I was supposed to leave for paris today but the mutiple strikes there made it unadvisible. I would love to give the cassis for holiday presents. As you well know it's WONDERFUL\" thanks Mary

Mary, Fairway seems to be sold out of La Trinquelinette jam temporarily. Judging from the great e-mail response we got to this piece, I think I know where it all went... . But if you're desperate, call Fairway and ask when they think they'll be able to restock it. Nosher

All in the Family at Il Melograno

***CONTENT
 The arrival of another small, family-owned Italian restaurant to the over-saturated Manhattan dining scene is not normally cause for notice or celebration. After all, there are far too many 'real Italian' restaurants that are in fact operated by well-meaning folks from somewhere other than Italy, restaurants whose cook-by-numbers approach to only the safest Italian classics is used to counterbalance the eatery's questionable authenticity. So imagine our suprise when we paid a visit to Il Melograno, a diminutive corner trattoria on a windswept section of Tenth Avenue in Hell's Kitchen. The restaurant is owned and run by recent Valle Camonica transplant Alberto Tartari. With Tartari behind the stove and his wife making frequent guest appearances at the cash register and in the dining room, Il Melograno just might represent that most ephemeral of destinations in modern Manhattan- a genuine family-run Italian restaurant that takes pride in what comes out of the kitchen. This is most evident in the pastas, all of which Il Melograno makes in house. The very best is the simplest: a spaghetti al pomodoro ($9), cooked al dente and with a savory cheese and tomato sauce, dotted with fragrant chunks of soft garlic and seasoned with plenty of freshly chiffonaded basil leaves. This dish alone makes a visit worthwhile. Nearly as extraordinary is the papardelle ($10), wide sheets of tender pasta folded over and around sweet, ground sausage, tender green peas and a spicy tomato sauce. It may be a little early in the season for this dish, but come November, I know I will be craving it. Not everything is perfect, however: a veal ravioli dish ($12) we sampled was drowned in a creamy, salty taleggio cream sauce and was excessively salty. A plate of tagliatelle (pictured below, $11) was bathed in a rich and very well-seasoned saffron cream sauce but was undone by uneven rolling of the pasta- many strands of the tagliatelle clumped together in finger-thick stacks that were almost completely uncooked, while other noodles were cooked perfectly. We also found one of the secondi piatti, a chicken paillard (pictured on Flickr, $13) cooked a touch past its prime and a bit too salty. But most puzzling was the minute sprinkle of romaine leaves and carrot strips on the plate that looked more like garnish than the 'side salad' our server described. Other dishes, including the appetizers, had fewer problems. An apple salad (pictured top, $8) with mesclun greens, arugula, wan tomatoes and goat cheese would have been excellent, had it not been for the roughly cut apples that made the salad tricky to eat without a sharper knife. Interestingly, the salad's signature dressing, made from honey, olive oil and a splash of pomegranate juice includes Il Melograno's only nod to its namesake fruit. After a few return visits, we think the trick to a good meal at Il Melograno is to focus on the always excellent soups, like the smoky white bean or musky mushroom purée (all soups $6), daily fish specials, and simple pastas - like the exceptional spaghetti described above or the gnocchi with gorgonzola ($10.50). And despite its occasional problems, we have faith that Il Melograno will work things out quickly-we have seen Tatari himself stop by every table in the dining room during each of our visits, asking patrons about their food and listening carefully when they give him feedback. We have also seen a marked improvement in the quality of both service and pasta over the course of just two weeks. More than this, Il Melograno's few opening month stumbles are almost entirely made up for by, of all things, its rock-solid pastry and baking prowess. In particular, the restaurant prepares springy and crusty homemade focaccia daily and serves it in a basket with a tiny bottle of good olive oil. It is easy to eat too much of it, leaving you no room for the other surprise: the very fine home-style desserts. We recommend a generous portion of the siken custardy tiramisu, as well as a spongy slice of the chocolate apple cake that is as good as any Italian nonna ever made. Like much of the rest of Il Melograno's menu, both taste genuinely homemade despite the ocassional bell and whistle, like a delicate vanilla cream sauce-drizzled on our slice by Mrs. Tartari herself. Don't look now, but this may well be the birth of a true mom-and-pop restaurant where the proprietors pay as much attention to their customers' food as they would to a meal in their own home. We can't guarantee you'll be welcomed at Il Melograno like a long-lost son or daughter, but if things keep improving the way they have been, we do think you'll want to come back for seconds, or possibly thirds. Il Melograno, 501 West 51st Street, at 10th Avenue, Hell's Kitchen. 212-757-9290.

Ba Xuyen, One Sandwich to Rule Them All

***CONTENT
 HungryMom called this afternoon just as we were starting to feel a little peckish. \"I know neither of you will approve, but I just ate lunch for $1.50!\" she proclaimed. \"Hang on just one second,\" HungryMan retorted, \"You know we love an inexpensive meal as much as anyone. The real question is: Was your lunch a good one?\" HungryMom paused, polled her two dining companions and replied, \"Just so-so. But what do you expect?\" She had a point. HungryMom's Costco repast got us thinking about the calculus of the cheap lunch and wondering: If a person had $5.00 to spend in any restaurant in the city, where could s/he get the maximum bang for the minimum buck? If filling up is the primary goal, we'd place our bets on Prosperity Dumpling or Lomzynianka, but what about raising the bar from HungryMom's 'so-so' to a more ambitious 'superb'? Very quickly we both agreed that banh mi was the only solution to this culinary version of Fermat's last theorem. So which among the city's dozens of Vietnamese sandwich shops would we head to with our lonely fiver? That's an easy one: Ba Xuyen. And within minutes, HungryMan and I were on the D train to Sunset Park, Brooklyn, stomachs rumbling from all of our theoretical noshing. That neither of us gave a second thought to taking a 40-minute subway ride for lunch is a testament to Ba Xuyen's indisputably first-rate sandwiches. Made on thick lengths of baguette so crisp that pieces of the glossy outer crust shatter with every bite, these banh mi are filled generously and served just barely warm. On our visit today, HungryMan opted for the traditional banh mi (pictured above, in foreground, $3.50)-a sandwich filled with pork cold cuts (our favorite is the heady grilled ham), tangy shredded daikon and carrot pickle, paté, and cilantro. I opted for the unusual tuna banh mi (pictured above, in background, $4.25), as I had only ever eaten the delightful sardine version previously. Both of our sandwiches were excellent, even with my tuna salad veering dangerously close to an onion overload. That said, we both firmly agree that the Ba Xuyen classic banh mi deserves to be listed as #1 on the restaurant's menu-it is the best sandwich in the shop, and very possibly the best in the city. And I will admit-even though HungryMan stayed true to the price limit for our lunchtime scenario and drank a can of winter melon tea ($0.75), I cheated a bit on our five dollar lunch, choosing to sip on a durian shake ($2.50), much to the chagrin of HungryMan, who sat nearby complaining that it smelled like I was eating a banana next to a natural gas leak. If you are a durian fan, it is hard to resist the temptation of a café that makes its blended drinks from chunks of aromatic fresh fruit, since so few establishments are willing to cut the durian themselves, let alone store it in an airtight container in their refrigerator. Better still, Ba Xuyen doesn't skimp on the durian, which makes this shake one of the best bargains in the shop. Sure, we may have spent an average of four times as much as HungryMom did for her lunch, but in terms of gustatory bang for the buck, Ba Xuyen is a supernova. Ba Xuyen, 4222 Eighth Avenue (between 42nd and 43rd Streets), 718-633-6601.

Oms/b: More Rice, Fewer Vowels

 Listen to the women behind the counter at this Midtown East Japanese café as they relay your order to one another and you will hear immediately how the shop got its unusual name. \"Umeboshi Omusubi, Hai!\" they call, clipping and squeezing all but the first vowel of the second word right out, making it sound exactly the way it looks on the awning outside: \"Oms/b\". The restaurant's eponymous specialty, better known in this country by its other interchangeable name, onigiri, is a classic Japanese dish: the filled rice ball. And while onigiri are not difficult to find in New York City, they are often treated as the ugly stepsister and sold as snacks, pushed into the background in favor of sexier dishes like sushi or comfort food like donburi. Not at Oms/b-here the menu lists no fewer than 45 different varieties of rice balls, ranging from a simple, nori-wrapped omusubi with sprinkled sesame seeds and seaweed ($1.25) to a pimped-out Italian-Japanese risotto spring roll ($2.80) that is unexpectedly creamy and decadent. Oms/b's very finely tuned focus on one primary dish has paid huge dividends in the quality of its food, resulting in a menu that is not only inexpensive, but consistently very good. Of the four dozen varieties of onigiri on the menu, we have found a few we enjoy more than others. In particular, the salmon (pictured rear on left, $1.75), which every time we have ordered it is nearly bursting with fish, and the playfully postmodern gobo salad omusubi (pictured front on left, $2.00), which combines two traditional Japanese dishes (kinpira gobo and onigiri) in one unusual yellow soy wrapper. The contrasting textures of the crunchy burdock root alongside the sticky rice work beautifully here. Also excellent are the lobster salad, at $2.50, possibly the cheapest lobster in the city, the hearty circular eel rice ball (pictured on Flickr, $2.50), and the miso tuna ($2.80), a very savory combination of smoky marinated tuna, nozawana pickles, and black sesame that possesses a surprisingly complex and sultry flavor profile. We have been less impressed with the simple bonito flake omusubi (pictured above, middle, $1.50), an onigiri variety that we have enjoyed elsewhere, but that here tastes dissapointingly like a Slim Jim hand roll. Moreover, given the large volume of business Oms/b does during the lunch rush, it regularly has pre-prepared onigiri in its deli cases. This is a fine solution for nearly all of the omusubi, with the clear exception of anything made with crispy fried ingredients-we have sampled a few wilted shrimp and spied a few pieces of very soggy-looking chicken waiting behind glass during the restaurant's peak hours. Fortunately, Oms/b prepares all of its omusubi to order, if so requested. During lunch, such a special request might triple or quadruple the wait time, but for anything that contains deep fried ingredients, the tradeoff is well worth it. While you wait, there's a secret house specialty waiting to be nibbled upon, and one that is easily among the best dishes at Oms/b: the calamari salad ($2.50). We are completely smitten with its palate-tickling brinksmanship; the fiery glazed squid pieces and crunchy seaweed teeter on the verge of spicy heat and vegetal coolness, back and forth, all in one bite. Best of all, the dish isn't a palate killer, so by the time the staff announce your \"Oms/b\" are ready, you'll still be able to taste every bite. Oms/b, 156 East 45th Street (near Third Avenue), 212-922-9788.

How many Omusubi would you estimate a hungry but relatively broke girl would need to order to satisfy her need for lunch?

Hi Sarah, I'd say three of the triangular ones, if you're hungry. Maybe two, if you're just peckish. As for the smaller ones (like the unagi), you might need four. But it isn't hard to get full for $5 or $10 here. Nosher

Taking the Kingswood out for a Test Drive

***CONTENT
 In Australia, a Kingswood is a model of car produced by the Holden subsidiary of General Motors. With its boxy outline and prominent grille, it looks suspiciously like an El Camino, with all the El Cam's blue-collar associations. In fact, Kingswoods have come to be icons of sorts, stand-ins for a certain kind of hard-graft nostaligia for the 1960s and 70s. Today, Kingswoods tend to be driven either ironically, or by what the Aussies call bogans-Antipodean rednecks, if you will. Take one look inside Kingswood (the restaurant), and it becomes immediately clear that a bogan sensibility is not what owner Nick Mathers had in mind in designing his newly opened Australian and British-inspired bistro in the West Village. That Nick, also of the Aussie burger and sandwich joint Ruby's on Mulberry Street in NoLiTa, hasn't bothered to let his American customers in on the joke, seems a bit strange-don't New Yorkers love an ironic name more than just about anyone? Stranger still is that Kingswood does not announce itself or explain its origins or heritige in many ways at all-other than a lone Australian at the front of the house and a mostly antipodean wine list, there isn't much to alert you that Kingswood is an import from down under. Aboriginal paintings are rejected in favor of retro, almost Victorian wallpaper, and a strikingly blue stuffed peacock is the only fauna in the room. The same approach holds true for the menu: unlike Eight Mile Creek or the New Zealand gastropub Nelson Blue, there's nary a kangaroo skewer or barramundi in sight. The only nods to Australia are subtle ones like the Bronte burger, a classic Oz treat that's topped with cheese and a sweet chili sauce and, on the dessert menu, an Eton Mess, a sloppy meringue parfait which is more of a British classic in any case. And this is just as well, because anything as kitschy as an outback or Crocodile Dundee theme would inevitably distract from a restaurant whose cooking is generally very good, and in one or two cases, exceptional. This became clear from our first visit last week, where our appetizers included a peach salad ($12) with a wholly original and extremely pleasing combination of mesclun greens, croutons, savory crisped prosciutto, silky roasted peaches, and a large dollop of tangy, creamy mascarpone. The prosciutto, with its aggressive saltiness, and the acidic white balsamic vinaigrette would normally overpower a salad like this; however, the balance of the dried meat, tongue-coating cheese, and the honey-sweet peaches was unexpectedly wonderful. With this creative dish-one of the best salads we have eaten this year- we felt Kingswood’s originality kick into second gear. Our other starter was one of the evening's specials, a creamy celery soup (pictured above, $8) that our waitress dubbed a 'celery extravaganza,' no doubt inspired by the doubling up of celery and celery root purée in the broth, not to mention a small nest of thinly sliced, limp and greasy fried celeriac in the center of the soup. While we enjoyed the flavors of blue cheese and apple in the soup, the texture of the liquid was a bit hard to stomach-it was puréed (almost whipped) to within an inch of its life, yielding a foam that looked beautiful, but tasted like spooning out the froth from a cup of celery cappuccino. Still, the soup's flavors were well-considered and worked well together, even if the soup would have been much better with a slice of the prosciutto from the peach salad thrown on top. For main courses, our order of herb roasted rack of lamb (pictured above, $25) was cooked just past the requested level of doneness, and the portion was a disappointingly skimpy two chops. The crust, a mix of fresh herbs and parmesan, was too subtle to stand up to the accompanying tomato orzo, which, with its rich and aromatic sauce, turned out to be the best thing on the plate. On the other hand, the fish in Nosher’s monkfish curry ($21) was extraordinarily tender, something difficult to do with a fish that is notoriously gristly and difficult to cook. That said, the curry itself-Goan style, with coconut, tomato and a raita yogurt-was just a bit too sweet, with a few pieces of raw onion in the curry offering an unwelcome distraction from what would otherwise have been an excellent dish. Our dining companion for the evening, Mary Ann Singleton, coincidentally raised in Perth, Western Australia, enjoyed a plate of pumpkin linguine ($18) with generous chunks of pumpkin flesh. Not overcooked into a hot mush as it sometimes is, the pumpkin here retained a toothsome bite. As Mary Ann commented, the dish would be an admirable option for vegetarians, and not a lesser one, at that. Having now sampled half of Kingswood’s remarkably short menu (including appetizers, there are only 11 items), we can safely say that it is easily the best of the new crop of Australian and Australian-inspired restaurants that have opened in New York over the past five years-even if it feels less Aussie then any of them. And perhaps because of its stealthy approach, despite its provenance from the other side of the world, Kingswood feels like it fits: as comfortable as an old, beat-up, gas-guzzling jalopy, but one retrofitted with luxurious leather seats and a sunroof. Kingswood, 121 West 10th Street, between Greenwich and Sixth Avenues. 212-645-0044.

 Our roving correspondent Noshingtonienne has an excellent eye for spotting trends-she's a demographic economist by training, so she knows a craze when she sees one. So when she wrote to tell us all about the lastest culinary fad sweeping England these days, we knew we had to have her write something about how, while we Yanks sit nibbling on our small plates and snacking on cupcakes, the Brits are slurping away at an old American fave, the milkshake. London and its suburbs play home to 31 milkshake shops and stands (at last count), Brighton houses six, and even Oxford, with a paltry 150,000 residents, manages to support three of them. Further evidence that the UK is the middle of a full-on blended blitz: all but one of the milkshake shops opened in the past 24 months, and while all do make smoothies, the most popular drinks are, by far, made with lots of ice cream. Noshingtonienne spoke with some of the staff at one of these new businesses, Shaken Stephens (with locations in Bristol and Oxford), and reports: This morning I had a lovely chat with Christian, and it seems this really is a new situation. I was really interested in learning what the most popular shakes and smoothies were, and Christian was very quick to announce that among the smoothies, women really like the \"pink peach\" (peach, raspberry, strawberry, apple), and that on weekends, the \"Hangover helper\" (pineapple, spirulina, and lime) is very big. I was also intrigued by the health/healing section [in no small part since it resembles Jamba Juice's offerings], and was told that the \"Athlete's super edge\" (strawberry, apple, almonds, vanilla, natural yogurt, protien [sic]) was the most popular amongst guys coming from the gym. I did not have the heart to ask about the \"Bone up solution,\" or rather, i didn't think i could do so with a straight face. And as for those shakes [the most popular drinks at all of the milkshake shops], despite a devoted clientele of at least a few Americans, the overwhelming favorites indicate that it is largely Brits doing the sipping: the biggest sellers are the Aero mint and the Dime bar mix-in drinks, followed by shakes with Cadbury confections (creme egg and caramel). And of course, any drink with Malteasers is popular too. I thought it was important to try a shake, given it was only me on the tasting prowl. At this point, as for what to try, I decided Christian had been a great tour guide already, so I was going to defer to him and ask him his favorite shake. When his response was a confident \"Chocolate fudge brownie,\" relayed with a big grin, I threw caution to the wind and went with it. I opted for a small (£2.60- $5.22), rather than a large (£3.20- $6.44), as it really didn't look so small. And even though I hadn't had breakfast, the idea of a 20-ounce British pint-size shake seemed a bit much, even as a meal replacement. I admittedly don't have shakes often, so when I do, I have high standards- Pittsburgh's The Original Hot Dog Shop's chocolate shake or a Ted Drewes chocolate concrete from St. Louis are my benchmarks. My UK shake was definitely thick and creamy and very slurpable. I suppose the emphasis was definitely on the cream, and I can't say that the shake was what I would have called fudgy- the Brits don't often do the \"brownie\" well. So this was more of a vanilla cream shake with very finely ground bits of chocolate, rather than a chocolate fudge brownie. Despite all of that, it was quite refreshing, particularly as the sun was peeking out-not the best shake I've had, but not bad. In fact, it really hit the spot. And the shake concept is charming and very different from other British treats. While drinking and walking afterwards, I couldn't help but think about the sustainability/viability of the Oxford milkshake market. The shop has row upon row of candy bars and 'extra ingredients' that are opened and popped into awaiting blenders-and with 150+ extras on hand at shops like Moo Moo's and Shake Away, you can imagine some of the profit disappearing into keeping these items fresh. But food staples in the UK-milk, eggs, bread, fruit, even ice cream, etc.- remain inexpensive, even by US dollar standards, so I can imagine shop margins being pretty good, so long as they can stay in business. The big question I had, of course, was: Can a small town like Oxford handle three or four shake shops? It's not unlike the cupcake bakery situation. What was particularly curious to me was how these guys were going to fare as soon as it turns cold, like, say, next month. Already it sounds like things have slowed down now that the summer's drawn to a close, and Christian mentioned that while they also offer a handful of paninis, it is quieter around Shaken Stephen's. It will be interesting to return to take a future milkshake census! We have yet to see much evidence that a Gotham milkshake invasion is close at hand, but we have spotted a few new blended drinks in town that are worth a taste. As we mentioned recently, Ronnybrook Milk Bar makes some stellar and fabulously creamy concoctions from its own fresh and local dairy products. But our personal favorite slushy, creamy drink of the past year has to be the green tea frappé from Café Zaiya and Beard Papa (locations on the UWS, 41st Street, and East Village)- not technically a milkshake, as it is not made with ice cream. The Zaiya matcha frappé (pictured left, $3.65) is made by blitzing together ice, fresh heavy cream, a little sugar, and plenty of high quality green tea powder. Its allure comes in part from its strong, almost malty tea flavor, as well as its delicate and subtle sweetness-the frappé is only about a third as sweet as a normal milkshake, which makes it lighter and much less cloying than an ice cream-based drink. Perhaps the next British invasion starts right here, with a Japanese tea frappé-if so, consider us conquered.

At These Prices, It's No Picnick

 Until recently, looking for lunch in Battery Park meant having to make do with soggy hot dogs from carts or plastic containers of steam table food from grubby delis on surrounding streets. From the beginning of this month, however, the culinary wasteland at the toe of Manhattan's silk stocking has been marginally improved by the addition of a pair of perfectly formed kiosks, both with the curiously spelled name of Picnick. With such a moniker, you might expect the person behind the scenes, to be a Nicholas or Nikolai, but instead, the kiosks are the brainchild of Will Goldfarb, the pastry chef polymath and part-time molecular gastronomer last seen at the recently shuttered Room 4 Dessert, and his partner, former Thor chef Kevin Pomplun. Together, the two chefs have put together a small menu of six sandwiches, two salads, and three desserts, each suitable for enjoying at one of a handful of new tables set up in the rechristened 'Battery Bosque' overlooking Upper New York Bay and the Statue of Liberty. Picnick doesn't just come with a pedigree, it comes with a near-obsessive eco-friendly philosophy; not only are all the ingredients locally sourced (and if they're not, larger suppliers must meet Fair Trade quotas or sign onto what the kiosks' owners call 'socially conscious philanthropy'), but all of Picnick's cups, cutlery and plastic containers are made from biodegradable materials, including cups made from cornstarch (they disintegrate at 130 degrees)-even the printed labels are suitable for composting. Picnick's behind-the-counter appliances are powered by wind as part of a new ConEd program that allows you to choose where your electricity is generated and a portion of profits go to the Battery Conservancy, which looks after the park. This degree of eco-consciousness is not without its cost, however, as evidenced by the stratospheric prices of Picnick's sandwiches. My Pork n' Roll, not much more than a ham sandwich with plenty of dry patches, was priced at an unconscionable $8.95. My colleague Candide's caprese sandwich, made from low-flavor local green tomatoes, fantastic mozzarella from Joe's Dairy on Sullivan Street, and fresh basil leaves, was only a dollar cheaper-and for the price, its ingredients ought to have been more consistently good. With a drink (iced tea is $2.95, lemonade is a U.S.Open-like $3.95), lunch for one can quickly approach $13.00. No wonder the only other customers we saw at Picnick were Wall Street bond traders or Western European tourists flaunting their strong Euros. Thank goodness then, for the desserts, or more precisely, one dessert - the pale pistachio panna cotta. At $3.95, one of Picnick's few bargains-our panna cotta was an enormous serving of nutty, creamy green goodness, topped with a filmy layer of strawberry compote (minus any actual berries on the cupful we were served) and sprinkled with crunchy pistachio shavings. Too bad that the other desserts, including a chocolate chip cookie ($1.95) and a blueberry muffin ($2.95) were less experimentally Goldfarbian and generally lackluster (a dash or two more salt would have made things much better). Perhaps the most curious part of the Picnick story is that its owners chose to open the kiosks so late in the season. Sure, late September, with the sun still strong and a lingering promise of just a few more weeks of clement weather, should be the perfect time to enjoy sweeping views off of Manhattan's southernmost tip. The worry is, at these prices, can anyone afford to? Picknick, Just east of Castle Clinton, Battery Park. No phone. info@mypicnick.com

Bread Bar at Tabla: American is Indian

 Refugees from the world of biochemistry, especially ones who, like me, found their way to the world of food, hold a special place in my heart. This subtle bias is one reason why we have avoided writing about Floyd Cardoz, fellow test tube jockey manqué, and his Tabla restaurant partnership with Danny Meyer. But after much soul-searching, HungryMan and our friend Chopper made an executive decision that among the three of us, we could and would keep each other honest enough to write about Bombay native Cardoz's Indian-inflected American fusion cooking. So with our checks and balances in place, we set out for a mid-September al fresco dinner at Madison Park's Bread Bar at Tabla, intent on enjoying what promised to be the last of the season's warm evening weather. Open since 1997, Tabla and its more casual sibling Bread Bar at Tabla, have built a strong reputation among critics by offering dishes that blend traditional Indian ingredients and preparations with more Anglo-European culinary ideas, all with an eye towards harmony and balance. This is possible because Cardoz, who once worked under Gray Kunz at Lespinasse, is fluent enough in both idioms that he is comfortable curing Atlantic salmon and equally comfortable infusing it with tamarind. In practice, this means that Tabla and the Bread Bar's menus comprise dishes that range from very traditional Indian specialties like garlic naan and mint chutney to hybrid fantasies like a fricassée of morels in a taro-coconut purée. On our most recent visit, we sat on the airy patio on the corner of 25th Street and ordered several items to share. Our server recommended we aim for five items plus breads, and this turned out to be just about perfect. We began with a heaping bowl of the eggplant bharta (pictured top, $9), which was meltingly soft, lightly smoky, and smelled like candied ginger. It went beautifully with both the rosemary naan and the makai ki roti, a mustard seed and corn bread (pictured in background at top, $4 for each bread). As we sat nibbling on the bharta and naan, more dishes arrived one at a time, with a gap of a few minutes between each arrival-an ideal pace for a small-plates meal. First came a hearty bowl of bhoondi raita ($6), a cumin-scented yogurt and chickpea dumpling dish that we adored so much we devoured it in mere seconds. Then, when our gram flour onion rings (pictured above, $11) arrived, we all leaned in close to get a good whiff of their peppery aroma. Unfortunately, they were slightly too greasy to eat without making a huge mess, leaving slicks of oil behind, even when they were transferred to a plate and cut with a knife and fork. Another mild disappointment was the flank steak (pictured above, $9), cooked in the tandoor with a Goan spice mixture and served with a very sweet chili and tamarind raita. We found the meat to be jaw-achingly tough in places, not to mention bone dry. Whereas we polished off all of the onion rings with an extra napkin or twelve, most of this dish went uneaten, which is a shame because the saucing was a lush combination of fiery spice and tangy sweetness. Fortunately, everyone's favorite dish redeemed the meal completely. The Kerala-style scallop pepper fry ($17), a chunky and quite spicy seared seafood dish, gave us all plenty of reasons to return to the Bread Bar. We loved the combination of textures of the thick, almost crunchy chunks of fresh coconut meat and the tender scallop flesh. Moreover, the serious peppery kick from the dish gave the seared scallops a soothing aspect that made us think twice about the role of the shellfish in the dish-was it the lead player or the back-up relief? Regardless, this was a fantastic dish, and enough to put the flank steak out of our minds completely. We ordered two desserts, one of which, the pleasing but unexciting caramel cashew tart ($8), served with candied ginger ice cream and a vanilla bourbon sauce, left us simply wanting more. And did we ever get it in the form of the vanilla kulfi with peach and ginger compote ($8), an extraordinary riff on a very American dish: peach cobbler. Kulfi, a dense, molded frozen dairy treat was the focal point of the dish in part because of its mesmerizing conical shape, and in part because its density meant that the compote had to be served with serrated grapefruit spoons. An ingenious reinterpretation of a canonical dessert that made us all happy we stuck around after our meal. With just a few exceptions, it was not hard to declare the dinner a solid success- certainly enough to justify a return visit to the patio sometime soon, and without a doubt enough to make us all glad that Floyd Cardoz made it out of the enzyme labs of Bombay and into his New York kitchen. Bread Bar at Tabla, 25th Street and Madison Avenue, 212-889-0667.

Geisha: Martinis for Models

 When SisNosh comes to New York for one of her legendarily bacchanalian ‘weekends with the girls,’ she arrives with a passel of five or six of her friends in tow, each traveling sans spouse, and all looking to have fun, fun, and a bit more fun. Shopping is almost always involved, as is a visit to a day spa and a series of raucous dinners punctuated by titillating stories of gossip from back home. This is not the crowd to take to Bouley, Eleven Madison Park or Cru, or any hushed, candlelit dining room. No, these are meals at which feeling yourself at the pulsating heart of life in the big city is what counts, and all the other, less glamourous nights of the year? For a few days, they just don't matter. This plan was in full effect last week when SisNosh booked a table for eight at Geisha, a three-story Upper East Side confection of Japanese/French inspired food and design owned by the same folks behind Lollipop lounge and Serafina. Although it is three years old, Geisha is a venue with a bustling, bourgeois vibe, attracting as it does a substantial number of the city's botox dependent, party-obsessed, and impossibly thin. And because SisNosh's visit coincided with Fashion Week, the restaurant's hip quotient was multiplied a few times over- models just off the runways preened everywhere, crowding the bar entrance with breathless conversations about Heatherette and generally towering over the other patrons in their pencil thin stilettos. But it wasn't all models, even at the peak of tent season; Geisha also seemed to be populated by an equal number of aging ex-fraternity boys. This may of course be no coincidence. No matter the reason for their presence, we found that negotiating our way among the heaving crowds to one of the dining rooms in the back or upper floors transported us back to ill-advised college parties- only with more wealthy, better looking participants. And to add to the verisimilitude, sound levels at Geisha are not much softer than at a Sigma Pi weekend kegger. But Geisha isn’t all about the scene it cultivates. The promise of creative Japanese-French fusion cuisine is a consistent draw for the restaurant. One explanation for Geisha's culinary reputation is its somewhat unexpected links to Le Bernardin: executive chef Michael Vernon spent seven years at Le Bernardin, and Geisha's consulting chef is Eric Ripert, still head chef at the renowned French restaurant ten blocks south. But the place where Geisha's pedigree shows up most clearly is in the presentation of food, with enormous attention paid to plating visually striking dishes. One excellent example is the daintily composed triptych of fish tartars (pictured top), a large portion of minced mackerel, yellowfin tuna, and salmon. Prepared by sushi chef Don Pham, the dish includes three perfect squares of Spanish mackerel, yellowfin tuna and salmon, each one more delicate and buttery than the last. At $29, this sizeable appetizer probably belongs on the menu with the main courses, but it is also remarkably not the most expensive starter. The $75 three-ounce Wagyu beef appetizer wins that prize. Nosher's fried bluepoint oysters ($16) with sriracha sauce were also presented beautifully on a bed of salt and were also generally a hit, although we thought the creamy base for the sriracha neutralized the mineral flavors in the oysters; a pure hit of the crimson chili-garlic sauce would have worked better. Yet where the tartars and oysters generally found their target, other starters were definite misses, including a set of three shrimp ‘lollipops’ ($14), so called because they were impaled on sugar cane skewers. The shrimp were well-grilled, but a coriander and ginger marinade wasn’t strong enough to cut through the char on the shellfish and the flavorless sugar cane seemed to give the enterprise more gimmick than gas. My own starter, billed as an Asian pear and crab salad ($14) contained both in such minute quantities it was hard to find or taste even a hint of either one. In the end, the salad was an over-hyped frisée salad with rare hints of Peetytoe crab that was powerfully overshone by the aggressively acidic yuzu vinaigrette. The story was much the same with the main dishes. My duck breast (pictured above, $29) was tough, overdone, and just barely pink inside. Moreover, our server never returned to pour a promised five spice duck jus theatrically over the dish as he did for neighboring tables-perhaps he was, like most of the other staff in the restaurant, busy making a pilgrimage to a neighboring table where Kyra Sedgwick sat chatting with a friend. Unfortunately, without its sauce, the duck lacked moisture and flavor-we would have gladly foregone the jus for another little miserly scoop of the excellent cauliflower purée. Nosher ordered the poached halibut ($29), but the kitchen had run out of it by 9 p.m. and instead offered to substitute scallops, which was perfectly acceptable. However, the kitchen changed more than just the seafood: rather than poach the scallops, they chose to grill them and then set them in the poaching liquid, which seemed a bizarre method of creating an alternative to the halibut. Adding insult to injury was the tiny portion-three quarter-sized scallops and four grape tomatoes. Other mains were all good, if a bit underwhelming, including a too-fatty beef short rib ($32) that was saved by its tender braising, a grilled rack of lamb ($33) overshadowed by an innovative goat cheese, tomato, zucchini and summer squash tart, and a well-portioned, though somewhat tough filet mignon (pictured above, $34). Helping to wash down all this meat and fish is Geisha’s impressive list of sakes, with a few fine varieties available by the glass. You can also find Japanese shochu by the glass, bottle, or splashed into a number of creative mixed drinks. SisNosh especially enjoyed the yuzu basil martini ($14), a sweet yet powerful combination of Toyonaga shochu, Japanese lime juice, water, and a generous shredding of basil leaves. Only one cocktail, the ill-conceived Hana San-made with passion fruit juice, cinnamon, mint, and vodka and tasting like salty wood epoxy-was not pleasant. Nearly every one of the several drinks we tasted was excellent, even if a few, like the mango mojito and chocolate martini were unwelcome reminders of Geisha’s studied trendiness. Perhaps the restaurant's great success at creating successful specialty drinks is the real measure of Geisha, a place where moneyed and fabulous clientele can imbibe in a pseudo-Japanese boudoir atmosphere while noshing on an occasional piece of sashimi here and there. Drinks are the real center of gravity here, and food may not be an afterthought, but it is clearly secondary. Geisha, 33 East 61st Street, between Madison and Park Avenues, 212-813-1112.

Ninth Street Espresso: Packed and Triple-Loaded

***CONTENT
 If Captain Hook needed a little pick-me-up after a busy day of pillaging and looting, chances are good he would find his way to Ninth Street Espresso, despite the fact that his claw might just cause a bit of trouble with a demitasse cup. The only java house in town with its own cup-and-saucer emblazoned Jolly Roger flag, Ninth Street Espresso seems to imagine itself as a caffeine-fueled pirate nation with its own strict and Shopsinesque legal code: store rules include no cell phones, no pets, and no half-decaf/half-regular drinks. Yet observing and respecting the shop's unique culture is a small price to pay for some of the very finest coffee to be found anywhere in the city. Ninth Street Espresso's beans all come from Counter Culture Coffee, a widely-celebrated sustainable artisanal roaster in Durham, North Carolina that also supplies The Spotted Pig, Franny's, Café Grumpy, and The Tasting Room. But fantastic beans-and Counter Culture's beans are genuinely terrific-only account for a portion of the success of an espresso shot; the rest is pure methodology. At Ninth Street Espresso, a triple dose of ground beans (21 grams versus 7 grams) are tamped and extracted for each shot. What results is a deeply ruddy cup of java with a nutty crema and a depth of aromatic flavors like anise and mace, the likes of which we have tasted nowhere else. This is an exceedingly good cup of coffee. It also makes wonderful lattes and cappuccinos, as well as very fine iced drinks. My personal favorite is the iced americano ($2.50), which retains all of the richness and complexity of the hot version. HungryMan is partial to the iced latte ($4.25), but in general, everything on Ninth Street Espresso's very short menu is superb. This holds true at the location near Avenue C, as well as at the new shop inside Chelsea Market. The only downside to the café's shared retail area inside Chelsea Market is that it cannot enforce its own separatist pirate legal code in the common space. But nevermind-the Ninth Street Espresso flag still flies over the heads of the mostly pierced and bearded baristas, and if you squint, you can just picture them all with peg legs and eyepatches, even if no one is forced to walk the plank for sending a text message. Ninth Street Espresso, 700 East Ninth Street (at Avenue C), and 75 Ninth Avenue, 212-358-9225.

Rebel, Rebel: Chai Thai Home Kitchen

***CONTENT
 The stretch of Eighth and Ninth Avenues from Columbus Circle to 34th Street has more Thai restaurants than any other sort-there are even more Thai eateries in this area than laundromats. While a few among the competitors in this overcrowded market have cultivated a reputation for quality-Pam Real Thai and Wondee Siam are widely regarded as the best-respected of the lot-most play the law of culinary averages, putting out safe, uninteresting, and often bland dishes that are bound neither to impress nor offend anyone. Which is why when HungryMan and I want Thai food, we generally leave our Little Bangkok and trek out to Woodside. But with the recent opening of Chai Thai Home Kitchen (also known simply as 'Chai') on Eighth Avenue, that may change. Chai does one thing very differently from most other local Thai restaurants: it takes chances with its preparations and ingredients, incorporating French, Vietnamese, and even Japanese flavors into its dishes without resorting to a hackneyed 'pan-Asian' theme. The rebel responsible for the gentle fusion is chef Amornrat Fukuda. Fukuda trained first in Asia and then here in Soho's Mercer Kitchen before helping start the original Chai Thai Home Kitchen in Williamsburg. Along the way, she picked up Vietnamese and Japanese influences and a traditional Thai home-style sous chef, Wanwisa Khetpanya. And by the time the pair landed on the corner of 55th Street and Eighth Avenue, they were ready to shake up Manhattan's Thai scene. On a small scale, at least-the restaurant fits only 18 two-tops. Yet the miniscule size of Chai's space is offset by its playful, modern design whose most striking feature is an open rock pool, the side of which is used as prime window seating. It's a clever and appealing touch that makes the space feel more open from the inside and outside. That said, when we have told friends of ours about the restaurant, we have warned them not to sit on the backless pool ledge if they plan to take advantage of Chai's ample selection of sakés. Rice wine and Zen pools don't mix. Fortunately, the flavors at Chai generally do. One of our very favorite dishes, the crispy shrimp with Thai celery and yellow curry (pictured above, $14) mixes mostly classic curry elements with a lovage-like mild celery flavor, giving the dish an undertone that reminds us of a French mirepoix base. The dish, only avaliable at dinner, is on the special menu, but we hope to see Fukuda add it to the regular roster. More traditional dishes, such as the pad thai ($8), are also very solid and consistently good. The ratio of tamarind to chili in Chai's pad thai is just right, as is the light touch with the oil- good pad thai should never be greasy. Also impressive is the staff's eagerness to ask about diners' spice preferences, and equally, to communicate these to a kitchen staff willing to listen. Whenever we have requested food spicy, it has been just that-no need to beg for food to be made grob grob, just to have it come back with half a microgram of chili hidden in the garnish. It is clear that Fukuda and Khetpanya respect their diners' palates enough to give them what they want and to offer them just enough intriguing fusion flavor combinations to keep them guessing. It's a plan that just might work, even in this neighborhood. Chai Thai Home Kitchen, 930 Eighth Avenue (at 55th Street), 212-707-8778.

Ronnybrook Milk Bar, Bringing All the Boys to the Yard

 When I caught Tina, a vegan acquaintance, making herself a glass of chocolate milk, I smiled at her slyly as she put her hand on her hip, waggled her wooden spoon defensively in my direction, and announced, \"I'll drink milk as long as I have visited the farm and know that the cows are treated well.\" I wasn't convinced. \"This,\" she announced, pointing at the heavy glass bottle on the countertop, \"is from Ronnybrook Farm Dairy, and I know the cows there. They all seem very happy.\" Tina poured her milk into a glass while I nodded. While I have never paid a visit to Ronnybrook's Ancramdale farms, about ten miles due east of Bard College, I have drunk and cooked with enough of their spectacular unhomogenized Creamline milk to believe her when she claims that the cows behind the scenes are content ones. One of only three family-operated dairy farms left in the Hudson Valley, Ronnybrook has been supplying greenmarkets across the city for the past thirty years, but it was not until the Osofsky family, original owners of the dairy, opened their first shop in Chelsea Market in 1997 that the brand really started to gain traction. Then early this year, their retail space was shuttered, expanded, and completely redesigned to look like a rustic, yet ultra-modern barn-it is part mid-century diner, part creamery, and with its iMac cash registers, part urban business. The menu focuses on savory items like eggs, sandwiches, and salads, as well as sweet treats that are either made with milk or designed to pair well with it. Among the dessert items, our favorite is the Ice Cream Shake (pictured top, $4.75), especially when it is made with Ronnybrook's Ginger Creme Brulee ice cream; thick as poured plaster and zingy with plenty of spicy crushed ginger, this milkshake works best on its own or after a meal. This is just how we finished off a quick weekend brunch at Ronnybrook Milk Bar yesterday, and it should come as no surprise that the milkshake was, by leaps and bounds, the best part of our meal. This is not to say that we did not enjoy our other dishes. In particular, HungryMan's Cast Iron Eggs with Asparagus and fresh Farmer's cheese (pictured above, $8.00) was generally very good, especially the gently-cooked eggs and the lovely salty crumble of Ronnybrook's own cheese. It was a shame that the asparagus had made the eggs a bit watery in their little cast iron pan, and even more so that, by 3:00 in the afternoon, the restaurant had completely run out of potatoes for the dish. And it wasn't just potatoes that were struck off the menu: lavender (for the lavender infused milk), all varieties of muffins, and chicken salad were also not available during our visit this weekend. I opted for the watercress salad with peaches and Poughkeepsie's own Sprout Creek Ouray cheese ($7.50). I was disappointed with the completely flavorless peach slices, especially since right now is the tail end of prime peach season in New York. And while the watercress itself was fresh and peppery and a sprinkling of pistachios gave the greens a robust crunch, the whole salad was rather skimpy and left me wishing my side order of roasted potatoes with chives ($3.00) had not been canceled. But in the end, all it took was a nice hot cup of Barrington Roasting Company coffee ($1.75) to make things right again-as much for the java (which we have written about before), as for a generous pouring of Ronnybrook's own half-and-half added to my cup. Sure, the Milk Bar has a few supply kinks to work out, but even at its worst, the restaurant can fall back on its plentiful and superior quality dairy products-milk so good, even vegans can't seem to resist. Ronnybrook Milk Bar, 75 Ninth Avenue (in Chelsea Market), 212-741-MILK.

A Sandwich Worth Celebrating at Margon

***CONTENT
 Twenty years ago this month, I ate my first sandwich in Manhattan. This is not the sort of anniversary that I would normally celebrate, but when I clarify that the sandwich in question was from Margon, you might understand why I'm slicing myself a piece of tres leches cake and reminsicing about cubanos past. I cannot recall why I, at seventeen, was wandering the streets of midtown that September, but I recognize now how fortunate I was that one of my companions that day was a Miami native wise enough to force me through the little semi-subterranean entrance to Margon. Raised on Cuban cuisine from the legendary Versailles restaurant, my pushy friend knew just by the smell of the roast pork and the toasting bread that we were in for something special, so I deferred to his expertise, sat down and ate. Quite a bit has changed in the intervening two decades: many of the local Latin diners have closed, and among the Cuban establishments left, most have been bought out by Dominicans-hence the blending of island cuisines on the menu at Margon. But a few things have remained unchanged in their every detail, among them the recipes for Margon's staple classics: the Cuban sandwich, octopus salad, and creamy batidos (fruit milkshakes). I took HungryMan for his first Margon lunch this past week, eager to find out how he, another South Florida native, found the sandwiches. In recent years, I have come back to Margon dozens of times, but because the café is open only for weekday and Saturday breakfasts and lunches, HungryMan and I had never been able to arrange a meal there together. But in honor of my sandwich anniversary, he took the afternoon off. And having eaten a few bites of the crisp, pressed Cuban sandwich ($5.00), he was already scheming ways to schedule an afternoon meeting in Times Square for next week. Part of the magic of Margon's cubano is its deft use of traditional elements: roast pork meat, swiss cheese, ham, sliced pickles, and mayonnaise. But equally as important to the success of the sandwich is the unorthodox inclusion of a few slices of garlicky salami, a flourish that makes the pork in the sandwich taste sweeter. HungryMan wasted no time in declaring it \"one of the two or three best Cuban sandwiches I have ever eaten.\" No arguments here. As good as the Cuban sandwiches are, the tuna sandwich ($5.00) and the chicken sandwich ($5.50) are also consistently excellent, not to mention inexpensive. We are also big fans of Margon's octopus salad ($9.75 as a platter, $6.00 alone), a marinated cold salad that is good enough to win over the most tentacle-phobic. What makes the salad so surpassingly good is the lime and olive flavors that give the toothsome seafood a refreshing complexity and salinity. Ours came with an order of either yellow rice or plaintains, and having never tried Margon's tostones, we opted for the plaintains, which while free of grease and remarkably light, were just a bit dry. Underneath or alongside a stew, these would have been ideal to sop up juices, but on their own, they needed a bit more moisture. If you order the tostones alone, be sure to ask for an extra ladleful of the slightly tart garlic sauce-one is not enough. After polishing off our food, HungryMan and I ordered one of Margon's impossibly thick batidos for the walk back home. My favorite is the mamey, made with crushed Charentais-like mamey melon, vanilla, and chipped ice. It was the perfect choice for a slow stroll through midtown on a balmy late-summer afternoon-good enough to make HungryMan want to play hooky again soon and good enough to remind me that some anniversaries are worth celebrating, even if they are just for a sandwich. Margon Restaurant, 136 West 46th Street (between Sixth and Seventh Avenues), 212-354-5013.

Happy anniversary, and good find, Nosher! Why am I not surprised you were even scouting out finds in your youth? I will have to check out Margon upon eventual return to Gotham, as I am very picky about my plantains, and having just returned to the States from the UK, let's just say that I could go for a sandwich that is not laden with mayo.

I haven't been able to find a great cuban sandwich spot in Chicago, and your post makes me feel the sadness of this even more. It also makes me want to make up a batch of tres leches (I learned while living in Costa Rica). Happy sandwich day!

Gotham Bar and Grill, Against All Odds

 Close your eyes and imagine for a moment that it is the mid-1980s all over again: Andy Warhol is still alive and compulsively jotting down the names of every person he meets up with, the voice of Pat Benetar wails on endlessly anywhere you turn on the FM dial, and the Cold War shows no signs of ending. Right this moment, in the heat of the \"Me decade,\" if you are lucky enough to score a table at New York's hottest new restaurant, Gotham Bar and Grill, you might see a dining room crowded with more than its share of smarmy Gordon Gekkos and their Working Girl dates, a few disaffected Bright Lights, Big City youth on summer break, and of course, an abomination of shoulder pads. Now flash forward to the present, nearly a quarter of a century later, and amazingly, while most everything else has changed inexorably-what's FM radio again?-Gotham remains as much of a dining destination as it ever was. In large part, the restaurant has been able to maintain its longevity across the decades because of the unwavering attention of one man, executive chef Alfred Portale. You may recognize Portale's name from his gig as a guest judge on Bravo TV's Top Chef this season, or perhaps from small handful of award-winning cookbooks, but Portale moonlights rarely, so chances are good that if you have heard of him, it is through Gotham. Then again, you may also have gotten wind of the James Beard Foundation's Outstanding Chef of the Year award he won just last year-yes, for his work at a twenty-four year old restaurant that, since he arrived, has never had another executive chef. Consistency may be Portale's greatest culinary virtue, but his legacy to restaurants across the country is his signature tall-plating. HungryMan, HungryMom and I witnessed his architectonic stylings this week in dishes like the seafood salad (pictured above, $21), a red lettuce-topped whimsy that resembled an upright pineapple through squinted eyes. We'll admit that there is something charmingly retro about teetering stacks of food-after all, Portale's national and international imitators had their heyday more than a decade ago-but presentation is just an opening salvo at Gotham. When the towers and timbales tumble, the food is what matters, and it is here that Portale really shows his skill. Both of our appetizers were close to flawless, from the pH-precise tang of the vinaigrette-moistened grilled octopus with chick peas, red onions, and cherry tomatoes (pictured top, $19), to the delicate chew of the seafood salad's squid. There were no oversights or afterthoughts on the table. Main dishes also displayed a masterful eye for detail: HungryMan's roast pork with fava beans and polenta ($37) possessed a smoky sear on its exterior while still managing to retain its elemental, essential pork flavor. This is no easy feat; when Julia Child famously pined for chicken that tasted like chicken, this is what she meant-fine quality meat that is prepared so that it becomes more, not less of itself. The roasted plum lent sweet and floral accents to the dish, and we all wondered if the fruit had not been finished with a bit of brandy before plating. HungryMom's grilled New York steak with vidalia onion rings and bordelaise sauce ($44) proved definitively that the pork preparation was no fluke: the beef ran just the right amount of red when it was cut, and its flavors were amplified and improved by the shallot-rich saucing. Only the onion rings were a bit of a let-down, as they were a drop too greasy and tasted as if they had come from a fryer that had perhaps made one too many baskets of rings already. On the other hand, my miso-marinated black cod with sticky rice, bok choi, and a lemongrass sauce ($38) was again nearly perfect, with its crisp seared long edges and quenelle of sticky rice that transformed the dish into a Modern American reinvention of the sushi roll. Yet the cod took traditional Japanese ideas in a new direction, borrowing promiscuously from Chinese and Thai flavors and forcing all three of them to come their own riotous equilibrium on the plate. And the result was sheer pleasure. Compared to Portale, pastry chef Deborah Racicot may be a new kid on the block, but already she has made an indelible mark on the restaurant's menu with her much lauded take on the restaurant's budino-esque chocolate cake ($11). We ordered a slice with a scoop of delicate fresh mint and chocolate chip to finish off our dinner and all found the dessert to be as superb as the rest of the meal. We have been nibbling on Racicot's treats for years now during her stints at Artisanal and Picholine, but it is easy to taste any of her desserts and see how seamlessly her work fits in with Portale's own, especially in playful pastries like her apricot crisp with lavender creme caramel ($11). Racicot brings a homey sensuality to the menu that really humanizes it, making the restaurant feel more confident. Touches like these are all the more crucial when Gotham's dining room seems to be showing its age a bit, finally. The room that one held oversized geometric plaster shapes is now softened with draped fabrics and muted Mediterranean tones, but if you look from just the right angle, it can feel a bit dated. But if anyone can rig up a fabulous quick fix to modernize the place and make it look updated once again, it is Alfred Portale, who was once a jewelry designer-someone who clearly knows how to accessorize, even if his client is the voluminous restaurant he has known and loved for very nearly half his life. Gotham Bar and Grill, 12 East 12th Street (at Fifth Avenue), 212-627-7810.

Eating Your Way Through the US Open, On Court and Off
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-08-31 10:58:00
***CONTENT
 For all the excellent tennis and close-up access to top players it offers, the US Open always seems to bring out the cranky consumer in me. First off, the USTA always seems to sell far more grounds tickets than the National Tennis Center can comfortably accommodate. This means lots of jostling and elbowing through crowds just to move among the outer courts. Secondly, after paying $45 for a day grounds pass, it hardly seems right that visitors should have to endure oppressive quantities of additional advertising and sponsorship. Not only are the players decked out in gear donated by Nike, Penn, Wilson and the like, but courts, placards, cushions and what seems like every flat surface are covered with logos from banks, insurance companies, luxury car companies; and new this year, a house paint company. And then of course, there is everyone’s perennial beef with the Open: the overpriced food-something we have written about twice before. Twelve dollar hamburgers and seven dollar hotdogs are, as my father, with a note of mock indignation in his voice, would have declared, highway robbery. But because anything more than what the tournament organizers call a 'small amount of food' cannot be brought through the gates, spectators literally have nowhere else to go. Perhaps because of the vagueness of this partial prohibition, very few people attempt to bring their own food. This year, Nosher and I saw one forlorn couple hunched over tin foil-wrapped sandwiches and plastic baggies filled with cookies, but they were the only brown baggers we spotted the entire day. So the crowds queue up, giving themselves over to the long lines for muffins and pizza at the Open’s Food Village, groaning as they allow the USTA to pick and choose from among the big bills in their wallets. For us, watching all the the vigorous activity (and a doctor’s temporary admonition against fried foods) pushed us away from the burgers and towards lighter, healthier fare. Nosher ordered a $13 Norvegienne crepe, filled with decent, if slightly dried out smoked salmon, swiss cheese and tomato. As we stood waiting for the crepe, we asked why the cooks all seemed to be ignoring the crepe grill and instead stood dipping into a large cache of pre-prepared crepes. The answer? None of the crepes were made on premises-the grills were there simply for show, while the actual crepe-making happened in, of all places, Miami. I did my best to enjoy a nearly cheeseless chicken Caesar salad ($7) and a plastic bowl of fruit ($7). For institutional food, the salad was passable, and the cantaloupe and pineapple slices were at least notable for tasting very fresh. Still, nothing we ate was worth even a third of what we paid for it. Perhaps we should have ordered our lunch from the Glatt Kosher Food Cart parked nearby-we're guessing that the Open is the only grand slam tennis tournament with such a stall where Jews and non Jews alike can order hot dogs, sandwiches and even knishes, trucked in twice a day, we understand, from New Jersey. Of course, if you really want to avoid overpriced, forgettable snack food, you have to leave the grounds altogether. Which, it turns out, does not mean having to give up on the tennis. Beginning today and stretching until the end of the tournament next weekend, fans can watch US Open matches live on jumbo television screens set up in Madison Square Park. Nearby booths will also offer food of a considerably higher standard than that found on the tournament grounds-Country and Tabla both plan to sell nibbles during the week. But for burgers without the USTA sticker shock, we recommend a walk 100 feet towards the southeast corner of the park and a hop into the line at summer's most popular food stand, the Shake Shack, which will continue to serve its inimitable burgers, dogs, fries and custard- based frozen concoctions throughout the tennis event. By now, the Shake Shack is old news, but it is worth mentioning that the quality hasn’t suffered at Danny Meyer's patty paradise, so if you haven’t been for a while, now is a perfect time to visit. For one thing, the Shack has established a quicker ‘B Line’ for orders that don’t include shakes or hot food (i.e. sodas, ice cream). For another, long waits at the pickup counter are as outdated as a wooden tennis racket because the Shake Shack gives customers buzzers that vibrate when their orders are ready. I stopped by earlier today to check out the US Open setup, and-doctor be damned-couldn't resist the siren song of the Shack. My shack burger (pictured top) was as savory and wonderfully greasy as any that I’ve enjoyed there in years past. Neither too small nor overwhelmingly large, neither too moist for the bun nor too dry, the sandwich reached toward a Platonic ideal of the hamburger and came pretty close to achieving it. Its mayonnaisey, slightly piquant ‘Shack Sauce’ hit its target as well. And at $4.75, the sandwich is a bargain-and when you factor in the widescreen views of Rafael Nadal and Jelena Jankovic in action, it's a downright steal. Glatt Kosher Stand, Savory & Sweet Crepes, Quick Pick Salad and Sandwiches, all at USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows, Queens. Shake Shack and US Open Live at Madison Square Park, at 23rd Street, now through September 9.

Not So Simple at Gaucho Steak Co.

***CONTENT
 Sometimes with red meat, simple is best. Sure, you can get ribs dry rubbed or dipped in any variety of sauce at the growing number of barbecue restaurants around town, za'atar scented kabobs at midtown food carts, and spice-infused steak tartare at dozens of eateries from Orchard to BLT Steak. And by now, a zesty and smoky, falling-off-the-bone tender short rib is as much of a cliché on a New York menu as the beet and goat cheese salad or the molten chocolate cake. But just as aggressive spicing seems to be taking over Gotham, there are a few local restaurants still holding fast to the idea that simple preparations often yield superior results. It's a dangerous idea: there is no hiding the quality of the meat, and more to the point, plain and simple grilling lays bare the skill of the man (or woman) behind the grill like almost no other technique. Simple is only for the brave. This was the lesson we learned last week at Gaucho Steak Co., a closet-sized steakhouse opened on the western edge of Hell’s Kitchen earlier this summer by Food Network celebrity chef Alex Garcia. We visited with good friends Zach from Midtown Lunch and his wife Mrs. Midtown, both of whom are avowed red meat lovers-a perfect tasting team. Among the four of us, we ordered a fillete (beef tenderloin), and two bifes (New York Strip, pictured top). Both were $18, a relative bargain for steak in New York, especially considering that one of twelve side dishes is included in the price. Meats were all of very good quality-the restaurant uses all Uruguayan free-range beef-and seared on a hot parilla grill to achieve a charred exterior and a tender interior. Great in theory, but we were disappointed to discover that two of our steaks, both ordered medium-rare, arrived decidedly medium. Both kinds of steak were served over a bed of marinated, grilled red onions, made sweet and tart from a bath in a simple marinade-a fine way to cut the heaviness of the meat. The other steak accompaniment we were served, a ramekin of surprisingly bland and mild chimichurri sauce, was mostly useless. Side dishes were also hit-or-miss: my swiss chard with cheese was a bitter approximation of steakhouse-staple creamed spinach, while Zach’s Gaucho fries were wonderfully crunchy, salty and hot. Gaucho does serve more than just steak, however. Nosher, the evening's designated non-beef eater (guinea pig), ordered the potato-encrusted salmon ($16) with swiss chard (this time prepared simply with slivers of garlic) and a mango mustard sauce. Dry and overcomplicated, the salmon not only tasted like it had been shaped from modeling clay, its multi-layered preparation also made it seem completely out of place on the menu. In the end, a very hungry Nosher found he couldn’t finish more than a third of it. The choice of salmon is also a bit suspect, especially when Argentina is home to some of the Atlantic's finest seafood-most particularly, the dorado, a fish that grills like a dream, or at least like less of a nightmare than the starch-plastered salmon. Our appetizers were, like the salmon, generally disappointing. These included a selection of unexceptional and oily mushroom empanadas ($3) and two deep-fried dishes: the chicken and manchego croquetas ($7), and the deep fried chicharrones (calamari, $8). The croquetas could have used twice the seasoning they were given, and the squid, while fried expertly, was made just a bit too sweet by a too-generous coating of Argentinean honey. Despite its competent preparations of red meat, we left Gaucho Steak Co. feeling conflicted and more than a little bemused by the restaurant's early efforts to create an identity for itself. The leather tablecloths, metal fittings and burned wood paneling seek to conjure up scenes from the warm grassy steppes of Argentina, but on closer inspection, it is not hard to spot that the steaks are all from Uruguay, the micro-mini wine list features a few iffy Spanish wines alongside Malbecs, and even Alex Garcia, no gaucho himself, is originally from Cuba. But put all of that aside; he may never have ridden a horse through the Tierra del Fuego, but Garcia knows how to grill beef. So if you go, ignore the appetizers and the mismatched multi-culti distractions and just keep it simple: stick to the steak. Gaucho Steak Co., 752 Tenth Avenue, between 51st and 52nd Streets, 212-957-1727.

Having just visited this place last night, 11/14, I too have now had several disappointing experiences with way overcooked steaks and an inability to comprehend the concept \"medium-rare.\" I now conclude that if you want your steak cooked that way here, you should ask for it rare. I'm not sure I'm willing to give this place another chance to test that theory out, however. Despite the great prices, I think I may just resign myself to ponying up another $5 or so at one of the other Argentine-style steak places in town that are capable of consistently preparing food to order.

Pockets from Patagonia: Ruben's Empanadas

***CONTENT
 Empanadas are as complicated and varied a dish as any: practically every country with historical ties to the Iberian Peninsula makes its own self-described 'definitive' version of the dish, and while most look relatively similar, the differences among national empanadas are enough to spark heated debates. If you doubt how touchy people get about their doughy pocket snacks, just stop in to any of the four Ruben's Empanadas locations and ask them a question that makes reference to another-any other-variety of the dish. We made the foolish mistake of drawing a loose, qualified parallel between the Argentine version made at Ruben's and the fat Chilean empanadas we have eaten with our frequent dining companion, Chilena. When we asked about the similarities, our Ruben's counterperson scoffed, \"Chilean empanadas? Yes, they are fat and baked like ours. Yes, the flavors are pretty much the same. But ours use more meat. Much, much more meat. And more meat is better.\" Some of Ruben's Empanadas' little turnovers do indeed contain quite a bit of meat. However, in the versions that succeed best-foremost among these, the Argentine sausage and spicy chicken ($3.69 each)-it is not the quantity as much as the lively spicing of the meat that makes all the difference. Lots of pepper and cumin, along with coriander and even a hint of cinnamon make these dishes the best pockets in the shop, miles and miles better than the flat, bland chicken with bechamel sauce and turkey empanadas (both $3.69). And although in general, spicier empanadas at Ruben's are superior to others, the potato and mozzarella and corn with pimentos and onions (empanadas de humita) are both satisfyingly flavorful, if occasionally a bit undersalted. We won't go so far as to say that we prefer the Argentine empanada to the Chilean version, but Ruben's Empanadas holds the pan-Andean advantage in terms of sheer availablilty, especailly south of Canal Street. And if you happen to be downtown around lunchtime, just when the prospect of choking down another tuna sandwich seems unbearable, it is nice to know that there is another satisfying option nearby. Ruben's Empanadas, 149 Church Street (between Chambers and Warren Streets), 212-513-1448.

I have enjoyed Ruben's spicy shrimp empanadas and their potato empanadas for several years. The fillings are generous, well-spiced and abundant. The price is right. Delivery is quick. I also recommend their black bean soup and fruit beverages (mango juice or papaya juice stand out).

Agree with famdoc. Spicy shrimp & spicy chicken are the best, along with the gazpacho & mango or papaya drink. Have tried Chilean empanadas and they seemed weird - lots of olives and TERRIBLE heartburn.

I got the spicy chicken, beef and corn empanadas at the location on 1st ave, and heated them up at home. The corn was very bland, tasting primarily of canned corn. The beef was great, the spicy chicken ok

It's My Burke in a Box, Girl

***CONTENT
 Nearly 100 years after Selfridges & Co., the UK department store chain, first popularized the concept of a restaurant within a shopping outlet, co-locating dining and retail opportunities has become common practice. Today, you can grab a bite to eat inside a book shop, a furniture store, and even in a haute couture showroom. HungryMan and I affectionately call these symbiotic eateries 'nested restaurants' and sometimes discuss how hard it is for them to break out of mediocrity, tainted as they are by the stigma of the suburban mall food court. But clearly, some have done exactly this. Bergdorf Goodman, for example, has built a reputation for posh excellence that has transferred well to all of its restaurants-most recently BG, on the store's seventh floor. Nicole Farhi also has done well with her Chelsea Market bistro-cum-boutique, 202. What both of these restaurants have in common is that they exist as dining destinations on their own, independent of their conjoined retail twin. When David Burke at Bloomingdale's and Burke in the Box opened a little over 18 months ago, we made a conscious decision to hold off writing about them for at least a year, figuring that the restaurants needed time to develop their own style, fully independent of the flagship Bloomingdale's that plays host to the split-space dining rooms. It would, we suspected, take at least 12 months for any kind of café to emerge from the hulking shadow of Bloomingdale's. So we waited, sampling dishes here and there, but always with the intention of revisiting a more mature version of the bistro sometime in 2007. And this week, when the weather started turning from sweltering to nippy, I met our friend Salli Vates for lunch. Things started out awkwardly when neither we, nor the waitstaff, could determine exactly which restaurant we were in-Burke in the Box and David Burke at Bloomingdale's are separated by Bloomingdale's 59th Street entrance vestibule. Simple enough. Except that, in addition to a long street-facing bar for carry-out customers inside Burke in a Box, there are several reserved tables in the same space that are meant to be occupied only by diners who cannot be seated in the other room. Burke in the box in a box, as it were. In the end, we opted for a two-top in the main David Burke at Bloomingdale's room and quickly placed our orders from the short, well-edited list of hot and cold sandwiches, pizzas, soups, salads and appetizers. We shared an order of the truffle and asiago french fries (pictured top,$4.50) and were delighted to find them steaming hot, crispy, and flavored with plenty of truffle oil-enough to permeate even the crunchiest bits at the bottom of the toque-shaped container in which they were served. Now, I am not someone who believes in the unerring power of the truffle to improve any dish-I think truffles are generally overrated and underscrutinized, especially when they are shaved carelessly over food and used to mask inferior ingredients and preparations, as happens all too often. That said, these fries were splendid, and they were to be my favorite part of the meal. Salli's Maryland Crab Cake Panini (pictured above, $15.95) was also commendable, resembling a cross between a crab salad and a grilled cheese sandwich. We both thought the Old Bay french fries were an excellent complement to the panini, and while they were not quite as exceptional as the truffle and asiago fries, they were light, hot, and well-salted. On the other hand, my grilled vegetable and fresh mozzarella salad (also pictured above, $15.95) was pure disappointment, thanks to the palate-scorching quantity of balsamic vinegar used to coat the vegetables before (and possibly after) grilling. The vegetables were cooked through nicely, with a bit of crunchy texture, but the entire plate had just one flavor: the sweet-and-sour punch of balsamic. Two full glasses of iced tea later, I was able to recover enough of my sense of taste to attempt dessert. For this, Salli and I crossed back over into Burke in the Box, where we ordered a miniature red velvet cupcake ($1.25) and a chocolate creme brulee ($4.95). The cupcake was dense and barely pink inside, with a fatty and bland frosting that added nothing to the cake. Life is too short to waste on lackluster cupcakes. Fortunately, the chocolate creme brulee was gratifyingly creamy, with plenty of intense cocoa flavor. Its one big fault was that its crunchy caramelized sugar top lost all texture after refrigeration, so that by the time we took a bite, the crust was little more than a sweet, scabrous skin. And as Salli and I parted ways, I couldn't help but think that the $27 I had spent on lunch could have been put to much better use. Had we taken our meals to-go in stylish pinstriped Burke in the Box packaging, we would have spent about 33% less, and perhaps at that price we might have felt more satisfied. None of this is to say that I will not be back to this particular nested restaurant-but next time, I will go with a plan to guard against disappontment: order only a glass of wine and the truffle asiago french fries. Not the healthiest lunch, but one that holds the promise of a menu that makes battling past little old ladies clutching Big Brown Bags all worthwhile. David Burke at Bloomingdale's/Burke in the Box, 150 East 59th Street (between Lexington and Third Avenues), 212-705-3800.

Midtown Lunch >> AQ Cafe is Best Deal for Chef Obsessed Midtowners

[...] The most famous in Midtown is 'wichcraft, Tom Collichio's upscale sandwich shop which opened its first location in Bryant Park a few years ago- and now has 4 stores in Midtown (with a 5th coming soon to Herald Square).  David Burke also has Burke in a Box in Bloomingdales, which is best described as \"cheaper\", but not exactly cheap.  And of course there is Matt Kenney's FreeFoods NYC.  (The latter pair, both too pricey to be considered Midtown Lunch'es.)  But by far, the best deal in Midtown for chef obsessed eaters is AQ Cafe, a downscale cafe in the Scandanavian House from Aquavit's Marcus Samuelsson's.  And the best part is, it falls in the Midtown Lunch price range.

Direct from Philly: Liberté, Égalité, & La Colombe Café

***CONTENT
 Barely into Tribeca, just at the point where the smell of rotisserie ducks and five spice powder fades into the background, sits a new café whose coffee might just taste familiar to you. La Colombe Torrefaction, the Philadelphia-based artisanal coffee roaster has, over the past decade, cultivated a sterling reputation among several dozen of the nation's finest chefs (Eric Ripert, Daniel Boulud, Alain Ducasse, etc.), and as a consequence, the company has built a significant business supplying these same restaurateurs with their signature beans. And the list doesn't end with the Michelin multi-starred eateries: Cupcake Café (and Casa Cupcake) has been brewing La Colombe beans for years-this fact plays no small part in their inclusion on most coffee experts' top ten lists of java spots in Manhattan. Yet until early this month, La Colombe only sold beans by mail-order, keeping its legendary baristas rooted in Philly. All of that changed when the Tribeca shop opened for business a few weeks ago. The understated, minimalist corner café has just under 20 seats-all laquered wood stools-and no menu in sight. This is not the sort of restaurant where a 'triple half-caff nonfat double foam extra shot iced grande latte' is yours for the asking; the menu is simple-cappuccinos, espressos (any length), and caffe lattes are the mainstays, with just a few variations on those themes. If this seems a little mean, consider the stakes: the new Tribeca shop is rumored to be paying more than $10K a month in rent to do battle against more than a dozen local Starbucks chains. Every single shot La Colombe pulls has to showcase the coffee's unique character in order to win customers over, so if the staff aren't so keen to add a quart of rice milk and four Equals to your drink, the refusal is not bad attitude as much as it is self-defense. And really, the staff absolutely know what they are doing. Put yourself into their hands and ask for something simple-a long espresso or a cappuccino ($2.00 and $3.50, respectively), perhaps-and you will be rewarded with a cup of coffee with ample body and soft nuances of wood and smoke. Pastries-all from Petrossian Bakery (and all $2.50 or $3.00)-are excellent accompaniments to the coffee, especially the double chocolate giant cookie, a treat that serves at least two people and is rich enough to stand up to very strong espresso drinks, and the almond croissant, which pairs nicely with milky coffees. As much as we adore the hot drinks and slushy granitas at the café, our favorite thing about the place is that it offers bags of La Colombe beans for home brewing-just enough of a freshly roasted supply to tide us over between visits. If the consistency and quality remain as high as they are now, we may never buy coffee anywhere else in Manhattan again. La Colombe Torrefaction, 319 Church Street (at Lisepenard Street), 212-343-1515.

Nice Matin Misses A Step

***CONTENT
 One memorable episode of a long-canceled BBC home redesign program featured a woman who could not commit to a design scheme for her three upstairs bedrooms. Fifteen years ago, she started collecting single-roll samples of wallpaper that she used to create dozens of test strips on every one of the walls in each of the rooms (including the bathroom), all with the intention of someday selecting her favorite among them and repapering with one unified theme. Walking into the dining room at Nice Matin, I had a flashback to that episode when I saw the restaurant's interior done up in seven different print wallpapers. It looked a bit like what might happen if Missoni, Pucci, and Diane von Furstenberg all got together to design an Upper West Side Honeycomb Hideout by committee. Perhaps most amazing is that, contrary to all traditional rules of aesthetics, the unusual décor actually works very well in the space. Fortunately, Nice Matin's menu is a little more tightly conceived than its interior decorating theme: most dishes are classic French, with a few falling in to that category of borrowed Italian dishes that the French like to think they imported and then perfected (i.e. risottos, ravioli). A few menu items are adequate, if a little bit lackluster, such as the frisée salad ($9.50) HungryMan ordered. Thanks to an overabundance of candied walnuts and ripe pear slices, Nice Matin's version of the iconic salad was far too sweet, even with the contrasting piquancy of the salad's crumbled roquefort. This is an easy problem to fix: go easy on the sugared nuts. My appetizer, the stuffed sardines ($9.75), was also a bit problematic, thanks to its underseasoned Swiss chard and anchovy stuffing. As I ate, I could picture the chef doing some quick mental culinary calculus, trying to work out how salty the stuffing would be with the inclusion of briny anchovies and ultimately choosing not to add any more salt to the mixture. The underestimation was a huge error, as the undersalting really emphasized a raw, chlorophyll flavor from the chard that was neither pleasing nor a particularly good match with the oily sardine flesh. And it was at this point that HungryMan and I both began to wonder if the kitchen staff was bothering to taste their food. HungryMan's impressively hefty Five Napkin Burger ($14.50) convinced us that indeed, they were not. To Nice Matin's credit, the girthy ten ounce patty was cooked exactly to medium-rare, as requested. The Comté cheese also lent a smooth unctuous mouthfeel to the juicy burger, and with the amount of liquid it produced, it gave the meat's flavors something to attach to before being washed away. Clever stuff. The aioli on the burger, on the other hand, clashed mightily with the heady beef patty and the radicchio garnish, giving the accompaniments a strongly bitter flavor that did the dish no favors. Scraping off the aioli or dumping the radicchio should take care of the problem, and once again with this dish, unfortunate combinations of flavors made us think that perhaps ingredients were being added to food without any of the necessary confirmatory sampling that prevents unpleasant tastes from making it from kitchen to table. While the corn, chanterelle mushroom and crabmeat risotto ($18.25) was not at all displeasing to eat, I did spend quite a bit of time closing my eyes and trying to discern the taste of crab in the dish-just a hint would have been enough, but among the rich sweet corn and the earthy mushrooms, it was hard to taste much else. We spotted the same dish, sans crabmeat, on the Restaurant Week menu as we left the restaurant, and in hindsight, we think the seafood-free version might have been a cleaner-tasting dish. At the very least, it would not have left us struggling to taste the most expensive ingredient on the plate. None of this is to say that Nice Matin should hew closer to a more traditional menu-we are all in favor of experimentation with unusual ingredients and flavor combinations. Sometimes they, like the wacky patchwork of wallpapers in the restaurant's dining room, turn out brilliantly-but the only way to be certain that they work well is to grab a spoon and taste them. Nice Matin, 201 West 79th Street (at Amsterdam Avenue), 212-873-6423.

Spiga vs. Spiga

2007-08-12 23:00:00
***CONTENT
 Newton's third law-the one about actions being paired with equal but opposite reactions-was written with stones in mind, but he could just as easily have been thinking about Spiga. The intimate, mid-priced Upper West Side restaurant has a lot going for it, but as we discovered on a visit with Candide and Cich last week, each of these assets has an equally damning fault that counteracts it completely. Eating a meal at Spiga can be as frustrating as playing a game of Chutes and Ladders, where every time you feel the dinner's trajectory moving in a positive direction, another problem rears its head to send the meal tumbling backwards again. This game of self-sabatoge is painful to witness from a distance, and doubly so when it plays out on every plate set down at your table. The seafood tortino ($13.95) is a perfect example: composed of light, tender chunks of octopus (splendidly cooked) and cubes of soft potato, the dish was undone by a too-generous slathering of salty black olive pesto that topped it. While the flavors from the pesto were all nicely balanced internally, they were far too strong to pair with the delicate sweetness of the octopus. Having lost all of its subtlety to the saucing, the appetizer ended up tasting like a chewy, savory potato salad. One step forward...one step backward. Cich's savory tomato and strawberry soup (pictured on Flickr, $10.95) featured two marvelously crispy, deep-fried oysters that, served on their own, would have made this dish a success. But the soup itself-the dish's central component-was a mess of sweet and tangy flavors that should never be puréed together. The culprit was the ripe mellowness of the blended strawberries, a flavor that amplified a very unpleasant musty taste in the tomatoes and put us all in mind of canned tomato paste. Only HungryMan's sautéed shrimp and mussels appetizer ($13.95), a ceviche-style concoction served on a bed of orange granita, could be counted as a truly solid appetizer. Here, the straightforward balance between bitter radicchio and sweet Italian ice worked as it should have, with nothing in the bowl overpowering the flavor of the seafood. Had our server not returned to our table three times to crow to HungryMan about how 'Local youths who hate seafood love it here!', this might have been a home run. Unfortunately, our mains brought us back to double-edged dining once again, especially Candide's bizarrely prepared lamb and eggplant cutlets with caponata and mint sorbet ($26.95). Sliced into rounds and then fried sandwiched between two layers of eggplant, the thin slices of lamb leached all their flavor out into the eggplant during cooking. By the time they arrived at our table, the cutlet rounds tasted like tough, overcooked luncheon meat. Candide poked and sliced for several minutes before abandoning the lamb, half-uneaten, and shifted his focus to the very fine mint sorbet. And on the subject of the sorbet, none of us could figure out why it had not been scooped out into a quenelle and plated alongside the disks of lamb. That is, until my own cod and tomato purée ($25.95) arrived with a tiny teacup of barely-sweetened almond ice cream. Every one of the icy garnishes and accompaniments, we quickly realized, were all loose and either not properly set or-even worse-melted. Because all of the frozen elements in the mains were kept sequestered, they never became fully part of their dishes and felt, in the end, like afterthoughts more than integral components. The lamb cutlets may have benefited marginally from a more seamless inclusion of their sorbet, but my tough, ammoniac cod was beyond any help. This rubbery, flavorless dish was no mixed blessing and might well be the worst fish I have eaten this year. Cich and HungryMan fared a bit better with their veal fillet and red onion jam ($24.95)-but not much. Both loved the gently acidic sweetness of the braised red onions and marsala wine sauce but were troubled by the dryness of the veal as well as its tepid serving temperature. The eggplant mousse, redolent of aromatic herbs, was a bit of a puzzler: none of us who tasted it could work out quite how its busy melange of flavors was intended to work with the rest of the dish. Had it been served with a roasted chicken dish or alone as the main component of an appetizer, it might have worked well, but teamed with heady, earthy flavors, it was entirely out of place. So too the often overbearing, over-familiar service, featuring our favorite quote of the evening: 'Dude, how's the veal?' Sadly, such strange, mood-killing touches were the rule and not the exception during our Spiga experience. Yet despite all of Spiga's flaws, we left feeling as if we had grazed the very perimeter of something special, only to be rebuffed and pushed away. We wonder how much of the restaurant's self-destructive tendency has to do with the thinly-spread attention of owners Alessandro Peluso and Salvatore Corea, both of whom are busy with their other, higher profile restaurants Cacio e Pepe and Bocca. In the long run, it is in the best interests of their budding restaurant empire to return to the Upper West Side, do some serious thinking about the great potential of their restaurant, and help Spiga to help itself. Spiga, 200 West 84th Street (between Amsterdam Ave. and Broadway), 212-362-5506.

At Home at Westville

***CONTENT
 Some New York restaurants go out of their way to remind you that you are not dining at home around the family dinner table-ornate lighting, moose heads and driftwood mounted on the walls, bolts of fabric draped in sine waves from ceiling corner to ceiling corner-all theatre used to distinguish haute from home. And sometimes this works to amplify the pleasure of dining out- the ethereal atmosphere at the Modern succeeds, as does the fin-de-siecle decadence of Dressler. Other times it most decidedly does not, and it is then, amidst a sea of condescending waiters, blaring music, and ingredients listed in Latin on the menu that you might find yourself wishing you had opted not to leave your apartment in the first place. Then there are restaurants like Westville, so straightforward in their unstudied casualness that walking into them feels a bit like walking into someone's cramped Manhattan living room. Except that at Westville, chalked on a series of wall-mounted blackboards like a child's art project gone wild, is the entire menu, with a few specials added for good measure. When dishes run out, they are scratched off the menu by the single friendly waitress/manager as she jokes with customers at each table as if they were close neighbors. In all likelihood they are just that, as Westville draws many regulars from the West Village and does a significant takeout business. That Westville has attracted a devoted following among Villagers, some of whom treat the restaurant as their second kitchen, is a testament to the consistency of its cooking. Owner and chef Jay Strauss has created a varied, if a bit predictable menu of All-American classics (burgers, grilled Niman Ranch hot dogs), salads, fish and steaks, but what really makes Westville stand out is its focus on using fresh produce in its comfort food. The Latin-style corn on the cob ($5 for two ears) is a good example of this. Full cobs are a summertime treat that you do not often find on (non-BBQ) restaurant menus, primarily because gnawing kernels can seem a little inelegant, even for the most dextrous among us. Westville doesn't mind this one bit, and even the most clumsy corn cobber won't be scolded for making a mess. It is hard not to like the dish's classic preparation: the generous dose of cumin, the aged, semi-hard Mexican cotija cheese, and the lime flavors. Just one thing was missing: heat. Next time we return, we'll remember to ask for a little chili on the side. Corn is just one of the restaurant's respectable lineup of vegetable dishes that it categorizes in a separate menu section called the Westville Market. In practice, the market usually offers around twenty varieties of seasonal veggies that diners can order either as side dishes or as an entire course ($5 individually, $13 for a plate of four). This makes Westville a great destination for vegetarians and, at this time of year, for non-vegetarians who want what's fresh. The night we went, Nosher was in just this sort of mood, and he ordered a plate of grilled asparagus with lemon and parmesan cheese, a curried chickpea salad, an arugula and feta salad, and brussels sprouts with a spicy dijon dressing. Not everything was equally good - the curry was sticky and underseasoned-but the barely softened brussels sprouts were superb, as were the savory asparagus spears. For sheer breadth of flavors on one plate, this entrée made postponing protein worthwhile. On the other hand, I was not feeling like delaying my protein fix, and after a few bites of my main, I was glad I had not. My cod fish po'boy ($8.50) was a satisfying tower of battered cod and homemade, chunky tartar sauce, all on a seedless (if characterless) bun. Here the proportions of the shoebox-sized restaurant worked to my advantage, as the sandwich was whisked from fryer to table in a matter of seconds, allowing me to bite into still steaming, silky strips of cod. One thing did leave me scratching my head though: in a restaurant with an embarrassment of fresh vegetables for the choosing, how could my po'boy have ended up with such a conspicuously wan tomato? A slice of mealy garnish is not likely to stem the flow of eager customers who start to queue in front of the restaurant on most nights after 7 p.m. Westville doesn't take reservations, and the consequence of this is a wait that can stretch to over an hour. We would love to see the restaurant add another bench for the inevitable crowd of hungry customers, because from the looks of things, people are already starting to bring their own furniture to use while they are waiting. Last week we spotted two desk chairs and a stool on the sidewalk. All Westville needs now is a few couches and a coffee table to make the sidewalk-to-living room transformation complete. Last one done with dinner, please turn out the lights. Westville, 210 West 10th Street (between Bleecker and West 4th Streets), 212-741-7971.

If you want to avoid the lines, go to their second location, Westville East, at Avenue A and 11th! Much bigger space, more laid back, no elbow-to-elbow dining.

... in my humble opinion, Westville has the best burger in the city. So many places callously make that claim - none come close to what Westville does so simply.

Doma Café: Coffee and Worn-in Charm

***CONTENT
 A friend of ours keeps a list of New York truisms such as: \"There is an automatic $20 penalty for setting foot out of your apartment building,\" and \"Garbage collection never happens on the day when you put your bags at the curb.\" But our favorite of these is: \"It is axiomatic that if you wander around the West Village for longer than a few hours, you will run into Ethan Hawke.\" So when Chopper and Mr. Coffee took us to Doma Café & Gallery recently, we were not surprised at all to hear them warn us that the place might be crowded, \"and especially if Ethan Hawke and the celeb gawkers are there-he often is.\" Of course, Doma sits at the corner of Perry Street and Waverly Place...so Q.E.D. Perhaps we were not in the neighborhood quite long enough for the Ethan Hawke Rule to kick in, because we did not see the former Mr. Thurman as we sat, sipping our cafés au lait and nibbling on our desserts. Instead, we saw a well-worn little coffee house with a cheerful hodgepodge of thrift store furnishings that made all four of us want to grab a book or a newspaper and sit for a while. I returned three more times over the next two weeks-never seeing Mr. Hawke, incidentally-and got the very same impressions each time I returned. Doma, it seems, is Starbucks's disheveled aunt, the one with the grow-lights in the basement and the 14,000 Guatemalan afghans in her bedroom, but also the one that everyone in the family secretly loves best. Food plays no small part in the affection locals feel for the place. The café does not make its own pastries, but it has mastered the tricky art of sourcing excellent baked goods-something many other coffee shops in town, save Joe's-get disastrously wrong. On our first visit, we sampled a delightful marble bundt cake that was satisfyingly dense and moist, with a tender, cakey crumb and runnels of icing suspended in mid-drip across its exterior. The staff refused to tell us where they purchase their pastries, brushing us off with a cryptic, \"It's someplace local. Not too close, but still nearby,\" but no matter: we are now officially on the lookout for that bundt cake. Until then though, we are happy enough to grab a slice at Doma, especially with a mug of their solidly good coffee (although espresso drinks tend to be better than brewed coffees here). Be forewarned: during the daytime, laptops preponderate, so if you plan to visit and use the café's free WiFi, be prepared to compete for a table-and good luck finding an outlet. That is especially true now that on the weekends, the café has instituted an unevenly enforced 'no plugging-in' policy, so things get even trickier for the power-hungry. However, after seeing how absolutely jammed Doma becomes in the late morning and early afternoon on a Saturday, we find it hard to argue with any ban that frees up an open chair or two. And if it means that it takes Ethan Hawke a few extra months to complete his third novel, we can live with the guilt. Doma Café & Gallery, 17 Perry Street (at Waverly Place), 212-929-4339.

I love this place!...when it's not full of people on their MacBooks (or other laptop, which seem few). My favorite things there are the SANDWICHES! GLORIOUS DELICIOUS SANDWICHES!!! They're a little pricey, but I think it's worth it.

What Becomes a Pizza Legend Most?  Not Di Fara's Glove.

***CONTENT
 For many Manhattanites, Midwood, Brooklyn seems so far away that it might as well be on another continent. In fairness, the neighborhood, which is home to a quirky assortment of Orthodox yeshivas and Chinese and Pakistani groceries, can be a good hour from midtown on the Q train, and not much more convenient if you're driving in Brooklyn's stop-and-go congestion. Even with two good friends to distract us last week, our car ride, punctuated by treacherous traffic circles and near-misses with Access-A-Ride vans, was near 25 minutes from central Park Slope. But the promise of arguably New York City's best pizza kept us seatbelted and moving slowly towards our destination: Di Fara Pizza. Purveyors of among the most talked-about pies in Gotham, Di Fara (or Di Fara's, depending on your mood) is one of those magical places that elicits wistful sighs from New York pizza aficionados. The pizzeria earns such near religious devotion because it does pretty much one thing: crank out pie after pie from the restaurant's deck oven. Dominick DeMarco, the owner and sole pizzaiolo, is renowned for working slowly and deliberately, often ignoring bothersome interruptions like telephones and customers as he makes each pizza by hand and to order, with little to no help from others in the shop. Each topping is added individually, and small steps, including adding a few final few snips of basil off a fresh bunch, grating grana padano and splashing a bit of olive oil on a slice or a pie, are taken with care, and never rushed. Attention to detail (not to mention the casual indifference to patrons) has resulted in not only deservedly famous pizza, but infamously lengthy lines. As word of Dom's doughy miracles has spread, two-hour evening and weekend waits have become all too common. But these days, if you have heard anything about Di Fara, it is probably that it was shut down for several weeks early this summer by the Department of Health as part of the Department's program of stepped-up enforcement following the Greenwich Village Taco Bell Department of Health (DOH) fiasco. As part of a negotiated re-opening settlement with inspectors, Dom was forced to don a plastic protective hat and gloves, and to keep the doors and window to his diminutive storefront closed while cooking. The good news is that the new rules haven't changed the quality of the pizza; the bad news is, without the ventilation from the window, the smoke and heat inside the shop are now nearly intolerable, particularly during New York's steambath months of July and August. After ten minutes waiting for a pie, you half expect to see a betoweled Bette Midler emerge from the crowd and start singing to the crowd. Despite the steam and interior haze, my dining companions Vince and Ms. Fribbles had hardly any complaints about their experience-and neither did I. One problem we did find was that our thin pizza had slightly too much char on its crust. Indeed, much of the crust was inedible and black. This was a surprise to us all, as Dom's most frequent movement in the open kitchen is his constant shifting and lifting up the bottoms of his cooking pies to check for even doneness. Can we chalk the blackened crust up to the tactile distraction of his DOH gloves? Regardless, a little char is a minor quibble with pizza this good. His sauce was as sweet and addictive as always-a happy multiplex marriage of canned and fresh San Marzano tomatoes, garlic, oregano, and no doubt a secret ingredient or two. The cheese, a combination of fresh mozzarella, buffalo mozzarella, and parmesan, melted effortlessly around and into the sauce. Of course, Di Fara's offers a panoply of toppings but really, why clutter up a classic? Di Fara's also produces a deep-dish, Sicilian-American style pizza in addition to the thin Neapolitan, and we decided to experiment by ordering one of these square pies with porcini mushrooms, one of Di Fara's special toppings, ones Dom claims to import (in grand Gotham quasi-legit tradition) himself, and that he can be seen fishing out one-by-one from a large jar that sits on the kitchen's back counter. The square pizza requires almost twice the preparation time as the Neapolitan pie, as the shell must be pre-baked, but like everything else at Di Fara's, it worth the wait. We won't be the first to say it, but Di Fara's square pies are better than the round ones, with their chewy, spongy interior and crunchy crust. Textural contrast doesn't get any better than this, and given that these pies are accompanied by a richer sauce than the round version (rumors have it that the square pie's sauce is simmered with pancetta), it is not hard to nominate Di Fara's Sicilian-American pie as the best square in the city. For us, though, what made the dish transcendent were the mushrooms, left totally uncooked, then added after the pizza emerged from the oven, imparting the whole dish with a distinctive marinated bite. Unexpected touches like the zingy tang from that marinated porcini mushroom illustrate the upside of DeMarco's attention to detail. And Dom makes Di Fara what it is: a true New York gastronomic institution that provides a glimpse of a true artisan at work, even if he does begrudgingly wear rubber gloves-and less often, the hat-as he grinds cheese and pokes pies. Sure, it might be a trek for a lot of New Yorkers, but with the Q train stop directly across the street from the shop, there is no excuse not to bring a book to keep you occupied while you queue, eat a slice or two, and then collapse in a happy pile as the subway doors close behind you. Di Fara Pizza, 1424 Avenue J, Midwood, Brooklyn, 718-258-1367.

This place looks fantastic. Great pictures of the pizza they are making me hungry. I wish there was more written about outlying dining gems in Brooklyn and Queens for that matter. Maybe a dining guide to oulying borough dining?

For Sicilian pizza in Brooklyn, I'd also have to recommend L&B Spumoni Gardens. This has been a Brooklyn landmark for years - people travel from all over for L&B's Sicilian pie. Definitely worth a trip, if you haven't yet tried it.

At P*ong, the Dessert is in the Details

 Pichet Ong is a man who clearly reads his own press-and that is no bad thing. Early word on P*ong, his new, upscale desserts and small plates venture, was that the restaurant showed great promise without ever managing to make good on it consistently. Yet rather than hit back defensively at critics, Ong, the former pastry chef at Spice Market and 66, did precisely the opposite: he listened, re-evaluated, and made things at his little dessert salon even better. His greatest asset in this project has been his own constant presence in his restaurant-P*ong has no front- and back-of-house; the space is all open-plan, with just a bar counter separating the chef and staff from the patrons, so when Pichet himself is in residence, as he is nearly every night from afternoon until late evening, you can see his face (barely) peeking through the stacks of plates, tasting, tweaking and paying attention to his guests. If you sit at the bar, you may even find Pichet himself asking you for your opinion, nodding very slightly, and then getting on with his chopping as he mulls over the new data you have given him. Changes, when they need to happen, can take place in a flash, and with such precision that diners themselves might only ever notice that their second cachaca-based cukeberry cocktail ($14) has suddenly gotten a bit zestier. And it is this fine-grained attention to detail that allows Ong to pull off some phenomenal dishes. Our favorite-easily the most impressive dessert we have eaten this summer-is the miso semifreddo and castella sandwich with strawberry sorbet and wasabi candy (pictured top, $12), a plate that features a symphonic coordination of textures, temperatures and flavors. Only someone who pays scrupulous attention to every detail would be able to pull off such a dish, one where each individual aroma and flavor articulates with each of the others to create something sweeping and magnificent. It is the culinary equivalent of a pointillist painting where the crunch of the wasabi candy, the cold strawberry sorbet, the tang of the white miso, and the soft sponginess of the castella cake all resolve to create a single sensational image: summertime. P*ong's seasonal references are no accident: the menu showcases fresh ingredients like huckleberries, watermelon, and even New Jersey corn, as evidenced by the jersey bi-color corn flan with bing cherries ($12), a dish with a rich condensed milk cake as its base and an unexpectedly delightful crunch that comes from dehydrated sweet corn. But the best part of this dish is the corn crema custard that accompanies it. A simple dish made from cream, eggs, sugar and puréed corn, this delicate pudding purrs with flavors of moist, bursting kernels. In one little ramekin, Pichet Ong uses his watchmaker's precision to greatest effect, distilling down the pure sensation of biting into a freshly steamed ear of corn, and even managing to evoke the feeling of juices dribbling down chins. If I could eat corn Pichet's way every day, I might never touch another cob. Such playfulness is reflected throughout the menu-savory items are constructed the way desserts might be, cocktails are built on unexpected ingredients (sea salt, corn), and sometimes even pastries are deconstructed and reconfigured anew. Our favorite example of this is the fraternal twin combination of Chinese-style short biscotti (pictured above), baked short and crumbly like butter cookies, alongside a spoonful of biscotti gelée. The double-whammy approach works superbly here-and quite honestly, even if it did not, all it would take is a subtle nod of the head in Pichet's direction for him to spot the problem, analyze the cause, and work out a clever solution on the spot, all before the post-dinner rush. P*ong, 150 West 10th Street (near Waverly Place), 212-929-0898.

One is the Hungriest Number: Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant

***CONTENT
 This review comes to us from corresponding writer, Doughboy, a former solo eater and master of Southern delicacies like key lime cake and crock-pot BBQ. When it comes to keen and penetrating psychological insights into the deepest recesses of the human soul, is there any question more revealing than, “What do you eat for dinner when you’re alone?” Whether you’re the type to follow the women’s magazine advice to “make every meal special” by trotting out a place-setting for one that rivals Versailles or the harried professional who slurps takeout soup over the sink, at sometime in your life, you’ve probably realized that it’s not enough to say we are what we eat, but that we are how we eat. And when we eat alone, we divulge our innermost impulses and priorities and fears-the very ones that we would never speak aloud, instead choosing to roll them into tight little balls of shame and anxiety and storing them down deep in our guts, next to the bowlful of brownie batter that ended up being your solitary supper the night before. Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant: Confessions of Cooking for One and Dining Alone is a collection of writings on this very topic; Jenni Ferrari-Adler has taken on the task of getting several noted authors (not just “food writers,” thank goodness) to describe their favorite “meals for one” or their own rules and rituals for dining alone. Though the sharply-focused subject matter lends a sometimes unwelcome air of repetition to the book (Haruki Murakami may have loved eating spaghetti for days on end, but one hopes he wouldn’t want to read about it for the same length of time), there are delights to be had here, along with a few interesting recipes that may prove useful the next time you have a solitary night-and a less-than-fully-stocked pantry-stretching before you. The first thing you will notice if you try to digest the work in one sitting (lazy food metaphor intended, I’m afraid) is that-in the immortal words of a thousand bad comedians-”Men and women are different!” Many of the female writers in this collection seem to fixate on food’s role in relationships. Winning a mate, caring for a mate, consoling oneself when said mate leaves-these seem the actual topics of Amanda Hesser’s “Single Cuisine,” Jami Attenberg’s “Protective Measures,” Holly Hughes’ “Luxury” (an infuriating essay which made me want to call the author and tell her to leave her picky, demanding, and insensitive family to fend for themselves I they were going to insist on being such jackasses about meals) and Courtney Eldridge’s “Thanks, but No Thanks.” The Eldridge piece, by the way, is the only real failure in the book-a hostile, defensive, joyless piece of writing that actually makes you root for the break-up of the relationship described in its pages. Some of the men are guilty of the same food-and-relationship intertwining as well: Steve Almond lays out a detailed wooing strategy contingent on proper execution of a delicious-sounding shrimp and avocado dish; Dan Chaon describes a friendship marked by a particularly intense bonding-through-chili session. But the male writers address the topic with a light hand and breezy tone-no grand metaphors seem to be lurking within their stories, and there are no valuable life lessons beyond “go easy on the hot peppers.\" Gender issues aside, the real reason to get this book is to see some skillful writers at work. It’s common knowledge that M.F.K. Fisher’s food writing is the pinnacle of the craft, but seeing it on the page in “A is for Dining Alone,” with the language as savory and sweet as the recipes she includes in her footnotes, is a treat for lovers of fine food and fine prose. The aforementioned pasta-focused piece by Murakami, “The Year of Spaghetti,” is as oddly haunting and strange as his short fiction. And my favorite essay in the book, “Beans and Me” by Jeremy Jackson, does what every essay in a collection like this should do: it makes me hungry for the food he’s describing (black beans and rice-a meal for which I would gladly join or start a fan club), it makes me feel like I know something about Jackson as a person, and it makes me want to read more of his work—novels and cookbooks alike. For fans of any sort of food writing, Alone in the Kitchen with an Eggplant would probably make a welcome addition to the cookbook shelf, whether that space is occupied by a single volume or sagging under the weight of too many sauce-stained recipe collections. Reading Ferrari-Adler's collection all at once is admittedly probably not the best approach to take, but I can think of worse diversions than sitting down to scan a chapter or two while alone, silently thanking the universe for its gift of an occasional evening in which you can savor a near-perfect dinner of a parmesan cheese wedge and half a tube of cookie dough.

United Flavors of Fu

***CONTENT
 Growing up in a household where nothing was ever wasted, I learned to see the remains of a meal as the starting point for the next. Bones from chickens and roasts became stock, excess vegetables became sauces or terrines, and darkening bananas became steamy pans of monkey cake. But the biggest cause for celebration was a loaf of stale bread, because it meant an upcoming breakfast of eggy French toast, slick with sticky maple syrup. It is, in many ways, a perfect dish-custardy and tender, with enough firm texture from the slightly toughened bread to extend the time it spends on your tongue, and best of all: it costs nearly nothing. It wasn't until I encountered Japanese yaki-fu for the first time that I realized just how potent the concept of egg-soaked stale bread was, and how international. Yaki-fu (or just 'fu') is made from leavened wheat gluten that has been baked into loaves or rings, sliced, and then dried and packaged. It is used primarily in two ways in modern Japanese cuisine: either simmered in a soup, sukiyaki style, or soaked and pan-fried with dashi broth and eggs. The latter cooking method produces a dish that bears a remarkable resemblance to a savory French toast, yet with a much chewier, more protein-rich 'bread' component. Fu and eggs is not the only savory variation on this theme, however. Both it and French toast are of course kissing cousins (mishpocha) to Jewish matzoh brei, a thick, pan-fried scramble of broken matzoh pieces and eggs that can be made as a sweet or a savory dish-thereby neatly bridging the gastronomical gap between French toast and fu. Our favorite matzoh brei in the city is the savory version from Edison Café, served as a crispy golden-brown disc that just begs for a liberal addition of applesauce and perhaps even a tiny dab or two of horseradish. It is made even better when it is eaten in the restaurant's ornate dining room, decorated to look like nothing more than the interior of a Jasperware teacup. All of these international egg and baked wheat dishes got me thinking about how versatile the combination really is-if it works with maple syrup, miso broth, applesauce and horseradish, and even bonito, why not other flavors? So I purchased a few bags of dried fu ($2.99 for 20 g.) from Yagura Japanese Market and started practicing making the dish at home. I was already an experienced French toast maker, as well as an old hand at matzoh brei, so yaki-fu wasn't too much of a challenge. At the same time, I began collecting discs of gluten-rich bread whenever we had a few extra leftover inches of a baguette. Soon enough, the experiments began. It wasn't long after that I hit upon a recipe that worked beautifully. For this French-inspired Provencal faux-fu, I used a clove of garlic, homemade vegetable stock (although chicken stock works just as well), as well as fresh thyme and oregano. I prepared the stale bread discs the same way as I had when making yaki-fu: by soaking them in very slightly salty water until they were just barely soft, and then pressing-never squeezing!-the liquid out of them. Bread is less gluten-rich than fu, so my homemade discs were ready for pressing after about 30 seconds in the water. Fu, on the other hand, sometimes takes minutes to absorb enough water to get it softened. The more glutinous the bread, the longer it will need to sit in the water. I also added a resting phase to allow excess moisture to evaporate from the pressed slices of bread, and therefore giving it back just enough absorptive capacity to soak up the flavors of the stock as it reduces in the pan. The resulting dish is light, aromatic, and just hearty enough to be served at a brunch or a lunch. Moreover, befitting its international pedigree, the faux-fu pairs just as well with a chilled rosé wine as it does with a dry saké. And Manischewitz, you ask? Don't push your luck. Provencal Faux-Fu 10-12 discs of hard, stale baguette, 1/2-3/4 inch thick 2 cups water with 1/2 teaspoon salt added 3-4 T. butter 1 cup vegetable or chicken stock 1 clove garlic, minced 5 eggs, lightly beaten 2 T. fresh thyme 2 T. fresh oregano salt and pepper to taste Soak bread discs in the slightly salted water until they are just barely softened. Press out water-do not squeeze or wring, or bread will fall apart*. Place pressed discs on a plate and let sit at room temperature for about 10 minutes. Heat butter in large, high-sided saucepan on medium-high heat until it foams. Add bread and cook on both sides until browned. Add minced garlic and cook for about a minute, being careful not to let the garlic burn. Add stock to the pan and cook until stock has reduced and been absorbed completely by the bread. Pour in beaten eggs and half the herbs. Cook, stirring just enough to break up the eggs as they cook. When eggs are solid but still just a bit wet, remove from heat. Add the remaining herbs, salt and pepper. Serves 2 as a main dish or 4 as a side dish. A Flickr photoset on how to prepare this dish can also be found here. 2007 nycnosh.com

No Tours, Just Innovative Twists at Massif Central

***CONTENT
 July is a time of year when the verdant hills and valleys of south-central France do not get much love from the media. Everyone, it seems, is too busy paying attention to the bicycles that describe a wide, irregular perimeter that avoids most of the Massif Central region in favor of steeper mountains and flatter fields elsewhere. A friend of mine from Limoges once told me that, \"The Tour de France is for extremes and extremists only. That is why we do not often see the bicycles-I think we are too normal.\" Massif Central's unassuming, low-key approach to decor and cooking alike reflect this same attitude-nothing in the place is designed to ring alarm bells of outrageousness, and yet here and there, tiny unexpected sparks of panache manage to escape into the dining room. It is just enough to make the place worth a second visit. Appetizers, especially salads, tend to be a bit underwhelming-on a recent visit, I ate a perfectly acceptable mesclun and goat cheese salad ($8.75), but found the tomatoes to be flavorless and the dressing a bit too oily. HungryMan sampled the frisée and lardon salad ($9.25) and enjoyed the runny egg, crispy lardons, and Fourme d'Ambert cheese, but kept commenting that he wished there were just a bit more frisée there to hold the dish together. The greens-to-pork ratio in a frisée salad needs to be high enough so that it never feels as if you are eating a plate of bacon and eggs, and as well-prepared as the ingredients were in this salad, it did veer dangerously close to breakfast territory. Overall, not an excellent start, but not a bad one either. Mains, on the other hand, are where Massif Central's chef, Moussa Thiam, really shines. My ginger-crusted striped wild bass ($17.50) was a perfect illustration of this-served on a bed of rich, salty sautéed wild mushrooms, the palm-sized portion of fish was flaky, with an almost delicately moist interior. What appeared at first to be a very loose sauce turned out to be a simple jus composed of the water leeched from the mushrooms, some red wine, and a small amount of butter. And for a fish like striped bass, the choice of a less-unctuous saucing was very smart, as it still allowed all of the original flavors of the fish's pale flesh to emerge with each bite. Also superb was HungryMan's poule au pot ($16.25), a seared-then-stewed chicken dish purportedly invented by King Henry of Navarre at the turn of the seventeenth century. Massif Central puts their own spin on this traditional dish by adding curry to the broth, an alteration that gives the chicken a nuanced depth of flavor-one that brings out the sweetness of the potatoes and carrots in the stew. If a typical poule au pot is classic French Sunday dinner fare, Moussa Thiam's zingy version is something you might serve to a prospective love interest on a Friday night. Indeed, this might be a candidate for an ideal New York summer date meal, especially when paired with one of the restaurant's exceedingly fine cocktails. Our favorites, the floral, lilac-kissed Barbellé and the fig-infused Brandied Garter (each $9.00), showcase some of the most clever use of aromatics and herbal flavors we have seen in quite a while. Admittedly, Massif Central's dinner menu is, in the restaurant's early days, a bit truncated. However, we understand from manager and co-owner Andrie Poon that it will expand considerably over the next few months. One promised addition we eagerly anticipate is aligot, an artery-clotting yet divine regional French specialty made with mashed potatoes and Tomme cheese, whipped together into the consistency of wallpaper paste. On its own, in its traditional form, aligot is sublime, if a bit cloying. Given his penchant for gently reshaping the classics, we suspect Moussa Thiam has a few delightful modifications planned out already. Massif Central, 323 Bleecker Street (at Grove Street), 212-488-2326.

Hi Bob, The wine list was just OK. Nothing amazing, but I am guessing they'll get it sorted out later on, after they've been open for a while. Right now, I think the focus on cocktails is a smart one for them, at least as far as beverages go, since they do such a good job of it.

 All it takes is a sip or two of Bracco Wines' Brunello di Montalcino and it becomes clear that Lorraine Bracco is not messing around. Started just three years ago with her business partner Vincent Viola, Bracco's brand produces a short list of wines that include seven reds and a white (and very soon, a rosé), all produced from Italian grapes Bracco selects herself. We got a chance to try out all of the Bracco wine offerings at a tasting event held in Midtown's Divine Bar West last night, and we came away with an even greater admiration for Lorraine...and her palate. During the evening, we recorded a short, ten-minute interview with Lorraine about her first foray into the wine business, her taste in wine (and Dr. Melfi's), as well as her very watchable on-screen chemistry with Martha Stewart. As with all of our podcasts, you have the option either to download the audio file (just right-click that link to save the file to disk) to listen on your mp3 device, or if you have a speedy Internet connection, you can stream the podcast by clicking the ‘play’ button on the audio player below.

It's No Fairy Tale: Il Brigante
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-07-16 10:35:00
***CONTENT
 In Italian folkore, the brigand is a resourceful vigilante, often on horseback, who roams the countryside stirring up trouble. If a brigand shows up in the story you're reading, you can bet things will shortly take a turn for the worse. At Il Brigante, a Calabrian pizzeria that opened up just a few months ago in the middle of the Seaport's expoding restaurant scene, things aren't quite as dire as in Italian legend, but it does not take long before fairy-tale hopes for other-worldly pizza and pasta are quickly quashed. The brainchild of Venanzio Pasubio, a Calabrian native who had an excellent idea to bring his native regional cooking downtown-an neighborhood not known for its Italian restaurants, let alone eateries that take their inspiration from Italy's toe (or inner arch; it's the peninsula pointing at Sicily). With a focus on pizza, pasta and tomato-based sauces, Pasubio's Calabria offers rustic peasant food with lots of regional pork and seafood. And seafood makes sense in this part of Manhattan, where Il Brigante sits within spitting distance of the site of the Hudson's most famous fish market. In addition to its regular seafood offerings, Il Brigante typically offers a seafood special or two, including a mussels in a white wine sauce dish that seems to make a recurring guest appearance at least once a week. But with its enormous wood-burning brick oven hulking in the back of the main room, it's clear that in this dining room-seafood be damned-the pizzas are the real stars. And as Candide and I took our seats at Il Brigante during a lunchtime visit in the middle of last week's scorcher of a heatwave, we crossed our fingers in hopes that the pizzas were worthy of their marquee status. From the short, oddly-edited menu that included, curiously, a few specialties from Northern Italy, we ordered two pizzas, a white ortolana with crisp green vegetables, and a red sauce pescatora, a seafood pizza often mislabeled outside of Italy as \"pizza frutti di mare.\" To whet our appetites, we also shared the large antipasto plate (pictured above). We should have skipped it-the platter was $14 of pure disappoinment. Alarmingly called antipasto casareccio ('home-made'), there was little here that tasted fresh, apart from the mozzarella. Pecorino wedges and slices of salami and sopressata rounded out the small and limited selection of nibbles. Had each of the cured meats been genuinely prepared and smoked in-house, the dish would have been worth its price, but given its more 'home-assembled' status, the antipasto ultimately offered very poor value, especially when compared to the more generous and imaginative portions offered elsewhere, including at the remarkably consistent uptown Gennaro. Our pizzas were better, but only marginally so. We had read the raves about Il Brigante's pies from postings on Chowhound and from Bob Sietsema's review in the Voice, many of which boldly proclaimed them the best Neapolitan-style pizzas in the city, but what arrived at our table was genuinely disappointing. Both pies were overly charred on the bottom and far too oily on top. My pizza ortolana ($12) was criss-crossed with ribbons of zucchini and red onion and covered with little branches of bitter broccoli rabe. As a pizza bianca, this was also the oiler of the two pies, yet even the extra lipids could not overcome the crispy dryness that resulted from leaving the pizza in the oven for just a few too many minutes. Those critical extra minutes also added an extra, unneccessary bitterness to the vegetables. Candide's pescatora ($14) tasted better, but only because its sweet tomato sauce and sheer variety of seafood-shrimp, mussels in their shells, squid and octopus, the latter two tender, not rubbery-managed to distract him from the blackened crust. Most telling is that by the end of the meal, only the pescatora's slices had all disappeared. Clearly, pizzas are only half of the story. But sadly, Il Brigante's pastas tend to be undercooked and even less successful than the pizzas. Yet, despite all of our disappointment with its inconsistent cooking, Il Brigante offers a convivial atmosphere and a window onto the increasingly active street life north of the seaport. Some of this is due to the unfailingly pleasant and knowledgeable staff, even if some of them appear to hail from the north of England rather than the south of Italy. We would love to see Pasubio take the time to fix some of Il Brigante's problems and focus on making this Calabrian outpost as much of a fairy tale as it undoubtedly ought to be. Il Brigante, 214 Front Street, Near Beekman Street. (212) 285-0222.

My family and I thought the pasta was the very best in terms of its being not too hard and not too soft. It was perfect... hard to do in a restaurant. And the sauces, five different items ordered, were superb. We never had the pizza but the pasta was delicious. The only thing we didn't like was the wine... too expensive compared to the reasonable cost of the meals, and not very good.

Setagaya Banks on Authenticity & Vietnamese Salt

***CONTENT
 Ramen is not a terribly controversial food-no city has yet banned the stuff, just as they have foie gras, absinthe, and trans-fats; and in truth, this may be because people do not generally give much thought to the humble, salty, soy-infused soup noodle. But as inventive ramen restaurants and bars have opened around town, ramen has begun to shed its image as student food and has started to garner attention from the gastronomically inclined. Rai Rai Ken and Minca got the ball rolling, but Momofuku Noodle Bar really gave the first big push towards bringing superb noodles to the attention of New York's dining public. Then just about a month ago, things got a little heated when Setagaya opened its doors on First Avenue in the East Village and its manager promptly started talking smack about Momofuku's ramen. While we plan to stay clear of the debate over which noodle bar is better-we admire David Chang's creativity and skill immensely and do not see the point in comparing two very different approaches to cooking-we do have to admit that on a recent visit to Setagaya, we waited in a long line where we were the only non-Japanese people, save one. Inside the restaurant itself, we witnessed the same demographic breakdown. When you read Setagaya's own description of their noodles and broth, it becomes immediately clear that this is precisely the sort of reaction they hoped to inspire in expat Japanese working and living in Gotham. One of our fellow queuers put it this way while talking to a Japanese friend, \"I'm taking you here because I know you miss home. You won't believe how much like Tokyo noodles these are. Just taste the soup.\" Oh yes, the soup. The tsuke-men broth is unlike anything we have had in the US-tawny and garlicky, tingling with the distinctive aromas of ginger and scallion, and absolutely packed with chunks of smoked pork. Most interesting of all is the deeply robust flavor of dried scallop that backdrops the soup's complex flavor profile-an overtone that derives its strength from a double-whammy addition of plenty of pencil eraser-sized nubs of dried scallops as well as a generous beading of scallop-based hotate oil across the surface of the stock. Both HungryMan and I ordered our ramen dishes separated ($9.50 and $11.00 for a portion with extra cha-syu pork), so that we could appreciate the concentrated soup on its own. Ramen noodles served this way are intended to be placed, a portion at a time, into the bowl of soup and then eaten, glistening with stock, from this second bowl. Loud slurping and messy twirls of noodles are de rigeur. Setagaya does of course offer its ramen mixed in with broth-and for this, it uses a thinner shio broth that gets its salinity from a minerally Vietnamese rock salt. The noodles (pictured top) are pretty special as well-toothsome and smooth, they are cooked for exactly 50 seconds, and then flipped acrobatically from wire mesh strainers into serving bowls or directly into broth. Setagaya claims that it makes its ramen in three thicknesses to provide added texture and 'unique feel and curiosity to the taste.' HungryMan and I spotted two thicknesses, but try as we might, we could not locate that elusive third, Waldo-like noodle breadth. Not that the ramen needs any more texture-they are pretty spectacular just as they are, and even when softened a bit in the broth, they remain substantial, never gummy. A few other items on the tiny menu merit a brief mention, most notably the shio-tama, a soft boiled chicken egg, brined in that Vietnamese salt and cooked until the yolk has just begun to firm up, then served split across its equator. Best of all, this salty, umami-rich treat costs just $1.00-the best snack dollar you will probably ever spend in the East Village. Setagaya's menma-zara-marinated bamboo shoot salad (pictured above, $1.50)-is also worth a try, especially if you have never experienced how tender and similar in texture to mushrooms gently cured bamboo shoots can be. On our most recent visit, we also opted for a bowl of oshinko, pickled Japanese cabbage with two other other tsukemono pickles, and while these were all quite good, we suspect that only the brined cabbage was prepared in-house. But really, a meal at Setagaya is not about side dishes, it is about world-class ramen and exceptionally complex broth. Say what you will about Setagaya's bellicose manager and his Momofuku-baiting, but we believe that the city is big enough to accommodate plenty more unique new culinary perspectives, even the scrappy ones. Setagaya, 141 First Avenue (between St. Marks Place and 9th Streets), 212-529-2740.

Having been to Japan several times, most recently in April of this year, and sampled countless satisfying bowls, I feel that if you plunked the NYC branch down in Tokyo, it would still merit repeat visits. In fact, I've had very few bowls there that can match the balance of ingredients here. In many cases, I've walked away from a place thinking things like, \"great broth, decent noodles, okay charshu\" etc. At Setagaya, it's all happening. A party, going full throttle, in the bowl. The thick charshu chunks in the tsukemen, at their most tender, rival those of my all-time favorite ramen-ya, the now defunct Manten Ramen (near the JR Koiwa Station in Tokyo's outer reaches). In my mind, great ramen has finally reached our shores. We should definitely give props to places like Rei Rei Ken, Minca, etc., whose earnest efforts generated the interest to begin with. Without them, there might never have been a NYC branch of Setagaya. But we also need to give ultimate respect to Sapporo, on 49th, which has been serving up ramen in NYC for at least 30 some odd years (I dig the Chahan, personally). P.

Bis.Co. Latte: Into Every Life, a Little Crunch Must Fall

***CONTENT
 Holly DeSantis is clear about why she chose homemade biscotti as the signature offering of Bis.Co. Latte (aka Biscolatte), her brand new Tenth Avenue café, \"I like to really experience what I'm eating. I like to fight for my food, \" she told us as we stood in her kitchen yesterday. \"Biscotti give you sweetness and crunch, and you really know you're eating something when you bite into one. Forget cupcakes-too easy,\" she said with a smile. Easy, it seems, is nowhere on Holly's agenda at all: Bis.Co.Latte is just a few days old-this the first week of its soft opening-and already she has 24 varieties of biscotti for sale. The café offers everything from traditional almond-studded biscotti di Prato to double chocolate biscotti with nuts, a savory red wine and pepper biscotto, not to mention a version for hungry neighborhood canines. When we first saw the shop's awning go up a few weeks ago and poked our heads into the cheery orange and lime dining room, we were understandably skeptical as Holly told us that eventually she would be making more than two dozen kinds of sweet and savory biscotti. But within the short span of several days, she opened the shop to the public with a full complement of sweet treats (and gelato) ready to go. Better still, after tasting nearly every single flavor (20 of the 23 biscotti made for human palates), we were all the more impressed-every single one of them was worth another bite. That is not to say that we don't have our favorites: I am a big fan of the aromatic lemon poppyseed biscotti, while HungryMan prefers the chunky chocolate espresso almond, and I can predict already that we will end up fighting over the rich double chocolate walnut biscotti. What makes these cookies so remarkable is, in part, that they are pleasingly crisp and dense, but because they are sliced thin, they remain light. And of course, there is the dunking. Holly's biscotti are satisfying on their own, but when partnered with a good cup of coffee, they achieve a kind of dessert nirvana. Thankfully, Bis.Co.Latte makes a lovely latte, as well as a few varieties of slow-steeped iced and hot teas, all of which make for excellent dunking. We were also won over by how affordable nearly everything in this this unique bakery-café is, especially the biscotti-at $0.85 apiece, we wondered if it was even humanly possible not to order at least two with a cappuccino. Biscotti are also on sale in bulk, at about $15/lb.-a bargain considering the lightness of the cookies and the variety this approach allows you to sample. And on the topic of sampling, Bis.Co.Latte is very generous with its broken biscotti, with more than a dozen flavors lined up along the back wall, just waiting for customers to take a taste. More than once on our visits to the shop, we have witnessed people wander in from the street, zero in on the array of samples, nibble on a few, and walk out of the café with four or five biscotti in hand. \"You can tell that the idea of a place selling so many kinds of biscotti excites people,\" one patron told us as she sat sipping and dipping alongside us, \"Just watch people's faces as they walk in the door. This is something special.\" We couldn't agree more-Bis.Co.Latte's theme is unique and splendidly executed. Sure pulling it off might not have been easy, but who really needs easy when the results are this wonderful? Bis.Co.Latte Hand Made Biscotti, 667 Tenth Avenue (at 47th Street), 212-581-3900.

A Lingering Blight at Smith Street's Chestnut
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-07-01 23:05:00
***CONTENT
 At the turn of the twentieth century, there were more chestnut trees in American forests than there were maples. Then, in the span of a few decades, nearly every single chestnut was killed by a fungal blight-suddenly there was not only a shortage of the tree's hard lumber, but also nothing left to, as the song says, roast on an open fire. Today, practically all chestnut products you find Stateside are imported from Europe or Asia, despite a small, unstable resurgence of the chestnut population. Every time a new crop of wild chestnut trees comes close to maturity, it gets struck down again by persistent fungal spores. It therefore seems fitting that we would sit through our worst meal of the year to date at a restaurant named for this iconic yet diseased tree. Things seemed disordered from the very start. We were seated in the nearly empty dining room and asked for our water preference as we opened our menus. We had no hint that this would be the last time we spoke with our server for the next twenty minutes, even as he stood nearby, enthusiastically completing a crossword or Sudoku puzzle at the bar. None of the classic hints that we were ready to order seemed to work-we closed our menus, perched them precariously on the edge of the table, shuffled our feet, cleared our throats, and just as we were finally ready to call the man over (something we both believe to be rude in most situations), the restaurant's other server arrived, bearing the bad news that a dish two of us wanted had 'just sold out one minute ago.' But rather than complain that our orders really ought to have been taken fifteen minutes earlier, we just nodded and made alternate choices. We were determined not to let even this extreme example of sluggish service phase us, as we had been told by reliable friends of ours that everything on the menu was wonderful. Chestnut's redemption, we figured, would come from the food. Our companion Jay and both I ordered the artichoke and feta salad (pictured above, $8), a full-on disaster of taste combinations. The salad was at once far too salty and too oily, with any sweetness from the artichoke masked by the sharp feta and the arugula. With each bite we were reminded not only of the artichokes' bitterness, but of the sad fact that we could not taste even a hint of the microgreens. HungryMan's gnocchi and guanciale ($9) appetizer was, unfortunately even worse. The dense little gnocchi on his plate appeared to have been sautéed in a few gallons of olive oil and pork fat before being served, transforming them into slick little rubbery lumps. Yet we could see the promise in this dish-with lighter gnocchi and a more parsimonious pouring of the olive oil, this could become a hearty first course. As it was, it looked and tasted like something made on a camp stove in Minsk. Mains offered no relief to HungryMan-his date-stuffed pork chop on white polenta ($22) featured a mammoth slab of flavor-free pork that had been cooked long enough to aquire the texture of a piece of balsa wood. He struggled to eat a quarter of the portion, unaided by the unforgiveably lumpy polenta. When he finally put his fork and knife down and muttered, 'What a waste,' I looked up and nodded, as I was at that moment fighting with a tough slice of quinoa stuffed squid (pictured on Flickr, $8), trying to decide whether or not to ignore my hunger and give up completely. I chose instead to pick a few more forkfuls of the grainy, underseasoned stuffing out of the calamari and pour myself another glass of wine. Jay, on the other hand, sat munching away happily at his braised oxtail papardelle ($19), and after tasting a few mouthfuls, HungryMan and I could both see why: against all odds, his pasta was spectacularly good. The beef was rich, moist and yielding, and the pasta were precisely al dente-exactly the right texture so that they matched the give of the meat. Divine stuff. All three of us sat, puzzled at how such a top-flight dish could come from the same kitchen that produced dry and lumpy polenta and goopy, overlubricated gnocchi. We had plenty of time to ponder this mystery, as our server left us for another twenty minute break, even after we made it very clear that we had finished our meal. Undaunted and more than a little intrigued by the disparity among our main dishes, we made the decision to order dessert. True to form, Chestnut delivered a selection of cookies that were mostly mediocre or mealy, and one that was phenomenally good. The two almond spritz cookies (shown here in the extreme foreground) were the only saving grace of the $7 dessert, but they were so fantastic that they tipped the balance on this dessert well into the positive. Not so the chocolate budino (pictured on Flickr, $7), a traditional Italian custard pudding. Our server described this dish as 'like a molten chocolate cake,' when she ought to have called it a desultory tepid lump of chocolate-flavored Jell-O that oozed water and smelled strangely of saffron. Nothing about this dessert was pleasant, and it sat nearly entirely uneaten as the three of us fought over the last remaining almond cookie. As we paid for our agonizingly long meal, we overheard our absentee Sudoku-solving server tell a nearby table that 'another new restaurant is opening across the street. They're like weeds in this neighborhood.' And he has a point: Smith and Court Streets are at the very heart of Brooklyn's burgeoning restaurant scene. At the same time, it has taken Brooklyn a few hard-fought decades to establish itself as a legitimate home to excellent food. Those new eateries that appear so quickly under the canopy of the well-established old guard benefit from the borough's newfound culinary reputation, while at the same time influencing its equilibrium with every dish they prepare. Chestnut's criminally poor service and substandard cooking do nobody, especially not the neighborhood, any favors. So for the sake of this urban ecosystem, perhaps it is time to cut down this chestnut to keep its blight from spreading. Chestnut, 271 Smith Street (at Degraw Street), 718-243-0049.

Huh. That's really odd. Seriously. I have had two amazing meals at Chestnut (well, one amazing meal that I had twice), and have found the service to be _quite_ good. I've gone on quiet nights (Tuesday and a Wednesday) so maybe that makes all the difference, but I haven't had your experience at all.

Oh, no doubt the place has its fans-we went on the highest recommendations from friends of ours. But what we experienced was shockingly terrible and just lazy.

This is why I can't stand eating in that 'hood. Tons of \"cute\" places with crap kitchens. I'll take no vibe and great food any day. Would love to be surprised by something great opening up, but I lived there for 8 years and it never happened. The places I dug (Leonardo's pizza, for one) closed or morphed. Just had a nice meal at Noodle Pudding but that's stretching it - really Brooklyn Heights. Keep up the great blog.

I have been there three times, with the first being amazing and the two after left me wanting that first experience. Once we walked in on a Saturday night, not expecting a table. They proceeded to tell us 10 minutes, which promptly turned into close to an hour. We were at fault for waiting so long, but we were so hungry that we just waited it out. The meal, however, turned out to be wonderful. Our second experience, we made a reservation, and still had to wait a half hour. The food that time, everything was a little off- a little oily, a little salty. Our last time there was similar, food just didn't live up to that first time and we were just so tired of waiting for everything. It really is a shame... it was so good to start

Eight Mile Creek: Tastes Like...Citizenship?

 Modern Australian cooking is not an easy thing to define. Even Aussies themselves don't seem to agree about what it means: some say it is the fatty colonial cuisine of the British that has never quite disappeared from kitchens down under. Others claim it is all about game meats and fish unavailable anywhere else in the world: kangaroo, emu, Moreton Bay bugs, and barramundi, to name a few. And then there are those that consider Australian cusine to be a process more than a collection of recipes; to them, Oz cooking amounts to nothing more than drawing inspiration from Australia's multicultural population (made up of primarily Mediterranean and Asian immigrants) and cooking with fresh ingredients that come mostly from Australia's bountiful natural resources. The disagreement might not seem like an important one, but because it exists, is nearly impossible to predetermine what kind of meal one is likely to have at an Australian restaurant without actually eating there. So when Schnicksy, Pescatore, HungryMan and I met up at Eight Mile Creek in the heart of NoLita, we girded ourselves for just about anything. What we found was an interesting combination of exotic game cookery and antipodean melting pot fusion cuisine-just enough of a twist to keep us guessing until the very end of the meal. We started with a few of the usual suspects: emu carpaccio with arugula, black truffle oil and edamame ($12), which tasted very much like a lean raw beef salad. The edamame offered a bit of pleasant sweetness to the dish, but the earthy truffle and bitter, vegetal arugula were both too strongly flavored to work with the raw emu slices. To solve this problem, HungryMan ate the emu first and then tucked into the salad after he had finished with the bird. My own beet and arugula salad with goat cheese and macadamia nuts ($8) was just fine, if a little too bland, and in the end it went mostly uneaten. Pescatore's New Zealand green-lipped mussels (pictured on Flickr, $12) were quite a bit better-served in a spicy tomato poaching broth, these little bivalves were meaty and tender, and not a bit overcooked. We also loved how their natural iodine and brine flavors worked well with the piquant saucing. I expected a similar level of spicy heat in Schnicksy's deep fried prawn dumplings ($8), but was surprised to find them a bit underseasoned. Strangely, the shrimp used in the gorgeous little tawny dough packets was pulverized into a thick paste, with no visible sign of a shrimp tail anywhere. Grinding prawns into a mash allows more meat to be packed into a dumpling, certainly, but the table's consensus was that we would have all preferred chopped or whole shrimps, rather than the gummy filling we found inside each of the bundles. On the other hand, we did genuinely enjoy the attempt to integrate Asian flavors and techniques into the dish. This theme emerged once again in Schnicksy's lemon myrtle grilled tuna steak on a seaweed salad ($19), although here it was an outright success. The tuna was seared exactly as requested, and the light and saline combination of soba noodles with two types of seaweed was an excellent textural contrast to the fish. Overall, this was probably the best dish we ate all night. It was certainly more cohesive and better executed than Pescatore's rack of lamb with creamy mashed potatoes (pictured on Flickr, $27), which HungryMan described as 'shockingly oversauced with an overly acidic jus.' We were also puzzled by the superfluous-and rather tough-greens on the plate; they seemed to be a hurried afterthought and out of character with the rest of the dish. Similarly, neither HungryMan's nor my own exotic main dish quite lived up to our expectations. Perhaps the long voyage overseas leeched away some of what makes these foods so special in their native context. No matter the cause, my crispy baked barramundi with couscous and sweet chili pesto ($22) was uninspiring and uninspired. No element of the dish was better than merely satisfactory-the pesto was bland, the couscous a bit sticky, and the fish that I had been looking forward to eating all night was just a limp, slightly rubbery fillet with no real distinguishing features. With such exciting ingredients, it seems a real shame to have turned them into something so dull-the whole dish reminded me of a silent meal of perch I ate in a university dining hall in Paris several years ago, except that the fish I ate then was much better than this barramundi. The kangaroo fillet ($23), on the other hand, did manage to clearly identify itself as an unusual piece of meat, with its flinty, nose-filling mineral overtones and identifiable gaminess. But it ought to have been served on its own, with a simpler sauce and accompaniments, rather than mounded next to an overflowing reservoir of what we could only describe as sweet mushroom gravy. Had the kangaroo been served drizzled with olive oil-or even better, wattleseed extract-and served with the mashed potatoes from the rack of lamb, this might have been an excellent dish. We also could not help but wonder how much of Eight Mile Creek's too-generous saucing was done intentionally, in hopes of covering up the inevitable fact that exotic meats and fish need to be imported-if not from Australia or New Zealand, then from a domestic supplier, and probably not one anywhere near here. Desserts, on the other hand, tend to be easy to re-create in almost any kitchen, and in this regard, Eight Mile Creek managed an easy redemption for itself with a thick, luscious sticky date pudding (pictured on Flickr, $7). We were all also completely won over by the Lamingtons ($7): two slices of fairly dense sponge cake, soaked in thin chocolate icing (or syrup), and then rolled generously in flaked coconut, all served with a ramekin of clotted cream. Any prior culinary missteps were immediately forgiven with one bite of the Lamingtons, a dessert that Australians traditionally serve to new citizens after they take their oath of national allegiance. And in the end, this citizenship day treat is a perfect embodiment of what Eight Mile Creek does well-when the restaurant sticks with stereotypes, it is no better than decent, but when it focuses on embracing Australia's immigrant heritage, infusing its cooking with techniques and flavors from Asia and the Mediterranean, it can be pretty great. So set out a plate of Lamingtons for the kitchen staff and start reading your Kylie Kwong, mates...it can only help. Eight Mile Creek, 240 Mulberry Street (between Spring and Prince Streets), 212-431-4635.

It is sad that so few indigenous Australian ingredients are used at 8 Mile Ck. Australian food is not just about kangaroo and emu, as you mention. Our authentic cuisine reflects the flavors of our land with ingredients such as Lemon myrtle sprinkle, Alpine pepper, Wattleseed and Quandong among 20 others. If you want to experience Australia through the food, try out The Australian about to open next week in New York city. There are others opening around the USA and Australian cuisine is certainly an emerging food trend today. We have an authentic food style and it will become a globally recognized cuisine over the next few years.

American Dreaming at Dressler

***CONTENT
 Williamsburg's Dressler restaurant is named after Martin Dressler, the eponymous antihero of Steven Millhauser's Pulitzer Prize-winning 1996 rags-to-riches, and back-to-rags novel. Dressler, a cigar store owner's son who manages to make it big in the world of New York hotels in turn of the century America, finds big city success to be anything but unalloyed. Among other things, the book is a cautionary tale about the emptiness of ambition and aspiration, especially in New York, where the city's ethos pulsates to the beat of success and money (see also Elizabeth Gilbert's perceptive Eat, Pray, Love). Martin Dressler is an appropriate namesake not just for a restaurant fitted with a steel-and-tile, new industrial age interior, but for Williamsburg as a whole, which continues its awkward evolution from the epicenter of hipsterdom to a more diverse neighborhood where people in suits are as accepted as those in trucker caps. Of course, gentrification has its costs as well as its pleasures: unaffordable condos and a declining bohemian sensibility may count among the former. But Williamsburg's burgeoning restaurant scene certainly compensates for some of this. In the vanguard of the movement is Dressler, squeezed in among a row of nondescript, grimy storefronts just off the Williamsburg Bridge. From its very entrance, Dressler seduces with its details: filligreed ironwork and black-panelled lightboxes frame long mirrored walls, original multi-hued parquet follows underfoot from front to rear, and magnificent coffered ceilings hint at Victorian era elegance. The feel is fin-de-siecle Vienna meets Parisian boudoir. And very much like the decor, the food is elegant and dreamy, unhurried and prepared with an obvious careful attention to detail. Our starters were both excellent on the evening we took photographs, full of unexpected turns and unusual preparations. Take our fried artichoke and salsify appetizer ($9), technically a special that night, the dish is really a recurring guest star on Dressler's menu-prepared in the Roman Jewish style, the artichoke petals upturned, fried in olive oil, and served on a plate protected by squares of butcher paper. Here's the kicker: these were every bit as good as the Carciofi alla Giudia that we ate in Rome in 2003. The salsify root was an excellent addition to the dish, with its toothsome interior and crunchy tips, but the artichokes were appropriately the stars, tender and meaty at the same time, brightened up with a squeeze of fresh lemon. It is true that fried vegetables can sometimes be a cheap trick-who doesn't like the taste of fried food, after all-but fried artichokes often fall flat in the wrong hands, as our recent meal at Centovini proved conclusively. At Dressler, on the other hand, the artichokes were about as close to perfect as either Nosher or I could have imagined. Our other appetizer, the smoked salmon (pictured above, $10) turned out to be a surprise. Not that there wasn't salmon here: there was, but it appeared atop a delightfully crunchy potato pancake, or galette, and nestled in underneath layers of herbed creme fraiche, baby arugula and frisee lettuces. If you squint, you can see a passing resemblance to traditional Danish smørrebrød, minus the dill and caviar. Dressler encircles its own miniature tower of home-smoked fish and greens with a liquid crown of truffle vinaigrette, which lends this starter a complex acidic overtone. Entrees are nearly as good as the appetizers, delivering on both taste and creativity. There's a pan roasted halibut on the menu served with springtime fava beans and sugar snap peas; there's lamb and pork on the list too, but oddly, only one beef entree and, at $30, it is the most expensive item on the menu. What made it worth the price was that the dish was a double-header: a small cut of aged rib eye, grilled to order, and an impossibly tender and wonderfully fatty short rib, braised until nearly molten. A bordelaise sauce glistened under the dining room's soft lighting, and a tart onion jam and small mound of steamed spinach provided both balancing flavors as well as a wisp of evidence that I was getting my allowance of vegetables in the bargain. My only complaint was that the portion of horseradish mashed potatoes, so critical to balancing the intensity of the meat-in particular the rib eye-was pityingly small. Nosher's wild striped bass ($24) was more modest in portion than my extravaganza of beef, but no less flavorful. Flaky and silky-tender, the bass played well with the crunch of the accompanying endive, braised yet still retaining a satisfying firmness. This entire dish represented a superb marriage of flavors: bittersweet endive, salty-sweet tomato, lightly oily and crisp skin, not to mention the olive and basil quenelle made up of an aromatic half-pesto, half-tapenade. Closing the meal we opted for a final, intense meditation on chocolate: the deconstructed peanut butter cup ($7). Renditions of peanut butter and chocolate have become so common on dessert menus of late as to be a little bit passé, yet Dressler managed to surprise us once more, this time with a milk chocolate foam and a light peanut brittle ice cream under a carapace of dark chocolate. Moreover, the Dressler version is a true equal partnership of tastes, with peanut butter flavor coming through every bit as intensely as the chocolate. We did find the chilled chocolate wafers to be a bit too thick to break without a considerable amount of pressure-we both were pleased we had kept a butter knife handy. But otherwise, we found the dessert to be a lovely combination of savory and sweet, and an excellent conclusion to our meal. Service at Dressler is proficient and unrushed, a noticeable feature in the small, often-crowded space where beautiful people-many of whom arrive in taxis, ferried across the Williamsburg Bridge from Manhattan-abound. It is undeniable that the place still has a city-wide buzz about it, even a year after its opening. If Dressler's owner Colin Devlin had in mind to create an eatery with a primarily local clientele, we worry that perhaps his restaurant has suffered a fate similar to that of its namesake in Millhauser's novel. Ambition might just have made Dressler too good to stay local. But let us also be the first to say there could be far worse fates. Dressler, 149 Broadway, between Bedford and Driggs Avenues, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-384-6343.

 Eating in restaurants in New York City is a wonderful thing-no argument from us on that count. At the same time, we also are passionate about the idea that the Big Apple is a home cook's dream town, with its easy access to so many varied and superior quality ingredients. Our belief that real New Yorkers actually cook in their tiny kitchens is why we have always been huge advocates of our good friend Aparna's culinary projects: she is the woman behind the brown-bag blog Lunch*Counter*Culture, a website whose absence we feel acutely every day at noon. Now Aparna and a team of videographers and producers have created a website called ShortOrder.tv, a video podcast blog that features not just cooking and shopping tips for busy people, but several recipes for scrumptious-looking three-minute meals. Yes, that's 3, not 30. Take that, Rachael Ray!

Strategy, Not Size, Keeps Sandwich Planet in Orbit

***CONTENT
 It takes a considerable amount of chutzpah to name a 15-seat restaurant using the word 'planet.' But to Sandwich Planet's owners, Jay and Nick Kidchob, the tiny size of their storefront is immaterial-in their view, the real source of the restaurant's disproportionate gravitational pull is its high-quality food. They have a very good point. The Kidchob brothers stacked the deck in their favor by making two brilliant, strategically critical moves. First, they signed contracts with one of New York's finest breadmakers, Sullivan Street Bakery, ensuring that every one of their sandwiches can be made with superior artisanal Italian bread. This alone guarantees a minimum level of quality to their dishes that most other sandwich shops might never reach on their very best days. Second, they hired exactly the right person to be the face of Sandwich Planet. Rung, the woman behind the tiny counter/lectern, might just be Gotham's most genial server: unfailingly kind, she remains always smiling and soothing, even to cranky local customers during the restaurant's busy lunchtime rush. Moreover, Rung knows the restaurant's 150-sandwich menu like a true expert and is not afraid to warn customers who turn to the 'World of Custom Sandwiches' section of the menu if they concoct a mismatched sandwich that might not be so delicious. Fortunately, Rung does not have to intervene very often; most customers at Sandwich Planet opt for one of the several dozen pre-designed sandwiches and hamburgers on the menu. With these, it is hard to go wrong. HungryMan and I have eaten at the restaurant fifty or sixty times in the past few years, and we have yet to order a dish we did not genuinely enjoy. Some of our favorites include Raoul's hamburger, which comes with a hefty dose of cracked pepper (it is an au poivre burger), swiss cheese, and mushrooms, all served on thick slices of ciabatta bread ($6.95); the Mikie panini, served with lovely bresaola, roasted peppers, fontina cheese, and mesclun greens-it is a pricey sandwich, but savory and gooey, and worth every cent of the $8.45 it costs. We also have a soft spot for Sandwich Planet's tuna sandwiches, especially the pizza bianco or rosemary foccacia sandwich with red leaf lettuce and fresh basil (pictured above, $8.10)-a custom creation, but one that always garners a silent look of approval from Rung. Recently, we have begun eating more of the restaurant's hot sandwiches. Of these, we especially love the unlikely combo of ingredients in the Mini Cristo, made with ham, swiss cheese, and chicken salad in lieu of turkey ($7.75); as well as the crusty French Dip on Ciabatta, served au jus (shown right, $7.25). Before the end of this year, Jay and Nick plan to expand the restaurant's dining room by moving back a few feet into their large kitchen space and opening up the store's basement. The extra room, in combination with extended evening hours and several new evening menu offerings, will give Sandwich Planet a chance to offer a casual dinner service. But before you start thinking that the tiny restaurant's expansion will make it truly planetary in size, keep in mind that the eatery is zoned for only five or six more tables. Its space may eventually grow to resemble Mercury more than Pluto, but as long as the sandwiches stay as reliably excellent as they are, Sandwich Planet can bring its outsized orbit to our solar system any day. Sandwich Planet, 534 Ninth Avenue (between 39th and 40th Streets), 212-273-9768.

Hi Drivingrain, Interesting observation there. The menus are the same because Sandwich Planet was originally conceived as a spin-off of Island Burger. Will Brown, Island Burger's current owner, created the burger menu with the Kidchob brothers, which is why it looks so similar. No copying involved-the two restaurants were once connected. But Sandwich Planet did not really start to excel until it was sold wholly to Jay and Nick-they expanded the menu and moved way beyond burgers and churascos. And if you ever ate a grilled chicken dish at IB prior to 2001, it was the same version they make at Sandwich Planet today. -Nosher

Everything's Coming Up Iceland This Summer

***CONTENT
 For a country of just over 300,000 people, Iceland seems to be making quite a large impression on New York's warm weather months. We started seeing early signs that our nearest European neighbors were working to establish a culinary beachhead here in New York earlier this spring, when we first saw Iceland's national dairy favorite, skyr, on the shelves of Whole Foods Market. Skyr is a kissing cousin to fromage frais-it is a light, skim milk-based yoghurt-style cheese that locals often eat fresh from the farm, drizzled with a bit of honey. And when it is good, it is divine stuff. Our first taste of skyr came about 13 years ago on a red-eye stopover at the Keflavik airport, where we were served skyr at an airport bar at 5:30 in the morning and commanded to: \"Eat this skyr! It will put a bit of the Viking in you.\" Ignoring the double entendre, we did as we were told and were immediately hooked on the stuff, only to be forced to wait a decade for our next taste. Now, thanks to MS Iceland Dairies, we can walk a few blocks for our 'bit of the Viking.' As much as we love skyr, we do wish MS Iceland sold the unflavored skyr, as all of the berry flavors we have tried are a bit too sweet, and at $2.79 for 6 ounces, the product won't be displacing yoghurt any time soon. Then just a few weeks ago, our good friend Chopper announced that he would be attending the Royal de Luxe marionette event, a performance art-cum-street theater extravaganza, which this summer was hosted and partially funded by the city of Reykjavik. He returned from his trip laden like a burro with several kilograms of our favorite candy-just the thing to snack on as we listened to him recount how the elaborately staged event moved through the city like a giant, fantastical puppet parade. While Chopper was away, we got an eerie e-mail that completed the Icelandic trifecta: the note in question came from the company that produces the world's first totally sustainably-produced vodka, asking us if we would be interested in tasting their small batch, lava-filtered spirits. The stars seemed to be aligning, so how could we possibly refuse? Describing the vodka's taste is a bit of a challenge, as it is distilled to be both exceedingly pure and nearly totally neutral in flavor; we detected very subtle pepper and wood notes, but even these were muted. Drunk neat or on ice, the end result is that Reyka has practically no flavor at all-an advantage in some cocktails, and certainly a surprise for a vodka that retails for around $24 for a 750 ml. bottle. HungryMan and I had been searching for a perfect base for a drink to use with our favorite windowsill/garden plant of the season: pineapple sage. This smooth-leafed variant of the Salvia genus smells exactly like a pineapple when its leaves are crushed, and we have been cooking with it all summer long, including using the bruised leaves to flavor a panna cotta. But our goal had been to extract the flavors from the pineapple sage into a cocktail, something summery and cool, aromatic and surprising. For this, the Reyka vodka was superb: we combined it with Poire Williams pear brandy and a teaspoon of superfine sugar, all topped with a few ounces of cold club soda to make a bubbly drink that reminded us of nothing more than the quintessential symbol of Iceland: a geyser. It won't put a bit of the Viking into you, but this drink is sweet and refreshing, especially on a blistering hot day in New York, several hundred miles away from the nearest glacier. The Green Geyser 6 large pineapple sage* leaves 1 teaspoon superfine sugar 2 ounces very neutral vodka 1/2 ounce Poire Williams pear brandy 8-12 ounces club soda *Pineapple sage is available from several stands at the Union Square Greenmarket, but if you cannot find it, you can substitute mint, kaffir lime, or even catnip leaves in this drink. Combine pineapple sage leaves and sugar in a mortar and pestle or small, thick bowl and muddle the leaves into a paste. Add Poire Williams to the mixture and swirl to dissolve all the sugar and to loosen the leaves from the interior of the mortar. Pour this liquid into a drink shaker and shake over ice with vodka. Pour shaken mixture (strained, if you prefer) into two tall glasses filled with ice. Top off with 4-6 ounces of cold club soda. Serve with a straw. Makes 2 cocktails. 2007 nycnosh.com

Arthur Avenue's Greatest Hits, with Bonus Albanian Remix

***CONTENT
 Admittedly, The Bronx's Arthur Avenue is no longer the pivot point of the Italian-American community in New York City-most immigrant families and their descendants decamped at least a few decades ago for the suburbs of New Jersey. But some steadfast residents and business owners remain, and because of them, there is still some excellent nosh to be found in the little neighborhood just south of Fordham University. Indeed, some of our very favorite Italian specialty shops are in the area, and several of these are worth the cost and hassle of a subway ride alone. Most of what we have come to love about the Arthur Avenue area is within spitting distance of the intersection of 187th Street and Arthur Ave. On a visit to the area this Tuesday morning, I started out my visit-at the recommendation of a well-known Bronx native-at the new Palombo Pastry Shop Café, where I ate a sfogliatella (lobster tail) pastry and drank a very hot, malty-tasting cappucchino (both pictured above, $5.00 total). I have certainly had better coffee, but the pastry itself was flaky and crisp, with a sweet ricotta filling that stuck to the top of my mouth as I watched the thin layers of dough spread apart on my plate. Lovely stuff. Scuttlebutt in the neighborhood has it that the café's owner, the ex-husband of one of the owners of nearby Egidio's Pastry Shop, paid quite a premium for the prime location of the restaurant-all just to spite his former mate by stealing away business from her little café down the street. We can't confirm the veracity of the story, but we do know this: Palombo is great for pastries, but only in the morning, while Egidio's is a better choice later in the day, as the latter shop seems better capable of regulating the moisture in its bakery cases, which in turn means fresher-tasting pastries in the evening. For Italian cookies, our favorite shop is De Lillo. Most of their treats are $9.00/lb, with the exception of the pignoli cookies, which are $20.00/lb. HungryMan adores their iced lemon drop semolina cookies, while I go for the pricier pignoli cookies (both pictured above), which cost so much because they contain so many expensive pine nuts. De Lillo not only makes all of its cookies on-site, it (unlike many nearby shops) maintains an across-the-board fair pricing policy, so you will pay for your cookies exactly what the dottering nonna from the building next door would. At any rate, if she wanted free goodies, she would likely be next door at one of our other favorite spots, Casa Della Mozzarella, which not only makes some of the finest deli sandwiches in the city but offers customers generous samples of cured meats and cheeses as they shop. We never leave Casa Della Mozzarella without at least one of their sublime homemade scamorza ($6.99/lb, or approx. $8.00 per cheese), a firmer, saltier, and more acidic relative of mozzarella. I prefer the yellow, smoked variety, and especially enjoy it sliced and browned on a grill pan, then tossed in a salad of arugula and figs or fresh berries. Most recipes that call for halloumi cheese can be made with scamorza, as well. When we first started visiting the Arthur Avenue neighborhood, it was to eat a meal at local legend Roberto's, and while we still believe that Roberto's is one of the best Italian restaurants in the city, these days, we bypass the restaurant's hour-long lines and just shop for provisions. Without a doubt, we see more of the changes in the neighborhood when we are not focused on losing our spot in the dinner queue. And the ethnic flux in the area is quite possibly its most fascinating feature-over the past two decades, Albanians and Kosovars have moved into the area in huge numbers. Today, you stand as much of a chance of hearing Albanian spoken on the street as you do Italian. Yet because the neighborhood survives in part because it is an Italian-themed cultural destination, much of the visible clues that the area is largely Central European are missing. If you look very carefully, you'll see them-you certainly will if you listen to street chatter-but from the corner of 187th and Arthur, things look much as they always have. Nevertheless, even this is changing, albeit at a glacial pace; south on Arthur Avenue from 187th Street, a few Balkan shops have opened, including a specialist deli and a grocery store. We suspect that as long as Arthur Ave. retains its public image as a little slice of Italian-American heritage, there will be plenty of Italian food in the area, even if it is cooked and served to you by someone whose last name is Xhaxhka. Palombo Pastry Shop Café, 601 East 187th Street (at Arthur Avenue), 718-329-8800 De Lillo Pastry Shop, 606 East 187th Street, 718-367-8198 Casa Della Mozzarella, 604 East 187th Street, 718-364-3867

Arthur Ave, as you no doubt know, offers far more too...thanks for the post. Homemade soppressata and ricotta at Calabria Pork Store...oysters on the street in front of Randazzo's fish market...incredible pizza dough and biscotti at Madonia Bros bakery...I could go on and on. My favorite sfogliatelle, by the way, are from Morrone's, an Arthur Ave newcomer. Albanian food is indeed lurking on the fringes...Tony and Tina's pizzeria (on Arthur closer to Fordham Road) serves up delicious bureks.

Of World Cocktail Day and Delaware Dish: Noshingtonienne's Big Adventure

***CONTENT
 When Noshingtonienne told us she would be attending the Meals From the Masters charity bash a few weeks back, we asked her for two things: (1) as many photos as she could possibly take, and (2) any nibbles she could fit into her purse. We're not proud of this, but when you peruse the list of chefs gathering to help out Meals on Wheels Delaware: Mark Peel, Lidia Bastianich, Dennis Leary, Dan Stern, Martin Oswald, and Vikram Garg of D.C. hotspot Indebleu, you can see why we were begging for table scraps. Not only did Noshingtonienne report that the food was spectacular, she also related to us how impressed she was at how generous all the participants were with their time, helping one another prep and plate dishes, and just generally acting completely ego and attitude-free. You read that right: for just one weekend in Delaware, there wasn't a diva in the house. Camaraderie and caviar were the watchwords of the event. Everyone's favorite dish, according to Noshingtonienne, was Vikram Garg's butter poached lobster with spinach potato tikka and fenugreek beurre blanc (pictured above). It takes no great skill to get food lovers to eat lobster, but when you do it in a way that has even the most jaded gastronomes doing double- and triple-takes at their plates as they eat, you know you're onto something very special. On that weekend, Noshingtonienne also started up a torrid affair with a new cocktail, thanks to NYC native and local mixology guru Dale DeGroff-also known to the world as King Cocktail. The drink that won her heart that weekend was an elaborate, citrusy concoction called the Yuzu Gimlet (pictured here below the buddha). DeGroff took the traditional gimlet formulation: gin, lime, and Rose's Lime Juice, and played around with proportions so that his drink really highlighted the astringent flavors of the yuzu (a small yellow Japanese grapefruit). So in celebration of World Cocktail Day today, we have created a version of DeGroff's Meals from the Masters gimlet made entirely from readily available ingredients. We approximated the zingy, floral tones of the yuzu by using grapefruit zest and Cointreau (instead of Maraschino liqueur), and we also upped the botanical quotient a bit by using Bombay Sapphire gin instead of the more neutral Plymouth gin that King Cocktail did. The result is bright, ultra-tangy, and very simple to prepare. After much debate, we decided to name the cocktail for Noshintonienne's favorite Spring bloom, and while you might want to garnish your Daisy Gimlet with a fresh daisy, be careful: many species of daisy aren't edible. A good alternative is a disc of kiwi, cut as you might prepare a lemon for a garnish, or simply floated on the surface of the gimlet. While you're sipping, you can also check out some of Noshingtonienne's photos from the Meals from the Masters event. And lest we forget: Happy World Cocktail Day! Daisy Gimlet 3 oz. Bombay Sapphire gin 1 oz. Cointreau 1 oz. fresh lime juice (about 1 lime) 1/2 ripe kiwi fruit, peeled 1.5 Tbsp. fresh grapefruit zest 2 Tbsp. Rose's Lime Juice 1 oz. agave nectar OR 2 oz. simple syrup OR 3-4 Tbsp. superfine sugar Slice lime in half, juice into a bar glass and muddle with ripe kiwi and grapefruit rind. Really grind the kiwi and grapefruit together to release all of the essential oils from the citrus ingredients. Add gin and Cointreau, and then transfer the liquid to a cocktail shaker filled with ice, leaving the big chunks behind. Add simple syrup and Rose's Lime Juice to the shaker. Shake well and strain into glasses. You can also strain a second time if you do not want pulp and kiwi seeds in the cocktail. Garnish and serve. Makes 2 drinks. 2007 nycnosh.com

 For the next two weeks, put banh mi out of your mind. No, we're not on an anti-Vietnamese snack kick; we have just fallen madly in love with another sandwich. Sadly, it's a seasonal one, so our passion is relegated to strictly Spring fling status. The sandwich in question is Sullivan Street Bakery's ramp, mozzarella and boiled egg sandwich with anchovy vinaigrette ($6), a narrow, savory masterpiece on a half a filone flauto that has been toasted and gently brushed with fine olive oil. It is the perfect culinary incarnation of the season, with its green, garlicky sautéed ramps imparting their musky flavor to semi-soft egg yolks and to the chewy interior of the thin Italian baguette. This is just the kind of sandwich that begs to be eaten on a warm weekday stroll through a park, but quite honestly, it is so good that even if you are forced to savor it in your office cubicle, acres from a window, it will make you feel as if you have captured a little piece of Spring. Only Sullivan Street Bakery on West 47th Street sells this lunchtime treat, and quite honestly, the sandwich is worth every penny of the cost of a cab ride from pretty much anyplace in Manhattan. But if you live in the neighborhood or work in Midtown and can make the trek out just past 10th Avenue, you are in serious luck. The shop sells out of the sandwiches often by early afternoon on weekdays and weekends alike, so be quick if you want to grab one-and we promise, the banh mi will still be here when the ramps are gone for the year. Sullivan Street Bakery, 533 West 47th (between 10th and 11th Avenues), 212-265-5580.

Always Wear Sunscreen: Gigino Wagner Park

***CONTENT
 Quite a few die-hard New Yorkers will tell you that the Statue of Liberty is in the perfect location: close enough to be visible from the city, yet far enough away to draw some of the tourists out of the boroughs and onto a boat moving into deep water. Uncharitable? Perhaps. But there is something to be said for admiring Lady Liberty from some remove-and even better if you can do it while eating a decent meal. This double sensory whammy is precisely what the team behind Gigino Wagner Park had in mind when they designed the space for the Battery Park sibling to their Tribeca eatery, putting all of their design emphasis on two key elements: plate glass and patio. The resulting restaurant is exactly what you might imagine: a superb lookout point on a sunny day, regardless of the weather. But when the temperatures are balmy, it becomes an amplified, ideal version of itself, luring diners ineluctably outside, onto the brick patio where the view of New York Harbor is about as perfect as it could possibly be. With surroundings like this, it is easy to imagine that the food might be an afterthought, but Gigino manages to hold up the gustatory part of the experiential bargain, offering a good, if fairly predictable, selection of Italian dishes, many of which are inspired by Amalfi Coast cusine. This makes perfect sense, considering that Luigi Celentano, the chef at both Gigino restaurants, was also the guiding culinary force behind sceney late-80's fixture Positano-a restaurant whose name wouldn't have been out of place on the pages of Spy magazine. But today, all that remains of Positano is its branded flatware-many pieces of which are currently in circulation at Gigino-and of course Celentano's reliably solid cooking. We joined our friends Candide and Cich for lunch one very sunny day recently, in celebration of HungryMan's birthday, and chose Gigino in part because we knew that we were likely to have both an above average meal and a glorious view. And on that weekday at noon, we got exactly what we had anticipated, plus just a bit more. Our favorite starters of the day were the light and chunky cool tomato soup with fresh ricotta (pictured above, $9), and the perfectly-dressed caprese salad (pictured top, $11.50), which surprised us with its fruity yellow tomato slices and very ample portion of silky fresh mozzarella cheese. Cich's Capellini Liberta ($16), an angel hair, shrimp, and lightly sautéed vegetable dish was excellent, despite the inauthentic grating of parmesan cheese on a seafood dish. Candide opted for the day's special tomato papardelle ($17), which was a simple garlicky red sauce over toothsome ribbons of thin homemade flat noodles. This dish had just the right amount of acid and basil, and was probably the best thing any of us ate that day. It also paired spectacularly with a glass of lightly sparkling and gently tannic Calabrian L'Antico red-a wine none of us had high hopes for, but which we all genuinely enjoyed. The bubbly Syrah blend also worked well with my seafood risotto ($17.50), thanks to the bold, round flavors of the crushed tomatoes and the slightly musky mussels. I was most impressed by the other seafood in this dish, however-I have not had risotto with such delicately cooked shrimp and squid in a very long time. The little shrimp were juicy, soft, and just...barely...pink. And by the end of our meal out on the patio, so were we. In truth, some of us were more than just a little pink, as the outdoor umbrellas had not yet been deployed to the terrace. Still, we left smiling, if a bit sun-blinded. We all decided that this was exactly what springtime New York birthday lunches should all be like: loaded with good food, a table yards from the water, and a view that makes slathering on a little SPF well worth the trouble. Gigino Wagner Park, 20 Battery Place (near Historic Pier A), 212-528-2228.

At Minamoto Kitchoan, a Blossom Sweetie

 Cherry blossoms have been blooming all over the city for at least a fortnight, after being forestalled just a bit by our late-season April freeze. So right now is your last chance to see New York's sidewalks carpeted with petals, and better yet, to smell the fragrance of the Japanese sakura/zakura trees that dot Midtown from Bryant Park north into Central Park. This is also your last chance to grab one of the most unusual souvenirs of the season that you are likely to find in NYC: a Japanese cherry blossom dessert (wagashi) called Yoshinozakura. These gelled pastries are made from an arrowroot matrix, meaning that they are gelatin-free and therefore vegetarian friendly. The arrowroot gel is boiled with sugar, cherry blossoms, glutinous rice, and essence of cherry blossoms, and poured into a wide, inch-high sheet that is then cut into cubes and wrapped for sale. The packaging has to be among the most elegant we have ever seen on a snack, with its petal-shaped tissue paper label and chic pink palette. Then again, at $4.00 per piece, a stylish wrapper is de rigeur, as is excellent flavor. However, before you purchase yoshinozakura for more than just decoration, you should know that when they are boiled or cooked, cherry blossoms lose nearly all of their floral scent and flavor and become more round and mellow tasting, almost like a cross between a blackberry and a prune. If you know this before you take your first bite of a slick, slightly sticky yoshinozakura, you will not be disappointed. Not suprisingly, there is only one shop in NYC that carries these unique confections: Minamoto Kitchoan, a high-end Japanese dessert specialty store that sells-and makes-exquisitely packaged traditional-style wagashi, and where above all else, presentation counts. This is not the place to go for a cream puff or a box of Collon cookies, but it is the ideal spot to pick up a gift to bring along to a swanky dinner party. When we talked with the staff at Minamoto Kitchoan, they told us that the shop has enough yoshinozakura in stock to last approximately another two weeks. Once purchased, these sweets last about a month, as long as they are kept cool. But we recommend giving and eating yoshinozakura right now, preferably outdoors, while there are still blossoms on the trees, so that you can capture the essence of the Spring with every single one of your senses at once. Minamoto Kitchoan, 608 Fifth Avenue (at 49th Street), 212-489-3747.

This place is simply irresistible. If you like sakura sweets, I hope you didn't miss the sakura-daifuku while they were here? Also, much as I dislike red beans, the sakura-mochi are one of the most interesting combinations of flavours I've ever tried. And, of course, you must try the hakuun-no-hotori before it goes out of season!

A Spice Route Runs Through It

***CONTENT
 If you find yourself craving South Indian food anywhere within 30 blocks of Midtown, Saravanaas is the easy and obvious solution. But if you're downtown and you're hankering for some spice, you've got your work cut out for you, because looking for Indian food downtown is like playing an especially frustrating game of Where's Waldo. Thank goodness then, for A Spice Route, where Oscar, a Bombay-born friend from work, took me last month. To him, A Spice Route's menu is reminiscent of the kind of food one might find at an Indian home, a kind of no-nonsense, veggie-heavy smorgasbord of sauces and rices, all enlivened by spicy heat. And in New York at least, this kind of fiery zing can usually only be found at the city's numerous ersatz barbecue joints. Spice Route has an intriguing pedigree: while it is owned by Inderjit and Manveen Singh, Vikas Khanna is its consulting chef. If you've never heard of Vikas Khanna, it was just a matter of time before you did. After all, not every Indian chef has his own Wikipedia page and multiple Internet fansites (including one with photo galleries grouped under a convincing faux 'People's Sexiest Man Alive' banner). Vikas moved to New York in 2000 and worked his way up from dishwasher at Tribeca's Salaam Bombay. But a lot has changed in the past seven years- Spice Route (formerly Tandoor Palace II) is Khanna's first restaurant, one that takes on the daunting challenge of blending North and South Indian cuisine in an ultra-casual setting. Inside, the restaurant is simple and spare, with two rows of functional tables lining the walls and cafeteria-style serving stations in the back. While diners can choose between an impressive a-la-carte menu and an $8 all-you-can-eat buffet, there are can't-miss items on both menus, which can lead to some hand-wringing. And although we generally find buffets lacking, with two people, you can have your aloo paratha and eat it too, if one goes for the buffet and both are consulted on the a la carte items. We started with the buffet, where Oscar prepared a chaat, a common Indian side dish of potatoes, chick peas and yogurt. Because there are no instructions posted on how to build a decent chaat, either go with a friend who knows or follow these simple directions: start with a big plate, pile on a base of Spice Route's tender roasted potatoes, add a sprinkling of chick peas, and then a larger handful of rice cakes. These are not your normal rice cakes-these are clusters of tandoori-fired rice that add a satisfying crunch to the chaat. In Bombay, Oscar told me, these come in the shape of long, hollow tubes that children place over their fingers before they nibble the snacks off, one by one. Over this potato/chick pea/rice cake base, liberally add spoonfuls of the loose yogurt. Finally, add as much of the various chutneys as you can handle. Spice Route offers two very good ones: a sweet tamarind chutney with wonderful depth of flavor and a hotter coriander chutney the color of absinthe, but made with mint and green chilies. Fully assembled, this is a soupy stew with both ample crunch and heat, a dish that is the essence of Indian home cooking. At the other extreme from the chaat are dishes most home cooks rarely prepare, like the baingan bharta ($7.95), which we ordered from the a-la-carte menu . This was a marriage of flavors from the spring and summer garden: tomatoes, onions, peas, eggplant, simmered for hours until the depth of the flavors came fully together. While the dish could have benefited from additional heat, this is not an easy dish to make well, which explains its absence from the menus of competitors. Another hard-to-find dish in Downtown is the dosa, a breakfast staple in Southern India but which in the US are eaten throughout the day. A dosa is essentially a massive crepe encasing a variety of fillings, and often rolled in the shape of a cigar. Spice Route offers a plain dosa, a masala dosa with potato and onion inside, a spicier version called a mysore masala dosa, and an onion rave masala dosa (pictured, $8.95), with onion, potato and a strong blast of turmeric. This dosa also looks different from the others, as it comes squared-off and folded into a lacey envelope, allowing the onion and potato mixture to spill onto the plate. Dipped into a ramekin of the thick coconut chutney, it is heaven on a plate. Overall, this is also easily the most satisfying dish on the menu, but be forewarned: all dosas are made to order and a five minute wait is part of the bargain. For echt Indian home cooking though, it's hard to beat idli, spongy discs or balls of fermented rice and lentils, steamed into a tender, springy dough (pictured top, $5.95). They look like a Madhur Jaffrey take on matzoh balls, but are drier and denser, with less salt and more heft than their Jewish cousins. And like matzoh balls, they are designed to float in broth, absorbing its flavors. At Spice Route, as in India, idli are eaten with sambhar, a lentil-based soup with vegetables, red and green chilies. As with the dosa, I found it hard to believe that idli is a breakfast dish in India, especially considering the heat its slices of green chili leave at the back of your mouth. Spice Route does offer a few sops to American preferences, and the chicken makhni, or butter chicken (pictured above, $7.95), is one of them. The dish features a creamy tomato sauce dotted with medium-sized chunks of white meat chicken. Unfortunately, we both found the chicken dry and overcooked and the sauce one-dimensional, under-seasoned, and thinner than it should have been. Forget catering to American palates; Spice Route is better without dishes like this. On the other hand, I do recommend the lassis, particularly as we move into warmer weather. The mango lassi packs a sweet, thick punch that can cut through just about any amount of heat a sambhar can put out. Less popular among Americans, but worth considering is the savory chaas lassi, made with coriander, salt, yogurt and green chilies. Do not come to Spice Route expecting haute cuisine or fancy Indian food; this is cooking of the kind you are likely to get if you went to visit a family while visiting Delhi or Bombay, and in case you forget its humble roots, just pay attention to the fact that everything is served on disposable dishware. At the same time, real Indian home cooking was never like this-there are few home kitchens that could put together such a feast, and with such successful results. Forget his Bollywood good looks-it is this skillful blending of hearty, rustic fare with complicated, festival-style cooking that Vikas Khanna is using to build his real reputation. And it only takes a few bites to discover just how lucky we are that New York's Financial District is the place he selected to invest his culinary capital.

Our office was relocated back to downtown on 222 Broadway, my only concern was good Indian food. I was totally wrong, Spice Route (Tandoor Palace) was it, right next door. Though I never cared much for their buffet, I absolutely love the DOSAS. Well, when Vikas is there it tastes much better I just saw he was in People's Magazine Sexiest Man. Well Spiciest to be more accurate.

thanks for your lovely review...but did you say everything was on disposable plate?? Isn't that a lot of plates to go through if you're eating buffet? Would love to visit the place, but I would like to know beforehand because honestly I don't think I want to eat at a place that uses only disposables. Thank goodness downtown has something better than tho old bad Indian food choices.

I just had dinner at Vikas Khanna's new place on 54 and b*WAY. It was amazing amazing. Picture perfect. It was superb. Frank, is not a big fan of Indian cuisine, but today was his day to explore the exotic cuisine. The fisherman's stew was my favorite. Every dish was holy COW. Thanks for posting this. Jessica

Centovini: Take One Down, Pass It Around

***CONTENT
 When a restaurant's very name declares just how stocked its cellars are-'centovini' means '100 wines'-you can bet its patrons expect a few good bottles. And in that regard, Moss sibling Centovini bears up admirably. Its wine list includes more than a hundred very fine and decently priced Italian wines from all over The Boot and its islands, many of which are available by the glass (in generous pours) for $10 and up. It is easy to see the allure of sipping a glass or two in the mod, monochromatic space, illuminated from above by some of the most sculptural and gorgeous hand-blown lighting fixtures we have seen in any enoteca anywhere. So far so good. Of course, there is food at Centovini as well, most of it Italian, with a few Modern American twists here and there. We visited recently with SisNosh and her traveling companion, hoping to kick-start their whirlwind visit to Gotham with a memorable meal, only to find that while Centovini fulfills its brief as a wine bar quite adeptly, there are a few serious kinks in the menu that really need to be worked out before the restaurant side of the business matches up to both the beautiful space and the moderately high prices. Of the several dishes we ate, two emerged as worth every penny of their cost: the Miner's Lettuce and Pickled Beets Salad ($14, pictured top), a lush plate of baby greens, tangy cubed beets, and crunchy shards of fried Jerusalem artichokes. SisNosh and I shared this starter and absolutely inhaled it off the plate. Also impressive was the Beef Carpaccio with Wild Arugula and Grana Padano ($16, pictured above), which was presented as a teepee-like pyramid of greens and cheese shavings that sat atop three delicately shaven slices of very lean beef-this was an umami-fest on a plate, and again, we made quick work of it. But our hopes were set too high by the superb appetizers, as our main dishes were all sub-par. HungryMan's Fried Rabbit and Baby Artichokes ($30) looked marvelous, with its deep-fried goujons of gently gamey rabbit meat and battered carciofi, done in the Roman Jewish style. But the meat itself was overcooked and tough, while the artichokes were overbattered in something sweet that reminded all four of us of nothing more than a beignet. Even though the portion was not large, the dish was at once too heavy and too insipid to finish. The Pollo Arrosto with Brussels Sprouts and Mashed Potatoes ($28) that SisNosh and her friend shared was even worse: oversalted and very tough, the chicken looked and tasted more like something out of a grocery store rotisserie than something befitting Centovini's rich ambiance. We also suspected that the mashed potatoes had been blitzed in a food processor, as they were very gummy, and again, far too salty. Only the brussels sprouts were cooked properly, and because these sat in the same briny gravy as the rest of the dish, eating them required a tall glass of water nearby. My own main, a special that evening, was the Soft Shell Crabs with Capers and Spinach. The crabs themselves were well-prepared and tender, but this dish suffered from the same overzealous salting that plagued our other entrées, a problem that was compounded by the liberal addition of capers to the dish's sauce. I far preferred the tender sautéed spinach accompaniment to the main event, and coming from someone who relishes soft shell crab season, there is no more tragic comment I could make. SisNosh also ordered a split bowl of the Chickpea and Dandelion Soup with Tubetti ($12), which she and her good friend ate only a few bites of before shaking their heads, pointing at the bowl and announcing, \"This is where all of the extra salt should have gone.\" And they were exactly right-the soup was bland and underseasoned, while the fried chickpeas were greasy and again, almost tasteless, even with the mild biterness of the dandelion greens peeking through the flavor profile. Despite our disappointment with our mains and the soup, we did what any intrepid noshers would: we made the most of the fantastic wine selection, ordered a second bottle of the Dolcetto Dogliani from the supremely competent wine steward, and sat talking as we picked wistfully at our plates. By the end of the meal, none of us wanted to risk dessert, so we settled the bill and left with good memories of the wine still lingering. When we discussed the meal later, we came to the conclusion that we would all return in an instant-if only for the ravishing décor and some of Centovini's eponymous, well-chosen vino. Centovini, 25 West Houston Street (at Greene Street), 212-219-2113.

Bronxhampton's Best: Johnny's Reef Restaurant
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2007-04-26 22:55:00
***CONTENT
 City Island is a Janus-faced little teardrop in the Bronx that seems to revel in its strange, urban duality. On City Island Avenue, the main drag, you'll find non-stop bumper-to-bumper weekend traffic, plenty of ambient Reggaetón, and dozens of subpar seafood restaurants, while on the eastern border of the island sit several dozen of the best-maintained Craftsman and Foursquare bungalows in the city. Imagine what might happen if someone grafted the busiest section of Fordham Avenue onto Shelter Island, and you've got an inkling of what City Island looks like on a warm Saturday. Now, the good news is that there is some really fine food to be found on the island, but the bad news is that it is located at the most remote tip of the island, which means suffering through at least 30 minutes of painfully slow driving, and that is only the last leg, after you have crossed over the bridge onto City Island. Bx29 buses run on City Island from the Pelham Bay Park terminus of the 6 train, but because these vehicles travel on the same, two-lane streets all the cars do, they are also very slow. It is possible to walk or bicycle from the train station, however, and if you can possibly manage it, you should. Once you are on City Island, we recommend putting your blinders on and making your way directly south, following the seagulls in the distance as you go. Once you are there, you will find Johnny's Reef Restaurant, a bustling cafeteria-style fish house that caters to perhaps the most ethnically diverse clientele in the city. Inside the warehouse-sized dining room, you will spot several stations around the perimeter where diners place orders for the various parts of their meals. Be forewarned that there is a method to ordering here: there are separate stations for side dishes, drinks, grilled seafood, fried seafood, and alcoholic drinks, respectively, which means that if you want to eat your food at its hottest, you should order your food in the following sequence: drinks-side dishes-seafood. Of course, bringing a friend or two along to divide up the labor also does the trick. The menu at Johnny's is simple, Eastern seaboard pier fare, and although the restaurant offers both grilled and fried fish, Johnny's overwhelming strength is its fried seafood. Our favorite item on the menu is the fried oyster platter ($13, pictured top), a paper basket containing about a dozen minerally oysters that have been battered in a cornmeal topping and then fried up crisp and crunchy. These rival any deep-fried seafood in Manhattan, at a fraction of the cost. Be careful though-deep fried oysters must be eaten hot, otherwise their iodine flavor becomes a bit unpleasant. We like to order a basket of the fried oysters at the very last minute before we eat, so that they are still tongue-blisteringly hot when we squeeze a lemon wedge on them and start to pop them into our mouths. The fried shrimp platter ($11) is also above average, although when the restaurant gets busy-and it does frequently on weekends-the kitchen occasionally overcooks the shrimp a bit. We have overheard other patrons asking for their shrimp cooked 'extra light,' a request that might ensure juicier shrimps. Yet even when they are a bit overdone, the shrimps are still very good, cooked in that same cornmeal batter used on the oysters. Our one caution is to avoid the fried lobster tails, as these are tiny, almost langoustine-sized, and absolutely not worth $22, not to mention the attendant ecological cost that comes from harvesting such minute lobsters. Side dishes are also very solid at Johnny's Reef-we especially like the buttery corn-on-the-cob ($2, pictured above with chowder) and the surprisingly spicy Manhattan-style clam chowder ($3.50), which not only contains lots of Long Island Bay clams, but a really zesty kick of cayenne pepper as well. The heat is unexpected but refreshing, especially when it accompanies fried food...as it inevitably does. The chowder, like everything else at Johnny's Reef Restaurant, is best when it is eaten outside in the sun, and while the restaurant's waterfront patio is a little charmless, the oysters and buttery corn are more than enough to make up for the ambiance. But if the seagulls and picnic tables do not appeal, your other option-and a perfectly good one-is to order your food to go (ask for an extra layer of foil to keep things extra hot) and then walk or cycle north along the much quieter, much more scenic Minnieford Avenue until you find a perfect little stretch of curb where you can spread out your feast and marvel that this cottage-lined street is still part of the Bronx. Johnny's Reef Restaurant, 2 City Island Avenue, City Island, 718-885-2090.

Gold St.: Don't Bite Too Hard

***CONTENT
 Gold Street sounds like it ought to be the name of the fanciest restaurant in town, yet this new 24-hour diner in the Financial District turns out to be decidedly downscale. Opened just last Saturday by Peter Poulakakos of Harry's fame (his family owns the Financier chain of patisseries, as well as Ulysses, Harry's Steak and Bayards on Stone Street), Gold St. looks more like a diner from New Jersey that has landed downtown than a hip new watering hole for Wall Streeters. And unfortunately, the menu suffers from multiple personalities: there are the expected burgers and salads on the list; a reasonable selection of comfort food classics like meatloaf, penne pasta, and a pork chop dish; breakfast items that are served all day; and then inexplicably, an extensive sushi menu, complete with $14 poached lobster rolls and three grades of tuna sashimi (akami, chutoro, otoro). Top all of this off with a rotating list of daily specials that also seems to have been chosen at random from someone's copy of Joy, and you've got the schizo essence of Gold St. Even stranger, there were no daily specials offered when a colleague from work and I visited this week-a disappointment. So we ordered some salads, a burger and a wrap. Our waitress, an over-excited Brazilian woman who was eager to shake our hands at the end of our meal murmured her approval of our choices and disappeared through the theme-y decor, a low-concept design that reads as little more than 90210's Peach Pit meets Newark Airport's Terminal C Garden State Diner. If my colleague's garden salad ($6) is anything to go by, heading to Terminal C may be a better bet than stopping in to Gold St. for a healthy plate. This industrial-style salad was an abomination of tasteless romaine, machine cut red bell peppers and wan, hothouse tomato. A raspberry vinaigrette struggled vainly to pep the dish up, but couldn't help this flaccid salad. As aptly described by my colleague, the salad was a depressing testament to process over imagination. If 'to salad' were a verb, this would be its sad subjunctive tense. The other appetizer we ordered, the roasted beets, arugula and goat cheese salad ($7.50), was better, but not without its problems. To its credit, the baby arugula was fresh and retained a peppery bite, and the croutons also added just the right amount of crunch to the dish. On the other hand, the ratio of greens to beet and cheese skewed heavily toward the greens, and the whole dish would have been improved with a lighter dressing and a larger portion and higher quality of goat cheese. Still, compared to the mixed salad, this was a dream. My colleague's BLT wrap ($7; $10 with chicken) was satisfactory, but miles away from special. Like other classic, simple recipes, the BLT is a high wire act that puts both its strengths and flaws on full display: if one ingredient lacks freshness or doesn't hold up to the other two, the sandwich can fail utterly. At Gold St., the bacon was crispy and competently cooked, but the lettuce was flavor-free chopped iceberg, and the tomato tasted like a miserable cousin of the mealy wedge in the mixed salad. The most interesting thing about the BLT wrap was its presentation- it arrived to the table swaddled in wax paper and a drive-in style wire cupholder containing a paper cup filled with passable, but barely warm french fries. My hamburger ($8, with swiss cheese and mushrooms an additional dollar apiece) was smaller than either of us anticipated-nearly slider-sized-yet it was ultimately mostly satisfying. Hot and not too greasy, Gold St.'s burger managed to avoid the worst sins of the genre: it held up to multiple toppings without falling apart and did not soak the bun. Also, we like that Gold St. asks patrons for input on doneness; you can get a rare or medium-rare burger without signing a consent form. All hamburgers served in the restaurant come with the same paper cup of fries that accompany the sandwiches and wraps. Just eat them quickly and don't save them for later. My colleague and I did not stay for dessert, though we understand that some of these come from the Financier kitchens, which is as solid a recommendation as any. Yet despite all of the problems we encountered during our visit, we are not ready to write off Gold St. just yet. For one thing, the Poulakakas clan has an admirable knack for listening to critical feedback and then working out early kinks in their menus. Then there is the more pragmatic reason: the area is in real need of a 24-hour jack-of-all-trades diner, and Gold St. will easily find a loyal crowd to keep the business afloat. We hope a perfect synthesis of both options takes place, turning what is currently Fool's gold into something a little more precious. Gold St., 2 Gold St., at Platt Street near Maiden Lane, 212-747-0797.

The Tastiest Kind of Stereotype

***CONTENT
 Ask a person from a foreign country to make a list of typical New York City foods, and you are likely to see pizza, hot dogs, bagels, and quite possibly, cheesecake. If you have been in Gotham for any length of time, of course you know that, while all of these could make a good case to be the gustatory metaphors for our city, there are also plenty of other native foods that may never make the list (egg cream, we're looking at you). But such is the nature of the stereotype-you don't get to choose your own image, no matter how hard you try. When we spotted these Meiji Pucca NY Cheesecake Cookies in the Yagura Japanese Supermarket on 41st Street, we knew we were in the presence of reductivist marketing at its best: unsalted, Goldfish-style pretzel crackers, filled with a cheescake flavored filling and depicted on the package swimming through the air in a little school, with a twilight cityscape in the background. The fact that one of the poor fish has been cross-sectioned to show its filling doesn't seem to stop it from floating along with its mates, however. Physical impossibilities notwithstanding, we were intrigued, and so we plonked down our $1.25 and left with a small, snack-sized box of the cookies. Imagine our surprise to discover that not only were some of these fish actually little octopus crackers (not very NYC, frankly), but more importantly, that the cookies were delicious. In particular, the cheesecake filling, which contains 'cheese powder' of some sort, tastes very much like a thickened dollop of cheesecake. It also works well with the light, crispy pretzel coating, and while we think these cookies could do with a touch more salt in the cracker component, the combination of sweet richness and crunchy coating is almost pitch-perfect. Don't hold your breath for a Gray's Papaya cracker any time soon, but in the meantime, you can revel in these little bite-sized morsels of cultural appropriation. It may not be your New York, but it sure tastes good.

Clinton Street Baking Company: Worth the Wet

***CONTENT
 With New York practically underwater at the moment, it takes a brave soul to step outside and challenge the elements, even if basic sustenance is part of the motivation. Credit Clinton Street Baking Company for coaxing us out. Wth our friend Dolin in tow, we made a pilgrimage to this Lower East Side breakfast mecca, a recent winner of Time Out New York's award for Best Brunch. And we weren't the only ones to be lured like earthworms out from our little holes on this Sunday morning: even with sheets of rain cascading from the rooftops, a line of 15 or more umbrellas curled down the street at 9:45 a.m., fifteen minutes before the restaurant was scheduled to open. Such devotion from its customers is CSBC's well-deserved reward for six years of consistency in both friendly service and close attention to detail and flavors. Much of this success is due to the efforts of chef and co-owner Neil Kleinberg, who, though Brooklyn-born and bred, has managed to re-create a small-town diner with a Southern accent, complete with homemade biscuits, fried green tomatoes, po' boys and baked grits. Yet the wholesome vibe has an edge. Those grits? They're made with fontina cheese and white truffle oil. And the po' boys? They can be made with yellowtail flounder or even soft-shell crab. The pace is also more urban than rural: Chef Kleinberg cranks out dozens of his nearly faultless plates as fast as the staff can squeeze diners through the door, and each of the dishes that lands on the pass-through between the kitchen and dining room is accompanied by a satisfyingly sonorous 'ding!' The presence of fried green tomatoes is the first sign you're not in a typical Gotham breakfast spot. These come lightly battered in a cornmeal crisp coat that is so lightly fried that they never feel heavy, even as the discs retain the fruit's original slightly firm structure. Better still, they're never soggy. A ramekin of jalapeno spiked sour cream is there for dunking; and while the sauce wimps out on the heat, it provides a smooth textural counterpoint to the grainy crunch of the fried tomato rounds. At $4 for a serving, these are also a tremendously good deal. Dolin's sweet tooth steered her to one of CSBC's daily specials, a plate of vanilla buttermilk waffles ($15) made from batter so moist that these waffles cook up to resemble nothing more than Clinton Street's own pancakes ($10). There is some crunch toward the edges, but for the most part, these waffles are as light as a Ferran Adrià-inspired vanilla-infused air. But there is substance on the plate as well- the waffles are topped with a dreamy, thick lemon honey yogurt and dotted with strawberries, blackberries and sprinkled with crunchy crumbles of housemade granola. Adding to the decadence is a small dish of warm maple butter that is more maple syrup than butter, with a rich overtone of almost-burnt caramel. A forkful of waffle, fruit, yogurt and caramel syrup might make this seem like more dessert than breakfast, but for those who managed to make it here despite the rain, sweet waffles are a just reward. My eggs benedict ($13) was another decadent layering of favorites. Taken from the top: a creamy, properly thickened hollandaise, poached eggs (about 30 seconds overdone, a rare disappointment), thick triangles of ham steak grilled to steaming, and a warm homemade buttermilk biscuit, a Clinton Street specialty. Here, the restaurant's innovation comes through via the biscuits, which are not only superior at sopping up juices from the eggs and the hollandaise than any English muffin could be, they are also missing the yeasty tang of the more traditional bread base, and as a result, it is possible to taste the cayenne and acid in the hollandaise sauce. There is much more to Clinton Street's menu that is worth mention, including their famous, award-winning pancakes, over which we caught a neighboring table purring, 'these are far better than Sarabeths,' a claim we won't dispute. There is also a Spanish scramble, a brioche french toast, a smoked salmon version of the eggs benedict, and a wild mushroom frittata, each of which grabbed innocent bystanders by the nostrils and turned heads as the plates landed on the pass-through. Ding! Clinton Street's servers take the restaurant's popularity in stride and somehow remain unfailingly helpful and polite. On our visit this weekend, they were happy to answer our questions about the menu and more importantly: to let each table take its time eating, regardless of the heaving mass of humanity at the door, waiting to get in. To avoid becoming one of just such a crowd, we recommend that you get there early-at 10 a.m. or earlier on weekends, or better yet, during the week. Clinton Street serves from its brunch menu seven days a week, not just on Saturdays and Sundays. This is useful data for those three-day weekends or holidays when nobody else seems to be serving brunch. And if the weather continues to be this wet and dreary, pancakes and frittatas might just be the kind of mid-week motivation we'll need to get us out of the house and onto our ark. Clinton Street Baking Company, 4 Clinton Street, between Houston and Stanton Streets, 646-602-6263.

Otto, A User's Manual

***CONTENT
 Otto may just be New York's most populist restaurant: on a given night, you'll see a crowd composed of oenophiles, gastronomes, families with children, young couples, groups of NYU students, and of course, bridge-and-tunnelers. If it is true that every person in New York City eventually ends up at the arch in Washington Square Park, then Otto is where they go afterwards when they're feeling peckish. Some of the restaurant's allure derives from the fact that the inexpensive menu allows patrons to taste a bit of co-owner Mario Batali's cooking without taking out an emergency bank loan, but this is not the only reason why Otto has developed such a loyal following. The restaurant's impressively huge, all-Italian wine list draws quite a crowd on its own, just as you might expect from any enoteca where Joe Bastianich holds a stake. As admirable as it is that the restaurant is so democratic and welcoming to Gotham's everyman and everywoman, Otto is not without its problems. Foremost among these is the bad rap it has garnered in some quarters for snarly, inconsiderate, and often physically painful service at the hands of aggressive busboys. Then there is the noise, an awkward admixture of MOR pop songs and the din of the vast, often overcrowded dining room. Yet despite these admittedly bothersome issues, it is possible-even simple-to engineer a visit to Otto that emphasizes its considerable assets. To that end, we have compiled a five-step guide to help you ensure that your Otto experience is a good one: 1. Ask for Lourdes. No joke-in a restaurant whose reputation has been sullied by reports of indifferent service and brutal injury by overzealous and clumsy busboys, your most important move may well be to get yourself seated in the right section. And at Otto, that section belongs to Lourdes. She is omnicompetent, knowing every dish on the menu, every special, and miraculously, nearly every one of the several hundred wines on Otto's list. Lourdes is also the only person-floor managers included- we have ever seen reprimand the busboys when they are too rough with customers. If ever there were a person whose obvious skills and intelligence made a difference to a meal, it is her. Note to Batali, Bastianich, and Ladner: Promote the woman, already. 2. Drink as you wait for a table. Face facts before you walk in the door: You will wait for a table, and quite possibly for more than 30-45 minutes. So relax, grab a copy of the wine list and order a bottle. There are drinkable, affordable choices here-our picks are the $30 Giuseppe Cortese '04 Dolcetto D'Alba and the $33 Curbastro '04 Curtefranca-as well as several selections that will run you more than $200. And of course, if you have wisely asked to be seated in Lourdes's section, you may wait a bit longer, so keep sipping. 3. Order salads. Counterintuitive as it may seem, the green stuff is fine at Otto. We adore the crisp fennel & tangerine salad, but our favorite of the $8 insalata is the escarole & sunchoke salad (pictured above), a plate of Jerusalem artichokes, hearty green escarole, and a perfectly contrasting sprinkle of crushed, salted peanuts. 4. Don't be afraid to order either kind of pizza. Yes, we know that the whole point of Otto is to showcase Mario Batali's brainchild, the atom-thin, griddle-cooked Pizza Otto, but the traditional pies are pretty great here, as well. We love the fennel & bottarga ($14) and funghi & tallegio (pictured above, $12) among the Otto-style pies, as well as the classic Romana ($10) and the butternut squash-topped quattro stagioni ($14). Our experiences haven't been as good with the vongole Pizza Otto ($14), which we have found comes out soggy every once in a while. 5. Get the famous gelato, but skip the pizzelle. Otto does have a signature dish, but those unique Pizzas Otto are not it. Instead, it is the olive oil gelato that has become the symbol of Otto's success, and it only takes a bite of the stuff to see why: the olive oil flavors come through as hints of sweet, green stone fruit, more like greengage than cerignola. And the other flavors are pretty fantastic as well, especially the bourbon butterscotch, hazelnut stracciatella, and the zabaglione. As for the pizzelle, they are unpleasantly eggy-on some visits we have found them to taste more like an all-yolk omelette than a cookie-and so we have learned to just treat them as garnish and leave them behind. Sad, really. But if you're desperate for something baked to munch with your gelato, the sweet brioche-based ice cream sandwich will do just fine, and at $3.50, it delivers the biggest bang for the buck on the menu. We wish we had some advice on how to avoid the crowds at Otto, but in truth, the restaurant is always absolutely heaving with people every single day, from the minute it opens just before noon until it stops serving customers at midnight. But don't dismiss the charms of the crowd-Otto's waiting area is the perfect place to have a glass of wine while playing witness to an evolving display of a pitch perfect cross-section of the metropolitan population. Hey, they've got your city right here. Otto, 1 Fifth Avenue (at Eighth Street), 212-995-9559.

Agreed -- Lourdes is great. My other tip (considering I use the place as my living room) -- dine at the bar. Much better, all around. And next time you're there, drop me a line, I'll come meet you!

Actually there is no need to wait anymore if you don't want to - in the last year or so, Otto started taking reservations! Just call ahead. If you have to wait at the bar, get the cauliflower and the Alfonzo olives - delish. And the Romana pizza is the perfect starting point for anyone reconsidering the taste of anchovies. It becomes quite addictive. Agreed on the salads - do not skip. Glad that someone else out there is pro-Otto. I think it's underrated. It's my local go-to place - I lurve it.

Régate, an Island Within an Island

***CONTENT
 If you look at a map of France's western coastline, it is easy to miss the little speck that is the Ile de Ré, an island that geographically resembles a mirror image of Crete, only in miniature. Until 1987, when the island was finally connected to the mainland city of La Rochelle, there were plenty of French people who had also never heard of the place, but that has changed dramatically in the past two decades. Today, Ré is one of the most popular vacation spots for Parisian tourists-the island's population swells by a factor of ten in the summer months, with nearly all of the influx originating from within the country. Slowly, local rétais recipes and culinary techniques have trickled back across the new bridge, eventually making their way to the arrondisements of Paris, and from there, inevitably, across the ocean to New York. It is therefore fitting that the ambassadors of rétais cuisine in NYC should be part of a blended family that comprises two Parisians (Marc Jehan, the chef; and his brother, Jocelyn Jehan, the restaurant's front-of-house specialist) and the chef's Rétaise wife. Together they have put together a menu that playfully reinterprets traditional cuisine from the Island of Ré, with its strong focus on fresh seafood caught in the Bay of Biscay or in the Atlantic Ocean, while also adding a few quirky mainland inflections, as well as a few items that would not be out of place on a coastal Basque menu. And somehow, it all works. On a visit to Régate late this past week, HungryMan and I decided to choose an ecumenical selection of dishes off the menu, starting with the endive and roquefort cheese salad ($8.95), a well-composed, lightly dressed plate of bitter white leaves, pungent crumbled cheese, and crunchy walnuts. I especially admired the balance of flavors in this salad, especially the contrast between the creaminess of the roquefort and the bite of the endive. We also ordered an appetizer of the sautéed sweetbreads with red onion confit ($11.95), which were ultra-rich, and yet still palatable, thanks to the sweetness and tangy lilt of the red onion sauce. We would have both preferred to see a bit more frisée than escarole on the plate, as that green's bitterness would have lent a lovely contrast to the sweetbreads, but quite honestly, there was very little to complain about with this tender, heady starter. Nor was there much to grumble about with our mains-HungryMan opted for the mouclade de la couarde ($18.95), a steaming hot bowl of mussels cooked in a brilliant yellow saffron cream broth that is perhaps the most traditional Ile de Ré dish on the restaurant's menu. The mussels were soft and gorgeous, taking on quite a bit of the ochre tone of the broth, and really, this is no surprise given the sheer quantity of saffron in the cooking liquid. It was not overwhelming, but unless you are a person who can say with absolute conviction that you adore saffron, you might want to investigate other options. No joke-the mouclade takes the saffron volume and cranks it up to 10-a bold gesture that quite possibly would only work well with the briniest seafood. My own main, the bourride rétaise a la lotte ($19.95) a rustic stew of poached monkfish with shrimp, mussels, potatoes and leeks, was nowhere near as strongly seasoned, and thankfully so. What I tasted more than anything else was the pure essence of the seafood-from the head-on shrimp that practically sent off sparks of iodine and salinity, to the seared medallion of flaky monkfish flesh that we suspect was sprinkled generously with iodine-rich authentic grey salt from Ré. With our eyes closed, we might almost have imagined ourselves a few thousand miles to the east. Gustatory illusions here are amplified by Régate's décor: the interior looks quite a bit like a beach cabana with painted wood paneling, a sea foam color palette, and paintings of dune-strewn landscapes. This mirage holds up remarkably well...as long as the television over the bar is turned off. As we sat sipping a few glasses of luscious white Pineau des Charentes, a cognac-fortified wine from the area around Ré, chef Marc Jehan came to our table to talk with us a bit about Régate and his ambitious plans for the future. To Jehan, Régate is the first ship of a future armada (or regatta, if you want to hew close to the restaurant's playful naming) of regional French restaurants due to land in New York over the next several years, all featuring high-quality seafood and all bearing the circle-R logo on the current location's awning. With a little tactical planning and a few strategic tweaks here and there (ditching the cheap-looking typeface on the restaurant's signage and menus being the first alteration on that list), Jehan and his team might well pull it off. For now, the restaurant remains a mostly undiscovered little jewel on the border of the LES, much like the Ile de Ré itself-and if you want to experience it before the rest of Gotham makes it their own, go now, before the bridge is built. Régate, 198 Orchard Street (at Houston Street), 212-228-8555.

 Just when we thought we had settled down permanently into a coffee common-law marriage with Gorilla Coffee's Blendimentosis ($11.95 per pound at Whole Foods), along comes a new Fairway product to tempt us away. Now, we have always been fans of Fairway's in-house roasts, especially their Life Begins at 40 and FDNY blends, but for sheer balance and versatility, Gorilla had them both beat. Still, it's hard to walk past aromatic barrels of Fairway's new small-batch roasting blends and not be seduced just a bit...even harder when gorgeous, oily dark roasts like our favorite, the Café de Santo Domingo, are $6.99 per pound. This blend produces a full-bodied espresso that is at once vaguely smoky and pleasantly acidic. And oh, the crema! So while we won't say that we have completely ended our relationship with Blendimentosis, we do have to confess to being in the very best part of a honeymoon period with our new favorite Dominican blend-completely loved up on what just might be the best coffee bargain in the city.

I've been completely converted to drinking Brownstone Beans coffee, even though I was an avid Oren's devotee. After having this coffee which is roasted right in Brooklyn only a few days before it's sold, any of the stuff that sits in the bins can't compare. I often wonder at Fairway if they move enough beans for their coffee to be sold within the two week freshness period.

Hi Maura, You can alway do what we do and just ask when the coffee was roasted. They often have the information on a sheet that comes with the bin bags, so it's pretty easy to tell.

Never Mind the Red Sauce, Here's Mario's Trattoria

 If a restaurant opens somewhere between 34th Street and 42nd Street and precisely nobody notices, does it merit a visit? We asked ourselves this very question when Mario's Trattoria took over an empty restaurant space directly across Ninth Avenue from Market Café this past December, and we watched and waited to see if the new red-sauce joint would find some way of establishing itself as unique among its neighbors. And that's no easy feat on a stretch of Ninth Ave. a short block away from where constantly-warring Italian stalwarts Manganaro's and Manganaro's Hero Boy reside. Friends of ours who passed Mario's on their way to work told us that they never would have noticed it, had we not asked about it. So the signs were not at all promising from the very start. And then we ate our first meal there with MiniNosh and HungryMom, only to be underwhelmed by just about everything in the place. Our antipasto platter ($8.95) was a pyramidal compost heap of canned olives, canned artichoke hearts, canned beans, and cold cuts that tasted suspiciously more like Spam than anything else. The biggest shocker was that the tomatoes on the plate were hard, yellowed, and flavorless; we would have rather had no tomatoes than these mangy specimens. Our other appetizers, the pasta fagioli soup ($5.50) and the arugula salad ($7.95) were not much better-the soup was pasty and underseasoned, while the arugula salad was not only overdressed but garnished with slices of jalapenos and black olives that very obviously came from a can-not the sort of ingredients an eight dollar appetizer salad ought to contain. Main dishes were just barely mediocre-the spaghetti with meatballs (pictured top, $9.95) MiniNosh ordered was overcoooked, and even keeping the meatballs on the side didn't reduce the greasiness of the sauce. HungryMan's eggplant parmigiana ($9.95) was nearly decent, but it suffered from the same surfeit of grease that plagued both the spaghetti and HungryMom's chewy chicken parmigiana ($11.95). And then, just when we were all ready to pack up our things and leave forever, a surprise: the pizza. My Pizza Mia Bella ($10.95), a Neopolitan favorite with artichokes, mushrooms, lots of basil, and a raw egg in the center that cooks with the pizza, was...stellar, defying all expectations. We all ate a slice or two, admired the light and toasty, echt Napoli-style crust, and came to the inevitable conclusion that it was the best pizza we had ordered in Hell's Kitchen. Since that first meal last month, we have put Mario's pizzas to the test, ordering ten of the fifteen varieties on the menu over the course of the past several weeks. Our favorites are the Pizza Fresca ($10.95)-a version of the classic margherita, but made with fresh mozzarella cheese-and the and the mushroom pizza ($7.00), which contrary to the apparent logic of Mario's kitchen, is made with fresh mushrooms, not canned. Our hunch is that the best ingredients in the restaurant are held in reserve for the pizza maker. But we're not complaining, as we have come to a quiet peace with Mario's by ignoring 80% of its menu and treating the place as nothing more than our local pizzeria. This pony may only know one trick, but it's a brilliant one. Mario's Trattoria, 493 Ninth Avenue (between 37th and 38th Streets), 212-239-3394.

Funny review. I'm a New Yorker living in Barcelona, Spain for the last 2 years. Your review reminds me of one of my favorite \"restaurants\" that we treat as a pizzaria. We only order the pizza margharita- it's baked in a Neopolitan style woodburning oven and puts most NYC pizza to shame. We avoid the toppings because they're invariably of low quality and the pasta, salad, etc. are absolute garbage.

At The European Union (E.U.), a Grand Tour

 A friend once described for me his ‘can't miss’ idea for the Bar Mitzvah party to top all other Bar Mitzvah parties: an international theme where each table of guests represents a different country. Not only would the food served at each table represent the cuisine of the country, its flag would be used as a tablecloth, replicas of national monuments would serve as centerpieces (Big Ben, Eiffel Tower, Leaning Tower, etc.), and guests would be expected to dress up to fit in with their table's theme. The piece de resistance? Instead of a candlelighting ceremony, each table would send representatives to a mini-Olympics, where they would compete in an egg-toss, three-legged race and a breakdancing competition (this was the 80's, after all). Winners would receive medals embossed with the winning phrase 'Gelt medalist at Benjamin's Bar-Mitzvolympics.' This idea, my friend proudly announced, was just like transforming Disney's Epcot Center into a coming-of-age ceremony for a young boy. Luckily for everyone involved, the Bar Mitzvah in question never happened. Twenty years later, when I first set eyes on The E.U.'s multilingual, butcher paper menu, I couldn't help but think that finally, someone took my friend's idea and turned it into something worthwhile. Open since late last year, The E.U. offers diners choices from across the (European) continent, with a strong emphasis on French and Italian specialties. There's a foie gras terrine listed next to a selection of mostly Italian charcuterie, a baked rigatoni dish mentioned in the same breath as a very British pot pie with puff pastry, as well as a nod or two in the direction of of Germany and Austria, including a $13 homemade pretzel served hot with bauernwurst and sauerkraut. But there are some surprising omissions-strangely, there less here from Spain than might be anticipated, especially given that country's recent increase in local culinary popularity. For that matter, neither is there any of Portugal's wonderful cheese, nor a single one of its standout fish dishes, nor much of anything Scandinavian or Greek...and forget about new EU entrants like the Czech Republic or Poland. This is more what the E.U. would have been, circa 1959. But that's not a bad thing necessarily; menus cannot be unlimited in their scope. Despite a bit of head scratching over the menu's national biases, we found some big flavors and real winners at E.U. . One good example was the escarole and treviso (radicchio) salad (pictured top, $10) I ordered as my starter, delightfully crunchy and fresh, and served on a flat butcher's block instead of a plate. The treviso is a milder, less-bitter type of radicchio, and this pairs better with the hardy escarole, blue cheese and crunchy apple slices than the more common chioggia radiccio would. Our sole quibble was that the salad was a bit overdressed with its tart balsamic emulsion. Also excellent was Nosher's cuttlefish orzo dish (pictured above, $11), an inky black stew of tender fish and, instead of rice, handfuls of slivery orzo pasta slow cooked in a rich broth to resemble a risotto. One very clever touch-lemon zest on top of the pasta- not only added color contrast, but added a much-needed floral and lightly acidic bite to the dish that kept the cuttlefish ink from becoming too strong and musky. My favorite cultural combo came in the form of a sumptuous bowl chicken and dumplings ($21) that blended Austrian and Italian themes into a seamless creole. It's not at all clear from the menu, but this is chicken soup deconstructed into its essential parts. Tender slices of pan-fried breast meat lay in a half-inch of heady, savory broth at the bottom of the dish, each piece of poultry positioned with its crust of glistening skin reflecting the lights above the table. And while the chicken might have been inspired by Central Europe, its accompaniment was pure Italian: half a dozen doughnut hole-sized malfatti dumplings held together with ricotta and chard. At once light, creamy, gooey and a little bit sweet, these dumplings-essentially Venetian gnudi-were the highlight of the dish and reflected a refined hominess that the restaurant's rough beams and pocket doors seems to be channeling. Nosher's main course took him to France via a baked monkfish and piperade ($22), a dish that benefited greatly from the surprise appearance of several fat mussels on the plate. This was, as our server told us, the perfect dish to eat while sipping a glass of the restaurant's very cold, very dry Vermentino ($8). The dessert menu, while short, remains multi-regional with few surprises: there's a sticky toffee pudding that could have walked out of British central casting, and a paper-lined enamel pot of straight-out-of-the-oil French beignets. Slightly heavier and more doughy that the beignets at The Modern, these brought back lovely memories of Elephant Ears that you might buy from a carnival vendor-if only state fairs offered the E.U.'s choice of chocolate sauce or thickened condensed milk caramel to dip them in. The vibe at E.U. is exceptionally cozy and casual, more English gastropub than French brasserie or Italian trattoria. Reclaimed wood lines the ceiling and industrial fittings on the brick walls and in the bathrooms prod you into believing that you're in a neighborhood restaurant somewhere in Europe. This appealing conceit is strengthened further by the fact that the staff genuinely pays attention to everything that goes on in the restaurant. We found this out when, after being told sotto voce by two servers that 'Things are a little crazy in here-the New York Times critic is here again,' we were nonetheless approached by E.U.'s very genial general manager, Anthony, when he spotted us (discreetly) snapping a photo of the aforementioned beignets. We were duly impressed. When Frank Bruni is sitting in the dining room a few tables away, we hardly expect restaurant staff to pull themselves away from the attention vortex his presence inevitably creates. Yet there was the GM, chatting happily and confidently to us about the farms where the restaurant sources its ricotta. This, more than anything, tells us just how misguided the local community board was last year when it waged an epic battle with The E.U. over its liquor permits. The restaurant famously ran into trouble before it even opened last year when, despite a good record with licenses at their other restaurants in the city, owners Jason Hennings and Bob Giraldi (of Jean-Georges, Vong and Mercer Kitchen) could not convince neighbors that they had no intention of plying binge drinkers with beer and wine into the wee hours. Yet given the staff's ability to multiask even in the most stressful of situations, The E.U. actually seems to be the NYC restaurant least likely to let loose a flood of drunks into the East Village. With its hard-earned license, The E.U. has modeled itself after some of the best gastropubs in Europe. Its wine list is well-edited, if pricey: bottles average in the mid $40's, but wines by the glass are a much better deal at $7-10. There are also a few smaller E.U. countries represented on the wine and beer lists (i.e. the Czech Republic and Belgium) that round out the European theme, yet always because the product is genuinely superb, not just to add another country to the gustatory roster. It is easy to see why Giraldi and Hennings fought so hard, because ultimately, the wine and beer menus square the thematic circle and make The E.U. more well-conceived resto-bar than precious bar mitzvah. The European Union, 235 East 4th Street, near Avenue B, 212-254-2900.

 Go to bed before 5:00 in the morning and you miss a backstage New York City, one that operates in plain view, but one that nevertheless remains utterly invisible to most Gothamites. Two weeks ago, we stayed up all night with the graveyard shift bakers at Amy's Bread, the ones responsible for most of the artisanal bread sold at Amy's shops. Along the way, we learned some fascinating things about Amy's Bread (it does most of its business to restaurants, not retail), breadmaking (overproofing French white bread dough can yield Italian white bread, if done right), and the people who work the overnight shift (they listen to a truly bizarre mix of music as they work: Rammstein and Barbra Streisand, to name a few). Musical taste aside, they are also some of the most generous and gracious people we have had the good fortune to meet in the food world. During our all-nighter with the Amy's crew, we recorded more than five hours of audio, which we have managed to edit down to a trim 47 minutes, and as with all of our podcasts, you have the option either to download the audio file (just right-click that link to save the file to disk) to listen on your mp3 device, or , if you have a speedy Internet connection, you can stream the podcast by clicking the ‘play’ button on the audio player below. Edited to note that the corrupted file has been replaced, so if you downloaded the podcast prior to Wednesday night, you may want to download again. This time, we not only have an Amy's Bread photoset on Flickr, but we have three YouTube videos (posted here yesterday). So have a look at both as you listen to the podcast. We are also holding a contest with a fantastic food-related (non-perishable) prize to the first person who e-mails us the correct answer to this question: What third-party shop sells more Amy's Bread baguettes than all three of Amy's own retail stores combined? Send answers to nycnosh at gmail- we'll post the answer next week. In the meantime, grab some carbs and have a listen!

 Waffles may not possess an inherent seasonality, but I always associate them with springtime. One of my best New York memories is of sitting outside on the thirtieth-floor terrace of a friend's apartment, eating a crisp, fresh waffle straight from the iron as we listened to the Easter parade pass by below and talked about our plans to stay in touch by the then-novel medium of e-mail. When this friend and I saw each other again in 2005, he commented to me that he has never forgotten that breakfast, although he seems to think we watched the St. Patrick's Day parade. No matter. We are both very much in agreement on the most salient detail: the waffles we ate then were both spectacular and serendipitous, because until the morning of the parade, he didn't own a waffle iron. Just a few hours before, as he buzzed me in to the lobby of his building, I spotted a copier box marked, \"FREE! Take Me! Take Me!\" next to the elevator. Inside the box sat a dusty chrome waffle iron that, judging by the heft and girth of its power cord, was older than I was. On a whim, I grabbed it and brought it upstairs with me, very warily plugged the old clunker in, and after a quick phone call to a friend who worked at the Waffle House in North Carolina, we were ready to cook. The recipe here is one that takes quick waffle batter (i.e. not leavened with yeast) and adds a bit of tactical crunch in the form of coarsely ground cornmeal. I have seen recipes that use equal parts coarse cornmeal and flour, but those waffles are aggressively crunchy and sometimes end up making me feel as if I am eating an asphalt roof shingle. I much prefer the gentle graininess of a blend of grinds. I serve these waffles with salted butter and some sort of fruit compote. In the photos, I used a simple strawberry compote that contains 12 ounces of fresh chopped strawberries, 1/2 cup sugar, the juice of a lime, and a bit of lime zest, all brought to a boil and then simmered until thick. Easy. Now that the first strawberries of the California growing season are finally coming in to shops, there are once again decent berries to be had on the cheap. But really, the strawberries are incidental-these waffles are just as delicious if they are drizzled with maple syrup or even topped with a scoop of good vanilla ice cream. And even if you can't eat them outside, just open the window-that's all the springtime you need to justify pulling out the waffle iron. Double Cornmeal Waffles 1/2 cup finely ground cornmeal 1/2 cup coarsely ground cornmeal or polenta 1 cup all-purpose flour 4 teaspoons (1 Tbsp. + 1 tsp.) baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt zest of a lemon 1 1/2 cups milk 4-5 Tablespoons salted butter, melted and cooled 2 eggs, beaten well Preheat a waffle iron. Whisk together all dry ingredients very thoroughly. Add milk, eggs, vanilla, and melted butter and whisk together until smooth. The batter will be thin at this point, which is precisely as it should be. Let the batter stand for 10-15 minutes before you use it (either at room temperature or in the fridge). Gently stir before pouring batter into the hot waffle iron and cooking for 3-5 minutes. Serve waffles immediately. If you cannot, you can keep waffles warm by placing them in a single layer on the rack of a warm oven. Leftover waffles also freeze beautifully-just stick a square of wax paper between each to keep them separated. Serves 4. 2007 nycnosh.com

Yeasted Waffles (adapted from Cake Bible) Proof 1 package yeast in 1/2 cup warm water and 2 T. sugar in a bowl. In a bowl mix: 2 C flour 1/2 t salt Add to yeast: 1 stick melted butter (or 1/2 C oil) 2 C Warm milk (may be 1% milk) Add flour mixture to yeast/milk and mix to smooth but don't over mix. This makes a thin batter. I prefer it a little thicker and add up to 1/2 or 3/4 C more flour. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and leave on counter until morning. Then add: 2 eggs 1/2 t baking soda (baking soda *NOT* baking powder) Mix briefly and cook in waffle iron. This recipe can be doubled or tripled but do not increase the amount of yeast.

Hi Jeffrey, The recipe you've included in your comment is not dissimilar to Mark Bittman's very fine version (in How To Cook Everything), one we've used to great success at more than a few brunches. As much as we like a good yeast-leavened waffle, sometimes you just don't have the time to wait several hours, so we like to make baking powder/soda waffles in those situations-they take about 5 or 10 minutes to throw together, after all. Also, yeast leavening doesn't play terribly well with cornmeal in batters that aren't worked or kneaded, so in this situation, the baking powder is more a necessity than a convenience.

Sushi Jun: Is It Bigger than a Breadbox?

 When we began writing about food in New York, we vowed never to withhold nosh-related finds, even if that meant watching a favorite ingredient disappear from the shelves, or a beloved restaurant turn into a hot spot. Sharing is what this whole endeavor is all about, right? So we thought until this winter, when we discovered a tiny restaurant that we seriously considered holding in reserve as our little secret-a place we might keep to ourselves and never even share with our best friends. Yes, I am a little bit ashamed to admit that we came very close to holding out on you, but given the circumstances, I think you'll understand our temporary selfishness and give us a pass, just this once. The restaurant in question is Sushi Jun, a lilliputian dining space on the northeast corner of the Worldwide Plaza complex. It is so tiny, in fact, that if you walk by and aren't looking for it, you stand an excellent chance of missing its one window and single, barely-labeled door. Inside are three-no, that's not a misprint-tables: a four-top and a pair of two/three-tops, along with a sushi bar that seats about six or eight more people. This is the new definition of cozy, one that makes nearby Nook look as capacious as a school cafeteria by comparison. Yet amazingly, the place does not feel cramped at all from the inside, especially since those two thick wooden tables are pushed well apart from one another, and unlike at several much larger Mahattan restaurants (Frank, for example), servers never bump and jostle diners as they deliver and clear plates. The atmosphere is, on the contrary, tranquil, even placid: a perfect environment to showcase the great passion and precision of Sushi Jun's head chef, Shigehiro Nagasawa, whose handiwork we witnessed first-hand on a visit last Thursday. We started with two of the evening's special appetizers. One, the matsumae zuke (mislabled on the menu as 'matsumake',$8), was a very pleasingly chewy salad of julienned pickled seaweed, squid, and mushrooms that was remarkable in its ability to bring earthy flavors and an almost slimy moistness together in a pitch-perfect fashion, somehow managing to be refreshing and hearty at once. Our other special appetizer was the pan roasted duck in wasabi sauce (pictured above, $7), an array of six thinly sliced medallions of rare, seared duck meat drizzled with a light and peppery wasabi sauce. The horseradish kick from the sauce offered a lovely flavor balance to the richness of the duck-a meat that can really fatigue the palate if it is not seasoned with real skill, as it was here. Then it was on to the sushi. Both HungryMan and I prefer nigiri, the hand-formed oblong sushi, as opposed to nori-wrapped rolls. Nothing against nori, but especially when we know a restaurant is good, we like to concentrate on the pure flavors and textures of the fish, without seaweed adding its vegetal complexity to the equation. Perhaps the highest compliment we can pay the restaurant is, therefore, to say that when we are at Sushi Jun, we order nothing but nigiri. Our favorites are the yellowtail ($3.50), the spotted sardine ($3.50), the sweet shrimp ($3.00) and the unagi (roasted eel, $3.50)-all pictured from front to back here. I have really grown to love the oily, piscine tang of the spotted sardine, especially when it is eaten plain, without any more wasabi than what sits between the fillet and the mound of rice beneath it. However, my favorite fish at Sushi Jun is the yellowtail, which is incomparably fresh, soft, and almost buttery-it is easily the very best yellowtail I have ever eaten anywhere. Thus it should come as no surprise that during our most recent meal at Sushi Jun, we ordered several pieces of the yellowtail nigiri, as well as a generous slice of the special toro ($7 on the day we visited, although this varies with availability), and a fresh raw oyster sushi ($3.50). The toro is always lush and velvety, with just enough of a hint of sinew to remind you that you are eating something that was recently-extremely recently, in Sushi Jun's case- alive and swimming. Impressively, the restaurant also lists the day's toro price on its specials board; we do not know if this is a nod to sensible governance and full transparency, but regardless, it is exactly what we like to see. We have also been impressed with the quality and light, minerally flavor of the fresh oyster sushi at Sushi Jun, not to mention its gorgeous, half-shell presentation. Superb sushi aside, there are several other menu items worth ordering at Sushi Jun. Among these are the vegetarian namasu ($6), a lightly vinagered salad of daikon, carrot, and orange zest, and the kinpila goboh (aka kinpira gobo, $6), a simmered burdock, soy, sake, and sesame seed dish with a crunchy texture and a savory, nutty flavor-a cornerstone of homestyle Japanese cooking. We love nibbling at an order of the kinpira gobo while we choose our sushi and sip a glass of sake-and when markups on bottles of sake are as low as an unheard of 1.3 times retail, we have a hard time avoiding ordering at least one. Our favorite on the menu is the Shirakabe Gura special junmai semi-dry sake-a steal at $14 for a 300 ml. bottle. We like it best chilled, but the restaurant will also heat it for you or leave it at room temperature, if you prefer. Soon enough though, we may only be able to reminisce about our sake-drinking, matsutake-munching experiences at Sushi Jun, because as Gothamites discover it-and they will, with our without our help-they are likely to be as completely won over by its superior sushi and excellent prices as we have been. And when that happens, we'll be the ones peeking through the miniature picture window, hoping against hope that our favorite little two-top is free. Sushi Jun, 302 West 50th Street (near Eighth Avenue), 212-315-4800.

Had a great meal there last week, thanks for the post. They take reservations, which ended up being unnecessary but was nice just in case. I really recommend the mushrooms and beef and tofu appetizer (which tastes a lot like french onion soup, actually, so if that's a turn-off then you're forewarned), though I'd split it because it's pretty heavy. The sushi was great, too.

Greetings! This Robert-Gilles Martineau. First of all, great pictures! As for your opinion of seweed/nori, I would tend to agree with you after all these years I lived in Japan. I ask whenever possible the sushu chefs to avoid making \"gunkan\" with nori. I have seen some chefs use strips of cucumber or daikon instead. Do not get me wrong, I love nori but sometimes it just interefere with the taste of fish. Looking forward to visiting you again! Cheers, Robert-Gilles

The Origin of Cream-filled Species: Twinkie, Deconstructed

***CONTENT
 Forget everything you know about the history of molecular gastronomy. Put Ferran Adria and Heston Blumenthal out of your mind and focus instead on another name that has never been associated with haute cuisine and Michelin stars: Hostess. The historic transformation of a little yellow cake from a snack whose shelf life could be measured in hours into an almost immortal dessert that practically never spoils is the real mythological beginning to the food-as-science movement. It all started after World War II, when, driven to find new ways to retain the freshness of its flagship product, the Hostess company embarked on a dismantling and reconstruction of the Twinkie. This fantastical, bionic journey is chronicled ingredient-by-ingredient in Steve Ettlinger's thorough and often charming Twinkie, Deconstructed. Ettlinger is an author who is best known for his encyclopedic guides to hardware stores and garden centers, and this experience has given him a great knack for systematizing-Twinkie's chapters are cleverly organized in order of ingredients in the snack cake, and he details the origins of each in turn, making a great effort to visit the places where each component is manufactured. While this approach is nothing if not completist, it does occasionally work against the rhythm and flow of the book's prose, which sometimes feels a bit too much like an eye-blurring 300-page shopping list. But always, the jarring dissonance of section headings-a discussion of wheat flour is followed immediately by a chapter on bleach, for example-is enough to keep you reading...and pondering the dietary status of something as quintessentially un-foodlike as a Twinkie. There is of course real educational value in placing special emphasis on the idea that many of a Twinkie's components are synthesized and mined, not harvested. But don't be fooled for an instant into thinking that Ettlinger is anything but a fan of the little snack and its \"emblematic quest for perfection in food\"-the point of this book is more to offer a field guide to every item on the ingredient list, rather than to adopt a more Michael Pollan-esque stance and take Hostess to task for its use of chemicals in baking. And really, it is hard to fault Ettlinger for not turning his light-hearted book into a journalistic exposé when you recall that his focal point is a pre-packaged dessert that no one is likely to mistake for a health food. In the final analysis, it is just as hard to damn the Twinkie as it is to praise it-as horrifying as the snack might be from a pure food perspective, its Methuselah-like shelf stability unarguably represents a great scientific accomplishment-one that in hindsight doesn't seem too far-removed from a Nitrogen-solidified gin and tonic or a styrofoam box of parmesan \"air\" served up at El Bulli.

Alfanoose: Beyond Falafel
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-03-14 04:01:00
***CONTENT
 Establishments serving Middle Eastern food in New York tend to be starkly divided into two categories: pricey and very cheap, with very little in between. At one end there are the ubiquitous street carts serving up steaming $5 plates of falafel and shawarma; at the other extreme are patrician Moroccan fantasies like Loft, with its $26 lamb loin, or the authentic (but outrageously-priced) Al Bustan, with its $23 shawarma and $7 hummus. But gastronomes looking for both inexpensive, tasty food and a seat can thank whatever higher power they choose that Alfanoose is still around, even after several recent dicey changes of venue that have seen it move nomadically throughout downtown Manhattan. Alfanoose means magic lantern or Aladdin's Lamp in Arabic, and it's an apt name-you almost do need a genie to guide you to the place, as my colleague Beanap and I discovered last week. While the restaurant is located on a busy stretch of Maiden Lane just west of Broadway, it has a very narrow frontage that is easy to miss. What's more, locals are often no help in guiding you there, as many still seem to think it occupies its original location on Fulton Street. Yet Alfanoose, ike a lot of businesses near the old World Trade Center, saw a substantial decline in foot traffic after 2001, and so the shop closed, eventually ending up in its current, better appointed location. And if lunchtime bustle is any indication, business is now booming. So booming, in fact, that there is often a good 10 or 15 minute wait for Alfanoose's cafeteria-style service on any given afternoon. Once inside though, the place is fantastic for people watching, as patrons make up a microcosm of today's Downtown: Wall Street titans lined up next to secretaries, locals and Middle Eastern expats, all biding their time to get a plate or two of food that is emphatically above average for the price. There are also a substantial number of Indians and Pakistanis here who, we're told, come to Alfanoose for the spicy dishes that echo the heat they use in their own cuisines. But it's best to know long before you order just how hot you want your food-Alfanoose is also the kind of place where diners are expected to know the ordering protocol, and with a long line of people behind you, dithering over your order is frowned upon. Luckily, there are paper takeout menus stacked near the door to help the ambivalent figure out what to order by the time they reach the front of the line. The menu is filled with variations on shawarma, falafel and kabobs, yet most customers seem to go for the falafel, which has long jockeyed for the much-contested crown of best falafel in Manhattan. As Alfanoose is quick to tell you at every turn, the freshness comes in part from the fact that the restaurant makes a policy of changing its oil more frequently than do other places, and this yields a lighter, less greasy, and therefore somewhat drier falafel. This also means that the dining room doesn't smell like the waiting room at a Jiffy Lube. But Alfanoose is much more than falafel-most meat dishes are prepared on a charcoal grill right in front of you, and as evidenced by our wait and the length of the long grill line, the cooks will not be rushed. This is a very good thing. All the meat for the kebabs and the shawarma are marinated in vinegar and a mix of secret spices: fantastic for fans of acidity (North Carolina barbecue shares a passing resemblance to shawarma), less so if you tend to avoid food with heat. In the case of the lamb shawarma (pictured top, $12) Beanap ordered, the hot sauce poured liberally on top of the meat was a distraction, drowning out the flavor of the lamb. My kafta kabob plate (pictured above, $12) was monumentally better: a tender brick of lamb and beef grilled over charcoal and covered with tangy tahini and hot sauce that tingled my tongue without overpowering my palate. Customers are offered the option to customize their plates- the women behind the counter don't take much persuading to go easy or heavy on the hot sauce and tahini. This dish, like the shawarma, is also available as a sandwich on pita bread for $7. Best of all here are the variety of side dishes offered. Alfanoose prepares three kinds of mojadara (mujadara), a side dish traditionally made with lentils, bulgar wheat and topped with caramelized onions. We chose the mojadara with wheat and tomatoes, a slightly sweet combination that played well with the marinated meats. Larger plates come with a choice of mojadara or simple salad, and a further choice of tabouli, excellent, tangy homemade hummus or Alfanoose's decidedly smoky baba ghanoush. Most dishes also come with pita bread, surprisingly lacking in flavor and springiness even though it is baked in house. Fair warning: portions are large. In the face of the sheer quantity of food for the money, it may seem perverse to save room for dessert, but at Alfanoose, sweets are not to be missed. In addition to the expected baklava - appropriately chewy and crisp - there are harder to find treats like date cookies, traditional Lebanese walnut-filled mamoul cookies, and muhallabieh (shown above, $5)- a sweet and creamy rice pudding that tastes a bit like what its American counterpart would be, if it were transported by magic carpet to the Middle East and anointed with orange blossom water and sprinkled with finely chopped pistachio nuts. It's those nuts and that orange blossom water that truly emphasize mastery of the more subtle flavors of Lebanon and Syria, and even taking into account their obsessive oil-changing policy, the desserts and side dishes show off Alfanoose's real strengths much better than a falafel ball ever could. Alfanoose, 8 Maiden Lane, between Broadway and Nassau Street. 212-528-4669.

Thank you, thank you, thank you for giving Alfanoose the attention it so deserves. I have been a customer since 2000 and try to direct any visitors to lower Manhattan to this treasure. The owner is a gem and works quite hard to give customers authentic, hand-crafted Middle Eastern food. He is extremely dedicated, working crazy hours, entrusting nobody but himself with the task of preparing the days goodies. Following September 11, he was either too proud, or not adequately informed, to avail himself of the recovery grant money available to Downtown businesses. Even when I offered to have the VP of my bank, who assisted me in obtaining federal and state relief funds to keep my own employees on the payroll, call him, he declined, choosing to close (thankfully, temporarily). During baseball season, he will prepare a wonderful assortment of dishes for me to bring to the Stadium.

Agree that the wait can be prohibitively long. Food is consistently very good, and \"homey\"-tasting. I would add that if you're not in the mood to wait too long for your food once you've already waited on line, order basic, popular dishes like the falafel. (As fresh as the falafel is, there's a high turnover on that and similar dishes, such that they've always got a few \"balls\" ready to go for you.) If you want to experiment with some of the more esoteric menu options, which is recommended, have lunch after 2 pm that day so that the total cumulative wait-time doesn't put you off.

I have tried Alfanoose twice. Found it very disappointing. Being a vegetarian and having seen a few rave reviews about this 'Best Falafel in Town', I naturally tried the 'Falafel veggie platter'. The only enjoyable part was the rice. I know comparing this to the food-carts is something not many would agree on, but I have tasted better falafel there. The second time around, ordered a Tabouli vegetarian sandwich. Ended up more disappointed than the first time. Not sure if it was a lack of taste-buds for this cuisine or wrong choice of dishes from the menu.

 Some snacks lure you with their ingredients, some with cultural references to faraway tropical destinations, and some, like the rapturously named 'Oh Yes' choco cake, do it with with unabashed hints at sexual delight. This is the dessert that ought to have finished off (so to speak) Meg Ryan's notorious cinematic lunch at Katz's Deli, the treat she asked for-begged for, even- by name. And if that name is any indication, these are the snacks that belong in a bedside table, hidden underneath a dog-eared Erica Jong paperback and a few spare batteries. But do they deliver on their implied promise of pleasure? In short, no. 'Oh Yes' cakes are made up of two layers of dry vanilla cake that sandwich a third layer of chocolate filling. This triple-decker square is then enrobed in a further layer of chocolate coating, which admittedly has a nice snap to it. But the crumbly, sandy texture of the cake itself is unappealing, and there is so little flavor in the cake that it is difficult to eat more than a bite of this snack. Everything about it tastes stale, even when the expiration date on the package is nearly a year away. Yet most disturbing of all is this mystery: Why do the ingredients, which otherwise seem typical for a packaged snack cake, list \"soybeans, wheat, milk and crab\"? Neither HungryMan nor I tasted any shellfish in the 'Oh Yes' cakes, so we're both hoping that is either a translation error or a typo. Yet even with the potential inclusion of crustacean components, Haitai's 'Oh Yes' cakes are phenomenally popular: they are among the biggest sellers in their category in Korea, Vietnam, and Russia. When we called Haitai's US distributors to inquire about the crab, they reassured us that there is probably a mistake on the English version of the label. We were also informed that the cakes are designed to be a little bit dry, since consumers often eat 'Oh Yes' dipped in coffee. This makes quite a bit more sense, but in all honesty, when I grabbed a cup of java to give 'Oh Yes' another try, I had a very hard time getting the image of a crab out of my head as I nibbled on my newly-moistened choco cake. Certainly, the snack was much improved when dipped in coffee, but seeing those little pincers in my mind's eye really killed the mood for me. What's Korean for \"Not tonight, I have a headache.\"? 'Oh Yes' choco cakes are available at Han Ah Rhem on 32nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, as well as at Asian and Eastern European grocery stores throughout New York City.

 Pick almost any neighborhood in Manhattan and imagine walking along an avenue, counting restaurants on your fingers as you proceed. How many blocks before you run out of digits? One? Two? With such high dining density on this little island, it is sometimes hard to imagine that there are neighborhoods in New York City where people still talk about the one good restaurant in the area. Kew Gardens is one of these neighborhoods. Sure, there are a few pizza restaurants and a diner or two, but when it comes to eateries with table service and wine, the locals all seem to have reached a spooky consensus that there is just one spot worthy of mention: Mood. So when fate (and a visit from Moose Ma) took us strolling through the neo-Tudor architecture in Kew Gardens a few weeks ago, we knew precisely where we'd end up for dinner. Mood is the brainchild of longtime resident Mo Ahmed, who with his partner Martin Forde, opened the restaurant in 2004 to immediate local acclaim. But because Kew Gardens is a bit of a trek for many Gothamites, it has gone mostly unnoticed. And that's a shame, because there is some inventive cooking going on in Mood's New American kitchen. Our favorite items included the escargot risotto starter ($9), a lush and earthy combination of textures and flavors that made us both wonder why it isn't more popular apart from here and at Geoffrey Zakarian's Town; and the seafood stew with chorizo (pictured top, $17), a special that blended Spanish and Italian flavors in a tangy rouille-it was so wonderful that it left us all wanting just a bit more of the sauce to sop up with our bread. Other dishes were good, if nothing special, such as the broccoli rabe ravioli with mozzarella ($13), an entrée that would have been fantastic, had the flavors of the broccoli rabe not been buried by an overdose of balsamic vinegar and too many sun-dried tomatoes. The salmon fillet with roasted baby beets ($17) was also decent, if a bit disjointed, lacking some crucial element to tie the whole dish together. On the other hand, we were all very pleased with Mood's homemade desserts. Our apple pie with vanilla ice cream ($6) was more like a tender bar cookie than a typical pie, and we all really loved how this small twist on a classic treat gave the dish a compact profile, one that lent itself very well to being forked up with a blob of the melting ice cream. The molten chocolate cake with cappuccino ice cream (seen in background below, $7) was competent and very rich-nothing groundbreaking, but still well executed. Desserts were such a highlight, in fact, that we have considered returning to Kew Gardens with an agenda: first a movie at the Kew Gardens Cinema-one of New York's few remaining art-house movie theaters and one of the only places where real butter is served on the cinema's popcorn-and then a sweet snack at Mood before heading back home on the E train. Admittedly, we are a little surprised that Mood's prices are more Manhattan than Queens, but overall, we are big fans of what Mo and Martin have done in Kew Gardens. It is especially nice to see that a restaurant that is overwhelmingly seen as the only game in town has managed to keep itself from getting too complacent. But there's still room for growth- we would love to see Mood push a bit harder to rectify its few missteps and turn itself into a real culinary destination. Other restaurants like Astoria's 718 have tried and failed to do just this, but Mood has all the fundamentals in place to lure a non-local clientele. The question is: Do they want it? Mood, 120-29 83rd Avenue (at Lefferts Boulevard), Kew Gardens (Queens), 718-849-MOOD.

residing in nearby Forest Hills, I've had the pleasure of dining at Mood a few times. Your comment about prices really struck a chord with me. It may be precisely because there is a lack of competition that prices are so Manhattan like in Queens. The restaurants on Austin St in Forest Hills, are often more pricey than most of my favorite spots in Manhattan. Our neighborhood has some pretty good spots too, if you ever find yourself wanting to destination dine in Queens again. Bann Thai (far better than Sripraphai imho- and I lived in Thailand many years and know my Thai)... Rouge (some passable choices, but the steamed mussels, and chocolate torte are divine. as are the wine pairings). 5 burros (great Mexican brunch)

Interesting theory there-the old 'we've got you over a barrel' concept. I suspect that Mood isn't trying to gouge anyone-in fact, I think their price points are pretty close to being justified. They just need a little more polish. A beefed-up wine list also wouldn't hurt, but we haven't seen many diners ordering bottles there, so that may be why the list hasn't become a priority.

This place had good food the one time my wife and I went. My theory on high prices in Queens restaurants, is that the mid-week volume is low and they have to realize more money per customer to cover overhead of being open all week. Anyway. regarding the post above about Bann Thai, I don't like it, and to compare it to Sriphapai is ridiculous. I have been eating at Sri for 10 years, I went to Bann Thai once at it was like Thai food you would get in Nebraska. I went back to give it a second chance and what they gave me resembled a cross between bad chinese and bad thai.

brgr: Don't Ask, Don't Tell

 There is a lot to love about Chris Russell's brgr: the serene $1 million nouveau chalet-style Rockwell Group interior, the commitment to sourcing most of its ingredients from small producers, and of course the fact that this stretch of Seventh Avenue has needed some decent nosh for more than a decade. The concept of the restaurant is a simple one to decipher: brgr offers a slow-food fast food experience similar to that of Danny Meyer's Shake Shack, except that here, there's plenty of seating. At the same time, the restaurant, which opened in December 2006, still has a few kinks to work out-some small, and some more serious. Unfortunately, one of the major problems is an impossible one to avoid: the service. At a corporate burger joint, it is hard to fault the staff for acting as if they don't want to be there, but in a restaurant where the cheapest sandwich costs $6.50 and most run north of $8.00, it really isn't asking too much to expect more than a grunted \"Customer. Next. Customer.\" from the counter attendants. Worse, the weekend staffers (to be fair, we have only visited on weekends) all seem to have perfected the exasperated sigh as punctuation to begrudging answers about pretty much any question a patron asks. On our most recent visit, we overheard one staffer let out a lungful of air, roll her eyes and announce, \"Nooooo. The beer is not organic. Any...other...questions?\" Unsurprisingly, there were none. We too got the full passive-aggressive experience when we asked one of the cooks about the seasoning used on the side dishes, only to be told, \"It's just stuff. Yellow stuff.\" But we pushed through the membrane of hostility a bit and got a somewhat more expert response when the head cook was called over. He told us that the mixture contained turmeric, oregano, salt, pepper, and \"secret brgr seasoning.\" Fair enough. We're all in favor of trade secrets, even if they are described unappetizingly the first time around. We asked about the seasoning mixture in part because it imparted such a lovely flavor to the sweet potato fries and the onion hay (both $2.50). Turmeric and secret ingredients aside, both dishes were fried perfectly and salted exactly right. HungryMan and I did prefer the sweet potato fries slightly over the crunchy onion hay, mostly because the soft, skin-on strips of sweet potato retained their heat longer and were steaming inside long after we started eating our meal. Another item we both enjoyed quite a bit was, to our great shock, the homemade veggie burger (pictured above, $6.50). Good enough on its own, it is elevated to something even an omnivore could love when it is paired with the crumbled roquefort (an extra $1.00) and a slice of the beefsteak tomato. In particular, the fresh, whole peas in the loose patty were an unexpected treat. The beef burgers, on the other hand, were not quite as good as the vegetarian options. Some of this has to do with brgr's default method for cooking its Montana Legend beef-if a customer does not specify how the burger should be cooked, it is done medium well, which sadly means that it ends up a bit too tough and a bit too chewy. Brgr is hardly alone in this practice; when HungryMan and I took a recent road trip and stopped for dinner at a Friendly's in the middle of nowhere, we encountered the same approach there. The thinking seems to be that it is better to avoid litigation by cooking the hell out of everything than to tempt fate by making an offer of a more palatable choice. But really, isn't brgr's target demographic a little more savvy than Friendly's? I'd wager that anyone willing to hand over a $10 bill for a burger probably would prefer to be asked how that patty should be cooked. That said, there are some creative burger options on the menu. Our favorites include the No. 4, with a fried egg and grilled onions ($7.75), and the No. 10 turkey burger, with bacon and goat cheese ($9.00). The No. 2, with gruyere, avocado, and herb mayonnaise was a bit too unctuous and needed something acidic to break up its intensely fatty mouth-feel, and for $8.50, we really thought the sandwich ought to come complete with everything it needs. We'd love to see a few bun options on the menu, as the whole and whole grain buns brgr serves now are merely adequate. But then again, more choices on the menu means more conversation with the counter staff, and until the crankiness disappears, we wouldn't wish that on anyone, even for an extra shake of the \"yellow stuff.\" brgr, 287 Seventh Avenue (at 26th Street), 212-488-7500.

I've been to BRGR more times than I care to admit since it's around the corner from our office. I usually get the #1, medium rare or if I'm at my weekly burger intake limit, the veggie burger (it really is that good!). On weekdays I've found the service to be at least satisfactory, especially considering hectic it can get there at lunchtime. The one time I was in on a weekend for dinner, the difference in the level of service was noticeable to say the least, and comparable to what you've described.

Nice review. Also check out Stand, it's bit more money, but in my opinion worth it if you're looking for a great burger (try the classic,) great fries (skip the shoestrings and go straight for the regular ones,) and superb shakes, those tasty $6 shakes!

Alaina, that's good to know. Sounds like a managerial issue on weekends, and if that is the case, it's easy enough to solve. Scott, thanks. We've been to Stand as well, but we didn't want to mention it in this post, since brgr and Stand get conflated quite a bit in the press and on websites, probably because they both opened around the same time. We'll write up Stand at some point, as well.

The New Black (Cracker)

***CONTENT
 Over time, we humans have evolved a justifiable wariness of black foods, an evolutionary skittishness that probably owes much of its persistence to a simple tautology: black means burnt. Going against the grain on this has worked out well for us on occasion-pepper and black sesame seeds are perfect examples; but it remains difficult sometimes to look at a black food and not anticipate the acrid taste of ash. This was precisely my own mental hurdle when I opened a box of The Fine Cheese Company's charcoal crackers. I knew that the entire point of the crackers, from a biochemical perspective, was to present as neutral a taste as possible for cheese, but that did not help me much. How, I kept wondering, could this little snack that looked as if it had been cut out from a piece of black construction paper not taste like volcanic fallout? Amazingly, it did not. As promised, the charcoal cracker tasted mostly like salt, with a muted grainy maltiness. The charcoal in the recipe strips the high-note, tangy flavors from the flour, leaving behind a crunchy and savory cracker that tastes every bit like something that is not supposed to be eaten on its own. And none of this is new-charcoal crackers have been available in the US and UK for more than two centuries, although they have only recently begun to come back into vogue. Nineteenth century doctors prescribed them for gastrointestinal distress, relying on activated charcoal's ability to latch on to small molecules and carry them out of the digestive tract. This property is also what makes charcoal a potent antidote to poisoning-adventurous sushi chefs often keep a pre-prepared bottle of charcoal solution at the ready, should a dish of fugu go horribly wrong. That same chemical adsorption is what makes charcoal crackers taste more neutral in the mouth-some of the wheat's molecules are bound up in the charcoal and cannot activate tastebuds on the tongue, relegating these crackers to the background and hence making them a perfect partner for subtle cheeses. Now, the manufacturer insists that they work well with any cheese, and although this may be true, at $4.99 for about 25 crackers, we think they ought to be reserved for cheeses that need them, such as Explorateur, fromage d'affinois, and Welsh Cilowen. Yet put the science of the charcoal cracker aside for a moment. After all, even The Fine Cheese Company itself does, using descriptive language like 'stylish' that belongs more to the world of Barney's than Balducci's. But in truth, the manufacturer does have a point; charcoal crackers are striking and even lovely to look at, especially when topped with a slice of something colorful or gooey. You probably won't see them at Bryant Park during Fashion Week this year, but now that charcoal crackers are widely available throughout Gotham, they may just make a cameo appearance in a fashion-forward cheese course near you. And if they do, just close your eyes and pretend they're tan. The Fine Cheese Co.'s charcoal crackers are sold at Amish Markets, Artisanal Cheese Shop, and several other Manhattan retailers.

Golden Unicorn-Third Floor: Chicken Feet, Bao Zi, & Almond Jelly...Going Up!

***CONTENT
 Nineteen years after it first opened its doors in Manhattan's Chinatown, Golden Unicorn remains so popular that weekend customers still sometimes wait 45 minutes for a table. In an industry where restaurants age in canine years, that's remarkable tenacity and longevity-the equivalent of Maya Plisetskaya dancing The Dying Swan long after her 65th birthday. Part of Golden Unicorn's allure comes from its rituals and processes-and not just the Hong Kong-style cart service. Just as important is the pre-dining ritual of entering the building and checking in with the hostess in the lobby. She records how many people are in your party, and when a table becomes available, she phones upstairs to the multi-level restaurant as you board the elevator bound for the appropriate floor. The whole seating experience is so well choreographed that it likely would make Plisetskaya proud indeed. But there's more: once you find a table, the dim sum carts begin snaking along the aisles, and yet these are no ordinary pushcarts-these have photographic labels to help you identify what each offers; and if you are new to dim sum and don't speak Chinese or luck out and find a rare server who speaks English, these little pictographs are a huge potential asset. However, things start to unravel a bit once you're seated, as Chopper, HungryMan and I discovered on a recent visit. The chatter on the Web recently has been all about how Golden Unicorn's cooking has gone from solid to stale, and we were eager to see how accurate the rumors were. And the truth is: they're not all wrong. To be completely fair, we still managed to eat some wonderful dishes at Golden Unicorn-the Ha Cheung Fun (shrimp flat noodle rolls) were soft and soy-bathed, with very juicy shrimps hidden inside and not a trace of sliminess. Interestingly, these arrived in a cart bearing the labels \"Duck Web\" and \"Shrimp and Shark Fin Shumai,\" neither of which was anywhere to be seen. We also really enjoyed the crisp and chewy stuffed shrimp spring rolls that reminded us of a panko-rolled, seafood version of pigs-in-a-blanket. These came with two dipping sauces, but I thought they were just perfect on their own. And once again, the cart that brought them to us was mislabeled, this time with \"Sweet Taro Bun\" and \"Steamed Chiu Chou Dumpling.\" I started to wonder if those much-touted, ostensibly helpful cart photos might actually do more harm than good in the long run. But it took an entire cartful of Lo Bahk Gow (Pan-fried Turnip Cake)-my personal all-time favorite dim sum item-delivered in a cart labeled as \"Steamed Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf\" to make me realize that someone in the kitchen was not paying attention to details. This lackadaisical attitude was, quite unfortunately, also reflected in the quality of many of the dishes we ate, and not just in their mode of transportation around the dining room. The roast duck plate was a perfect example-soggy in places, greasy in others, and altogether missing any of the sultry smokiness that can make this dish such a winner, this dish was both the most expensive thing we ordered ($8.95) and the least worth the effort it took to chew. Just as terrible was the deep fried pork bun that looked so appealing on the cart, but tasted like an oil-soaked wad of Kleenex and smelled unappetizingly like too much five spice powder. Other dishes we ate, such as the chive dumplings, the sautéed Chinese spinach, and the sweet tapioca and custard bun, were unremarkable-although the yellow center of the tapioca bun did taste quite a bit like a marshmallow Peep. And as the three of us finished our meal and we saw our bill ($45 total), the conversation took on a sour tone and turned to other, better, cheaper dim sum spots in the neighborhood. Just the week before, we had eaten at local favorite 88 Palace and paid $35 for four people and frankly, much better food. Entertaining pre-seating rituals and cart labels are great gimmicks to get customers in the door, but these aren't the late 1980s-there is a growing public interest in and access to information about restaurants, and diners do talk about carelessness and mediocre cooking. Unfortunately, unless Golden Unicorn adopts some of Plisetskaya's Soviet-era discipline, it is unlikely that the restaurant will be able to retain its position as Chinatown's dottering, absent-minded grandfather of dim sum. Golden Unicorn, 18 East Broadway (at Catherine Street), 212-941-0911.

Have you been to ping's? dimsum go-go? on a tangent, those steam carts make quite the drama of dimsum, but in almost every other city with a sizeable cantonese population (london, shanghai, vancouver and even parts of california) demand for fresher made-to-order dishes has made dinosaurs of those dimsum carts. like general tso's chicken* and mr k's, like japonais and buddakan, dimsum at jing fong, golden unicorn and all the other mega-restaurants exemplifies chinese with a distinctly american patois. amidst chinatown's fantastic little bakeries, great congee and authentic la mian, it is unfortunate that the dimsum here has such a long way to go to resemble the freshness and light hand of real cantonese food. a real pity alan yau didn't make it across the pond** - nor even susur lee from toronto - to show us how to take chinese food seriously. forage on, guys, and keep up the great posts! *http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/magazine/04food.t.html?ex=1328245200&en=3413e2c35e4a18e6&ei=5088&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss **http://www.nypost.com/seven/02082007/gossip/pagesix/chinese_shuffle_at_gramercy_pagesix_.htm

Yes to both Ping's and DGG. We'll get to both eventually, but of the two, DGG is our favorite, even without the carts. Now while I agree with your point that carts are theatrical, they're certainly not outmoded in other parts of the world-one visit to London's biggest restaurant (and of course, biggest dim sum restaurant), New World, will show you just how popular they still are. New World remains the site of our longest wait for a table: 3 hours (which we'd normally never do, but a friend from Sao Paolo who had never had dim sum was visiting). And honestly, I think you're right about the Anglo inflection in the bigger dim-sum palaces-especially at Golden Unicorn. But carts aren't always a sign of inauthentic cooking, nor are they harbingers of a bad meal. My Chinese teacher in graduate school told me once that she (a Taiwanese woman who had been in the US for 30 years) would never bother with dim sum if it didn't come on a cart. \"Part of the is the fun in seeing something delicious two feet from your face and grabbing it!\" she claimed. And I have to agree with her.

i agree entirely with the theatre and the instant gratification! (and the vote for dsgg.) carts are good fun, but if i'm looking for freshness and a bit more perfection, i definitely order a la carte. even on a packed sunday afternoon in a smaller restaurant, the difference between an order flash-fried or steamed just for you and one that's made the rounds in a cart is palpable! much as with those sushi 'trains'* oddly popular elsewhere (bless us for not having succumbed much yet), you never know what you're going to get - or how old it is. agreed that the carts may never go out of historic style and the need to serve the masses. but restaurants overseas with aspirations to finer dimsum (royal china, yauatcha in the uk) have definitely migrated to an a la carte style which suits the thinner pastries and more extravagant concoctions a little better. *http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conveyor_belt_sushi

 We love a good cupcake. Really, we do-even if we have been a bit bearish on the waning little-treat trend recently. But don't be fooled; if HungryMan and I get our hands on a cupcake from the Little Pie Company, for example, it doesn't stick around very long. Which is the reason why we're so disappointed in what we've eaten at Crumbs Bakeshop on the Upper East Side. In our recent quest to spend more time eating east of the park, we have gone out of our way to give Crumbs a chance. Several chances, in fact-since we don't like to write about places we have visited only once. But two things give us pause about Crumbs Bakeshop. First is...well, the cupcakes. They look beautiful and certainly offer value for money-even the pricier ($3.50) cakes are gargantuan and provide enough food for two people. On our most recent visit, when HungryMan collected our bag of two cupcakes (a Boston Cream Pie and a Fudge Chocolate Chip, both pictured above), he had to double-check to make sure he hadn't been given an entire cake (or a paving stone) by accident. These high-density desserts also seem to be a little confused about what they are-they have such a strange, almost gummy crumb, that they could pass for muffins in the dark. And frankly, they taste more like muffins as well. Every time either one of us has visited Crumbs, we've struggled to eat more than a bite or two of our cupcakes and have lugged the leftovers home. Their sole virtue appears then and only then: these cupcakes never seem to go stale. Then there's the service, which at the best of times is a bit brusque, and at the worst of times is just plain rude. On one nighttime visit we, and the rest of the patrons, were told unceremoniously, \"OK folks, it's time for you to leave.\" No warning, no thanks, no smiles. We laughed it off the first time, but unfortunately, it has been our experience that this is the norm at Crumbs. We love that Crumbs operates a location in East Hampton-and we suspect that this is part of the reason why its shops in Manhattan remain in business-there is no better way to build a positive food memory than to sell treats in a place where happy vacationers go, so that when they return home, they're thinking more about the beach than about the frosted concrete dessert they're eating. But until our taste-smell dendrites connect up with our sandy shore-getaway brain centers, we'll leave the Crumbs where they are and grab a real muffin instead. Crumbs Bakeshop, Upper East Side location, 1371 Third Avenue (at 78th Street), 212-794-9800.

I have never had these giant cupcakes. however, one day at work we were treated to delightful miniature cupcakes from Crumbs. Same varieties, but they were rather light and small...I got the feeling that any larger size would be too sweet/too much. Perhaps the key is to sticking with the minis...at least the ones we had were very good. I tried the hostess-eque one with the chocolate ganche and white design on top.

Crispo, Decoded

2007-02-21 18:31:00
***CONTENT
 In the five years since Crispo opened, it has lost none of its enigmatic qualities. Is the restaurant a Northern Italian generalist, a pasta specialist, or, given the massive size of the space Crispo occupies- it can seat nearly 200 diners at a time- is it more of a venue for parties and large groups? Everything about the place, down to the salvaged iron faucet sculptures on the wall, defies classification, and perhaps that's the point. Earlier this month, I went with Nosher and our friend Red to investigate further what makes Crispo click. We brought Red along to give us the San Franciscan perspective on quirkiness, and as someone who knows her fishcake from her flambe, she was as perfect a companion as we could have hoped for to help us decode Crispo's multiple personalities. Crispo attacks Northern Italian cuisine with gusto and breadth of range: Its menu is heavy on affettati, thin slices of prosciutto, bresaola, coppa and soppressata, artfully arranged ($7-15, depending on the combination). At the same time, there are salads and an assortment of home-made pastas. And, as if to remind you that this is a New York-style Italian restaurant, veal shows up cooked at least five different ways: marsala, fontina, saltimbocca, parmigiano, and with artichoke & lemon sauce. The only really unambitious section of the menu is the salads-these never stray far from safe harbors, with combinations that are nothing you haven't seen elsewhere a hundred times (beet with goat cheese, apple with gorgonzola and walnuts, tomato and mozzarella). Most everyone we saw at Crispo seemed happy with these options- and there was certainly no shortage of people in the dining room with us that night. Crispo's narrow but cavernous front dining space was crammed mostly with a heady mix of neighbors from the Village and Chelsea. The back room, which is less formal, larger and more cacaphonous, was where we were seated, and it was a perfect spot, at least until the entire room filled up with a large wedding rehearsal dinner party proudly and loudly hailing from Union County, New Jersey; given the obviously deleterious effects a party like this can have on neighboring tables, we were surprised that our server didn't bother mentioning this to us before we sat down. Still, in the quiet ninety minutes before the wedding party's bleatings would drown out all conversation, we enjoyed the better part of our meal, including three very different appetizers. Mine, a cold octopus salad (pictured top, $11.00), suffered from preparation problems; the cephalopod's long limbs were too thick here and too thin there, with the more delicate parts seriously overcooked and only a few of the the meatier sections tender enough to eat without sawing away with a knife. The dish was saved, in part, by a foundation of fork-tender Yukon Gold potatoes, cherry tomatoes and microgreens in a tangy and fruity vinaigrette. Red's endive salad (pictured above, $9.50) was one of the evening's specials, and came tarted up with slices of red delicious apple, chopped walnuts and crumbles of a particularly strong gorgonzola. The walnut/apple/gorgonzola combination works as well here as it does in lots of other places, but ultimately, it was nothing special and lacked some of the zing we expected from a featured appetizer selection. Tempting fate, Nosher ordered one of the more unusual appetizers, a platter of tiny caramelized cauliflower florets, crunchy pine nuts, and dried currants ($10). This dish missed its mark despite a wonderful combo of textures, mostly because more than a few cauliflower pieces were crispy casualties of too much cooking. The dish also really could have used a bit more moisture-even an extra hit of olive oil would have helped eliminate its dryness. Starters aside, Crispo has become known for its homemade pasta, and to judge it by its appetizers is a bit like judging a great steakhouse by its creamed spinach. With pasta as the main event, therefore, Crispo's mystery only deepened, because the three pasta dishes we ordered couldn't have been more different. Nosher's pappardelle with porcini mushrooms ($21.50, also a special) was good, if a bit oversalted-not the best we've ever had, but certainly very decent. On the other hand, Red's butternut squash tortelloni ($18.50), wonderfully tender parcels of egg pasta stuffed with sweet butternut squash and sprinkled with softened, roast chestnuts were excellent. For the price, though, the portion was too small and left her still hungry. Finally, all three of us tried the spaghetti carbonara ($18.50), perhaps Crispo's best-known pasta dish, and also its most successful. The dish is described on the menu as '3p classic,' confusingly not referring to its ability to serve three people (it does not), but to the three varieties of Italian pork products it features: prosciutto, pancetta, and smoked pancetta. The whole thing is topped with parmesan shavings and a lightly poached egg which, once broken and mixed in with the hot al dente pasta, binds the dish together in a way that makes this a hearty dish that will help anyone get through another day of bleak, wintry weather in New York. We did not stay for dessert, because by this time, the wedding party had started up in earnest. No matter - even without dessert, we think we've solved at least part of the Crispo mystery: the restaurant is a haven for pasta, especially its wonder-working carbonara. Pay no attention to the supporting actors like most of the salads or cheeses - you can get these anywhere. So in the end, here's our final Crispo answer: it's Colonel Mustard, in the back dining room, with a candlestick-at the DeNuzzio rehearsal dinner. Crispo, 240 West 14th Street, between 7th and 8th Avenues. (212) 229-1818.

I was there recently for the first time, and neither of us felt like we'd be tempted to return. Nothing special, esp. for the price. You didn't really mention service, which was lackluster (we asked for some info on the wine we were going for and were told it was \"very dry\" -- um, yeah, it was listed under the \"dry\" heading). The porcini pasta was definitely too salty and also too oily (and pricy!). I had same disappointment with the octopus as you did. The place was pretty packed though, so it's doing something right, evidently.

 Uncle Heraclitus came up with a brilliant idea for a nightclub last year at around this time. The concept, as he explained it, was a sedate venue where Boomers could go, eat a meal, perhaps dance a little, and then be home in bed by eight at night-hence the name: Home By Eight. Little did he know that Bruno Jamais had a similar audience in mind when he created his eponymous restaurant. But Bruno's Place (as it is called by those in the know) gives mid-century babies a bit more credit for endurance; his supper club stays open until 4:00 a.m. and serves dinner until 2:00 a.m.. So when Bruno-former maitre d' at Restaurant Daniel and Alain Ducasse-invited us to visit and chat with him and the restaurant's young chef, John Keller, we thought we should see what they're doing to keep patrons lingering long past midnight.

At Pigalle, It's All About Morning

 Breakfast might be the most important meal of the day, but when it comes to food writing, it is also the most neglected. Ignored in favor of its chic, more cosmopolitan (and occasionally alcoholic) weekend sibling, brunch, poor breakfast just languishes in a puddle of wet cereal. And all of that goes double for mid-week breakfasts. So when HungryMan and I found ourselves with an extra A.M. hour in the middle of last week, we set out to try to find something special with which to kick-start our Wednesday. Perhaps we were also smarting from our recent Brasserie 52 disappointment, because we both confessed to a long-unfulfilled craving for something French-something in the omelette family. Now, it should be pretty apparent that we're no enemies of diners-spend a few weeks in Gotham and it's hard not to see that some of the best food in the city is cooked by short-order line cooks. But as we thought about the best way to satisfy our omelette jones, we decided to skip a trip to our favorite local egg slinger and focus instead on trying to find a genuinely French breakfast. So despite having eaten a few very mediocre dinners there in the past, we headed to Pigalle, one of the brasseries in the Nice Matin group of restaurants. After all, we figured, the kitchen staff is likely to be different for the breakfast service, so why not give the spot one last chance? It turned out to be the best thing we did that day. HungryMan's Fritatta Espagnole (pictured top, $8.95) was loaded with chunks of potato, tomato and onion, flavors that matched beautifully with the piquancy of the chorizo. The kitchen serves this dish with a small, lightly dressed mesclun salad, a well-considered touch, as fried potatoes would have been not only redundant, but too much fat for one morning plate. My own smoked salmon and asparagus omelette ($8.50) was much lighter and taller than the frittata, and therefore worked better with the fist-sized serving of fried potatoes that accompanied them, although we both thought the potatoes were a bit too greasy. But the real triumph of the morning was the bread-both HungryMan's and my eggs were served with two thin, very lightly grilled slices of fantastic white sourdough bread that tasted quite a bit like Poilâne. The superb bread and the very respectable cafés au lait made this an unexpectedly sophisticated breakfast. One that, in light of our previous experiences at the restaurant, we never would have expected from Pigalle. So perhaps it is time for the Nice Matin management to shake things up on Eighth Avenue-if we knew the breakfast kitchen staff were cooking at night, we'd quite happily return again to the brasserie for dinner. If they've got this kind of respect for and flair with morning fare, we think they certainly deserve a crack at onion soup and boeuf bourguignon. Pigalle, 790 Eighth Avenue (at 48th Street), 212-489-2233.

Dinner at a Tastier Sort of Big House: Kunjip

***DATE

***CONTENT
 A reporter from a travel magazine asked us last week what we thought was the biggest change to New Yorkers' palates over the past ten years or so. \"Easy,\" we responded, \"It's that finally, Gothamites have realized how wonderful Korean food can be.\" Nowhere can you see evidence of this more than right around Herald Square in Manhattan, where Koreatown thrived-all but invisible to non-Koreans-for decades, until very recently, when some magical key turned in Manhattan's collective conscious, and suddenly, everyone has a favorite spot for japchae. But the restaurants, especially those along 'Korea Way,' the stretch of 32nd Street between Sixth and Fifth Avenues, have taken their new-found popularity in stride, opening up larger dining rooms and making a real effort to educate patrons about the difference between a mandoo gui and a mandoo jjim (the former is a fried dumpling, the latter a steamed or braised dumpling). The downside to all of this is, of course, that it is harder than ever to find a seat in one of Koreatown's more popular eateries. Even over the past two years, business seems to have spiked exponentially to the point where it is nearly impossible now to sit down at lunchtime carryout hotspot Woorijip, where as recently as 2004, I often told friends to meet me for a quiet, very casual lunch. Another restaurant that has seen their customer base explode is Kunjip, or \"The Big House\" in Korean. Just like its kindred spirit Han Bat, three blocks to the north, Kunjip does mostly authentic Korean classics, eschewing experimentation for tradition. And just like many restaurants in the neighborhood, Kunjip is open for business 24 hours a day. Unlike Han Bat, it is also crowded during almost every one of those 24 hours (save at around 7:00 in the morning, when even the post-karaoke crowd has left for home). Some of this has to do with the fact that Kunjip is located at the epicenter of Koreatown-it is difficult not to walk past it if you are in the area, and when you do, Kunjip is ready for you with a little olfactory seduction. But the gorgeous smells really don't hit you until you walk in the door, as my friend Texasian and I found out on a recent visit, and they appear to work spectacularly well at eliminating any desire to do anything except stand and wait for a table...which we did obediently. Our wait was not without its hiccups-we were once offered (and rejected) a table positioned six inches from a parabolic heat lamp that made us feel as if we were orbiting the sun in a camp stove, and we were later passed over for a two-top when a stately-looking Korean couple arrived. But it's hard to complain too much about these problems when our dinner was as good as it was. Our banchan (pictured top) were all high-quality and included a delightfully light and subtly salty sprouted mung bean pickle that was one of the best sprout dishes I've tasted. Texasian and I also shared an order of the kimchi pajun (pictured above, $8.95), a spicy pan-fried pancake filled with hot kimchi and scallions. Both of us were really impressed that the pajun was crispy all across the diameter of the pancake, as one of the problems a kimchi pajun often has is that it gets soggy in the middle within minutes after it is removed from the stove. Not this one. Ours was firm throughout our meal. Small details like this are what really set Kunjip's execution apart from that of most other traditional Korean restaurants. Before our meal, I had read some criticism of Kunjip's maewoon dduk boki, suggesting that in the past, the restaurant had been a little stingy with its rice cakes (the long, cylindrical noodle type). My entrée proved this wrong-there were generous portions of both rice cakes and glass noodles at the bottom of the serving dish, as well as several long, thinly-sliced pieces of fish cake marinating in the lurid red broth. I was also very pleased to discover that the kitchen had not skimped on the gochu jang (sugary red chili paste) in the dish. The result was a filling and very hearty dduk boki with exactly the right amount of spicy kick. Texasian's main, the gobdol bibimbob ($12.95), was also generously portioned and served at just the right searing temperature to allow the rice to develop a perfect crunchy crust around the inside surface of the stone bowl. Our server warned us that this particular dish came with \"lots, lots of beef,\" and while I wouldn't say she was lying, she was perhaps exaggerating a bit. That said, there was plenty of meat-just not enough to warrant a heads-up. But overall, the bibimbob dishes at Kunjip that we have eaten have all been very solid. In a departure from the traditional orange slices on the table, Kunjip finishes its meals by serving small bowls of a room-temperature spiced sweet brew intended to help digestion and to cool down the mouth after a peppery meal. Both Texasian and I enjoyed this ginger and cinnamon 'tea,' presented with a single pine nut floating languidly on its surface, although neither of us finished it. She is just like I am, in that we both like to leave a Korean restaurant with just barely inflamed lips and tongue-enough to remind us that we've just eaten Korean food, and enough to remind us to be grateful that we live in a city where we can. Kunjip, 9 West 32nd Street (between Fifth and Sixth Avenues), 212-216-9487.

You didn't mention that this place is 1)cheaper than most and 2) sometimes so crowded that you have to wait in line to be seated. Often you are asked to place your order while in line so they can get you in and out quicker. Not a big deal for a Korean who wants a real meal, but maybe an issue for a casual diner looking for a full dining experience.

Hi Sue, Yes. Kunjip can be crowded, but I suspect that's as much an artifact of the increased popularity of Korean food as anything else. And you're right about being asked to order in line sometimes, but I've noticed that taking place at several places, so perhaps calling out Kunjip isn't entirely fair. I also think Han Bat is a little cheaper, on the whole, but Kunjip is less pricey than many of the 32nd Street restaurants-and it shouldn't be. Thanks for the comment! Nosher

I'm surprised they didn't give you the steamed egg in the banchan. That's one of kunjip's specialties for their banchans... unfortunately if your not korean they usually forget to give it to you. I had to wave them down for one ever time I ate there with non koreans. If you get around try Dons bogam down the block, less of a crowd but he food is fantastic especially the lunch special. They have some bimbops that no other k town places serve.

 Whether or not you're sold on the idea that shabu shabu is the next sushi, you have to admire the way Koca Lounge (formerly Outlet Koca Lounge) chef Shawn Collins has thrown himself into his work-the man is so busy preparing small plates and simmering pots of broth on the Lower East Side that he hasn't restocked his own fridge since Labor Day. Collins, along with the restaurant's two Chinese-American owners, have made it their business to make hotpots as big of a sensation here as they are in Taiwan-which is to say, huge. HungryMan, the Noshingtonienne, and I took Collins up on his invitation to come down and visit Koca Lounge and to see what the restaurant's small but knowledgeable staff is doing with pan-Asian cooking. Along the way, we also found out all about Koca Lounge's upcoming secret vegetarian menu.

 Call it coincidence if you will, but we did predict last month that Hell's Kitchen would be a great place for food in 2007, and with the impending April arrival of Alphabet City refugee NYC Icy, it looks like the H.K. might prove us right sooner rather than later. The new frozen dessert outlet will open in the former florist's shopfront adjacent to another Tenth Avenue fave, Lali. We're already thinking ahead to stopping in for an afternoon order of pescado frito at Lali, followed by a cooling scoop of NYC Icy's signature chocolate pepper ice. And although I never thought I'd be talking up cold food in this bracing weather, it is hard to deny that Hell's Kitchen has long been lacking a decent purveyor of frozen sweets. Stay tuned...more in two months. NYC Icy (open soon), 628 Tenth Avenue (at 45th Street), no telephone number yet.

Pasita's Venezuelan Dreams, Subtitled in Italian
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-02-05 03:18:00
***CONTENT
 By all accounts, real Venezuelan cuisine appears seriously underrepresented in the New York dining scene. Yes, there are the ubiquitous arepa stands at every summer street fair, but in truth, you are about as likely to be served something authentically Venezuelan there as you are to find true 600 thread-count cotton sheets on sale in the next festival stall. And in a city where Venezuelans make up the fifth-largest group of Hispanic immigrants, it's surprising that until 2003, there were only two Venezuelan eateries in the entire city: Flor's Kitchen in Greenwich Village and El Cocotero near Chelsea. But things are changing...slowly. Pasita, a small-plate restaurant and wine bar, opened to mixed reviews last October on the site of the former Gioia Pizzeria & Vinoteco. We have been hearing rumors that the restaurant was finally living up to some of its potential, so Jay and I stopped in for dinner last week to investigate. Like Spanish tapas, casual Venezuelan cuisine centers on shared small plates, each called a pasapalo. Some pasapalos will be familiar to diners who enjoy Latin food-tostones and yuca frita, for example, are pan-Hispanic classics-others, like the arepitas, small button-sized parcels of fried corn and cheese, are distinctly Venezuelan and don't have analogs in other cuisines. Other national dishes, like the pabellón criollo, a hearty combination of rice, beans and shredded beef, are absent on Pasita's menu, perhaps because they do not lend themselves so easily to small portions. On this visit, we tasted two of Pasita's most authentic pasapalos, the tostones and the arepitas. The tostones ($6), silver-dollar sized fried green plaintains, were beautiful and crisp, but as completely dried out as a stack of pub coasters. Even the very decent green pepper salsa served alongside the plate could do nothing to save them. Our expectations for the arepitas ($6) were similarly dashed. While we accurately predicted that these corn and cheese cakes would be the diminutive cousins of true arepas (hence the name), we were sorely disappointed to find the corn-to-cheese ratio in the arepitas to be far too high-was there any cheese at all in these? Overall, this was an altogether different experience than the magic comingling of grain and dairy found in a truly heavenly arepa. This letdown was even more of a shame because Pasita provides some fantastic guasacaca (a particularly Venezualan avocado-based salsa) and nata cheese to dip your arepitas in, but sadly, both of the sauces were overwhelmed by the rather uninteresting taste of fried corn. At the other extreme of quality were the empanaditas ($9), crispy yet somehow much lighter fried packets filled with either shredded chicken or beef. More than respectable, our empanaditas had us wishing we had ordered three baskets instead of just one. But it is telling that the best pasapalo at Pasita had the least connection to Venezuelan cooking. Like the arepitas, the empanaditas were served with a creamy nata cheese salsa and a slightly more aggressive green 'mojo' sauce. The highlight of the night, if you can believe it, was the pizza. Pasita wisely decided to keep Gioia's brick oven intact and operational-it dominates the dining room as before, spitting out pie after pie throughout the night. If you visit, try to get a seat with a view of the oven; the swarm of activity surrounding it is often Benihana-esque. There are a variety of pizzas on the menu, with a few nods to New York classics like margherita and pepperoni; but the real stars are the Venezuelan-inspired pies. These include the wonderful ropa vieja pie ($15), a soft, doughy base that remains crunchy at the edges, topped with spicy red sauce, bubbled Manchego cheese, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers and most importantly: roughly chopped strips of shredded braised flank steak. The combination of manchego and beef turns out to be a felicitious and complex one that required several bites just to comprehend. This pie deserves its place as one of Pasita's most popular dishes. Desserts are at once more and less than what you might expect. Pasita serves sorbets and gelatos from Il Laboratorio del Gelato on the Lower East Side- all excellent, if not particularly Venezuelan. But at $6 a dish, they are very reasonably priced. We ordered ours with a plate of caramelized, fried sweet plaintains that managed to hold their own alongside two heaving scoops of Il Laboratorio's immaculate honey gelato. We were also pleasantly surprised by a 'triple chocolate' cake that featured a creamy middle layer of chocolate mousse- it was an easy winner, despite our suspicions that its origins have little connection to Caracas. Pasita also bills itself as a wine bar, and we enjoyed a wonderful Spanish Crianza Rioja from the rotating list of nightly wine specials. The restaurant's full wine list is rather small for a wine bar, however, featuring about 20 bottles of both red and white, all from Latin America or Iberia. Interestingly, you're better off ordering by the bottle here, as pricing by the glass is somewhat aggressive. Four months after its official opening, we still think Pasita has some work to do before it really hits its stride and makes New Yorkers sit up and take notice of Venezuelan cooking. But it is different enough from both other small-plate restaurants and other South American eateries to make it worth stopping by for a casual dinner; and as long as you stick to the fusion pizzas and the empanaditas, you'll be sure to taste some noteworthy nosh. Pasita, 47 Eighth Avenue, Between Horatio and Jane Streets (at West 4th Street), 212-255-3900.

Colombians also make arepitas (but call just them arepas). Different from the venezolano kind. My husband (Venezuelan) and I found the food at the Caracas Arepa Bar to be quite authentic and delicious. The arepas at El Cocotero, however, fall apart way too easily and their meat doesn't have nearly as much flavor.

 Nothing phases Candace McMenamin: not the throng of young teens jostling her table as she chops jalapeno peppers; not the fact that only her mother accompanied her from South Carolina to New York for the Simply Manischewitz Kosher Cook-Off; and least of all, the fact that she's not actually Jewish. To her, the extra attention she seems to be getting from the hovering rabbis isn't even a distraction; it's all about the flavors, and if her $20,000 windfall at this year's competition is any indication, she's onto something. Her winning entry, Sweet Potato Encrusted Chicken, is at once a sophisticated dish that marries sweet, acidic, and savory elements, and a quick-and-dirty entrée that she engineered with busy home cooks in mind-people pretty much like her, just with a few extra restrictions on what and how they prepare for a meal. As McMenamin and I chatted throughout the hour-long final round of the competition today, she reflected on how the contest's eight ingredient maximum and strict kashrut dietary regulations actually helped her to make choices when she first began brainstorming recipe ideas. \"I like to keep it simple,\" she said, \"Well, simple and interesting. I love a mix of flavors and textures.\" When you take into account that she has already been a finalist at the Pillsbury Bake-Off-twice-and recently won $10,000 in a beef contest, you can see where she gets the confidence that inspired her to take a few risks with her recipe. Indeed, among the six finalists, she is the only one to include spicy heat, and she also makes a bold statement in choosing chicken breasts-notoriously tricky to cook properly in an unfamiliar oven. Take an extra second to wipe the matzoh meal from your hands, and suddenly, you might as well be baking the Potato Pancake Mix box. Then again, McMenamin, as well as the other five finalists, have had ample opportunities to practice making their dishes since they first submitted their entries this autumn, moving through regional and semifinal rounds that winnowed the field of contestants down from more than a thousand to just these six. One entrant, Rayzel Yaish, a school psychologist from suburban New Jersey, found an added bit of competitive leverage as a crowd of several dozen students trickled in to support their 'Dr. (Falafel Stuffed) Pepper' on to victory. Not only did the stacked crowd give her a very vocal home-court advantage, it didn't hurt that all those teens couldn't help but jostle the other competitors a bit in the bargain. After a few cutting boards, jars, and cameras were upended in the pubescent bustle, the contest organizers made the very wise decision to cordon the kids off at the back of the room and distract them with a lunch buffet. But in the end, the mob was a mere distraction, and it was a gentile from south of the Mason-Dixon Line who won the day with her calm, self-possessed mien: \"I've got a teenager at home. I honestly don't even hear or notice when the kids are there while I'm cooking, unless they're talking directly to me,\" McMenamin quipped, stirring her apricot jam & grape juice glaze, \"But really, it makes me feel at home.\" Candace's serenity in the midst of all the contest madness brought to mind some of the most memorable cooking competition veterans ('contesters') profiled in one of our favorite books of 2003, Amy Sutherland's Cookoff: Recipe Fever in America. After all, if McMenamin can steal top honors at a kosher cooking contest without breaking a schvitz, we suspect she might just have the makings of a cookoff legend. *** For many more photos of all six competitors and the dishes they presented today at the Marriott Marquis Hotel, visit our Flickr photostream by clicking here.

Let Them Eat Chlorella

***CONTENT
 Maybe the long overdue chill in the air has reawakened our cave-dweller metabolism, encouraging us to pack on some winter weight, because we have been feeding a powerful craving for sweets over the past few weeks. Not that we're complaining too much-there is something liberating about scarfing down a doughnut while blaming your Pleistocene-era ancestors for the extra poundage. And there aren't too many better places to indulge a craving for sugary treats than New York. Over the past two years though, we've gotten a little fatigued by the ubiquitous cupcake and have been searching for unusual, as well as unusually tasty, snacks. One of our favorite haunts is Koryodang, a bakery-café right in the heart of Koreatown's busiest block on 32nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Koryodang is also easy to locate because of its ultra-high wattage incandescent white interior and dark wood tables; it is the sort of place that looks like it could cure even the most dire case of seasonal affective disorder on the greyest day of the year. The restaurant does a brisk business selling pricey coffee drinks and bubble teas to a mostly Korean clientele, but we rarely take a table inside, choosing instead to browse the large selection of take-away items at the front of the store. Koryodang is one of the best bakeries in town for fresh traditional Korean walnut cakes, an extraordinary citrus-glazed sweet potato cake (pictured left), as well as surprisingly authentic-tasting Cannelés Bordelais-who knew? But we've been sampling the shop's more unusual baked goods recently, starting with something we thought was a green tea sweet bread with cranberries, walnuts, and streusel topping. When I asked the name of the lurid green cake, I was told simply that it was Koryodang's own creation and had no English name. The closest anyone could tell me was that it was pronounced 'clo-eh-ra'. HungryMan was understandably wary of the thing, but quickly changed his mind as soon as he tasted it, commenting that it had a richness, a mellow taste that was a bit like green tea, but rounder, softer. The tang of the cranberries and the crunch of the topping were also perfect touches to this half-bread, half-cake that reminded us a bit of something you might find at a Mexican panaderia. Not the best dessert we've ever eaten, but interesting enough to convince us to each down more than one slice. Eager to find out more about the mystery cake, I went back the next day and asked someone else for more details and found out that the cake is named after its most conspicuous ingredient: chlorella. Yes, that's algae. The story behind the cake, as we were told, is that Koryodang's chef wanted to create a winter sweet bread that incorporated some healthy ingredients, so he turned to chlorella, using it as a substitute for green tea. We're not sure if we quite buy the claim that the Chlorella bread is healthful, but it is certainly much more fun to eat than a wheatgrass smoothie. Koryodang, 31 West 32nd Street, 212-967-9661.

My favorite feature of Koryodang: a couple months ago, I sat there with a friend on a fairly busy Saturday afternoon and had a conversation for at least an hour or more without a single \"can I get you anything else?\" or even a passive-aggressive \"here's the check, there's no hurry\" from the waitstaff, which is a rarity in NYC -- or anywhere, really.

Brunch's New Area Code: 202 in 212

 Eating in a restaurant that doubles as a retail shop carries with it certain risks: that the food may act purely as a loss-leader, introduced in an effort to keep you shopping longer; that the food may be unspeakably awful (I'm looking at you, Cafe Beyond); or both. Then there's the IKEA-style thematic food-retail pairing (Swedish meatballs, anyone?), a uniquely bizarre and postmodern experience that consists of bombarding the diner with a befuddling double whammy of culinary clichés and bargain prices. More upscale versions of this idea can be hit or miss: just compare the overweening BG at Bergdorf Goodman to the wonderful and endearing Tea Box Cafe at Fifth Avenue's Takashimaya. Nicole Farhi's 202, a British-American bistro occupying the front half of her Chelsea Market clothing and housewares shop, avoids the pitfalls of both pretension and preciousness, even managing to serve up some respectably good food along the way. Which is no small feat, given the carefully selected and self-conscious luxury the retail shop peddles: hungry customers can finger $85 decorative pillows and $115 minimalist glass candlesticks while waiting for a table (and when the wait for a table during prime weekend brunch hours can be more than 40 minutes, there is plenty of time to browse). But we get the sense that shoppers and diners come to 202 for different reasons-every time we've visited, we've found the clotheshounds among the racks of blowsy, natural fiber clothes and pricey nouveau-Edwardian shift dresses, while the obvious chowhounds tend to wander, looking a little lost, around the front of the shop. And we've never spotted a serious shopper take a quick break for a plate of fish tacos ($17)...but it's nice to know that, should the mood strike, it is possible. Whether or not those eating its food are also wearing its clothes, 202 does present an appealing choice of brunch options, and at prices quite a bit cheaper than those candlesticks. Pancakes and eggs appear on the menu alongside other dishes like arctic char, beet and arugula salad, and a tuna burger. Then there's the full English breakfast with fried eggs and tomato, a required item in any restaurant named after its overseas sibling, which in this case is located at 202 Westbourne Grove in London. When our friend Blanc and I stopped in to 202 last weekend for an early brunch, we weren't hungry enough for the onslaught of a British fry-up, so we ordered something a bit smaller. Blanc's french toast ($10) and accompanying bacon were respectable, although the kitchen seemed to be a bit flummoxed as to how to handle his request that both items be prepared well-done; indeed, they arrived fried to a crisp, practically carbonized. Maple syrup helped to moisten the two arid blocks of brioche, however. To counteract his otherwise vitamin-free entrée, Blanc also ordered a side of sauteed spinach ($6), which was cooked beautifully, although some of its healthful properties were diminished by a too-generous shower of salt. I was much luckier with the buttermilk pancakes (also $10) I ordered. The thick stack was almost wholly covered by a landslide of rich whole blackberry compote that completely eliminated any need for syrup. I was not surprised to learn later that 202's growing culinary reputation is in large part built on the quality of this dish. There are also several other notable offerings on the menu, including daily specials that include unusual, Shopsin-esque soups, as well as a very fine fish and chips platter-another nod to the Nicole Farhi empire's British origins. We'd like to see a little more differentiation of 202's current Chelsea Market space, just to make the dining experience feel a bit less like noshing on the sales floor of an Anthropologie. But in truth, for a great stack of flapjacks, we're happy enough to be seated amidst the silk embroidered camisoles. 202, 75 Ninth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets, at Chelsea Market.

Too bad that Blanc asked for his french toast to be prepared well-done. I had it last week and it had the texture and consistency of the lightest souffle and tasted sinfully like a donut -- I was in heaven! The bacon gave it the great salty contrast it needed.

Their cookies were amazing, I wouldn't expect miso to be used for a sweet treat. chocolate miso cupcakes and green tea okara cookies were ace.

Beyoglu Finds Simplicity's Downside
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-01-23 22:53:00
***CONTENT
 As HungryMan and I sat down to dinner at Beyoglu with our friends Mint and Petrus, we knew it wouldn't be long before someone mentioned Atatürk. This proved to be true when, not more than two minutes after taking our seats, in the middle of a discussion about pronouncing the names of the dishes, Mint let slip that she had lived for years in Turkey. She explained to us that during Atatürk's reign, he reformed not just the country's economy, but its very language, removing irregularities and shifting orthography to a Latin-based system-all in the interest of boosting literacy. The result is modern Turkish, a what-you-see-is-what-you-pronounce language. Beyoglu, named after a ritzy neighborhood in Istanbul, seems to have taken this simplifying passion of Atatürk's to heart, applying it like a sledgehammer to its menu, where most everything we ate among the six kinds of meze and grilled striped bass we ordered was underseasoned, one-dimensional, or both. This is not to say that simplicity is a bad thing. When clean, uncomplicated dishes are prepared well, they can be stellar: think of a steamed lobster with drawn butter as a classic example of perfection in simplicity. But a pared-down list of ingredients demands skilled cooking-it's nearly impossible to hide mistakes when a dish contains just a few components. Take for example Beyoglu's barbunya pilaki (red kidney bean and potato salad, $5.00), a meze served with practically no salt and very little lemon juice, despite the menu's description. There was an unpleasant oiliness to the dish that would have been cut significantly, had just a little bit more care been taken with its seasoning, or had another ingredient been added to the mix. The same holds true for the levrek (char-grilled striped bass with green salad, $14.50), a fish special that both looked and smelled fantastic. But again, the high wire act of cooking simply demands near-perfect execution, and here, the fish had been cooked far too long and had become stiff and rubbery inside. Despite the fact that four people were sharing it, we left nearly a quarter of the fillet on the plate, uneaten. Also overcooked was the octopus in our ahtapot salatasi (char-grilled octopus, marinated in olive oil, lemon, and vinegar, $7.50), although the salad was salted well and ended up being decent, if just a little chewy. The only meze we ordered that was an unequivocal, yet uncomplicated success was the sigara borek (filo-wrapped feta cigars, $5.00), a plate of four crispy deep-fried fingers of soft, salty feta. Petrus insisted we order them, and in hindsight, I'm very happy he did, as this dish showed that Beyoglu is at least capable of preparing delicious and simple food. We found much more consistency in the cooking when the number of ingredients in a dish was greater than three or four: the patlican domates soslu (pan-fried eggplant, topped with fresh tomato, $6.50), a garlic-infused salad with lovely contrast between sweetness and acid, was everyone's favorite. It was even better when it was spooned over a piece of the nigella-topped bread. However, with only a CD-sized loaf to share among the four of us, we ate most of the soslu on its own. Also very fine was the zeytinyagli ispanak (sautéed spinach and dill with homemade yogurt, $5.00)-I was especially taken with the way the rich, browned yogurt topping brought out the distinct vegetal flavors of the spinach and dill. Inexpensive nosh on the Upper East Side is such a rarity that, in spite of its mediocrity, Beyoglu guarantees its own success as long as it doesn't raise its prices substantially-that is, unless a competitor moves in nearby and starts stealing away the restaurant's business. It wouldn't be too difficult to up the ante with a few well-seasoned, carefully prepared kofte and dolma- and really, a little competition from a new Turk on the block might be exactly what Beyoglu needs. Beyoglu, 1431 Third Avenue (at 81st Street), 212-650-0850.

[...] Raki has an extremely strong flavor, but it was perfect for sipping with meze. Although Beyoglu got panned a bit by NYC nosh (and I agree that the octopus was chewy), the hummus and puffy bread were amazingly good and any place that encourages ordering multiple appetizers and no main courses gets an almost immediate gold star (and a spot in the sidebar) in my book.

Brasserie 52: French in Contour

***CONTENT
 Living with very smart people has taught me to love party games-in particular, one called Terra Incognita, a paper and pencil game wherein players attempt to draw the outline of a state, country, or continent from memory, without referring to a map. The results are sometimes hilarious, sometimes shamefully bad, and more often than not, humbling. With no globe in front of you, it's not easy to remember that the Iberian Peninsula tilts, or that Laos looks a little bit like a crooked, long-stemmed artichoke. But what I love best about Terra Incognita is that it teaches you a little bit about yourself and your own internalized recollections of the world-even the very best players screw up a bay or an isthmus here and there. All of this should clarify why, as HungryMan and I sat eating our entrées at Brasserie 52 last week, I got a distinctly familiar, party-game feeling that we were dining in a restaurant that had be reconstructed brick-by-brick, dish-by-dish from someone's foggy memories of Paris-someone, in other words, playing Terra Incognita with the idea of a brasserie. It is clear from the décor, the menu, and the wine list that authenticity was and is a major goal for the restaurant, right down to the (faux) art nouveau tchotchkes and the abbreviated menu painted in gold onto the room's mirrors and windows. But the illusion is spoiled mightily by the complete absence of a single accent or diacritical mark anywhere, as well as by a stunning preponderance of spelling errors on these same mirrors, windows, and worst of all: on the lengthy menu, which consists almost entirely of classic French dishes such as bouillabaisse, escargot [sic.], poulet aux landons [sic.], and boeuf bourguigno [sic.]. It's enough to make your inner French teacher wince in pain and cry «Mon dieu!». Yet ultimately, it's not about the spelling but the food. And sadly, there seem to be some real failures of memory at play here as well. The salade de chèvre chaud ($7) was composed of a fist-sized tangle of overdressed baby arugula and three discs of deep-fried goat cheese, each one the size and heft of a bar of fancy hotel soap. Because the cheese-to-greens ratio was so high, this felt less like a light appetizer than a meal-ending cheese course. Our other starter, the salade de betterave et endive ($7) featured some very decent mixed salad leaves and several refreshing slices of tart green apple, but was ultimately undone by two things: the presence of two wedges of unappetizingly wan and tasteless tomato, and the bizarrely crinkle-cut beets that looked and tasted as if they had been pulled from a jar or can. As my main, I ordered the supions farcis (squid stuffed with seafood risotto, $15) and was initially very pleased when I sampled the little mound of risotto in the center of my plate, finding it to be creamy and just barely firm. But my pleasure was short-lived, ending the minute I discovered that my squid were not, in fact stuffed with risotto, but rather with undercooked crab meat that had not been properly shelled. Generally, I subscribe to the theory that stuffing anything with crab indicates an alarming insecurity in the quality of the thing being stuffed, and for that reason alone, I would have avoided the dish, had it been accurately represented on the menu. But the biggest disappoinment in this dish was that the squid themselves were very well-grilled and paired with a delicate and lemony beurre blanc-had the chef not substituted poor-quality crab for risotto, this would have been a very successful entrée rather than a nearly inedible disaster. HungryMan's foie de veau aux fines herbes (calf's liver, $15) was not much better. Both the liver and the potato gratin were plagued by a tell-tale dryness that made us suspect that the plate had been cooked and then kept warm for a substantial amount of time before it was served. We both loved the accompanying vegetables- simple sautéed carrots and green beans that were salted perfectly and seasoned with aromatic herbs-and wished that there had been more of them on the plate, especially since the dessicated liver was performing so poorly in its lead role. When we finished our mains, neither of us had the courage to order dessert, mostly out of concern that we'd be let down by another similarly low fidelity reproduction of a French classic. We wish Brasserie 52 had embraced the original plan owners Patrick Lima and Ciro Colantonio described on the restaurant's 2006 rental application and had built a \"French-Brazilian\" restaurant, because there is enough well-executed French technique here to support an appealing cross-cultural culinary experiment. But as a traditional brasserie with aspirations to authenticity, it fails to do more than offer a loose and imprecise representation of France, no matter how hard you squint at the shape it tries to draw. Brasserie 52, 772 9th Avenue (at 52nd Street), 212-586-5005.

Sparrows, Groundhogs and...Fig Rings?

 Traditions rarely survive a diaspora without at least a few changes: sometimes this is because immigrants find themselves in new contexts where they can't replicate their homeland's resources perfectly, so substitutions get made-ask any American who has ever tried making homemade cranberry sauce in Europe. And sometimes, little deformations and mutations occur to celebrate the new country's unique assets, like the Italian feast of St. Joseph, which in Capistrano, California, at least, has become an event more identified with the spectacular annual swallow migration on March 19 than with the patron saint of workers. Since New Yorkers are nowhere near the swallows-nor are most who observe the holiday-other traditions take center stage here. Our favorite, and the most visible of these is the annual arrival of the Sicilian fig ring, a short (in both stature and fat content) pastry, filled with a dense paste of puréed figs and roughly chopped almonds. No, this is not a King Cake, although you'd be forgiven for mistaking them for one another, as they both make their yearly appearance at around the same time of year. Where King Cakes are light and yeasty, a bit like a cinnamon roll, the Sicilian fig ring is squat, with a texture that reminds us of a bar cookie. And no, we don't mean the more famous fig-filled bar cookie that you might be familiar with-the fig ring is sweet without being cloying, tasting subtly of fruity olive oil and floral honey. But it gets even more complicated than this. Some Sicilians refer to their fig rings as cuddureddi (little throats), while yet others insist that a proper cudduredda is a cookie no bigger than a quarter. Then there's the added complication of the guccidatu, another Sicilian fig ring that looks suspiciously like the one you see in our photos, but which is flavored with pine nuts, walnuts, candied fruit, and is only sold as a Christmas pastry (never, ever after the day). And yes, there's even another related pastry, the cuccidatta, a Southern Italian fig cookie that is perplexingly served both at Christmas and at the Feast of San Biagio on February 3. Cuccidatti are smaller versions of even larger cakes called buccelate-also served incongruously both at Christmas and on Groundhog Day (although naturally not in celebration of the little rodents). With all of this in mind, you can imagine our confusion when we walked into the Villabate Bakery in Brooklyn's slowly vanishing Little Italy neighborhood and spotted the cake shown in these photos. We were told simply, \"It's a fig ring.\" And while it was undoubtedly the best fig ring we've ever eaten, we had to know more. A few telephone calls later-all backgrounded with muffled shouting about figs and holidays-and we've got the answer: it's a buccelata. Villabate has them on sale now and throughout March, just in case you're feeling in the holiday spirit-and in keeping with traditions new and old, that means pretty much any holiday. Villabate Bakery, 7171 18th Avenue, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, 718-331-8430.

Jane Spreads Its Wings, Despite Turbulence

 Last weekend was so freakishly warm that even the birds were confused: I swear I saw a spring robin poking around in a green patch of Washington Square Park, searching for a good worm. Like the birds, we normally-hibernating New Yorkers seem to have been transformed by the weather into foragers, and so playing to type, I dragged Dolin, visiting from Washington, D.C., with me on a hunt for some grub. We ended up at Jane, a cute, American restaurant on West Houston Street. Nosher and I have eaten at Jane on several other ocassions, although usually for dinner. We've returned so often because on previous visits, we have had very few major disappointments with the food and service, so when Dolin and I sat down at our table, our expectations were admittedly high. Jane presents itself as a classic American neighborhood bistro, somewhat in the Alice Waters mold, given the menu's implicit focus on seasonal ingredients, yet unlike a number of other restaurants in this tradition, Jane is both unusually approachable and affordable. Yes, there's a maitre d' behind a desk at the door and yes, there is inevitably a model or two hanging around the dining room-this is the edge of SoHo after all-but remarkably, every patron gets the same treatment from the staff, headshots or no. This even-handedness seems embedded in Jane's DNA; even the restaurant's website goes to great pains to emphasize that the place was born out of a desire to create a friendly, unintimidating neighborhood hangout. And it seems to have worked, as one Chowhound discussion about the place dubbed Jane 'the J. Crew of New York restaurants,' perhaps referring to its ability to turn out moderately upscale food without much haughtiness. Such tasteful simplicity translates to the menu as well. Dinner choices range from wild mushroom soup to steak frites and a wide variety of fish (salmon, cod, trout, flounder), and there's even a weekly lobster dinner. At brunch, the options also tend towards homespun classics: steak and eggs, home-made chicken sausage, a country breakfast with cheddar grits, and buttermilk biscuits with gravy. To this are added a few smart touches like bread baskets filled with home-made focaccia and pots of coffee served with small containers of frothy steamed warm milk. Despite the magnitude of Jane's brunchtime temptations, a New Year's Resolution kept my friend Dolin grasping at healthfulness, and she ultimately ordered the egg white omelette ($14), a generously-portioned melange of egg whites, sauteed spinach, and goat cheese. The eggs were well-cooked, and the classic spinach-goat cheese combination worked adequately, but the omelette was practically ruined by being served marooned in a large puddle of water which quickly flooded into the mesclun greens on the other side of Dolin's plate. Because she was hungry, Dolin finished the omelette anyway and just dodged the soggy bits. This was by far the biggest lapse in quality we've seen at Jane in the many times we've visited, and while some of the extra moisture on the plate clearly has to do with the fact that Dolin's omelette was made of only egg whites, there really is no excuse for a soaking wet platter. My Benedict Johnny ($15) was significantly better and much more enjoyable. Variations on the classic Eggs Benedict equation of English muffin, ham, poached egg and hollandaise sauce are a dime a dozen at New York brunch spots, yet it is not often that what's reconceived is the muffin rather than the toppings. At Jane, a perfectly poached egg lies on top of each one of two hefty johnny cakes, both bursting with sweet corn kernels. The johnny cakes' wonderful rough and rustic texture is the perfect complement to the warm, runny yolks and the roasted tomato hollandaise sauce. Snuggled in between the cakes are Jane's much-touted chicken sausages, shaped into thin patties whose savory, peppery bite grabbed my attention away from the sweet corncakes. For a dollar more, I could have ordered a 'Benedict Jane' with crab and crawfish cakes in place of the johnny cakes, spinach instead of sausage, and a hollandaise with a strong spike of tarragon. Not everyone likes Jane for brunch, as the space does fill up quickly on weekends and can become somewhat noisy. In a similar vein, tables can be quite close together, leaving you captive at times to loud conversations of adjoining diners. When the weather is more reliably spring-like, Jane does open up some valuable sidewalk real estate out front, and while sitting outside cuts down on background chatter, it also brings with it the aural competition of Houston Street traffic. Still, if you are lucky enough to score a quiet table in one of the restaurant's less-busy corners and can hunker down over a plate of something that isn't made entirely of egg whites, you might enjoy Jane enough to see it as the rarest of all New York birds: a brunch standby. Jane Restaurant, 100 West Houston Street, between Laguardia Place and Thompson Street. 212-254-7000.

Joy Revision
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-01-12 12:13:00
***CONTENT
 We wanted to hold off before we wrote about the new edition of the American classic, Joy of Cooking, figuring that the real benefit to owning a reference book like Joy is not necessarily immediately apparent from the minute you pick it up-Joy has never been the sort of cookbook that makes a person want to rush home and cook everything in it. Instead, its real value emerges slowly, unfolding as culinary emergencies arise-\"What do I do with this bushel of live blue crabs?\"-or as cravings do-\"It's been years since I've eaten hot cross buns...\" So we took our review copy and put it right into the kitchen. Scribner probably think we've run away with their book, but really, we've been doing our job: actually using it for two months, putting it through its paces right alongside its older sister, the 1997 edition. When that edition of Joy was published, it represented the first major revision to the cookbook in more than twenty years, and while critics universally agreed that a new Joy was necessary, not everyone was pleased with the results. Most notably, Christopher Kimball, Mr. Cook's Illustrated, who bemoaned the lack of...well, joy...in the 1997 revision, calling it \"impersonal,\" \"pedestrian,\" and missing much of the considerable charm that Irma Rombauer brought to the series when she began writing the first Joy in the 1930s. Instead, the 1997 took a more clinical, pedagogical tone and removed many of Rombauer's original, if often peculiar, anecdotes in favor of more carefully phrased directions. Flash forward nearly ten years, and we've suddenly got ourselves another Joy, one that is a little thicker (even with the new typesetting) and much, much folksier. Ethan Becker, the current editor (and grandson of Irma Rombauer), apparently took the earlier criticisms to heart and set out to bring some charm back to the series, mostly through vignettes and well-padded recipe introductions that often feel a bit like extended dance remixes of the original recipes. The Pommes Anna recipe is a perfect example of this: the 1997 recipe is straightforward and clear, while the new edition's recipe seems as if it was rewritten by an advertising copywriter trying to channel John Steinbeck. Not all of the expanded anecdotes are this purple of prose, certainly. But some others, especially the passages where Becker tells huntin' and fishin' stories about his Tennessee mountain ranch, Half Moon Ridge, make the book seem like it might be the perfect kitchen companion for a survivalist or militia leader. The '06/'07 edition also expresses an inexplicable editorial affinity for packaged and processed foods, a fondness that seems atavistic in light of the fact that the 1997 edition put such a strong emphasis on fresh ingredients. As we've cooked with the new Joy for the past few months, we've also started to notice small, unexplained changes to old standby recipes such as the one for Brownies Cockaigne, where the vanilla has been halved for no particular reason. This is the kind of change that, ironically, would make nobody more angry than Christopher Kimball himself, as Kimball is famous for writing verbose, process-oriented recipes that detail why every ingredient and every step of the recipe is the way it is. I wonder, did he notice, or was he too busy admiring the quirky new personality of this year's Joy? As difficult as it is to be critical of such an important American cookbook, we're led to the unfortunate conclusion that unless you think you'll really need the new edition's sections on canning, slow cooker recipes, or game preparation, you may just be better off with a copy of the 1997 edition of the Joy of Cooking-it might be a little less genial than the new book, but we think it's more likely to bring you joy where you most need it: in the kitchen, not on the page.

One thing I was astonished to discover recently is that the 1997 ed. completely ignores frozen desserts; no home-made ice creams, sherbets, gelati, bombes... I no longer have my ancient edition so can't check, but does the new version correct this? Surely these should be in a comprehensive cookbook, no?
Nosher
2007-01-12 23:41:00
Yes, the 1997 edition includes only a recipe for an ice cream cake, whereas the new edition has a very short chapter on frozen desserts (although they cheat and pad the section out by including 'sweet sauces' that were in the 1997 version). I agree with you that the ice cream and gelato entries ought to have been in the earlier edition. Even still, I'll take the squirrel-free book, even without a recipe for sorbet!

I went and had a look at my old copy of Joy and it has a whole section of frozen desserts, on pp 758-769, as well as a variety of sweet sauces in the same section. No Gelatos, though. The latest copyright in the book is 1975. I don't use the book much because I find the recipes often need to have the sugar or salt cut, or give instructions that encourage overcooking.
Nosher
2007-01-13 04:13:00
Larry, yes, the older ones did. There was an editorial decision in the mid-90's to remove the frozen desserts section from the upcoming book. The 1975 and 1963 editions have the section though, as does the newest book. I think you'll find that the 1997 edition reduced sugar (and salt in some places), so it might be worth a peek.

[...] For the party, I made Indian Pudding, because I love it. Other people made Chicken with Fruit, Meatloaf, and a whole array of dishes. As someone at the party remarked, there weren't a lot of greens on the table. And it was true. But Joy of Cooking was never necessarily about eating healthy food. It was about good-tasting, simple food. [...]

Totto. Totally.

***CONTENT
 Ask a daring diner for his/her top ten list of riskiest dishes, and you're likely to hear about the joys and dangers of raw nettle leaves, blowfish meat (fugu), freshly foraged wild mushrooms, and the benign-sounding but potentially deadly chicken. Raw chicken, to be specific-because in the wrong hands, it's a potential killer. Uncooked poultry is also the reason these selfsame gustatory thrill seekers know about Yakitori Totto, an ultra-authentic Japanese grill restaurant in Midtown West. But the famous chicken sashimi, served here with a hygienic precision that might make an internist self-conscious, is, quite honestly, a distraction from the rest of the menu. Ignore it and just think of Yakitori Totto as a traditional Japanese grill, one whose paper screens, long lacquered dining bar, and nearly completely Japanese clientele lend it a transportative charm that might just make you forget that you're on the second floor of a Manhattan walkup. But focus, because we're ready to commit this to writing: Yakitori Totto is the best grill restaurant in town. I'd call it an izakaya, but Totto is more refined than most izakayas in the city-most notably, there's no incipient sense that everyone who walks in the door will leave the restaurant so trolleyed that they can barely stand. Instead, from the instant you see how Totto's patrons watch the grill masters at work, you get the feeling that everyone is aware that too much sake or beer might dull the tastebuds, and so they carefully maintain enough sobriety to really enjoy their food. It is impossible to find fault with this attitude when virtually everything the restaurant serves is delicious. Chopper, HungryMan and I stopped in to eat dinner, take some photos and sample a few skewers, but instead wound up spreading our Totto experience over two days of noshing and 20 different dishes. On our first visit (when we took pictures of what we ate), we ordered 18 small plates, two shochu drinks and one order of Harushika (junmai) sake and sat in amazement when we saw that our bill came to only $93. At about $40 a head after adding a tip, a meal at Totto might just be the culinary bargain of the year- and it's only mid-January. As much as we'd love to write about each of the twenty items we ate over the course of two visits, we've created a Flickr photostream of the meal and took the editorial liberty of focusing on a few of the biggest highlights of our meal here, even though we do believe that every one of the dishes (except perhaps the slightly dry asparagus skewer) deserves a paragraph of its own. Two of our very favorite items, the grilled eggplant rounds and the seaweed salad (both pictured above) put to rest any concerns we might have had about bringing a vegetarian to Yakitori Totto- these dishes were not only meatless, they were superb. The eggplant slices were delicately soft and savory, slathered on their tops with a sweet ponzu sauce and a few sprinkled sesame seeds. Our Kaiso seaweed salad was also a sweet-savory combination, but in this case, three different types of briny seaweed were marinated in a mirin-umeboshi (Japanese salted plum) dressing with thin slivers of onion and half-moons of cucumber. I have rarely experienced such a complex flavor profile in a salad, and never before in one with seaweed as its primary ingredient, but now I can't stop thinking about it. We ate the seaweed salad as a sort of palate cleanser to prepare us to make the transition from tofu skewers and tofu salad into the realm of the chicken-Yakitori Totto's claim to fame. Both HungryMan and Chopper agreed that the chicken meatball, a skewer made of ground white chicken meat was the best of the chicken dishes, with or without the side order of a raw quail egg for dipping. But HungryMan, in particular, also fell in love with the marinated chicken liver skewer as well as the crispy fried chicken skin skewer. As he ate the liver, he rolled his head back and compared it to \"a sweet, smoky foie gras.\" On most of our grilled dishes-the chicken livers included- we opted for a ponzu sauce marinade, but diners can also choose a simple Okinawan sea salt seasoning, which is absolutely just as good, if much simpler-tasting. My own favorite dish at Yakitori Totto is not a grilled item, but an unusual chimera that crosses a salad, a gumbo, and a seafood stew. Nebaneba is a thick, soup-like concoction made of fresh, crisp chopped okra, sliced sticky seaweed, Japanese yam, miniature sardines, and soy sauce-and it's served ice-cold. It is like nothing I have ever tasted in my life, with flavors and textures that reminded me alternately of gazpacho and bouillabaisse, then tomatillo salsa and cucumber soup. Chicken sashimi might get all the attention, but nebaneba is the real Jennifer Hudson here. That's not to say that the other dishes we ate weren't similarly fantastic-I don't think we've eaten a meal this consistently good in the past six months. And to help you get a better sense of how true this is, you may want to pay a visit to our Yakitori Totto Flickr photostream. One quick word of warning: there seems to be a prankster at Totto, one who likes to flip the sign on the front door to read 'Closed,' when the restaurant is quite definitely open, as he/she has done on each of the last three times we've visited. Maybe, despite the little bowls of salt on either side of the staircase, there's a mischievous poltergeist in the vestibule- one who wants to horde the ponzu-dipped chicken breast skewers for himself. But ignore the sign and try the door-the food is too phenomenal to let a thing like a little shenanigan keep you away. Yakitori Totto, 251 West 55th Street (between 7th and 8th Avenues), 212-245-4555.

Did you try the chicken tail? Like the NYT review said, it's pure molten fat...delicious. Keep up the good work, guys-I love your site, particularly because you: 1) List menu prices (sometimes not on Menupages, or outdated) 2) Post photos (it's wonderful to know what and how much one will be getting!)

Chagrined, thanks for the kind words. No, we didn't have the tail, although we have heard some great things about it. As for menu prices, we try to include them whenever we can, but sometimes we don't list them, as we'd rather have them be accurate than hazard a guess if we don't have notes on them. But in the case of Totto, it's easy: most grill items are $2-4, and salads go up to $8 or so. I wish it were always that simple!

Nebaneba is the name of the dish and it's the general term used to describe that slimy texture of things like natto, okra, grated yamaimo, and certain seaweeds, among other things. Many Japanese folks in NYC enjoy Totto, but the general comment seems to be that it's pricy for what it is, not the bargain you claim. I always feel I don't get my money's worth when I go there, but then, I've been eating this stuff for a long time, and I guess that's to be expected for NYC prices.
Nosher
2007-01-19 16:46:00
Eric, I think you're right that it's all about context. But it's interesting that you say that you've heard people comment that Totto is expensive-I've never heard Totto criticized for its prices-just the opposite, in fact. Sure, you could claim it's street food and should therefore be dirt cheap, but I've only ever seen great care and precision taken at Totto-something I wouldn't trust a street vendor to take. And if that means that my skewers cost $2 or $3 on average, I think that's a fair trade. How great to know that 'nebaneba' also describes natto, one of my other favorite Japanese foods. I'm on a quest to convert at least one of my dining companions to the joys of the 'mozzarella of soybeans'. No luck so far though.

2006 Retrospective Part II

 2006 is fading into memory like a Proustian madeleine, or perhaps more aptly, like last weekend's holiday leftovers, so before we leave it behind for good, here are a few final thoughts on the year, as we get ready to uncork the 2007-vintage Nosh: Our Favorite Nosh-Related Happening of 2006 We were surprised and really delighted that a walk through midtown could have resulted in a rediscovery of long-vanished restaurant and elicit such strong responses from readers of the site. Our 'Urban Archaelogy' post dug up more than just the remaining ephemera of old Schrafft's locations around the city; it brought out all kinds of stories from visitors to our site, some who were brought to Schrafft's as children on special occasions, and a few who recalled desserts like Schrafft's fruit cake, candy or other signature dishes like chicken a la king- a dish now rarely seen. We have gotten more e-mails inspired by this post than any other. Moreover, that post is still among our most popular and most linked-to. It seems to be a reminder that, even with the opening of one trendy small-plate restaurant after another, there is still a yearning in New York for a restaurant that offers simple, homestyle cooking without being self-consciously labelled as 'comfort food.' Our Favorite Yet-Unreviewed Food Item These amazingly chewy Thai pineapple cookies (officially Thai pineapple biscuits, pictured above) that we found at Thailand's Center Point, just steps away from lemongrass juggernaut Sripaphai in Woodside, Queens. These confections have a layer of sweet, sticky pineapple paste spread between two subtly sweetened, crisp cookie rings, and they demand to be eaten by the fistful. Why would we write about them and endanger our supply? Call it a New Year's resolution to share a little more of our grocery shopping bounty with you in '07. Just leave a few boxes for us. Worst Nosh Experience of 2006 Our friend's pizza delivery debacle, courtesy of Fat Sal's in Hell's Kitchen this April. We still can't believe a delivery person would stoop to attempt urinating in someone's hallway because he didn't realize he'd been tipped through SeamlessWeb, but we saw it happen. Our post about the incident, 'When Pizza Delivery Goes Wrong - Horribly, Horribly Wrong,' provides all the gory details of both pizza and forced watersports; it's perhaps more depressing to think that Fat Sal's is still in business and worse-that we've since seen the same delivery guy around the neighborhood. It's almost enought to turn us off to pizza. Well, nearly. Our Biggest Food-Related Disappointment That Dylan's Candy Bar will no longer be selling Valomilk candy cups in Gotham. We were informed by Russ Sifers, the owner of the company that makes the treats that Dylan's Candy Bar- the only outet in the city with a direct relationship with the manufacturer- has not re-ordered Valomilks for 2007. New Yorkers looking for gooey marshmallow centers in their chocolates will have to go the direct route to ordering a case or seven- or worse, console themselves with the decidely second-rate Idaho Spud. We're considering a Norma Rae-style intervention. But most of all, thanks to you for making our 2006 so wonderful. Here's to more and better nosh in 2007!

Tarallucci e Vino with a Late Lunch Crowd of Our Own
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2007-01-01 21:48:00
***CONTENT
 Lunchtime is difficult enough when you're accompanied by a gaggle of friends and relatives, but when two of them are vegetarians and one of them is a very...ahem...choosy nine year-old child, finding an appropriate place to eat is about as much fun as doing your taxes. But it's not impossible. When our little crowd made the decision to forage for food as we left Books of Wonder on 18th Street and Fifth Avenue, we had one perfect solution: City Bakery. Sadly, the realities of the C.B. at 2:30 p.m. confronted us immediately when we couldn't find a table big enough for three people, nevermind six. So we struck out again and wound up at the northern branch of di Giacomo and di Pietro's Tarallucci e Vino, a coffee bar-cum-enoteca that has garnered considerable attention since it opened last year at around this time of year. We figured the small-plate menu would suit our lunchtime noshing needs just fine, and the added promise of a glass of wine made me, in particular, smile. Those among us with restricted diets ordered bowls of the restaurant's special Tomato Ricotta Soup ($7), a super-creamy, gently acidic concoction. It was even better when sopped up with a few of the thick slices of Italian bread the restaurant serves. HungryMom and HungryMan both thought this was the highlight of the meal, even though as we continued to eat, we started to suspect that all the good tomatoes in the kitchen had gone into the pot to make this soup. Melon and I ordered the Octopus, Potatoes, Celery and Plum Tomato Salad ($9), to the great dismay of MiniNosh, who (predictably for a nine year-old), grimaced and asked, \"Is that real octopus?\" We assured her it was, at which point she became mesmerized watching us fork bites of it into our mouth. I wish the salad had been a little better, so that I could have encouraged her to have her first octopus experience right there and then. Unfortunately, the polpetti were not uniformly well-cooked: some pieces were perfectly soft and tender, while others were actually undercooked- something we've rarely seen in New York (restaurants commonly overcook, but rarely undercook squid and octopus). The plum tomatoes here were also puzzlingly pale and mealy, a strange bedrock for a salad that contained some exquisitely savory cubes of soft potato and flavorful roughly diced celery. Melon suggested that the salad would have been improved greatly had the tomatoes just been left out of the dish, and she's right. I would have been ashamed to serve those tomatoes in my apartment, let alone to a roomful of paying customers. The greens in HungryMan's Tagiatelle al Grano Saraceno con Cime di Rapa e Funghi (Buckwheat pasta with broccoli rabe and shiitake mushrooms, $12) were far better, tasting fresh and just faintly crunchy-perfect for broccoli rabe. But the flavors in this dish were muted, which worked well to bring out the subtle maltiness of the buckwheat noodles, but was a liabilty for the dish as a whole, as it was rather bland and quickly became a chore to eat after the first few bites. There were a few rare flecks of garlic here and there throughout the dish, but not enough to prevent the pasta from acquiring an unfortunate overall blandness that reminded us of hospital food. What's worse is that the lack of flavor in the pasta was emphasized when it was eaten while drinking a glass of wine. Dolin fared better with her choice: the Salmon, Spinach and Onion Quiche ($5.95), a coaster-sized cooked tart dotted with large chunks of smoked salmon. We enjoyed the pastry, which was flaky without being too greasy, as well as the combination of savory flavors in the filling. One quiche is perhaps a little too small for a full meal, but as they are some of the cheapest items on the menu, ordering two of them isn't too expensive. We also were pleasantly surprised by the simple mesclun salad accompaniment, which was dressed in some of the best vinaigrette we've had in an Italian restaurant in months. It should come as no surprise that the baked dishes were among the best of our meal, given Tarallucci e Vino's roots as a coffee and pastry café in the East Village. But because so much of the menu does not feature baked items, we'd like to see the kitchen refocus its attention a bit to ensure that everything the restaurant creates is as high-quality as the quiche and the tomato soup. There's really no excuse for pale, tasteless tomatoes and underseasoned pasta in a restaurant that charges $9-12 for small plates, especially when the food is served in a dining room as inviting as this one, with its large, rustic dining tables and backless wood stools. And really, all of the elements are here to make Tarallucci e Vino something special, right down to its knowlegeable servers to generous wine pouring policy; all it needs are a few surgical tweaks behind the kitchen doors. Tarallucci e Vino, 15 E. 18th Street between Broadway and Fifth Avenues, 212-228-5400.

***CONTENT
 December is drawing to a close, and-no surprise-we've been thinking a lot about eating. More precisely, food that we've eaten in 2006. We've had some wonderful nosh in restaurants, cooked up several new recipes, and have of course mourned the loss of a few of our old favorite eateries in NYC. Just as we did last year, we took part in Eater's annual Year in Eater poll, and we've reprinted our responses-complete with links to our reviews, so that you can see why we loved...and sometimes loathed what we did this year. 1. TOP 3 RESTAURANT NEWCOMERS OF THE YEAR? Our top restaurant newcomers are Kyotofu, Bocca Lupo, and Prosperity Dumpling. 2. TOP 3 RESTAURANT STANDBYS OF THE YEAR? This year's standbys are Gennaro, Mary's Fish Camp-we think that in 2006, it has finally started to outpace its mother restaurant on a consistent basis, and Via Emilia (although considering its newly re-opened status, it could also count as a newcomer). 3. NYC MEAL OF THE YEAR (GOOD OR BAD) FOR 2006? We've got two meals of the year, one high-church, one low-church: the first is our recent autumn dinner at Cru, if only for the rock shrimp salad and the saffron cioppino pasta; the second happened after a spur-of-the-moment decision to detour our taxi from JFK to swing by the East Village so that we could make a visit to Otafuku after being okonomiyaki-less in Egypt for a week. Bonito and shredded yam have never tasted so good. 4. BIGGEST NYC DINING SURPRISE IN 2006? Our biggest shock? That Bamn! could garner so much positive buzz while managing to serve some insufferably awful food. 5. IF YOU COULD ONLY HAVE EATEN IN ONE NYC NEIGHBORHOOD IN 2006, WHICH ONE WOULD IT HAVE BEEN? ANY GUESSES WHICH ONE IT WILL BE FOR 2007? It's a toss-up, but we'll go with our home turf this year: The H.K. (Hell's Kitchen, of course) With the opening of Whym, Roberto Passon, and Kyotofu, there's even more high-quality nosh here than ever before. We'd like to think this is the beginning of a trend that will continue well into 2007.

The Deep and the Stuffed, Chicago-style

 Sixteen years ago, Chicago-style pizza saved my life. At the time, I was working as a graduate student (aka laboratory slave) in one of the Windy City's famous universities, spending my days trying to make proteins fold and unfold, and my nights exploring Chicago's ethnic neighborhoods on the world's tightest budget. In February, I ran out of money so uttery and completely that all I had to my name was my train pass and a twenty-pound tub of cranberry granola that a friend had given me as a birthday gift. So every day at the lunch and dinner hour, I took to visiting the university's central bulletin board, looking for lecture and reception announcements marked with the keywords 'refreshments,' 'wine,' 'snacks,' or best of all, 'pizza.' I am ashamed to admit that my polestar was free food, not academic interest. So it was that I, a biochemistry graduate student, found myself attending talks on Aphra Behn's seventeenth century feminism(s), debates on whether or not quarks and bosons were hypercharged particles, and my favorite: an Egyptology roundtable where I found myself unexpectedly thrust into the position of having to weigh in on the evidence that the ancient Nazcans flew around in hot air balloons. Technically, the food afterwards was free, but I'd argue that I paid for it all in chutzpah. And so that year, I kept myself alive by consuming far more than my fair share of the university's favorite reception food, Chicago-style pizza, and along the way coming to the life-changing realization that I wanted to study more than just protein chemistry. More than a decade later, I still have dreams about massively thick slices of pan pizza, only to awaken and find myself in a city that worships at the altar of the thin crust. The only local option is Pizzeria Uno, a chain that is routinely criticized by gastronomes for its inauthentic execution of the Chicag0-style pie, and one that tellingly only runs four restaurants in the entire Chicagoland metropolitan area. So when I came down with an acute case of a deep-pan craving recently, I started doing a little investigating and found that several Illinois pizzerias have begun selling par-baked pizzas and shipping them to customers around the country. HungryMan and I contacted a few of them and asked them to send us what they thought was most representative of their mail-order product line. Two restaurants, and not coincidentally, two of the biggest guns in the Chicago-style pizza lineup: Lou Malnati's and Giordano's, sent four-packs of their pizzas for us to taste. In the interest of full disclosure and ethical reviewing, we warned them in advance that we would only include their pizzas in our round-up if we liked them, which is our general policy for anything we receive that we do not pay for. HungryMan and I gathered together a tasting panel comprised of the two of us, our nine year-old niece MiniNosh, and our friend Chilena, who once worked for Pizzeria Uno. Very fortunately, we enjoyed both shipments of pizzas we were sent, perhaps in part because they were substantially different from one another. The Chicago-style genre isn't monolithic: pizzas in this category can be simply tall, deep-dish pies, or they can be double-crusted, or 'stuffed' pies that sandwich their fillings between two layers of dough. Lou Malnati's specializes in the former type, placing its focus on creating a buttery crust that crisps on the sides and bottom as the pizza cooks. Giordano's, on the other hand, is the home of the stuffed pizza, concocting pies that sometimes weigh several pounds apiece. Pie size varied considerably- the Lou Malnati's pies were nine inches wide and provided enough food for two hungry people. The Giordano's pies, on the other hand, were twelve inches across, offering at least enough food for three adults- four if they're not ravenous. Among the eight pizzas we tasted, we had three clear favorites. My vote went to the Giordano's spinach pie (pictured in the top paragraph), loaded with what tasted like an entire salad. This is a pie not for the faint of heart- it is for people who really, truly love spinach. Think of it more as a spinach pesto pizza and you'll get the idea. The crust on this pie tasted a bit like the chewy, slightly crisped end of a piece of a baguette, while an extra layer of dough covering the top of the pie (underneath the sauce) holds in steam as the pie cooks, causing the inside of the pizza to become gooey and runny with mozzarella cheese and roughly minced garlic. HungryMan and Chilena both fell in love with the Lou Malnati's vegetarian pie. Because the Lou Malnati's pies are smaller, the two of them managed to eat nearly the whole thing, even while managing to taste the other pizzas. Although this pie features three vegetable toppings: green peppers, mushrooms, and onions, we all thought the green pepper dominated the other flavors, but this was not a liability, because in combination with the sweet tomato sauce on this pie, the vegetal green pepper worked very well. All of us also loved the fact that the sauce on this pizza was not only chunky, it contained an entire half-tomato embedded in the center of the pie. Vegetarian, indeed. MiniNosh found a personal favorite in the Lou Malnati's cheese pizza, and all of us placed this pie in second place on our lists. The bottom crust here was almost crunchy, making eating this pizza quite a bit like eating wedges of cheesy garlic bread made with light focaccia. It wasn't a typical pizza- MiniNosh exclaimed, \"This is pizza? It's not like the pizza I'm used to...but I like it.\" We agreed completely. After baking eight flash-frozen pizzas, we've learned a few things about partial-cooking: (1) When the directions say to put the pizza in the middle of the oven, do it, even if it means taking a few extra minutes to figure out where the exact center is- too close to the lower element and the bottom will burn, too close to the top and the crust will burn; (2) These pizzas (especially the Giordano's monsters) are dense, so it is worth the extra time to cook the par-baked pizzas longer on a lower temperature. So if the package suggests 20 minutes at 425° F, try 30 minutes at 400° F or 375° F; (3) If you like a bit of brown (or even black) on your pizza crust, as we do, you can really crisp up the top of the pizzas if you hit them with a few seconds under the broiler, as both Giordano's and Lou Malnati's ship their pizzas with instructions that will produce hot, but only slightly browned edges. In the final analysis, we're calling this showdown a draw. We give the edge to Lou Malnati's for pricing: four pizzas cost about $70, including shipping, while four Giordano's pies will run you about $129. However, keep in mind that the Giordano's pizzas are heavier and thicker, so they'll feed more people. Both restaurants make all the pies by hand in their restaurants and ship them in a dry-ice packed styrofoam cooler, via Federal Express or UPS Next Day Air. Pizzas from either restaurant would make perfect party food for a New Year's Eve bash, and if you order a few extra pies, you can keep them in the freezer...just in case you ever find yourself in a pinch and without a catered astrophysics lecture to crash.

Celeste Minus Carmine = Fiasco Napoletano

***CONTENT
 Customs agents all three of the New York metropolitan airports must be on high alert for Celeste manager and co-owner Carmine Mitroni to return from one of his regular visits home to Naples; after all, nearly every published review of the restaurant mentions his very hands-on approach to importing his favorite cheeses. We've certainly been the beneficiaries of his alleged unique intercontinental shipping methods, as we've sat nibblng on rare Italian cheeses late on a weekday evening, listening to Carmine describe dairy microclimates in his polenta-thick accent. The man absolutely knows his stuff, and there's no doubt that his cheese courses are easily among the very finest in the city. Carmine also runs his restaurant with an orchestral precision, overseeing every aspect of the experience and often hovering between the kitchen and the dining room, ready to move in either direction, should he be needed. And in a popular restaurant that is, generously, the size of a studio apartment even with the recent addition of four tables (ten seats) to the enclosed sidewalk patio, there is quite a bit of potential for chaos. Yet somehow, Mr. Mitroni's charm and watchful oversight manage to keep diners from feeling as if they are eating at cutting board-sized tables crammed into an airplane's coach class cabin. Unless, as we discovered on our last two visits to Celeste, Carmine is away, and in that case, a new species of entropy reigns in both the kitchen and dining room alike. Our most recent visit began with the inauspicious shattering of a water glass on the floor in between our table and the adjacent table three inches away. The busboy responsible for the incident mopped up most of the water and picked up the large shards of glass, but HungryMan and I both felt an unsettling amount of crunching underfoot as we took our seats. Worse, not two minutes after sitting down, HungryMan himself knocked another glass into the very same spot. When nobody came to pick up any but the biggest slivers, we both looked wide-eyed to one another and said aloud, \"Oh no. Do you think Carmine is in Italy?!\" Indeed, he was. What followed was, to be frank, some of the most amateurish and laughingly terrible table service we've witnessed in a long time. We had the wrong food delivered to our table twice, were bumped and knocked during one server's repeated double-speed delivery of hot plates, and at one point after our appetizer dishes were cleared, were asked, \"Would you like dessert?\" Speaking with other people about their Celeste experiences, we've found that Dr. Jeckyl and Mr. Hyde service experiences are pretty common at Celeste, and the key element of difference between the two is Carmine. Cooking, on the other hand, doesn't seem to vary much, with or without Senor Mitroni in the watchtower- it is consistently terrific, with just a few little problems. HungryMan started our dinner last week with the Fegatini di Pollo (sautéed chicken livers in a balsamic reduction, $7.00), one of his favorite dishes at Celeste. The livers are cooked so that they are soft and so buttery that they spread across the bread like nutella. In particular, the sweet, acidic sauce pairs wonderfully with the flinty livers. Sometimes the livers are a bit over-sauced (as they were here), but even then, eating them simply requires avoiding the surplus pools of balsamic reduction. My starter, the Spinaci, Mele e Noci ($7.50) was a very simple salad of baby spinach leaves, thinly sliced apples, pecorino romano shavings, and chopped walnuts, all dressed with a light, slightly vegetal olive oil and lemon juice. This, I realized as I ate the salad, was what I missed most during 2006's spinach scare. As good as Celeste's salads are, I only order them as a light precursor to a heavier main dish, and especially if I'm in the mood for something from the Fritti (fried food) section of the menu. Literally everything in this category is excellent, from the fried artichoke to the gooey fried buffalo ricotta balls, but my personal favorite is the Fritto Misto di Pesce ($9.00), a combination platter of batter-dipped whole red snapper, sweet prawns, and calamari. This is what true Neopolitan frying is all about: fresh ingredients dredged in a pale batter of flour, eggs, and white wine and flash-fried the instant before they are served. It's enough to make you think you're in Campania. The homemade pastas are pretty amazing, as well. Our favorite, and the dish that HungryMan ordered during this meal, is the Tagliatelle con Gambieri e Verza (egg pasta with shrimp and sautéed cabbage, $9.50). Pasta and cabbage might not sound like the most natural combination, but it is a regional specialty, and with winter cabbage just now in season, it is the perfect time of year to order this dish. Additionally, a significant contributor to this dish's success is the velvety, fresh pasta. Celeste makes a few kinds of fresh pastas every day, so unless you're unadventurously wedded to the idea of eating spaghetti, try the homemade stuff; you won't be sorry. Nor will you be sorry if you skip dessert and go straight for the cheese course. We love tiramisu as much as anyone, but the real late-stage dinner treasure at Celeste is the cheese plate. $10 for five thumb-length slices of cheese might not sound like a bargain, but once you hear Mitroni talk in loving tones about their provenance, it becomes clear that Celeste's is a cheese collection that has been curated as carefully as any exhibit at the MoMA. I don't know if I buy the stories about him smuggling wedges of provola affumicata di bufala in his laptop bag, but I do firmly believe that few people in New York think more about cheese than Carmine Mitroni, and I'd venture that nobody thinks more about Italian cheeses than he does. However, in the hands of his employees, the cheese course misses a crucial element: expertise. We were told by our server that the cheeses were \"brought over by the owner...but I don't know what they are.\" The staff was all brought in to consult on the perplexing cheese plate, with one insisting that the honey was \"orange blossom and red onion\" and the brown compote was \"raisins or something.\" (For the record, the red onions were in the chutney...no raisins.) It's not much of a stretch to imagine that Carmine would have been appalled at this mixup, even if the cheese itself did taste gorgeous. Our plan for future visits- one we recommend wholeheartedly to you- is to peek into Celeste before we put ourselves on the inevitable waiting list for a table. If Carmine is in the house (and for the record, he's a broad, middle-aged man), we'll stay. If the oldest staffer in the place is under 40, we'll try again another day. Call it a cult of personality if you will, but when the quality of a dinner pivots so crucially on the presence of one man, we are more than willing to postpone a visit until he unpacks his suitcases and returns to restock the larder. Celeste, 502 Amsterdam Avenue (between 84th and 85th Streets), 212-874-4559.

Mmmm! I've been craving Celeste for weeks. My mother is in town for another week and we must go. I do agree that a Carmine-less evening is generally somewhat subpar. Granted, the place isn't exactly the most service-oriented restaurant in town, but, as you say, especially with regard to the cheese, Carmine is essential. They essentially refused to do the largest cheese plate for us once because he wasn't there and they didn't know what to serve/pair. That all being said, it's one of my favourite places to eat in the city.

Just curious, do you know where Carmine's other restaurants are? He was complaining to us around Christmas how busy he was with the other places - but I never got a chance to ask him.

 We've made no bones about our great admiration for Kenny Shopsin- we've been going to his restaurants for nearly two decades now, and when the documentary about him and his family was released earlier this year, we were among the first in line for tickets. Shopsin's has become as much a part of our New York City as the subway, the Flatiron Building, or the Hudson River. Which is why it pains us to share with you a little confirmatory news that we got in our inbox this morning, right from Kenny himself: Yes we are closed for good. You should read this sentence with emphasis on the last word. My family and I have a strong sense that there is an art to staying small, and humble. Our departure is a happy event meant to continue the success we have shared with you and our other friends. See you at Essex. Ken. Oh, we'll be there. I just hope the Jalapeno Cheese Grits make the trip.

The Santa Cohen Finds a Perfect Season

***CONTENT
 When Manhattan temperatures reach 60 °F in the middle of December, it's hard to get excited about twinkly light displays and potato pancakes. One recurring topic of conversation at the Noshpad these days is how absolutely unseasonable this holiday time seems- we're not sure whether we should be pulling out our short sleeves, our stockings, or our dreidels. But if the past few years in New York have taught us anything, it's that finding enjoyment in this city involves embracing your context: if it's humid and sweltering, find the Coco Helado vendor; if the subway system is shut down for a strike, rediscover the joys of your own neighborhood; and if this week feels more like Georgia than Gotham outside, well...eat your gingerbread cookies al fresco. The mismatch between weather and holidays also makes me think fondly of my childhood neighbors, the Sterns, a family that was, at every turn, eager to mix and match cultural influences to maximize their children's joy. My first exposure to their ecumenical approach to holiday celebrations came when I was six years old, when I wandered into their dining room and saw what looked to be suspiciously like a tiny decorated Christmas tree sitting on the same table as the Sterns' silver menorah. I was perplexed, but I didn't have to wait long for an explanation, as Sharon (Mrs. Stern) came through and very casually said, \"Oh, I'm sure you're wondering about the tree. Don't worry, dear. It's not for us, it's for Santa Cohen. He likes it if we have one.\" I was familiar with Santa Claus, but not this Santa Cohen person. Had I heard correctly? Cohen? Anticipating all of my follow-up questions, Sharon sat me down and gave me the full story of Mr. Claus's Jewish cousin, Mr. Cohen. If I recall correctly, both Santas share a very big house and elf-powered workshop in the North Pole and deliver gifts to children: Cohen to the young Jews on Chanukkah, and Claus to the young Gentiles on Christmas. The arrangement works out fine for both, although Santa Cohen has to do much more work every year, as he drives his sleigh across the globe not once, but eight times in eight days. This also explains why Cohen is a trim, svelte man, while Claus is...ahem, a little zaftig. Most years, the Santas share reindeer, since Chanukkah and Christmas don't often intersect on the calendar, but once in a while, Santa Cohen has to make other plans (since the reindeer are officially registered to Claus) and is forced to visit the North Pole branch of Rent-a-Reindeer, which is unfortunately stocked with quite a few subpar sleigh-pullers. Usually, it is poor, put-upon Mrs. Cohen who ends up with the job of collecting the reindeer from the rental agency, since Santa Cohen is usually out in the fields, helping Santa Claus plant next year's pine trees, because secretly, it's Santa Cohen who has the green thumb. And that is why Mrs. Stern likes to have a little tree- just to show Santa Cohen that she knows who's really responsible for the season's greenery. So in honor of our favorite cultural pastiche, we present a drink with a bit of an identity crisis, a drink with a cross-section of seasonal flavors: green apple, juniper, cranberry, and orange. The most unusual ingredient, the green apple juice, comes from Eastern & Central Europe (Hungary or Bulgaria) and is available now (and will keep throughout the year) from Amish Markets ($2.49/quart), as well as from some international supermarkets. If you own a juicer, you can also just make your own, of course. Just don't substitute plain apple juice for the green apple juice, not only because the colors will change, but because the gentle tartness of the green apples is absent in red apple juice. (If you must substitute, do so with 5 ounces of fresh apple cider and 1 ounce of lemon juice.) When shaken over ice, somehow-dare we say miraculously?-all the aromatics and essences combine to make a cocktail that not only tastes delicious, but that also seems to fit 2006 and its unseasonable winter just about perfectly. No tree required. The Santa Cohen 2 scant measures (2 ounces) good gin 1/2 measure (1 ounce) Cointreau (or Grand Marnier) 6 ounces green apple juice (not cider or regular apple juice) dried cranberries Combine wet ingredients in ice-filled cocktail shaker. Shake vigorously. Strain and pour over dried cranberries sprinkled into martini glasses. Makes 2 cocktails. 2006 nycnosh.com

The Tastes of Potential at Amazing 66

2006-12-13 22:54:00
***CONTENT
 Well-wishers beware: friends of the new Amazing 66 restaurant on Mott Street have set quite a standard for beneficence. From the hip-high clusters of gift baskets and flower arrangements so plentiful that they spill out of the dining room and down the stairs, decorating the entire width of the sidewalk in front of the shop, to the dozens upon dozens of orchids and ribbons festooning the entrance: we got the opening night message loud and clear-plenty of people want to see this restaurant succeed. And while hundreds of people appear to have sent gifts, we were surprised to find Amazing 66's dining room still more than half empty on its official grand opening night. Nevertheless, we were greeted with big smiles by the manager and told, \"Welcome! It's our first official night. Sorry about the flowers, but we have lots of friends.\" Clearly. She then led us to a table and gave us two menus, explaining that the restaurant's focus is on Cantonese cooking, but with inventive twists. Fittingly, she then returned to the front desk to sign for yet another incoming bouquet. As we scoured both menus- one for specials, one for permanent offerings- we noticed right away that several appealing dishes we saw on our way in were not listed. Chinese restaurants often get a bad rap for menu apartheid: Chinese customers get one menu, while non-Chinese patrons are offered another, usually less spicy and less adventurous, version. However, we've been told by chefs at some of these establishments that often, it isn't so much that there is a second menu, as that the kitchen staff is willing to cook off-menu items for patrons who know what they want. And when we asked one of our five waiters for the evening (they kept swapping off, course by course, dish by dish) about the particularly appetizing baby bok choi we spotted, he announced, \"It's not on the menu. But we'll make it if you want it. It's delicious.\" So we took him up on the offer, all the while thinking how strange it was that a newly-opened restaurant already had diners cobbling together their own meals off-menu. Regardless, he wasn't wrong about the baby bok choi ($9.50). It was excellent, and quite easily the best thing we ate at Amazing 66. Each of the matchbook-sized heads of bok choi were brilliant green and tender at the tip, while still just a bit crunchy at the base. The sauce was very simple: just minced garlic, soy, and a little vinegar, but it was the ideal accompaniment to the fresh greenness of the little cabbages. This should be added to the menu, STAT. Our other appetizer, the stuffed conch ($5.50) was listed in the chef's special menu that night. Our (new) waiter described it to us as chopped conch meat baked with oil inside the conch shell. And while this wasn't a misleading précis of the dish, we didn't expect that it was an actual list of every single one of the ingredients, save one: smoked pork. The result was a messy, chewy stew of sorts-as the shell is baked in a very hot oven, the juices from the conch meat filter down through a layer of smoked pork and pool in the bowl of the conch chamber. As much as I adore pure, fresh seafood that is cooked with as little adulteration as possible, this dish lacked depth of flavor and complexity. It wasn't much more than a rubbery and bland chowder. I kept looking longingly at the sprig of parsley laid atop the shell as garnish and thinking that the whole dish might have been saved, had the chef just chopped up a bit of it and mixed it into the conch meat. But it certainly was beautiful, even despite the fact that it was served in a disposable aluminum baking cup. HungryMan opted to go off-menu once again with his choice of the Fried Shrimp with Chili and Spiced Salt ($13.95). There is a close cousin of this dish on the permanent menu (substituting squid for shrimp), but when we saw a nearby party noshing on fat, juicy prawns, we knew we had to give them a try. What arrived at the table was a very hot, very ample serving of large, golden shrimp- so far, so good. But someone must have tipped off the kitchen that we weren't Chinese, because there were no more than six or seven tiny slices of green chili on the entire platter. Just to be sure, we stole a glance at our neighbor's dish and saw that their shrimps were liberally sprinkled with the hot stuff, and unfortunately, without plenty of chili slices, this dish falls flat. Yes, the spiced salt is lovely, but without the high-note heat from the green chilis, this dish isn't radically different from what you might find on the menu at your local Popeye's. Despite our disappointment, HungryMan and I both held out great hopes for one of the permanent menu's more creative-sounding offerings: the Honey and Peach with Fish Cubes ($16.50). Reassured by yet another new waiter that the 'fish cubes' in question were really just large chunks of boneless striped bass meat, we decided to order it; after all, we wanted to see some of that innovative cooking that the manager had mentioned as we were seated. Visually, the dish was a great success, with pieces of red and green pepper, quartered onions, and wok-seared peapods. But the peaches... oh the peaches. Our suspicions began the very instant we spotted their garish yellow hemispheres on the platter. Could they be? Then we tasted the tell-tale metallic sweetness of kindergarten fruit cocktail and confirmed our worst fears: these were, we believe, canned cling peaches. Yet the dish itself was still remarkably pretty good- the fish/fruit combination worked to bring out a meatiness in the bass that is otherwise hard to taste. The textures of the dish also were well-considered, moving from the snap and crunch of the peppers to the firm fleshiness of the fish (and even to the soft pulpiness of the peaches). I couldn't help but imagine how much better, how much more aromatic and zesty the dish would have been, had it been prepared with fresh peaches- even woefully out-of-season ones. This, I thought, is what possiblilty tastes like. With so much goodwill behind Amazing 66, it would be unfortunate to see all of its potential go unrealized. As it is now, it is a very decent Cantonese restaurant in the middle of a neighborhood where it will need to do better to really succeed. And all the signs are there that it can do this, from the willingness to take chances with flavor combinations, to an eagerness to showcase ingredients like pickled cabbage, scrambled egg, and pork intestine on its permanent menu. All the stars seem aligned to allow Amazing 66 to live up to its name, and it really would be a shame to see all those flower arrangements go to waste over slipshod service and a few ill-advised canned peaches. Amazing 66 Restaurant, 66 Mott Street, 212-334-0099

yea, saw this place on mott pop up maybe a few weeks back. it doesn't look to be that popular which might mean not as fresh... as far as the menu goes, it's not strictly a race thing; it's more about whether you can order in cantonese/mandarin and/or whether you can read chinese. but i do love how they've adopted the same semantics as western restaurants and use \"off the menu.\" hey, if a restaurant wants to discriminate based upon regulars vs. tourists/food adventurers or asians vs. non-asians... if the place isn't good enough to stay open, doesn't matter. we shall see, but my money would be on this place not making it to 08.

Went here for dinner on 12/25. Place was packed and had to wait for 30 minutes. Every single table was ordering some of lobster (either with ginger and scallions or with minced pork atop lo mein). We ordred the lobster with minced pork over a mound of lo mein. The lobster was as good as I've had in Chinatown (which is to say, not very good) but the pork and sauce added a lot of flavor and it was more or less satisfying. To start we had honey pork ribs that we fabulous -- very thick and very meaty -- and two specails of baked stuffed clams and baked stuffed scallops. Both were really fantastic, with a deep briny flavor, lots of juices underneath the stuffing, and the shellfish absolutely dominating over the stuffing. Also ordered a sizzling filet of beef becaus we wanted beef, although the menu didn't seem particularly beef oriented. Dish was nothing special, but no worse then I imagine it would be elsewhere. Clearly not the thing to order. Overall I agree with the \"potential\" assessment based on the night notes of the meal.

At The Modern's Bar Room, A Special Exhibit
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-12-09 20:50:00
***CONTENT
 Open now for almost two years, the Modern's Bar Room is nearly as packed with eager eaters as it was when it opened. This is after all a Danny Meyer restaurant, the same restauranteur behind the visionary Union Square Cafe, Tabla, 11 Madison Park, and five other restaurants across town and, together with Meyer's Gramercy Tavern, the recipient of one star from Le Guide Michelin. And like these other restaurants, everything about the room indicates a space that has been thought through with astonishing attention to detail: a zen-like entrance tunnel empties into a space that is spare but bustling with movement; tables are precisely set with stylized, minimalist silverware, and pint-sized Eames-style chairs cosy up to rows of tables in front of a translucent white wall that separates the Bar Room from the Dining Room. The style is modern European, or a kind of B&B Italia meets Terence Conran. In fact, the Modern reminds me of nothing so much as a Conran eatery- in a sense, the Modern is New York's Plateau. But despite appearances, this is New York, not London, and those beautiful curves outside the floor-to-ceiling glass windows of the main dining room are the Henry Moores and Giacomettis of MoMA's Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. For those in the main dining room (the Bar Room has no direct view of the garden), the proximity of such intoxicating sculptures is almost like having Picasso and Rodin as dining companions. HungryMom and I wanted a little more privacy that that, however when we paid the Modern a visit last week. Booking nearly two weeks ahead, the Bar Room had tables during the part of the evening most people would consider dinner-time, while a table in the main restaurant would have meant choosing between equally disagreeable 5:00 p.m. or 10:30 p.m. reservations (we booked online and without problems, although had I not responded to a message on my answering machine seeking re-confirmation, I would have lost the table). The Modern has a menu that requires an explanation. Dishes are divided into three columns and everything on the menu is a small plate. The first column includes mostly cold appetizers; the second, hot. To further confuse matters, dishes in the third column are billed as 'half-sized entrees.' Our server guided us competently through the list of options -- suggesting we order three dishes if we were hungry, two if we weren't -- but given that the prices range from $10-$17 no matter the column, our budget meant that our meal looked less like Paul Cezanne's overflowing fruit dish and more like a minimalist Rothko. I suppose if we were really hungry, we could have been seated in the dining room, with its $155 Autumn Tasting Menu. But in that case we would have had fewer choices: unlike other restaurants with split personalities, the Bar Room and the main dining room have completely different menus. This means that the kitchen prepares over 50 different dishes each night - no small achievement. And the quality of what comes out of that kitchen is at times extraordinary. My basil gnocchi ($17) were soft yet pleasantly chewy, with crispy basil leaves complementing small spheres of sweetbread that were lightly fried themselves. Best of all were the sprinkling of oyster and champignon mushrooms, whose earthiness balanced the sweetness in the basil-flavored broth. This was indeed a small dish; it held out for little more than four or five forkfuls. Hungrymom's wild mushroom soup ($12) had more of those wonderful oyster mushrooms, but these were whizzed up in a food processor first, turning the soup into an intense, mushroom-infused puree. In a dramatic flourish, three chorizo ravioli - more akin to empanadas or samosas - lay balanced against each other in origami-like folded napkins, ready to be dropped into the soup or eaten right away. I liked the crispy chorizo packets, but together with the well-seasoned soup, the combination was far too salty for one dish. HungryMom and I decided to stick to just two plates each to save room for dessert. This turned out to be an easy accomplishment given the paltry portions of our second courses. My spice-crusted lamb ($16) turned out to be two finger-sized cuts of tender meat accompanied by a wedge of potato gratin and a drizzle of pomegranate reduction. Despite its diminutive dimensions, the lamb was juicy and soft and tasted, in a revelatory way, of lamb. Even better was the gratin side dish, prepared with heavy cream and Spanish Manchego cheese, and among the best things I have eaten in a restaurant this year. Note to the Modern: offer this as a separate side order and it will fly off the menu. HungryMom's wild salmon ($16) was just as good. Fork-tender and soft in the center, the salmon was excellent, perked up by a horseradish-spiked sauce, a bed of shredded cabbage and a ring of sweet Riesling-infused foam. Declaring the food in front of her \"the best piece of salmon I've had,' HungryMom could barely contain herself and practically licked the plate. But perhaps the biggest surprise about the Modern are its desserts. Not only are they excellent, but they are by no small margin the most generously portioned dishes the restaurant serves. And at between $8 and $12, desserts are also 30-50 percent less expensive than most of the other food. This adds up to a preferred strategy for the hungry, culinarily curious and short of funds: instead of having three plates as recommended, order two plates and a dessert. Serious chocolate fiends are advised not to miss the Modern Chocolate Tart ($10), a chocolate shell filled with silky chocolate mousse and topped with a roof of crispy dark chocolate. A spoonful of this together with the accompanying vanilla ice cream is a sexy and sinful way to end the meal. But even this concoction could not compete with the Modern's New Orleans-style beignets ($10), sweet, chewy puffs of air shaped into bow ties and nestled deep in a cloth napkin to keep to keep them warm as long as possible. There's no danger of these beignets getting cold, however; most every table we saw ordered them, quickly tearing them apart and dunking them in one (or all) of the three dips provided: an ambrosian, hot caramel sauce, cold maple ice cream, and a tangy mango marmalade. Crowd pleasing touches like the beignets are why the Bar Room at the Modern succeeds two years on from its opening. The menu may be a tad confusing, but its breadth of choice and the restaurant's sparkling atmosphere generally add up to something more than a likeable whole. Like the museum in which it resides, the Modern's food seeks originality and expert execution; that not every dish reaches these heights should not be considered a fault - the Modern wins points for its sheer exuberance. Bar Room at the Modern, 9 West 53rd Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. (212) 333-1220

It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Latkes Again

2006-12-05 15:52:00
***CONTENT
 Since writing one of our ten most popular posts of all time, we have gotten a regular stream of happy e-mails from people who have tried our now well-distributed latke recipe. Our goal last winter was to recreate, at least in part, the texture and heft of a potato pancake from the now sadly departed 2nd Avenue Deli, and after hours and days of experimenting, we did so, using the non-traditional approach of mashing a portion of the potatoes in the recipe before frying the latkes. Apparently, our iconoclasm was easy to excuse, because a few of those e-mails came from actual Jewish grandmothers, one of whom told us, \"I am never telling my kids or grandkids about this...but I started using your recipe that I found through a Google search and it's better than mine. I add capers to mine (old Italian Jewish custom). Try it.\" So we did, and Bubbe Errera is absolutely right: they're wonderful. So if you're in the mood for a more savory latke, you can do what she does and add a tablespoon or two of tiny, salt-packed capers to the potato mash before you fry the patties. And really, how could we really complain about someone modifying our recipe, when the tinkering comes from an actual bubbe-and one who uses Google, to boot?

Will Work (and Wait) for Noodles: Super Taste Restaurant
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-12-03 23:04:00
***CONTENT
 In hindsight, I think it must have been all the questions we were asking that gave us away, because it was clear that, in the mind of the woman behind Super Taste Restaurant's counter, we had transformed from regular diners to people who paid careful attention to what we put in our mouths. \"You go! Come back. One hour! Everything fresh in one hour,\" she snapped as she handed us back our change. \"But,\" I spluttered, \"we just paid. You'll remember us?\" She laughed, smiled and said, \"Yes. I remember. Now you go away. Come back one hour, OK?\" In the back, a man rolling out a sheet of dough the size of a Monopoly board nodded at us. So of course we did as we were told, because if there is one lesson we've learned over the course of nearly a decade of adventurous chowing, it is that commands like this one ought to be obeyed, and most especially where noodles are concerned. And at least for us, the whole point of our visit was Super Taste's famous hand-pulled Lanzhou noodles, yard-long strands of wheat pasta approximately the same thickness as linguini. These noodles are cooked in broth (although they are also sometimes sautéed in a wok briefly before being boiled) as part of a traditional Lanzhou hotpot, and are noteworthy not just for their freshness, but because they miraculously never seem to go mushy and distended, even after sitting in the bottom of a soup bowl for hours. There are two keys to the noodles' firmness. One is the athletic hand-pulling process, during which the gluten in the pasta dough gets pulled and yanked so vigorously that it locks onto itself with a virtually indestructible attachment that no mere soup can destroy. The other key is the short lag-time between noodle stretching and noodle cooking- if fresh noodles are allowed to rest, their gluten molecules begin to relax a bit, creating softer and more absorbent dough; if, however, hand-pulled noodles are cooked the instant they are stretched, they'll remain intact when cooked. Suddenly the counter woman's exhortations to come back in an hour began to make sense. Upon our return, precisely one hour and one minute later, we were commanded to take a seat and were presented with two bowls of Lanzhou noodles and a plastic container containing pickled vegetables and herbs, all brought by the now-beaming counter woman. She instructed us on how to add the 'brown pickle' to our soups, if we desired, also warning us that she herself didn't much care for the condiment. We really liked the tangy overtones from the pickle mix in the House Special Soup ($6.00), a hodgepodge concoction of beef broth, tripe, sliced pork, cubed beef, a fried egg, and from what we understand, anything else the chef feels like adding to it. The House Special is the most traditional form of Lanzhou beef noodles, not to mention Super Taste's most popular dish. It is easy to see why: the broth is clear and aromatic, with a complex variety of flavors ranging from scallion to chili, beef bone to preserved ham. Our sole quibble was that some of the meat in the soup was quite fatty (the sliced beef, in particular), so if gristle offends you, you might want to choose a different soup. This also might be the perfect soup to use in a hands-on, mouth-on lesson for offal neophytes- the tripe here is tender and clean, with just a faint hint of the muskiness that offends some diners so terribly-just right for the uninitiated. Think of it as tripe with training wheels. As HungryMan slurped through his House Special, I concentrated on my Hand Pulled Noodle with Eel Soup ($5.50), a dish that was much better without the proffered brown pickle condiment. As with the House Special, this soup contained a large portion of toothsome hand-pulled noodles, along with eight or nine thumb-length morsels of roasted freshwater eel. I adore eel. I order unagi whenever I get the chance when I'm eating Japanese food, and once on a visit to Belgium, I sat in a playground and polished off an entire half pound of paling in 't groen (eels in green sauce) with a huge chunk of brown bread as local children laughed and pointed at me. But to my great surprise, the meaty slices of eel I found in my soup from Super Taste were the most singularly luscious and tender I have ever eaten- bar none. At less than six dollars for a serving, they are also among the cheapest. We have returned to Super Taste several more times since our first trip, and every time we have found the same excellent quality soups (another new favorite is the Hot & Spicy Soup ($4.00)). Perhaps we've always had lucky timing, as we have never again been asked to go away and come back since that first visit. But, for the sake of noodles as good as Super Taste's, we'd happily do it all again. Super Taste Restaurant, 26 North Eldridge Street (between Canal and Division Streets), 212-625-1198, 1196.

 There may be more than seventy food items on Roll and Dough's menu-every single song from the K-Tel Greatest Hits Collection of Chinese (American) Cooking is here, from General Tso's chicken to pork spare ribs, but nearly half of those items are completely irrelevant. The true story of this newish shop, a sibling of legendary Flushing bakery Unique Pastry, is simple: it's all about the bings. Shao bings, more precisely, are sesame-encrusted, soft pan-fried buns that are filled with either sweet or savory ingredients. Bings are, in practically every respect, kindred spirits of the Japanese yakimochi-in fact, apart from the use of rice flour and dry-roasting in the Japanese version, they are the same dish. But don't underestimate the differences in taste and texture between a bing and a yakimochi. Bings have a soft, very light exterior dough with a crisp and nutty crust- any chewiness in a bing comes from its filling, whereas a yakimochi is engineered to be chewy. And there's another major difference: shelf life. Yakimochi can sit at room temperature and remain edible for as long as 48 hours before they begin to get a little too chewy and crusty. Bings, on the other hand, don't fare at all well when they leave the heat. Once a bing is fully cooked, the clock starts ticking. In our experience with bings, you've got about two hours to polish off your sesame bun before it starts to resemble your building's handyman: a little discomfortingly greasy and sweaty. But if you eat the bing within that 120 minute window, it's a delightful little treat. Our favorites are the sweet taro, the red bean (pictured here), and the banana ($1.50 each) flavors. We also love the spicy pork and spicy chicken bing, which at $1.75 apiece are among Greenwich Village's best bang-for-the-buck snacks. However, cheap isn't always an easy sell, even a neighborhood absolutely heaving with students. We've walked by Roll and Dough several times in the past few months and have seen the shop offering pedestrians free samples of entire bings. Not a good sign. It's not too difficult to put the pieces together to figure that the restaurant must be paying a phenomenal amount of rent to stay in its large, ultra-premium location, and if we're being brutally honest, Roll and Dough has done a pretty terrible job of optimizing its business to showcase its strengths; this is a restaurant that carries a lot of culinary dead weight on its menu, and it's also a restaurant that needs only about 1/4 of the space it occupies. If we could have a private tête-à-tête with Bing Lady Extraordinaire Elizabeth Ting, here's what we might suggest: (1) Head up to Koryod@ng on 32nd Street in Koreatown and check out what they do with desserts and replicate the model with fresh bings, adding a little WiFi access for the NYU kids; (2) Ditch everything on the menu except the bings, wontons, and buns (and maybe take the inspired Lychee Pork from the menu and stick it into a bing, as well); (3) Focus on savory items at lunch, the way Café Zaiya does. Just pay attention to that sound- it's the tick-tock of the bing clock, and we'd rather not hear the alarm. Roll and Dough, 135 West 3rd Street (between Macdougal Street & 6th Avenue), 212-253-2871

Funny... a few friends and I had gone to Ony (RIP, sadly) a few months ago, maybe a week after R&D had opened. For some reason a large number of us were still hungry so we headed over there- it was like 10+ of us- and they told us they were closed... I thought they could still serve us though. I haven't been able to get back there to try the stuff... though it does look yummy. I guess I can go there now... since Ony closed

I reheated a bing in the toaster oven - it got all crispy again, yum. The taro are the best, but you should try the spicy veggie. Sometimes I actually prefer the baked bun format too...

You are absolutely right; the bings are phenomenal, but the location isn't right. Personally, I think they'd be better off with a couple of street carts in midtown, but I sure hope that the West 3rd Street location becomes successful. It isn't my neighborhood, but West 3rd is still a lot closer than having to schlepp out to Flushing for a bing fix.

 Generally, I am not a fan of culinary dogma-I don't believe in the innate superiority of the white truffle over nearly all other ingredients, nor do I really think there is anything wrong with drinking a latte or cappuccino in the evening, or with sprinkling a little cheese on your seafood, if that is what you prefer- but there is one rule of baking that is ineluctably true: there is nothing better than a well-made plain croissant. I don't deny for a moment that a pain au chocolat or almond croissant can be exquisitely delicious. But there is no denying that good quality chocolate or almond paste can cover up some pretty shameful pastry making sins, shifting focus away from soggy layers or burnt edges. On the other hand, a pure, unadulterated croissant bravely draws all of an eater's attention to itself, placing both strengths and flaws on full display. The plain croissant plays a high-stakes game of flakiness, and it is one that very few outside of France or Québec manage to win. Until this week, HungryMan and I probably would have said that Financier Patisserie on Stone Street made our favorite croissants in New York, and although they are genuinely very good, they wouldn't quite make a Parisian or Québécois swoon. Everything changed when we finally dropped by Patisserie Claude on West 4th Street, after months of reading about their pains au chocolat. Call it fate, but as we walked through Greenwich Village, HungryMom picked the perfect moment to announce, \"Oooh, I'm feeling peckish! What's good to snack on around here?\" So it was that we ducked into Claude's nondescript storefront and found ourselves in a displaced little corner of Paris's 11th arrondisement, complete with cranky proprietor glowering at us through the kitchen's pass-through window. The po-faced man in the back was, of course, Claude, the shop's owner and chief baker. His crabbiness is well-documented and quite frankly, not the point. If you say hello to him (extra points for doing it in French), he'll brighten considerably, as most people do when they're treated like...well, people. Claude's talent is not as a sales person or interior decorator, but as a patissier, and in that arena, he is among the best anywhere. We left the shop with two plain croissants and two brioches (each $1.50) and could barely keep ourselves from devouring them as we rode back to the Noshpad. Once we did tuck in, we immediately understood that we were in the presence of greatness- greatness that wouldn't last another ninety seconds. Truly superb croissants achieve two opposite textures at the same time: they are crispy on the outside-so brittle even that they splinter and shatter when they are bitten or torn-and soft on the inside, with dozens of atom-thin layers of striated dough. These gossamer sheets are formed during baking, when layers of dough, separated from each other by butter, rise and trap bubbles of steam. On the other hand, bad croissants can be too watery, too greasy, too doughy, too stiff, too crunchy, overdone or underdone: there are a hundred ways to screw up, and sadly, most bakeries do. But not Claude. His croissants were crisp, light, soft inside, buttery, and just barely, nearly unnoticeably sweet. Unsurprisingly, his brioches were also nearly perfect in their toothsome, eggy flavor and ultra-tender crumb. One of the two brioches we bought was a bit over-browned on the bottom, but even that portion of the little roll was better than any other brioche we've tasted in several months. Word on the web is that the chocolate croissants (pains au chocolat) are also divine, as are the éclairs and napoléons. We don't doubt it. If his other desserts are a third as good as his croissants and brioches, they are well worth the subway or cab fare to West 4th Street, as well as the small emotional cost of suffering through the scowls Claude will probably cast in your direction. But our advice is just to smile, say \"Bonjour, Monsieur\" and order as much as you can possibly carry out of the shop. Patisserie Claude, 187 West 4th Street (between 6th and 7th Avenues), 212-255-5911

I never knew Claude was supposed to be crabby... But that could be because I always speak to him in French. I worked for a French baker in Ottawa for many years, and I totally agree with your review. (Let me know if you go up North, I'll point you to some good croissants.)

You should definitely try the other stuffs in Claude. The palmiers and eclairs are both to die for and he also makes a mean pumpkin pie. I used to frequent PC a lot back in 2000-02 during my grad school days at NYU. He was crabby at first till he noticed that I was fast becoming a regular and seriously hooked with his eclairs and palmiers. I also found some money (maybe around $5) once in the floor and handed it to him and since then have been getting extra palmiers when I drop by to visit and a huge smile

I leave for nyc in two days and cannot wait to try this place. I recently visited France for the first time in January 2007 and couldn't believe how a real croissant should taste!! I always thought they were ok here at home, but I never craved them. Now I think about those delicious croissants and pains au chocolats all the time!!! I also died over the palmiers in France as well. I cannot wait to visit this shop in Greenwich. And I will not forget my manners..I learned that in France also.

Pedestrian, not Equestrian at Jack the Horse

 Certain quarters of Brooklyn Heights have long been aching for a local restaurant with consistently good food. Sure, there is Henry Street's oddly named but quite decent Noodle Pudding; but really, this trattoria is better known for its friendly neighborhood atmosphere than for the high quality of its food. Hopes were high when Jack the Horse Tavern, a new eatery with an equally quirky name, opened on the corner of Cranberry and Hicks Streets, but after suffering through a seriously subpar meal with our friend Jay, a long-time local, we're forced to report that this corner of the Heights will have to keep its fingers crossed a little longer for a truly excellent restaurant capable of galloping away with their hearts and stomachs. We started to catch the first glimpse of the problems within seconds of being seated. Jack the Horse seemed to have fallen victim to a peculiar kind of server anarchy, with more than one waiter approaching our table to take our drink orders, each unaware of the other-we wondered if we were actually supposed to choose a server ourselves and hand him our menus as a symbol of our new commitment. But eventually, fewer and fewer waiters stopped by the table, and when finally just one waiter was left, he was so flustered that he needed a little prompting to recall the night's specials. These lapses are a shame, because some guidance would have certainly been helpful in navigating the eclectic menu. On the one hand, by its name alone you would be forgiven for thinking that Jack the Horse has set itself up as a temple to hippophagy (the restaurant is actually named after a lake in northern Minnesota where owner Tim Oltmans went fishing as a boy), but there's no horse meat here. What is on offer is a wide-ranging, often seemingly arbitrary selection of dishes from Italy (pizzetti, Italian cous cous), Germany (grilled German sausages, served with three different kinds of mustard) and Lower East Side New York (the chicken liver 'schmeer,' served with chutney on small toasts). If we had to guess, we'd say that the theme appears to be comfort foods from and inspired by Europe, but even that's a stretch. Jay ordered a simple mixed green and red leaf salad with an uninspired balsamic vinaigrette dressing ($7). It was rescued by shavings of Spanish Manchego cheese, poached pear slices and roughly hewn homemade croutons. Manchego and pear are a great combination, and a welcome change from the shopworn pairing of the cheese with apple or fig. I ordered the sweet corn arepas which, while certainly less of a revelation than those offered by Jackson Heights's legendary Sainted Arepa Lady, were significantly better than many of the arepas sold at New York's summer street festivals. Outwardly crisp and tender inside, these were arepas to enjoy in small mouthfuls. Better still, the flavor combination of sweet (corn and kabocha squash) with savory (the puddle of goat cheese atop the arepa) was an unmitigated success. Main courses were also hit-or-miss, with a certain spareness of presentation that suffered or benefited from a single-minded focus on the main ingredient. Jay's roasted porkchop ($18) was massive and juicy, and with a puree of celery root and grilled apples shredded and mixed with cabbage, the dish was just right for crisp autumn weather. The celeriac purée was also wonderful, with a less starchy flavor than that of mashed potatoes but all of the richness. This dish could have been improved only by increasing the portion of the celery root purée- there was hardly enough on the plate to balance the king-sized portion of meat. My skate ($17), while beautifully presented surrounded by a briny black olive tapenade, was heavily overseasoned with pepper. The fish itself was prepared well enough: the flesh was fork-tender and the crust was hot and crisp as advertised. Yet the crescent of cerignola olives and moat of olive purée along the plate's perimeter made the dish cry out for something-anything- that wasn't salty. I almost stole a spoonful of the pork chop's celeriac purée but my better instincts (and the stingy portion) kept me from doing so. Sweets were better than main dishes, but were not without their issues as well. In an expansive mood, Jay and I ordered a trio of desserts on one plate, a melange of small, sweet bites perfect for sharing. What we got was a trio of desserts that covered the spectrum of success: a disappointing spoonful of rich, mascarpone rice pudding, a passable mint chocolate and peanut brittle, and a miniature cream puff that practically deliquesced at the slightest touch. Two out of three isn't too bad, but the rice pudding was so flavorless and palate-coatingly heavy that it muted our enjoyment of the other desserts. Jack the Horse's website makes a point of eschewing \"meaningless flourish,\" and this attitude is reflected in the dining room's casual décor: most of the wood in the room has been kept rough, and there are pillows on many of the banquettes. But we wish the owners had lavished one or two more well-considered flourishes on the food, if not the space, because our Jack the Horse experience felt chaotic and unfinished, right from the start. Then again, perhaps we just picked the wrong waiter out of the server scrum. Jack the Horse Tavern, 66 Hicks Street, at Cranberry Street, Brooklyn Heights. 718-852-5084

At Cru, It's Always 8:00

***CONTENT
 We love to eat late, but we also realize that this isn't Spain, where the dinner hour often elides seamlessly into midnight. Here in New York, things work a little differently, and being seated in a restaurant at 10:30 p.m. is generally not much better than not being seated at all- by that hour, the staff are tired, sometimes cranky, and probably counting the minutes until they can head home. It's hard to blame them. Dedicated diners don't let that dissuade them though, because at many popular eateries around town, it's hard to snag a table on the weekend at any other time. Greenwich Village's Cru is in this category: more than two years after it first opened its doors, it still manages to sell out both of its early seatings regularly, leaving spontaneous diners with the graveyard shift. We'll be the first to admit to a little wariness about accepting a reservation slot less than an hour before the kitchen was advertised to close, but after finishing an overall excellent meal and exiting Cru at 1:15 a.m., we're left wondering if anyone at Cru even owns a watch. Not that time ever seems to have been on the mind of our genial, if often overbearingly chatty, waiter. From the instant we took our seats, he let us know that he was omnicompetent and willing to provide us with information on anything the restaurant had to offer. Because HungryMan and I both like to ask questions, we welcomed his eagerness to discuss the food. However, by the end of the meal, his logorrhea was too much to bear- the evening's experience had become too much like being waited on by Wikipedia when he presented us with our credit card and remarked, \"Ah, Mr. (HungryMan), you share your name with a very fine Australian producer of Shiraz.\" We knew that if we engaged him in this conversation, we'd never leave. The upside to all of this was that we rarely needed to ask for clarification on the ingredients in a dish, so we smiled and ate as he talked to prevent our food from going cold. This proved to be the perfect strategy, carrying us through a triptych of amuse-bouches: (1) crispy, savory herbed arancini (risotto balls), (2) a thin pastry cup of infused mascarpone cheese, and (3) a Lego-sized layered terrine of butternut squash, more creamy cheese, a little squirt of citrus sauce, and a brilliant, sweet sage-streusel topping. Both of us adored the risotto ball and the terrine, but I found the pastry cup too simple and a little too much like eating a spoonful of pure mascarpone. But the portion size for each was ideal: just one or two tiny bites, and the amuse was gone forever, leaving us wanting something more...like a glass of wine. If there is one thing Cru does have, it is wine. Since 2004, the restaurant is rumored to have expanded its legacy cellar (via Cru's owner, Roy Welland) from 65,000 to nearly 90,000 bottles, giving it one of two of the largest wine cellars in the nation. (The other? Bern's Restaurant in Tampa, Florida). Choosing a bottle at Cru entails poring over two leather-bound volumes, each as big as something out of Harry Potter. Prices range from the high $20's up to tens of thousands of dollars per bottle. It's hard to estimate an accurate median price, but it is enough to say that there are plenty of options for reds, whites, and rosés in the $40-80 range. HungryMan and I opted to exploit the cellar's substantial catalog of back vintages and ordered a 1989 Saint Joseph red for $72. Pricing older vintages is tricky, but considering this was a wine from one of this century's greatest Rhone vintages, we figured the price was just about right. And while the wine took a good 30 minutes post-decanting to open up, it was dense and remarkably fruity. Sadly, our sommelier was, in all fairness, not much help. We asked him a few questions about differences between the 1990 and 1989 vintages of the Saint Joseph, but he seemed more interested in popping Cristal for a neighboring table. For us, this was not a dire situation-we've both taught wine courses-but we wonder if other diners might not get a bit overwhelmed by the two-fisted list when it doesn't come with a little more friendly guidance. If I could, I'd subtract 20% of our waiter's enthusiasm and graft it onto the sommelier to produce a perfect service combination. Our dinner choices were a bit easier to make. Both HungryMan and I chose from the three course prix fixe ($74 per person) menu, politely turning down the $399 white truffle menu (featuring white truffles in every one of seven courses, including dessert), and I don't regret the choice. My appetizer, the saffron tagliolini with cioppino sauce (pictured above) and flat-leaf parsley was phenomenally good, not to mention a fantastic match for the still-tannic red wine we ordered. Moreover, I was really pleased to see that the portion size was not minute- this dish would have been a large appetizer in any restaurant, and it was made even more filling by the quarter-sized chunks of fresh Dungeness crab trapped in the mound of aromatic, al dente pasta. The star dish of the evening though was HungryMan's Rock Shrimp Salad (also pictured above), served on a crunchy bed of grated celeriac and a polenta cake that was redolent of fresh green onions. The small spoonful of horseradish cream atop the stacked dish was what truly made this appetizer into something special- the high-note flavors from the horseradish brought out the mellower essences of the shrimp and the celery root, turning this into quite possibly the best appetizer of our culinary year to date. HungryMan's main dish, the roasted duck breast with baby beets and root vegetable purée was also first-rate. The duck was very rare, yet still crisp on the outside, and the port-drizzled beets were as sweet as toffee. The grouper saltimbocca I ordered was, unfortunately, not as good. I loved the long, noodle-like strips of tender broccoli, but the fish itself was cooked very strangely- half of it was moist and just a bit overdone, while the other half was rubbery and as tough as a door-stopper. We try not to send food back when we're writing about it, but I'll admit that I was tempted. Had it been a little earlier in the evening, I might have done just that. But after looking over the autumn menu on Cru's website, I think I may know why this one dish seemed so uncharacteristically inadequate: it appears that the restaurant's original plan for this seafood dish incorporated sturgeon, rather than grouper. I'm always in favor of using whatever is freshest-especially from the fishmarket-but substituting a less fatty fish (such as grouper) as a stand-in for sturgeon requires that some big changes to the recipe be made. The biggest disappointment to me was that the lingonberry sauce and the bed of vegetables were both terrific-I can only imagine what the whole dish would have been, had the grouper been a sturgeon. For our final course, HungryMan and I split our options and shared both dishes, one of us ordering the cheese plate and the other the gianduja terrine. This was partly by design-we both love cheese courses and dessert-and partly by necessity, as we still had 1/3 of a bottle of our slow-blooming wine to finish. Our server was very generous about giving us time to finish the bottle and brought the cheese course immediately. Both of us enjoyed the presentation of each small slice of cheese with its own individual accompaniment and were especially taken with the Québecois Oka, served with a white fig compote. Our gianduja dessert was also superb, particularly the tiny banana doughnut and the bittersweet chocolate sorbet components. I also loved the crunchy base of the terrine itself; I imagine that this is what Thor's pastry chef was trying to achieve with the deconstructed Snickers bar we ate there this February. What is all the more amazing is that both the cheese plate and the dessert were as flawlessly presented as they were, considering that they both emerged from the kitchen long past midnight. While we did indeed get to watch most of the kitchen and dining room staff head home in their street clothes as we finished our meal, nobody shot us a dirty look or even hinted that we should hurry. Maybe the real test for a high-end restaurant should be in how it handles its final evening seating. And considering that we were every bit as comfortable in the dining room at 1:00 a.m. as we were two and-a-half hours earlier, Cru has set the score to beat. Cru, 24 Fifth Avenue, 212-529-1700.

Surprises on Every Scale at Kyotofu

***CONTENT
 Like several thousand other New Yorkers, we've been drooling over Kyotofu's press packet for weeks now, staring at lush, close-focus photos of matcha-dusted brownies and kabocha pumpkin bars, counting the minutes until the tiny Hell's Kitchen bakery and dessert bar opens its doors. Our temptation is made all the worse by Kyotofu's proximity to the Noshpad; for months, every time we left the building for a dozen eggs, we walked past the little white boite and tried to peek inside. Finally, last night, all of our anticipation came to an end when we dropped in on Kyotofu's official opening press event and got a shock- the desserts featured in the November 2006 menu were, to a dish, different from the goodies we'd been gawking at for weeks. But it didn't take us long to get over it, because this new menu? It's even better. Surprise seems to be a key theme at Kyotofu- co-owners Nicole Bermensolo and Michael Berl got a taste of it themselves when they hired Hiromi Tsuruta to design their 800 square-foot space and he announced, \"Secret! It's a secret!\" and wouldn't let them see more than a rudimentary mock-up of the restaurant's plans. Tsuruta is probably best known in Gotham for his sleek interiors at Chikalicious and both Momofuku eateries, and despite the great acclaim those have won Tsuruta, Kyotofu's owners were understandably a little nervous. But what they got made them ecstatic: a space that feels larger than it is, with very clearly defined areas for drinking and cooking, as well as a visually arresting dining room with lots of white leather and polygonal angles that evokes just a hint of 2001: A Space Odyssey. We were especially impressed with the efficient use of cooking space in the restaurant; the kitchen is no bigger than many New York apartment kitchens, and by some magic of time-shifting and excellent planning, everything is still made in-house, from the green tea-dipped okara cookies to the savory tofu tsukune chicken meatballs. As I stood at the bar in the front of the restaurant, drinking a gingery shibuya martini and nibbling my way through sample-sized versions of all but one of Kyotofu's autumn desserts, I found a few standouts in the deeply nutty sweet black sesame tofu ($7) and the warm chestnut mochi chocolate cake, filled with gooey green tea-anko cream ($10). But my very favorite item, the sansho pepper tofu cheesecake ($9) was complex and delightful, in part because it completely defied my expectations: the cheesecake was light, flecked with aromatic and fragrant sansho pepper that added flavor with very little spicy heat, and just slightly sweet- in other words, this was like no other cheesecake I'd ever tasted. The anmitsu with crystal plum sake ($9), a compote-style dessert made up of miniature mochi, ice creams, and jellies, was also superb. After nibbling my way through the menu, Bermensolo and I talked about the challenges posed by taking the restaurant's concept from its home in Japan and importing it to New York. Kyotofu, not actually a chain, but a family-run business with only seven branches in Japan, serves primarily a soy-based menu in Japan, something that required lots of rethinking and tweaking here for New York palates. But the result of all of this revision has become Kyotofu's credo: to use Japanese ingredients and traditional preparations and incorporate them into a modern, American culinary style. It has been so successful that now the Japanese branches of the restaurant have begun to steal items from the Hell's Kitchen shop, calling them 'New York Style' desserts. And when the results are this well-executed, it's not hard to see why the Japanese might want a sansho pepper cheesecake of their own. Kyotofu, 705 Ninth Avenue (at 48th Street), 212-974-6012

iCi, Fort Greene's Little Chez Panisse East

***CONTENT
 One of the frustrating things about living outside the US for several years is that you remain blissfully ignorant of certain pop-cultural touchstones-sometimes for years after you return. You say Buddy Ebsen died in 2003? Didn't know that. Someone won over $3 million on Jeopardy? How is this possible? Sure, cable television narrowed the distance between London and the US to some degree, but there are still times when I find myself shaking my head at a missed connection. So it was last week at iCi, a homey French bistro in Fort Greene, where we overheard a group of nearby diners not-so-quietly whispering about the celebrity of our host: 'Let's hope we don't see that awful manager!' we heard one woman hiss, and we wondered how she could make up her mind about someone so quickly. It turns out that iCi's co-owner, Laurent Saillard (who runs the place with his wife, Catherine), played the general manager of Rocco DiSpirito's reality-eatery on The Restaurant, a TV show whose '03-04 season-long run on NBC we completely missed. However, we read plenty of reviews of the show, so we were quite familiar with the show's recurring themes: abused waiters and, behind the scenes, a shambolic kitchen. So we started looking around for hidden cameras and then got a little concerned, even though everything seemed calm in the dining room. Maybe too calm? Of course, we had nothing to worry about. Whatever well-edited sins Mr. Saillard committed on The Restaurant, his move out of the spotlight has served him, not to mention the lucky residents of Fort Greene and Clinton Hill, very well. With a cozy, light ambiance and emphasis on local, seasonal and organic ingredients, iCi is a restaurant straight out of the Chez Panisse mold; in fact, iCi's menu quotes Alice Waters directly; her best line, \"Eating is a political act\" appears just below the listing for the seared sea scallops. The rest of the menu makes iCi's commitment to local and organic ingredients manifestly clear in every item of the well-edited selection of soups, salads, entrees, and wines. Nosher had little trouble choosing an Asian crab salad appetizer ($9), one of the evening's specials. The salad (pictured above), featured a generous portion of fresh crab meat-not crab stick or surimi-paper-thin cucumber slices, julienned red peppers and a nest of watercress. The refreshing crunch of the cucumbers and peppers balanced the tenderness of the crab, and the peppery bite from the watercress worked beautifully with the salad's tangy, citrus vinaigrette. The other salad on our table belonged to Lady Film Editor. Her appetizer was a simple arugula and fennel salad ($9), lightly dressed and dotted with small slices of sweet pear and crescents of fresh fennel. This shape was echoed in the curls of parmesan cheese atop and around the salad. Arugula and parmesan are a classic combination, and we loved how both ingredients were enlivened by the addition of the fruit and fennel. Despite iCi's explicit focus on fresh ingredients, it offers much more than salads as starters. I chose the handmade spaetzle appetizer ($11), a rich confederation of braised, mostly dark-meat chicken and rustic, hand-extruded noodles that are made from flour, egg and milk, and cooked like fresh pasta. iCi's spaetzle was delicate and light, with strong infusions of flavor inherited from the chicken and a sprinkling of flat-leaf parsley. This had the makings of a near-perfect autumn dish: substantial, warm and just a little creamy-the kind of food a German grandmother might prepare if you weren't feeling well. Yet, just like such convalescent food, it was slightly undersalted and suffered from an unfortunate greasiness. Like its appetizers, iCi's main dishes are also generally praiseworthy. Nosher's skate ($19) tasted phenomenal, a celebration of how tender fish can be when prepared well. In the final analysis, this was some of the best skate we've eaten in years. The dish's accompaniment, collard greens, so often overcooked, here were still soft but with just the right amount of al dente-style bite to them, and flecked with red pepper flakes that added a gentle spicy kick that also worked as a welcome counterpoint to the salinity of the brown butter sauce. In truth, the presentation of the dish was a bit of a mess-the skate wing had fallen apart in places-but this should put off no one. Lady Film Editor ordered the sea bass ($21), an almost sculptural marvel with a handful of greens carefully balanced on top of a hefty portion of crispy-skinned fish. The sea bass was bathed in an unusual sweet red onion reduction with small strands of onion still visible throughout, and came with a number of sautéed and roasted vegetables that balanced the smooth fish with their crunchy textures. Our favorite was the fractal-funky Romanesco cauliflower that not only stood out visually, but added structural support to the towering presentation. I took the advice of our very friendly server and ordered the short ribs, a frequent special at iCi and a dish that ought to have come with a warning: 'Only for the seriously hungry!' Yes, I am called HungryMan, but its a nom du site, and not an abiding condition...well, not all the time. The ribs were braised and fantastically tender to the point where the meat was falling off of the bone, and the sauce was rich with succulent pan juices. Given the amount of meat here, I found myself wishing for proportionately more of the wonderful polenta, although the carrots and turnips eased my disappointment. On the other hand, like the spaetzle, I found the short ribs to be somewhat underseasoned and perhaps a little undersalted. After such a large dinner, we couldn't stay for dessert, despite our earlier plan to do so. But iCi's reputation for chocolate confections will likely bring us back to its tables very soon. We would love to return and stretch out in iCi's expansive back garden, although this will either have to wait until we have another unseasonably warm weekend like this one or until the Spring. If it takes us several months to return, we suspect that we won't recognize most of iCi's menu- exactly what you might expect when Alice Waters, not Rocco DiSpirito, is the real celebrity ghost haunting the room. iCi, 246 DeKalb Avenue in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, 718-789-2778.

The thick slabs of bacon they serve at brunch are reason enough for a special trip down there on a Saturday or Sunday morning. Seriously, it is knife-and-fork thick, and unbelieveably tasty. We haven't had dinner there yet, but are anxious to do so.

 Shopping in New York is all about surprise discoveries: a jar of divine preserved lemons in a Spanish Harlem bodega, dozens of British candy bars in a Queens deli, and now-most surprising of all-beautiful, fresh long stemmed artichokes in, of all places, Gristede's Supermarket on 8th Avenue and 54th Street. None of this is to say that we're anti-Gristede's; we love the 24-hour shop in our neighborhood when we're out of milk or food for Mr. Packets, but with fantastic produce just a few blocks away at the Stiles fresh market or at the nearby Whole Foods, we rarely pay much attention to Gristede's greens. And we'll be honest, we also avert our gaze because we've had more than a few issues with quality and selection in the shop. Yet when we caught sight of a cluster of forearm-length artichokes, we had to stop, gawk, and take a few home, muttering to each other, \"Did we really just buy these at Gristede's?\" as we made our way back to the Noshpad. But by the time we got the artichokes into the kitchen, all we could think about is cooking them in a fashion that would showcase the extra several inches of edible stalk on each choke. Most artichoke dishes begin the same way, so we knew that no matter how we chose to cook them, we'd need to dip the artichokes in a huge bowl of cold, slightly acidic water-half a lemon or tablespoon of vinegar per gallon of water prevents artichokes from turning dirty brown immediately after they're cut. HungryMan and I also didn't want to get rid of all of the leaves, so we removed several layers of tough, exterior leaves and cut off the top two inches of the leafy heads. We then extracted the artichoke hearts and the the thistly center with a grapefruit spoon, dipping anything green into the lemon water every time we made a cut. Our decision to braise the artichokes rather than deep fry them (a personal favorite preparation) was a pragmatic one- we would have needed 10 or 12 quarts of oil just to submerge one of the artichokes completely. So we opted to cook them Sicilian-style, pan-frying them in garlic-infused olive oil for a few minutes, then adding two cups of stock to the pan, covering and simmering the artichokes in the broth for at least 30 minutes. When the stems and leaves were fork-tender, we removed them from the stock and served them with a generous garnish of shaved pecorino romano cheese-a perfect contrast to the soft, sweet, and fleshy stalks. The staff at the 8th Avenue Gristede's tell me that their supplier may or may not continue to send them these long stemmed artichokes during the month of November- nobody seems to know much about how or why they ended up on the shelves. This uncertainty doesn't surprise me, but it does send a very clear signal: go to Gristede's now if you want a few of these long-legged sprouts. Otherwise, you may just have to wait for your own moment of shopping serendipity.

'inoteca, Checkmate by Small Plate

***CONTENT
 The small plate revolution that has overtaken the city hasn't missed a neighborhood, and 'inoteca, on the Lower East Side looks a lot like the movement's official base of operations. A casual Italian wine bar with large picture windows that can, in good weather, be thrown open to the narrow sidewalks of Rivington and Ludlow Streets, 'intoteca sits on a formerly sleepy corner that now watches the insomniac LES scene with wide and over-caffeinated eyes. Restaurants and watering holes abound, but 'inoteca, which opened in 2003, distinguishes itself through its simple, satisfying menu and a prodigious wine list that features wines from practically every single nook and cranny of Italy (including the Islands-all of them). Simplicity is the name of the game all around, but only in the best sense: the service and atmosphere are easy and casual, with knowledgeable servers who are happy to bring you one plate or ten, it doesn't matter- and fortunately, there's no unsubtle upselling of more expensive options. Even if there were, the priciest item on the menu is a decently-sized $17 Wagyu Beef bollito panino. We also love how 'inoteca's menu raucously throws together exactly six categories of mix-and-match small plates, including antipasti, salads, fritti (fried goodies), affettati (sliced bresaola, coppa, mortadella, prosciutto, sopressata), formaggi (cheeses, over 20 varieties, all Italian), and pane, or bread, its largest category. And that's it: one single page, yet a suprising amount of choice, nevertheless. On the short menu is the dish that made 'inoteca famous, the truffle egg toast ($7), a creamy, rich concoction of poached egg and truffle oil over a several inch-thick slice of ciabatta bread. Before you go any further, you should know that we didn't order it- does the world really need another food lover rhapsodizing about truffles? Nosher ordered one of 'inoteca's salads: a rustic mix of lightly grilled and sliced calamari, borlotti beans and shaved fennel ($9). The surprise, evident from the first bite, was the brightness of the dressing, a pert marriage of red pepper oil and lemon that woke up each of the ingredients, especially the unadvertised chunks of red pepper and flat leaf Italian parsley. Once in a while we find a dish or flavor combination so compelling that it screams out for recreation at home, and this salad is clearly one. \"I cannot wait to buy some red pepper oil when we leave here,\" Nosher enthused. I just nodded my head eagerly. I took the easy way out and ordered the large antipasti plate ($13), which stuffs practically the rest of 'inoteca's menu onto one platter. Here were thin discs of sopressata, florets of grilled cauliflower, kalamata and green olives, a cold wedge of vegetable frittata, and silky, unctuous slices of oilve oil-roasted fennel. Pig-pink chunks of pickled red onion and carrot-a surprise-were at once tart, sweet, and briny, and were a perfect match for a semi-soft shaving of pungent pecorino cheese. Two impossibly long and thin breadsticks also lay crossed like chopsticks on top of the pile, a reminder that this was a dish meant for nibbling while talking and sipping. And there is plenty to drink; after all, 'inoteca recalls the enoteca (literally, a library of wine), a neighborhood staple throughout Italy where small snacks conspicuously play backup to the show's star, the vino. Here, too, 'inoteca lives up to its reputation. Bottles of wine line the walls and a long bar sweeps across the back of the room and seems under a constant siege of oenophiles. 'inoteca serves over 300 bottles of wine and over 30 by the glass. The import of this encyclopedic wine list should not be understated- 'inoteca offers one of the city's best opportunities to try out unusual Italian varietals and regional wines without spending a fortune. Yes, you can order a good Montepulciano d'Abruzzo or a Chianti Classico, but why would you when there are $9 glasses of juicy, super-fruity Aglianico or Negroamaro to explore? For many people, 'intoteca may be better known as the larger brother to the Bedford Street original, 'ino. But despite the noise at the LES location, which can be deafening late into the evening, and frequent long waits for tables, we think 'inoteca's food and atmosphere bests the original at its own game. We were especially impressed to stumble upon the chef conducting a full-staff tasting of the upcoming week's menu in the restaurant's basement cantina. \"The fish is really filling, don't first course it!\" he barked. \"Come on people, get a good taste of this stuff, people are going to ask questions!\" And just like a great commander readying his battalion of soldiers, he made us believe, while we stood waiting for the WC, that the small plate revolution in New York has already been won. 'inoteca, 98 Rivington Street, at Ludlow Street, 212-614-0473.

Hurrah that you enjoyed your 'Inoteca Experience. I happened upon it one evening recently having heard alot about the place, and more excited about the wine list than the food... What a pleasant suprise it was to discover the food! Having lived in Italy for 6 years I miss authentic Italian, that you rarely see on menus. 'Inoteca has quickly become a favorite destination.

 Manufacturing mistakes aren't always bad news- lively, even burgeoning trade in mis-struck error coins and glitchy Fiesta ware proves that it is possible to turn a goof into gold. And perhaps this is just what the copywriters for Starbucks were thinking when they mocked up their new Earth-friendly, unbleached paper napkins with this fouled-up motto: 'Less napkins. More plants. More planet...' It doesn't really take a William Safire to see the groaning error: 'less' is used for things that cannot be counted individually, and 'fewer' for things that can. Napkins, especially the sort that encourage you to use just one, fall squarely into the countable category. While we'd love to suggest a retraction and reprinting, we recognize that this would require disposing of the hundreds of thousands of sloppy serviettes Starbucks has already produced- a move that would destroy even more of the fragile rainforests that prompted the message in the first place. So instead, we'll stick a few of the mint condition error napkins in our safety deposit box-just in case the collectors eventually catch on-and think fondly of the trees we're saving as we silently grind our teeth.

Songs in the Key of Tofu: Cho Dang Gol
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE

***CONTENT
 Koreatown's considerable bustle may orbit around the cramped little block of 32nd between 5th and 6th Avenues, but I'm starting to think that its true culinary center of gravity might actually reside three blocks directly north of there on 35th Street. Our long-time favorite classic Korean restaurant, Han Bat, sits on the block, as do Hyo Dong Gak, the on-again-off-again Hang Suh Garden, and perhaps the most inventive restaurant in the neighborhood, Cho Dang Gol. While Cho Dang Gol does offer traditional favorites like Gob Dol Bi Bim Bap, Jap Chae, and Bul Ko Ki, the majority of the restaurant's menu features creative glosses on Kangwon provincial countryside cooking, most of which include at least a smidgen of freshly-prepared tofu (doo boo). If you're a tofu-phobe, Chef Kim Bong Ok is convinced that she can change your mind, and to be quite honest, she is probably right. At the very least, you'll walk away with a new understanding that the rubbery blocks on sale in the supermarket are nothing like fresh handmade bean curd. The difference is stark- much like the comparison between a loaf of bagged bread and a crusty, just-baked loaf from an artisan baker. The texture of Cho Dang Gol's firm tofu is dense but still pliant, just like a chilled terrine might be, and its taste?- sweet, a little nutty, and just vaguely minerally. Such a flavor profile is a perfect match for spicy heat, as borne out by the Mo Doo Boo Ojing Oh Bok Um ($17.95), a squid, onion, and thick rice noodle dish that is served with four generous wedges of the restaurant's signature tofu. The peppery red sauce on the dish packs a decent amount of fiery heat, especially on the sautéed onions, but it is never overpowering. For $5.95, you can order extra tofu, and after quickly running out of my own bean curd during my meal this weekend, I'll attest to the wisdom of ordering extra- especially if you're sharing dishes, as HungryMan and I were with our old friends KTMS and Tigger. HungryMan and KTMS shared one of Cho Dang Gol's Special Casseroles, the Son Bol Go Ki Jun Gol ($34.95, intended for two people). All Special Casseroles are prepared table-side by the waitstaff, a process that can take ten minutes or more. Even more impressive than watching the cooking is the kitchen staff's attention to timing- all of our dishes were finished within 30 seconds of one another and delivered to the table at the same time- no easy feat when half of the mains are bubbling away in the dining room, out of the chef's reach. Both KTMS and HungryMan enjoyed this reinterpretation of Bul Go Ki, but both also commented that the beef broth in their casserole was a bit too sweet, perhaps from too much rice wine. That said, HungryMan loved the double-noodle idea of combining rice cakes (essentially disc-shaped rice noodles) with the curly ramen-style noodles in the dish. The starchiness of the ramen, in particular, worked beautifully with the thinly sliced sirloin. Tigger's Buh Sut Gob Dol ($14.95), made up of steamed rice generously topped with a mushroom and beef stew, arrived in an intensely hot black stone bowl that was nearly as hot when we left the restaurant as when it left the kitchen- all the better to generate a crunchy, crispy crust of rice on the bottom. And while the rice itself was just right, this dish left us all a little cold in other ways. First was the cardinal sin of putting surimi where crabmeat was promised. We don't mind crab-stick, as long as it is sold to us as such. Second was the heaviness of the mushroom and beef stew- if there is one dish on the menu that could really improve with the substitution of tofu for beef, it is this one, especially in a restaurant that makes such divine bean curd. All of us were impressed with Cho Dang Gol's special appetizer, the Gak Saek Jun ($18.95), which consisted of two pancakes each of four varieties: leek and green vegetables, spicy kimchi and pork, tofu with egg and pork, and soybean with vegetables. Our two favorites were the kimchi patty and the leek patty, both of which were not only gratifyingly warm and savory, but also quite clearly original. The spicy kimchi pancake (Boo Choo Pa Jun), especially, had us seriously considering ordering another round of appetizers. But we never would have been able to finish them all without neglecting Cho Dang Gol's superb banchan (little dishes of condiments and small snacks). The very lightly-fried zucchini and cucumber banchan slices was easily one of the best things we ate that night. I'd pay for that little dish alone. But the other banchan were nearly as good: sweet wedges of gently-spiced and pickled daikon, salty beans with tiny dried fish (which made us all want beer), crimson wedges of braised mackerel in kochujang sauce, and of course, homemade kimchi, which was at once briny and tart, hitting exactly the right proportion of each. I'd love to see a tofu dish as part of the banchan, a little teaser to entice the bean curd wary, and perhaps to make the point that Cho Dang Gol is not a typical Korean restaurant that survives on the strength of its Bi Bim Bap. If you want the greatest hits of Korean cuisine, go next door or even down to Koreatown's main drag three blocks south, but if you want a taste of innovation, it's here. Just look for the doo boo. Cho Dang Gol, 55 West 35th Street (near 6th Avenue), 212-695-8222

Apres Ski without the Lift Ticket: Aspen

***CONTENT
 Sometimes the best tonic for the ever-increasing chill in the air isn't a tropical fantasy that leaves you pining for sand and suntan lotion. Instead, try embracing the frost. And if getting in touch with your inner Cold Miser sounds appealing, we've got the solution: a few hours in a modern reinterpretation of a 1970's-era ski lodge. Rough-cut wood and lucite stag heads might not sound like the keys to a Zen peace with nippy weather, but Nosher and I both felt ourselves coming to terms with the approach of winter after a visit to 22nd Street's Aspen. This high-concept bar and restaurant celebrated its one-year anniversary this Thursday, and we gladly accepted an invitation to the festivities. Both of us were charmed by the vast, cauldron-like fireplace that takes up a sizeable proportion of the back room- just like an apres-ski cabin in the bar/restaurant's namesake town, it attracts mostly fabulous, see-and-be-seen customers. But without the slopes nearby, the space becomes more after-hours than apres-schuss. Drinks are a little more complicated than the hot chocolate and cider you might expect; but they just manage to fall on the good side of fussy. The Guavita ($12) is vegetal and sweet, with shreds of torn fresh basil, guava juice and Patron silver vodka. The Grilled Peach and Tequila Sangria ($12, our favorite, at left) has a Whole Foods aisle worth of fruit in it-oranges, cherries, lemons, and peaches. But the drink's best feature is the interplay it hosts between the subtle char on the peaches and a hint of chipotle. The unusual combination helps make this cocktail a complex and very appealing drink. As we drank and warmed ourselves by the fire, we also managed to grab a few bites of the restaurant's starters. Both of us enjoyed the Bison Sliders ($12), adorable mini-burgers accented with a tiny strip of bacon and served on brioche buns. We weren't as taken with the Tangy BBQ Chicken Lollipops, which at $11 were more like skimpy, dry satay skewers. But Nosher's favorite snack of the evening, the Potato Gratin & Shrimp Quesadilla ($11), featuring a melting disc of fresh mozzarella and a smooth, smokey pesto (and a surprise shiitake mushroom, to boot) easily made up for the shopworn chicken. Our plan is to return to Aspen (this one, of course) after the year's first snowfall, right at the point when we're feeling the bite of the city's notorious winter temperatures at their depressing worst; we'll sit at a table by the fire, studiously avoid rubbing up against the walls-splinters!-and just count our blessings that we don't need to worry about buying a lift ticket. Aspen, 30 West 22nd Street, at Fifth Avenue. 212-645-5040

Blossom, On Its Own Merits

***CONTENT
 Eating a meal with vegan friends is an experience that reminds us omnivores just how spoiled for choice we are in a city like New York- we can go into just about any neighborhood in town and find five or six restaurants capable of serving a fantastic meal, whereas our vegan pals are lucky to find two or three acceptable choices per borough. So we've made a personal commitment to sniff out the options and steer our herbivorous friends to the places where the tofu and tempeh are at their very finest. And that's not as easy as it sounds. There are plenty of vegan and vegetarian eateries in town with high aspirations but seriously mediocre or hit-or-miss cooking (Candle 79, I'm looking at you), and relatively few that manage to make meatless culinary magic happen on a regular basis. In fact, until last year at around this time, after a year of eating too much lackluster seitan, we were skeptical that a consistently high-quality vegan eatery existed in Gotham. But we very quickly changed our minds after our friend Pisces hired Blossom to cater her wedding. The catered dinner was a revelation, not to mention an event that allowed us to taste our way through most of the restaurant's appetizer menu. Since that day, we have not only looked forward to taking our vegan friends out for a meal, but- and this is the real shocker- we've gone back ourselves for dinner with nary a plant-muncher in tow. So when our old friends Sunny and Baba, both ultra-strict vegans came to town a few weeks ago, making dinner reservations was, for once, the easiest part of the evening. We sat in the center of Blossom's dimly candle-lit dining room and promptly went through 20 minutes of \"Vegan Choice Panic\" (VCP), a syndrome that affects people who usually only have one or two menu options, as they discover that they'll have to read descriptions of at least a dozen dishes, all of which they can eat. The waitstaff at Blossom seems to be well equipped to deal with VCP-afflicted diners- they are very good about stopping by occasionally and asking ever so gently if a party is ready to order. And eventually, we were. Sunny ordered the savory seitan with herbed potatoes, green beans, and creamy garlic dressing ($19, pictured top), a dish that reminded me a bit of a summery chicken stew. All of us loved the tender seitan, and I was particularly fond of how the chunks of potato soaked up the aromatic broth. The textures here were also well-considered, with the gentle snap of the beans contrasting with the fluffy white potatoes and toothsome seitan. I expected the same quality from my own dinner, the seitan and eggplant risotto ($19, above), but found pleasure only in the light, slightly-smoky flavor of the seitan slices. Unfortunately, my risotto was heavily oversalted- so much so that HungryMan remarked that he was relieved we were not drinking the restaurant's pricey Voss water ($7/large bottle). In the end, it made very little difference, as we all ended up nibbling off of Baba's plate throughout the meal. His order, the seitan medallions with capers, polenta, and broccoli rabe ($18) was the standout dish of the evening. While there is no disputing that his dish was also on the savory end of the spectrum, the salinity was balanced by the soft and...well, creamy mashed potatoes. Yet somehow, it was all entirely dairy-free. Go figure. HungryMan's entrée, the sweet and sour braised tofu wedges with couscous ($15) was also very good. His (and my) favorite part of the dish was its soft-cooked cauliflower florets, especially when these were dipped in a little of the tofu's sweet glaze. The couscous does not appear to be on Blossom's menu any longer, but we'd like to see it return, as it was a very welcome alternative to brown rice- almost a vegan dining cliché. Our only complaint about this dish is that it was a bit dry, especially with the couscous acting as a dessicating agent, sucking up every bit of moisture from the nearby vegetables. Just a little broth or sauce would have made this dish into a clear winner. When the time came for dessert, we had another moment of VCP, resolved quickly by HungryMan's quick intervention. We sampled two desserts: the phyllo berry tart with maple cream custard ($9), as well as the chocolate sponge cake with coffee sauce and peanut butter filling ($8). I have no shame in admitting that I still think about that sponge cake dessert late at night, as I'm drifting off. The maple cream tart was solidly good, if a bit too sweet, but the chocolate sponge cake was rich and yielding, and most surprising of all for a vegan baked item- light! The peanut filling, coffee sauce, and sexy unadvertised drizzle of caramel oozing goo over the top and sides gave this treat at least a dozen parallel dimensions of flavor. The fact that this dessert could hold its own in any restaurant is the truest testament to the quality of Blossom's cooking- if a vegan restaurant can make one of the best desserts we've eaten this year, they're clearly doing something right, dietary restrictions be damned. Blossom, 187 9th Avenue (between 21st and 22nd Streets), 212-627-1144

Thanks so much for this review. I'd never heard of this restaurant before, and I considered myself a knowledgeable NYC/foodie/vegan. It's great that people with high standards apply those to vegan restaurants as well. As a vegan, I will never say something tastes good unless it really does- this can only help the cause. Cheers!

Hey, thanks for the omnivore's perspective on VCP. I'm a veg and hate to nag regular folks that vegan food (and desserts) can be satisfying to all. Instead of telling someone “hey, here’s a great vegetarian casserole,” I like to say “This is a great casserole!” Thanks for keeping an open but measured opinion about your vegan dining experience. I can't wait to see more veg/omnivore crossover restaurants without the cliche brown rice (which I happen love, but good call on your part!) and granola decor that can deter the normal diner.

Omnivore: Yes, we've eaten at Gobo a few times and have a review coming up soon. Bazu: We're with you- there's no sense in having 2 sets of standards for vegetarian and non-vegetarian food, especially when it all can be done so well. Vanessa: We actually get a big kick out of watching our vegetarian friends pick up a menu where anything is edible to them- it's not unlike bringing a child to FAO Schwartz.

 During the past few months, HungryMan and I have been on a serious blueberry bender. From the instant the berries came into season this August, we've been cooking up blueberry waffles, pancakes, muffins, salads, and even some fruity fish and meat dishes. It has gotten to the point where we've become a little concerned that sooner or later, we're going to end up like poor Violet Beauregarde. But now as the trailing edge of berry season ebbs away, and just as we've reconciled ourselves to the end of this year's berry binge, we've rediscovered the pleasures of blueberry juice. Yes, blueberry juice. It's not as unusual as it sounds- in Eastern and Central Europe, it's a popular drink, and for that reason, some of the city's best and cheapest sources of the stuff are Slavic specialty grocery stores and places like Astoria's Euromarket, where we've found it for as little as $1.99/liter. But there are domestic sources as well, bottlers that are just now packaging the last of this season's super-fresh berries. Of these, our clear favorite is Walnut Acres, whose 100% organic juice costs $4.29/quart at Whole Foods Market. The domestic juice differs from its imported analogues in both its purity and its gorgeous sludginess: the Walnut Acres juice is full of lots of pulp- and therefore fiber- and is best when it is very cold. It is also a superb mixer, as we discovered through lots of tinkering over the past few months. Our favorite cocktail made with the stuff is the Blueberry Mojito, a non-traditional take on the minty classic. The drink works because of what we've come to think of as the Transitive Property of Culinary Linkages: If blueberries and lime are a wonderful combination, and lime and mint are a perfect match, then blueberries and mint are probably good together. No, it's not always a reliable hypothesis, but in this case, it works splendidly. There are a few recipes out in the world for a similar drink made with fresh blueberries, but quite frankly, if it's not late summer/early autumn, the berries aren't worth using. Blueberry juice, on the other hand, retains the vast majority of the blueberries' original flavor, and with its longer shelf life, the juice is easier to keep in stock than are a few rare punnets of non-seasonal fruit. And if the choice comes down to a bland little blue nugget versus rich and just barely tannic juice, I know which I'd choose. The Violet Beauregarde Mojito 4 full measures (6 Tbsp./4 oz.) rum 18-20 mint leaves one lime, sliced in half 1 heaping Tbsp. white sugar 4-6 oz. blueberry juice ice cubes or crushed ice seltzer water or club soda (optional) Muddle lime halves, mint leaves, and sugar in the bottom of a shaker using a paddle or wooden spoon. Juice the lime well and be sure to bruise the mint leaves thoroughly. Add ice cubes or crushed ice, rum, and juice. Shake well, strain, and serve over ice cubes or crushed ice. Add lime wedges and mint to the serving glasses. Top with a few ounces of club soda or seltzer for a fizzier mojito. Makes 2 cocktails. 2006 nycnosh.com

Delicious! I love it! http://xf3.xanga.com/0cda96e34663572581665/m48879082.jpg I went to a house party in August and the hostess's roommate whipped these up. I believe the recipe was almost the same except I think he used maple syrup or honey? It was definitely not sugar... unless I was already too drunk to remember (which is entirely possible, he came to the party about 2 hours into it, heh).

But the sugar is what makes the muddling happen- without its abrasive properties, it's nearly impossible to bruise the mint and crush the lime pulp without lots of elbow grease. Those do look great though, yvo!

On the Avenue of the Other Americas, It's Lali

***CONTENT
 Tenth Avenue from 43rd Street north to about 58th Street is home to some of Manhattan's best affordable ethnic cuisine. Standouts like Queen of Sheba and Desi Deli certainly fall into this category, but the best restaurants on this little strip are Latin American: Tulcingo del Valle, the fabulous Tehuitzingo, and our new neighborhood fave, Lali. Calling it new is a little misleading however, as there has been a restaurant serving Dominican food on this site for nearly 50 years. But only in the past 8 years, since Lali (short for Gladys) took the place over and renamed the former Felix Coffee Shop after herself, has the restaurant really blossomed and grown into the efficient and bustling business it is today. You may have walked by Lali dozens of times and never noticed it, at least not until it was repainted a very perky saturated chartreuse. And the anonymity is partly by design- the clientele for the restaurant is and has always been primarily Midtown workers (mostly Dominican) who live in other boroughs and who come to the little café for authentic, traditional Dominican cooking. So while Lali isn't exactly a secret dining spot, people do hear about it exclusively through word of mouth- a rarity today in a world with resources like Chowhound. This sub rosa popularity also frees Lali from having to work hard at promoting itself- \"If you're Dominican, you know about Lali,\" I was told. And for good reason, as Chilena and I discovered last week. Lali's lunch menu is a simple one: any day of the week, you can order pollo al horno (baked chicken, $5.50) or carne guisada (Dominican beef stew, $7.00). In addition, every day features two or three more specials, dishes that vary from rabio guisado (ox tail stew , $7.50) on Tuesdays to patita guisada (pig's feet, $7.00) on Thursdays, as well as one soup special and a fresh-squeezed juice special each day. On Fridays, as you might expect, the menu features fish. As Chilena and I were lucky enough to stop in to Lali on a Friday afternoon, I was able to order the bacalao guisado (salted cod stew, $7.50), a chunky, tomato-based dish featuring enormous pieces of soft potato and rich shreds of cod. Although this stew is originally a Basque-region specialty, most Latin cultures have adapted a version of it. The Dominican version emphasizes the sweet-salty interplay between sautéed onions and brined codfish and keeps other flavors such as bay leaf, adobo, and parsley in the background. And here, it works beautifully- even better when the stew is ladled out over a mound of soft, annato-pigmented rice . Chilena ordered the carne guisada, which at 1:45 p.m. was the only other option, as quite literally every single portion of ropa vieja (shredded beef, $7.50), pescado frito (fried fish, $9.00), and the mondongo (tripe) soup ($4/$6) had been sold. But it took just a single bite to convince us that we shouldn't complain- the stewed meat was so tender that it collapsed when touched with a fork, and the rich odors of sofrito and tomatoes had us both watering at the mouth. I loved the addition of just a few olives to the stew- if you think of this as a meat-based puttanesca sauce with potato chunks in place of pasta, you'll start to get the idea. As we ate, Chilena and I shared a glass of freshly-pressed tamarind juice, perhaps the neighborhood's biggest bargain at $1.00. The tongue-curlingly tangy juice was a perfect accompaniment to our lunch. I should admit that, had I been able to, I probably would have downed a glass or two of red wine with the meal, but I'm glad now that I didn't have the chance- I might have missed the sweet and pulpy tamarind nectar that Lali makes herself while chatting with customers at the front of the restaurant. We talked with Lali ourselves towards the end of our visit and started to understand how her vision for the restaurant is simply to see it as an extension of her own home kitchen- people come looking for the kind of Dominican comfort food they might get at home, and that is precisely what she gives them. And if she runs out of food along the way-and given how good her cooking is, it should come as no surprise that this happens every day- her customers just smile and take whatever the restaurant still has available. In that regard, this is a very unusual New York restaurant: whining about shortages will get you nowhere, and there is always someone standing near the doorway, willing to take your barstool...and your bacalao. Lali Restaurant, 630 10th Avenue (at 45th Street), 212-664-1507

My People Call it Maze: Julia in the Cornstalks

***CONTENT
 It's over a three-hour drive from New York, but Sunderland, Massachusetts might be the closest you'll ever get to Julia Child. For a few more weeks this month, you can wander through 7 acres of dessicated cornstalks cut and mowed into the shape of America's all-time favorite TV chef. There she stands, caught in the middle of a lusty laugh and about to thwack something with a mallet. Cutting a maze into a slice of the Warner Family Farm is part of a long-standing late summer tradition here; past mazes have been created in the shapes of King Tut, Albert Einstein, and, in honor of the 2004 Presidential campaign, the smiling faces of candidates Kerry and Bush. This year, Mike's Maze was cut and opened up to the public in July, and by this point in the season, after a few months in stalk-withering heat and little kids straying from the paths, poking through poor Julia's sinus cavity, the maze is no longer at its pristine best. However, the recent spate of wet weather has revived things considerably, and with the temperatures as warm as they have been lately, the maze is still worth a visit. If you go, you'll be given a map with positions of 20 markers located at different points in the maze (the above picture was taken at one such one marker, just inside Julia's right fist): these landmarks are crucial to navigating around and, critically, back out again. Maze markers are also clues to a 'French Menu Game' that is as much fun for grown-ups as it is for kids: players have to find clue cards labeled with the English names of dishes from Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and then match clues to a numbered French menu given to guests upon their entrance to the maze. It's good fun, made especially so by running around with excited local kids and their French-challenged parents, all panicking to figure out what cervelles au beurre noir might mean. It's also a kick to look around and realize, from the map and from the shape of the pathways, that you happen to be standing in, say, Julia's kitchen shears or hair. Because the maze is primarily a portrait and not a labyrinth, it's harder than you think to get lost- although it does happen; just ask the woman I met who spent 15 minutes unable to escape from Julia's sleeve. On the other hand, if wandering about in a maize maze isn't your thing, the farm also hosts a small petting zoo, pony rides, and a snack bar serving cider and cake on the site. So why Julia? Mike Wisseman hasn't given too many clues other than that she was a graduate of nearby Smith College, and most importantly, she remains an important national character who seems to inspire nearly unanimous affection. (Mike discusses his choices in an NPR story that aired in July- you can listen to it by clicking here. ) On reflection, Mike is more right than he knows; Julia's boundless enthusiasm and childlike curiosity about food is a perfect match for such a lighthearted seasonal event. Yet I couldn't help but be reminded of one of Nosher's and my favorite books of the year, My Life in France, an autobiography (written with Julia's grand-nephew Alex Prud'homme) about her love affair with France and her slow-but-steady transformation into a bestselling author and television celebrity. There's nothing in her memoir about mazes carved into cornfields, but enough of Julia's warm and passionate personality is reflected in the playful joy of the place to make you know that, were she still around, she would surely approve. Bon appetit! Mike's Maze, Sunderland, Massachusetts, 413-665-8331. Detailed directions and information are available at: www.mikesmaze.com. Open Saturdays & Sundays 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. through the end of October.

That sounds really interesting. In Queens (border of LI) there's a farm that does a Maize Maze around now. I did it last year and it was pretty hard. But this one looks even harder.

Wind, Wine & Water on the Shearwater

 Cruising around New York Harbor on an 83-foot yacht, sipping ice-cold New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, it is hard not to feel a little bit like Simon LeBon on the set of a Duran Duran video. But then the Statue of Liberty comes into view, and you realize with a sense of amazement that you're just a mile or two from home and not slicing through the choppy waters of Antigua. Yes, it is mid-October, and yes, this is traditionally the end of the sailing season, but thanks to a warm early autumn and a wine importer with a taste for the waves, two more opportunities remain in '06 for some nautical nosh & slosh. Chilena and I were invited to attend the first of the Shearwater's Fall 'Tasting & Yachting' events this past Sunday, courtesy of Glamourite's Jasmine. Each of this month's three scheduled tastings features wines from Frederick Wildman & Bros. importers, and each of these themed sunset cruises is hosted by the very affable Felicia Sherbert, author of The Unofficial Guide to Selecting Wine. During our sail, Felicia poured six southern hemisphere wines-three whites and three reds-taking lots of time to chat about the vino with all the participants and to answer questions. Despite the tasting's decidedly genteel context, we were pleased to discover that price points on the bottles we sampled range from $8 to $18 retail, with most coming in at around $15. After quaffing all six of the evening's wines, Chilena and I found three favorites: the 2005 Michel Torino Don David Torrontes from Argentina, the 2005 Glazebrook New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, and the 2004 Broquel Malbec (also from Argentina, natch.). The Malbec was the night's biggest surprise, both for its relatively high $15 pricetag-expensive for a Malbec, as well as for its uncharacteristic but pleasant smoky and spicy notes. But honestly, I'd buy any of these three wines in a shop. The final two Tasting & Yachting events on the Shearwater run on the 22nd and 25th of October and highlight Spanish and French wines, respectively. At $95 per person (plus a tip for the crew), which includes wine, cheese, soft drinks, and hot cider, these Fall sailing excursions are less expensive than some terrestrial wine sampling events. And while you won't be tasting any $100 bottles on the Shearwater, the view of Manhattan from the Hudson Bay and the cool twilight breezes more than compensate.

Remaining Swiss on the Zagat Survey

***DATE
2006-10-13 12:52:00
***CONTENT
 Zagat-no matter how you pronounce it-is probably the most important surname in the restaurant business today. Tim and Nina Z.'s international guidebooks have grown from a cottage (or Manhattan studio apartment, more accurately) industry into a self-publishing Leviathan whose estimated value currently hovers around a half-billion dollars. Regardless of what you think of Zagat's \"colorful\" and \"loose interpretation\" of the \"rules of punctuation,\" there are millions of people around the world who use the guides, not to mention the 250,000 who contribute to them. But, pace Elvis, can 50 million Zagat Survey fans be wrong? Yes and no. In parallel with its explosive growth over the past 28 years, the Zagat Survey has become a cultural whipping boy for the chow-loving set. In some snobbish circles, even possessing a slim maroon volume is considered déclassé and grounds for ostracism, or at least for never being allowed to voice an opinion on where to eat. One rationale for scapegoating Tim & Nina's survey goes something like this: contributors tend to vote for safe, middle-of-the-road restaurants, further favoring unadventurous dishes, and in the process, this conspires to create a normalizing effect on the quality of cooking. According to some, on the pages of the Zagat Survey is where culinary clichés are born. Clearly, it's hard to deny that this is at least partly true when eateries like Peter Luger's manage to retain an iron grip on the survey's top ranking. All it takes is one read-through to see that, in general, the Zagat guide rewards cautious creativity, glitz, and truffles- pretty much in any form. From a methodological perspective, we certainly take issue with the idea that any aesthetic evaluation can be averaged- it is impossible to justify the statistically crucial claim that the difference between a 30-point and a 29-point restaurant is the same as that between a 20-pointer and a 21-pointer. But sloppy stats aside, the Zagat Survey still possesses a number of redeeming features. Foremost among these is its vast scope. It compensates a bit for the fact that any one person cannot know every restaurant, every neighborhood, and every dish, no matter how much s/he eats. Believe us, we've tried. And supposing you assume, ungenerously, that the Zagat guide makes the right call only 1/100 times, you'll still find 20 undisputed winners in the 2007 edition that was released this past Wednesday. Even ignoring the bulk of the quanititative analysis (as HungryMan and I do), there remains quite a bit of useful information in the qualitative data the guide offers. But most importantly, we promise we won't tell your friends if you buy one.

I agree with your characterization of the Zagat guide. (See also my post about restaurant recommendations, Zagat, and what they OUGHT to be doing with that data: http://somethinktochewon.blogspot.com/2006/10/restaurant-recommendations.html ) People certainly do respond to surveys in very different ways, and the fact that different subsets of people rate any given restaurant means that you can't necessarily compare a 23 for a pizza place in the Bronx with a 23 for a French place on the UES. This said, I agree with you that as is, it's a fairly comprehensive and useful starting point, to be supplemented with other resources. I also agree that their methodology rewards cautious creativity. Oh, also, the first comment on The Food Section's posting about the Zagat is hillarious. http://www.thefoodsection.com/foodsection/2006/10/2007_zagat_surv.html

Using a system such as Zagat is good for judging how many people visit a restaurant. However, beyond that, it is pretty useless.

Mary's Fish Camp, Going Its Own Way
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-10-11 18:43:00
***CONTENT
 2000 was a banner year for seafood in the West Village- that's when Mary Redding left Pearl Oyster Bar to open her own restaurant. In a much-storied act of gustatory mitosis, Mary's Fish Camp was born, looking for all the world like an uncannily-similar cousin of Pearl's. Since then, it's hard to find a reference to one that doesn't mention the other- they've become forever entangled in history like Sonny Bono & Cher. Since the split, both restaurants have attracted throngs of devotees who insist with messianic fervor that one or the other is New York City's truest and purest crustacean destination. As for us? We're torn. Never dogmatic when it comes to shellfish, HungryMan and I have decided to declare our divided loyalties. When it comes to lobster rolls, we do like Mary's- they're large, meaty, and served on a pretty wonderful bun- but overall, we still give the edge here to Pearl Oyster Bar. The same holds true for salads and white wine. But being the open-minded eaters we are, we recognize absolutely that Mary's trumps Pearl on a few fronts. Most notably, appetizers, where the lobster knuckles ($9) alone deliver the knockout blow. Knuckles are the claw section of a lobster between its pincers and thorax-they're a little too time-consuming for the lobster roll-makers to crack and pick, so Mary's salvages these still-meaty joints and serves them cold, with lemon and clarified butter. Yes, it is true that they're fiddly and labor intensive, but they are profoundly delicious and worth ten times the effort they actually demand. We're not the only ones who think so- the restaurant has run out of them every time we've visited. So order a portion the instant you're seated, otherwise your neighbor will beat you to the punch. I'm also a fan of Mary's raw appetizers: in particular, the Wellfleet Little Neck Clams ($9 for 6 clams)-these are just about the freshest molluscs you'll find in Manhattan. Perhaps the most telling fact about them is that they're so briny and clean that I rarely doctor them with the perfectly good sweet-tangy horseradish sauce that accompanies them-but really, these clams need no help whatsoever. The Malpeque Oysters ($12), something of a signature bivalve for Mary's Fish Camp, are also gorgeously cold and always, always fresh. Whole fish are another house specialty at Mary's, and from what we've tasted, they deserve to be. Offered as mains, there are regularly four or five types of freshly-caught whole fish available broiled or deep-fried for about $25. On our most recent visit last week, HungryMan opted for the deep-fried daurade (a.k.a. dorado, sea bream, or porgy), which arrived coated in a peppery batter. Inside, the fish was flaky and steaming. Whole fish, when prepared well, are a delight to eat, and at Mary's this is incontrovertibly the case. We even sat and eavesdropped as our neighbor at an adjacent table took great joy in introducing his dining companion to the pleasures of whole fish, teaching her how to loosen the meat from the sides and more importantly, from the cheek. And we understood completely- when the fish is this good, you don't want to let a single milligram of it go to waste. For my own main dish, I ordered the grilled 1-1/2 lb. lobster, a bargain at $25. I'm never squeamish about steaming or boiling a lobster, but slicing it down the middle before cooking is just a little beyond the pale for me, so I rely on braver souls to do the chopping, and Mary's cooks do a fine job of it. We've watched them prepare these lobsters from the vantage point of a bar stool at the boomerang-shaped counter-a perfect place to observe and learn how to do the job. The lobsters are brushed generously with olive oil, split, and then laid flat on the grill, where they cook, often still twitching a bit, until the legs and the tips of the grapplers start to char slightly. Then it's straight onto a plate with some drawn butter, and then immediately to your seat. This is simple preparation, to be sure, but the difference in flavor between steamed and grilled lobsters is enough to make you think you're eating a different food entirely. The smokiness of the lobster meat is even further enhanced by the green pea griddle cakes served as a side dish with the lobster. Frankly, these sweet little green flapjacks deserve to be on the menu by themselves. We still wonder how the West Village got so lucky, ending up with not just one, but two of the best seafood eateries in Gotham. And while Mary's and Pearl are very subway-accessible, we'll keep secretly hoping for a Fantasia-like fission of seafood restaurants in the Pearl Oyster Bar/Mary's Fish Camp mold, each one splitting into two more little restaurants, until- and we're crossing our fingers for this- the entire city is ready to be dipped in clarified butter.

 Vegetarian restaurants in New York can be divided pretty neatly into two camps: one group stands proudly independent of any meat-mimicry, focusing its attention on creating food that exists entirely free of any culinary references to flesh; the other group is notable mostly for its enthusiasm for replicating familiar meat dishes, spawning protein-based concoctions such as mock-shrimp and chicken, mock-duck (sometimes unappetizingly called 'muck' or 'luck'), and that perennial favorite, 'fakin' bacon.' Vegetarian Paradise II in Greenwich Village proudly counts itself among the latter group, making an ongoing project of producing a huge array of carni-facsimiles of everything from fried calamari (made with soy protein and flavored with sea-water), orange beef, beef with broccoli and tenderloin tips (all textured soy protein), and even Mississippi-style pork chops made from grilled soy cutlets. There's a vague Asian theme here, although with paella, corn chowder, and Texas fried chicken on the menu, you'll find nearly as much East as West. We were first introduced to VPII by our cousin Pluck, who, while not a vegetarian herself, told us about the restaurant's well-known soul chicken dish with near-evangelical zeal. \"It's just the best I've eaten; I like it better than real chicken,\" she trumpeted. Always skeptical of superlatives but eager to investigate them, we vowed to taste for ourselves. And we did- twice. Then we decided it was time to write about the place. The restaurant's close proximity to the IFC Center (a favorite of ours) ought to have made a recent taste-test convenient for us, either pre- or post-moviegoing. Trouble was, VPII closed its doors for several months for renovations, only reopening on a permanent basis this Labor Day. Worse, the restaurant posted no explanation for its closure, leaving only a tiny sign on the metal doors recommending that hungry diners head for its sister restaurant, the Dragonfly, around the corner (the owners also run Red Bamboo, just down the street on West Fourth). When VPII did reopen last month-looking puzzlingly similar to its old self, save for some spiffy new lighting and a fresh coat of paint, we were ready. On this visit, as on others, our appetizers were decidedly mixed. The soul chicken (or more accurately: the 'World Famous Crispy Soul Chicken™', $5.95) was indeed quite good, just as Cousin Pluck had reported: chewy, bite-sized pieces of soy protein, breaded with a very spicy mix of panko, rosemary, basil, oregano, and hot pepper flakes. As an approximation of chicken, this had a few faults: you won't find dense flesh that pulls apart in steaming strips here. On the other hand, the 'chicken' was pleasantly chewy on its own terms. The panko-fueled crunch and smoky-mustard dipping sauce served alongside gave this dish a complexity that we've come to appreciate on its own, regardless of whether we're supposed to think we're eating poultry. Given the soul chicken's popularity, VPII offers this dish as both a larger entrée ($11.95) and as a chicken salad ($8.95). I do think, however, there can be too much of a good thing, and the soul chicken is probably best as a small plate. Our other appetizer was a a plate of hoisin rolls ($3.00 for two), crispy spring rolls filled with matchsticks of mixed vegetables and thin slices of seitan. The rolls had a hint of sweetness from the hoisin sauce baked inside, but unfortunately, theywere, on the whole, far from revelatory- these were simply standard-variety, greasy spring rolls that could have just as easily been reheated from frozen. Main courses on VPII's truly extensive menu run the gamut from noodles to clay pots filled with pressed bean curd and seaweed. After a few visits and a few tastes of less-successful faux-flesh, we've found that VPII does some things better than others. We've found, for example, that in general, you are safer with mock chicken dishes than with almost anything else on the menu. The soul chicken bears this theory out of course, but the real proof is in the mango chicken ($11.95), composed of slices of soy protein that genuinely do resemble chicken. Served with sections of sweet, ripe mango and red bell peppers in two hollowed-out mango shells, the presentation of this dish is eye-poppingly colorful, and the interplay between the sweet mango and the tangy Thai-inspired citrus marinade is a delight. After a few bites, Nosher commented that he had forgotten that he was eating vegetarian food. Score one for verisimilitude. On the other hand-and there always seems to be an other hand at VPII-our order of 'Paradise Turkey' ($10.95) reminded us more of a science experiment gone wrong than of warm memories of Thanksgiving dinner. The 'turkey' in this case was compressed millefeuille-like stacks of tofu skin, which tasted about as good as it sounds. The discs of 'turkey' fell apart into thin, endoplasmic reticulum-like ribbons at the touch of a fork, making this dish exceptionally hard to eat. Oddly, the gravy for the turkey was soy-based, which put the dish at an even further remove from the Thanksgiving meal it was intended to resemble. The more passable garlic mashed potatoes and mediocre cranberry sauce (probably canned) did little to salvage the meal. In the end, The turkey went largely uneaten, and I fought Nosher for what was left of the mango chicken. As we left, I wondered aloud whether VPII could really be a paradise for vegetarians. Perhaps, but there's serious danger of getting stuck in limbo for all eternity with that fake turkey. The path to VPII's version of Shangri-la, we decided, is clearly signposted- just look for the the word 'chicken.' Vegetarian Paradise II, 144 West 4th Street (at 6th Avenue), 212-260-7130

Aiming for the Sweet Spot at Bubby's Brooklyn

***CONTENT
 As a brunch destination, Bubby's in DUMBO has a few things working in its favor. First is its location: right on the edge of the water overlooking Manhattan, Bubby's sits in the very heart of arguably one of the cutest neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Second is its massively capacious dining room. The roller rink sized space is, quite simply, vast, with enough room for you, all of your friends, plus the entire cast and crew of Xanadu. This is a serious plus in a town where brunch waiting times routinely run 60-90 minutes at tiny local favorites such as the 9th Street Market and Good Enough To Eat. Third, and not unrelated to its second strength, is Bubby's kid-friendly ethos: children are welcome here, as evidenced by the fact that every third table we saw this Sunday had at least one booster chair parked alongside. When kids make noise in the cavernous dining room, it doesn't make too much of a difference—the place is already clamoring. Yet ultimately—inevitably—the quality of the food is what matters. And at Bubby’s, it’s OK…just. Some dishes are wonderful, while others are only passably decent. HungryMan’s Fried Oyster Po-Boy, for example, was edible, but not much more. It was a spectre of the delectable po-boy we ate at the Reef Grill in Juno Beach, Florida the week before, and about half as large. Bubby’s version also suffered from a lack of seasoning—we couldn’t tell if there was any sauce at all on the sandwich without pulling it apart, and the cornmeal batter on the oysters themselves was just plain bland. The two best things on the plate were the juicy slice of tomato on the sandwich and the tangy red cabbage and carrot cole slaw. Our good friend Dolin’s Smoked Trout and Horseradish Cream Scramble, confusingly listed as both a Brunch Special and an entrée on the regular menu, was better, but was still nothing spectacular. We all loved the smoked fish, which was flaky and not overly smoky, but the eggs themselves were dry and overcooked in parts, and the horseradish cream sauce was considerably less peppy that we imagined it would be. The potato hash, while nicely browned, was just a little too greasy to work well with the already heavy egg dish. By far, the best dish we sampled was a Sunday special: the Swedish Pancakes with Local Peach and Berry Compote. When they’re prepared well, Scandinavian pancakes are flat and elastic, with just enough springiness to remind you that you’re not eating a tortilla. Bubby’s were no exception: golden brown and dusted with powdered sugar, I could have eaten eight or ten of them. The compote too, made up of large, ultra-lush chunks of peach and blackberry, was absolutely magnificent. Perhaps it should come as no surprise to anyone that Bubby’s best dish was its sweetest—the restaurant is renowned for its pies and cakes. I’ll also go out on a limb and guess that children, some of Bubby’s most valued customers, tend to order desserts, waffles, and pancakes more than its more savory offerings. Which leaves us wondering if the key to a successful brunchtime visit to Bubby’s isn’t to go for the sweet stuff. We’d love to see them shore up their other dishes a bit, but as long as the kids are happy—and who’d hear them complain in this dining room?—they’ve gone a long way towards satisfying at least part of their target demographic. Bubby’s Brooklyn, 1 Main Street (between Water and Washington Streets in DUMBO), 718-222-0666

A New Interpretation of 'Fast Food': Lucky's Famous Burgers

***CONTENT
 Not eating for an entire day isn't as difficult as birthing a child or writing a novel, but like both of those things, it takes a little preparation. So when HungryMan and I started planning for this weekend's one-day fast, we gave serious thought to minimizing the anticipated hunger pangs. Our plan wasn't a radical one: we would locate the most filling food we could find and eat a very large quantity of it so that we would be sated at least for the few evening hours before bed. But what to eat? For pure belly bloating efficiency, Polish food, with its focus on dense dumplings, butter, and heavy cuts of boiled meats generally fits the bill nicely, but our favorite Polish café, Lomzynianka, was a long subway ride away from where we would be at the start of the fast. As we pondered our Hell's Kitchen options, we came up with a few candidates, but none stood out in day-glo orange clarity like Lucky's Famous Burgers, a newish hamburger joint on 52nd Street and 9th Avenue. Both of us have eaten at Lucky's before, once immediately after the shop opened up at the beginning of the year, and then once more during one of the hottest days of the summer, when we undertook a desperate search for a chocolate shake. Both times, we've been confused: some menu items were fantastic- the aforementioned shake (which remains as luscious and thick as ever), for example- but others were dull or overseasoned. So we chose this occasion to re-taste Lucky's more popular offerings, hoping that we'd set ourselves up for several hours of satiety in the bargain. HungryMan ordered the plain Lucky Burger ($5), a thick patty of grilled ground beef on a very slightly sweet-tasting bun. The meat itself was juicy without being soggy, but every other bite, HungryMan would mutter, \"Hmm...\" to himself as he chewed. The bemusement, it turned out, came from the flavor of smoke in the burger. At first, we thought it came from the creamy Lucky Sauce, which had a distinct odor and flavor of liquid smoke, but upon further investigation, we found the same smoky taste in the patty itself. On its own, this one strong unexpected flavor probably would have been easy to ignore, but there were nearly a dozen other taste-components in the patty, all competing for attention-only one of which was the meat itself. After a bite or two, we found this overseasoning to be a distraction, not an enhancement. The onion rings ($7 for a double order) were also disappointing. Lucky's serves only big, chunky slices of onion- a point in their favor- but the rings we ate on this visit contained the blandest pieces of onion we've eaten in years, and worst of all, they were overbattered, ending up more like hush puppies than onion rings. Perhaps this was an aberration, as we have eaten Lucky's rings twice before, and they have been far, far better on previous visits. But regardless of history, the onion rings we were served on this visit were shamefully bad. I fared better with the Lucky Fries ($3) that came with my sandwich. These crinkle-cut potatoes were fried quickly and drained well, salted lightly, and served steaming hot. The portion size was quite large as well-unless you're feeding more than three people, you won't need the Double Fries ($5). My Veggie Cheddar Burger ($6) was less impressive, with its grainy and gummy patty that was both too dry around the edges and too wet in the center, and a scabrous slice of salty cheddar cheese that simply refused to melt completely. Strangely, the veggie patty suffered from an equal but opposite seasoning problem as the Lucky Burger's patty- the non-meat version tasted lifeless and flat. Even an extra dose of whatever extra spicing goes into the Lucky Burger would have been a welcome addition here. Despite the fact that this was, by a very long shot, our least satisfying experience at Lucky's Famous Burgers, we ate nearly everything on our plates- except for the onion rings, that is. After all, this meal was as much about pragmatic stomach-stuffing as it was savoring the food we ate. But in the final analysis, perhaps the most revealing fact about our meal at Lucky's is that now, with 20 hours of fasting under my belt as I write this, those photographs of the food aren't making me hungry at all. Lucky's Famous Burgers, 370 West 52nd Street, 212-247-6717

 Over the past few days, we've had nearly 1000 users search our site for our review of Soba Koh. So just in case you're looking for it, here it is- Soba Koh: Subtlety in Buckwheat. All of the recent attention comes, of course, from Peter Meehan's favorable review of the place in this week's Dining In, Dining Out section of the New York Times; we're both really pleased to see the NYT recognize Soba Koh for the delightful little noodle shop it is. It deserves all the attention it gets.

Unbalanced: La Focaccia
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2006-09-29 05:21:00
***CONTENT
 A restaurant that names itself after a type of soft Italian bread sets some high expectations for its bread basket. That La Focaccia falls short on its eponymous offering is a worrying signal that all is not well in this Italian trattoria. This is all the sadder, because when you factor in the restaurant's location at a prime people-watching corner and its mostly modest prices, La Focaccia really ought to qualify as the kind of destination that negates the frustration of getting lost in the West Village's rabbit warren of curvy streets. But in the end, you might be better off if you keep wandering, as we discovered on a recent weekend visit. Our first inauspicious sign came immediately after we were seated, as we reached for what we expected to be the restaurant's signature item: its bread. But what a disappointment: hard, stale, oversalted, and lacking any of focaccia's trademark springiness, its sheer density called to mind lumber, not Liguria. The focaccia was so stale and crispy that even swishing it around in the little bowl of La Focaccia's decent extra virgin simply displaced the oil rather than absorbing it or mopping it up. Unfortunately, the rest of the food we ate at La Focaccia was as uneven as the pavement underneath its sprinkling of plein-air tables, on which small plates seem in constant danger of sliding to the ground. My salad, an insalata di riccia con caprino e pancetta ($10) looked beautiful with long strips of roasted red peppers draped langorously across a mound of frisée lettuce. The lettuce itself was pleasantly fresh and crunchy, yet the salad was underdressed, the pieces of cured Italian bacon (replacing the lardons you might find on this salad's French cousin, salade Lyonnaise) were overcooked and rubbery, and the peppers had that tell-tale taste of citric acid that made us suspect that they had come from a jar, rather than from the brick oven that La Focaccia features so prominently in its dining room. Nosher's caesar salad (insalata di cesare, in Italian, $9) had the opposite problem, in that it was decidedly, gloppily overdressed. La Focaccia's underwhelming focaccia made an unwelcome cameo appearance here in the form of croutons, but there was scant evidence of any fried capers, as promised on the menu. Our main courses also wobbled between the good and the problematic. Nosher's gnocchi ($14.50), ordered in a butter and sage sauce, were manifestly homemade, a point in the restaurant's favor. But gnocchi are notoriously difficult to make, and all too often they are heavy or overcooked; La Focaccia's version was both. We were fortunate that our cranky and harried waitress had by this point removed the bread basket- I don't think our table could have supported the weight of the gnocchi and the bread at the same time. As for the sauce, there was very little sage flavor in evidence (even with the crisped garnish leaf), and with the gnocchi shedding its starch, the base of the deep plate turned quickly into an oleaginous mess. One bright spot at La Focaccia were the grilled meats- my flavorful grilled Italian sausages ($17.50), seemed to come out of a completely different kitchen than the gnocchi, bread, and salads. These well-seasoned and juicy, extra-large salsiccie were split down the middle and spread wide across a shallow puddle of tomato sauce and several lego-sized blocks of polenta. For the quality and amount of food on the plate, this was an excellent value. The polenta was, unfortunately, a real disappointment, tasting slightly acrid and burnt, with an odd, flaky skin that distracted rather than complemented the dish's other textures. Weary from taking part in the balancing act of steadying our outdoor table and reeling from the off-kilter food that kept appearing on top of it, we couldn't bring ourselves to stay for dessert, despite rumors that it is excellent. But who knows? We can certainly imagine ourselves lured back by the siren song of the dining room's floor-to-ceiling picture windows and perfect placement for pedestrian-spotting. Then again, it is hard to muster much enthusiasm to return to an eatery-no matter how scenic- where the cooking is so lazy and where the restaurant's namesake dish is such an utter dud.

 As HungryMan and I left the IFC cinema in the wee hours of last weekend, we passed a couple walking hand-in-hand and turning to stroll down Cornelia Street. The man said to his companion, \"You know, everything you could ever need is right here on Cornelia Street.\" And while this may not be strictly true- especially if you have a fondness for creature comforts like newspapers, clothing, and shampoo- from a culinary perspective, he's got the right idea. On the one-block long stretch of Greenwich Village sit Home, Pearl Oyster Bar, Po, and the restaurant that predates them all: the Cornelia Street Café. Opened in 1977 as a multipurpose performance space and artist's café, Cornelia Street Café still operates both components of the business, encouraging them to evolve in parallel with one another, although the music and acting has moved to a dedicated area downstairs, leaving the street level of the café as the kitchen and dining room. The café is also pretty impossible to miss, with its red-and-white awning extending out over the sidewalk across the width of two or three storefronts. At the same time, with such other stellar eateries so nearby, you'd be forgiven for ignoring the brick café. But then you might never know that inside, among the dozens (upon dozens) of framed landscape paintings, is one of the city's most reliable and affordable French-style bistros. Not everything is strictly a la francaise, however. Cornelia Street Café takes some chances with its specials, as the sweet and aromatic Carrot Cardamom Soup ($6) illustrates. Strained but not quite smooth, this nearly rustic soup was served finished with a few tablespoons of heavy cream. I loved the stick-to-the-spoon texture, as well as the surprising lightness of the broth- despite the root vegetables, this felt very much like a late-summer soup. It also paired gorgeously with the tropical Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc ($28) that HungryMan and I drank. We won't tempt you with a description of the baby spinach, pear, and blue cheese salad ($9) we ordered, given the recent drama over the safety of spinach. However, when the time comes (and it will) when our favorite leafy green makes its comeback, you'd do well to welcome it back with this salad, especially as the very tart cranberry vinaigrette has to be one of the best dressings we've tasted this summer. I also enjoyed the black sesame salmon, a finger-like tranche of pan-fried filleted salmon, coated on one side with crispy sesame seeds. The dish benefited greatly from a perky little kick of ginger in the mustard sauce that dotted both the fish and the nest of steamed carrots and snow peas that lay underneath. I should admit, however, that I did secretly wish that I had ordered HungryMan's main dish, the Steak Frites ($19), if for no other reason than for the gloriously hot and savory french fries that accompanied it. This is certainly not to say that the steak wasn't excellent- it was cooked exactly as requested (medium-rare), and considerably enhanced by the herbed butter creeping as it melted over the steak's grill-scored surface. The restaurant's late-night menu- a truncated version of its longer dinner menu- now only runs until 12:30 a.m., but while the weather is still relatively warm, that is certainly late enough to enjoy a midnight repast on Corneila Street Café's patio and watch the locals wander back home. It may not be everything you'd ever want, but for an autumn evening, it feels like plenty. Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street (near Bleecker), 212-989-9319

We Don't Believe in Lattes: Aroma Espresso Bar
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2006-09-19 17:18:00
***CONTENT
 Whether or not you buy into the stories about how Aroma drove Starbucks out of business in Israel, it's hard not to believe when you see the glam interior of the chain's Houston Street outpost- it looks every square foot like the home of a coffee giant killer. And after nearly $2 million worth of renovations to this, the 74th Aroma Espresso Bar and the first in the US, it should. The distinctive narrow white and red-tiled space looks a bit like a subway station crossed with a spaceship, with lots of glossy dark wood tables and long bar seating set into the storefront's windows. Aroma's menu reads very much like a typical coffee shop's: espresso drinks, iced coffees, and frappés are all present and accounted for... with one glaring omission. On our first visit to Aroma, HungryMan and I planned to order one mocha coffee and one latte, only to be told by the woman at the counter, \"No lattes. We don't believe in lattes.\" Probed to explain further, she demurred and instead suggested that we order their regular au lait coffee. We were puzzled: this isn't about kosher laws; after all, Aroma sells cappuccinos. This made us wonder, does the addition of a little extra steamed milk cause some sort of philosophical disconnect among coffee theorists? How can a coffee shop not 'believe' in lattes? We wound up pondering these weighty questions as we sipped. HungryMan drank the mocha coffee, a rich and sludgy drink with a viscous layer of undissolved chocolate as its base. Tasting more of chocolate than of coffee, this super-thick drink could easily have counted as a dessert. I went with the aforementioned au lait coffee, which was decent, if a little over-roasted. As we drank, we concluded that we would have to suspend any judgment about Aroma until we had both sampled a few dishes from their made-to-order food menu, and of course, tried for another latte. Four days later, we returned for a post-midnight snack, taking advantage of Aroma's 24-hour policy. This time, we had an even stranger experience. When we inquired about lattes, we were told in a sighing, pitying voice, \"No lattes. But if you really insist on it, we can do one.\" How could anyone resist such an invitation? Soviet-style hospitality aside, Aroma had bigger problems that night: every computer in the place was on the fritz when we arrived, which in turn meant that orders had to be taken by hand. Our brusque cashier somehow managed to calculate our bill for two coffee drinks, a sandwich, and a salad to be $40: nearly 200% of what it should have been, and it took a great deal of persuading to convince her that she had made an error. \"Tax!\" she insisted, \"It is tax.\" Eventually, we did manage to get our correct change, collect our food, and find a place to sit- at 2:00 a.m. there are tables aplenty in this normally crowded space. HungryMan ordered the tuna salad bowl, a very hearty dish that could easily have comprised an entire dinner, thanks to its colossal portion of tuna and eggs. Perhaps 'salad' is a misnomer here, as there was very little lettuce in the bowl (there were actually more red onion slices than lettuce leaves): a huge boon if you're famished, but not as much if you're trying to watch your weight. That said, the tuna itself was excellent: very high quality fish with just a little peppery spice, all held together with precious little oil. Both of us enjoyed the salad quite a bit and wished that we had ordered it alone, as it was more than enough for us both to share. We were less impressed with the halloumi sandwich, however. Featuring sliced tomato, plenty of grillled halloumi cheese, cream cheese, and pickles, this sandwich was simply far too salty. The combination of brined pickles and brined cheese, even when cut by mayonnaise and fresh tomato, was overwhelming- I needed nearly a quart of water afterwards. That is a shame, because the textures in this sandwich worked together so beautifully, especially the rubbery cheese and the spongey sweet white bread. If you're tempted as I was by the thought of a snack featuring grilled halloumi cheese, just order the pickles on the side, because while Aroma may not believe in lattes, it clearly has no quibbles at all with salt.

Small Plates, Large Flavors: Bocca Lupo
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Perhaps luck is what the owners of Bocca Lupo, Brooklyn's newest Italian tapas joint, thought they needed when they decided to open in Cobble Hill last month. After all, they named their new restaurant aftter the Italian phrase 'in bocca al lupo,' meaning something close to 'good luck,' or even 'break a leg,' when it's used to inspire courage before a challenging undertaking. And it is apparent that making Bocca Lupo work is going to be no small feat, as the small-plate trend has, we think, plateaued on both sides of the river. Then there's the undeniable fact that the restaurant's menu is pricier than many others in the neighborhood. Suddenly that metaphorical wolf is looking a little more threatening than before. But from what we have seen of the restaurant so far, the superstitious naming seems to be working... well, like a charm. Bocca Lupo is a delight, not to mention a tonic to Brooklyn's oversupply of 'me-too' New American restaurants. And with its enoteca-like long list of Italian wines, Bocca Lupo feels like the kind of neighborhood standby where you can bring friends or stodgy relatives with equal confidence. In my case, I brought Jay, years ago my boss, but now a good friend and happy Brooklynite. We walked right in without a wait on a slow Thursday night and ordered widely from Bocca's menu. Tapas-style menus are often tricky because you never know how many plates to order, and because the issue is further complicated by the often unspoken question of whether to share or not to share. Yet Bocca Lupo only makes this Hamletesque dilemma worse, presenting customers with an overwhelming array of choice: a regular menu, a specials menu, and a drinks menu, each of which is divided into further sub-sections. For example, the main menu has exhaustive listings for panini, bruschetta, and tramezzini- triangles of crustless sandwiches designed to be consumed in three bites- as well as other small plates, and daily pasta and risotto specials. Jay and I avoided much head-scratching over the menu by ordering two test plates, then resolving to continue the two-at-a-time pace, sharing both plates between us. This method is a little more service-intensive than ordering all at once, but the waitstaff are friendly and accomodating. We started with a roasted artichoke appetizer, which was quite small but wonderfully meaty and tender. Like most of Bocca Lupo's small plates, the artichokes are really only about three or four bites worth of food if you're sharing -- though they're worth it, especially the version with creamy herb and roasted hazelnut sauce. Up next was a tramezzini of mortadella, pecorino cheese and sweet mayonnaise all on barely toasted wedges of white Italian bread. This sat appealingly on the plate next to a perfect slice of tomato and sprig of thyme; unfortunately, the sandwich was so small it felt like it was never there to begin with. The rest of the meal followed the same pattern: lushly presented and solidly fine food in astoundingly small portions. The much-touted meatballs were moist and toothsome, with just the right amount of sauce, but were a little difficult to share between two people without mashing them to bits. Our plate of spinach ravioli (a pasta special that evening) was unexpectedly- but very pleasantly- dense and bowed more to gnocchi than to ravioli. Finally, a pair of carefully chosen bruschette were served on untoasted slices of crusty Italian bread; the toppings of pureed eggplant and garlicky spinach-artichoke, respectively, were piled so high that they practically toppled onto the plate. Small but perfectly formed. Desserts at Bocca Lupo range from the traditional to the decidedly modern. A plate of sliced peaches in a simple syrup and with mascarpone cheese was the image of simplicity itself, accented subtly by chiffonaded mint and chopped almonds. We should have stopped there, but Jay, a hopeless chocoholic, ordered a Stonehenge-like construction of Nutella and banana toasts. The dessert quickly deconstructed itself into a gooey mess and was ironically the largest portion of food on one plate that we had all night. While the nutella and banana combination worked well as always, this dish was the evening's one off-note: it seemed more than anything to be a cheap trick served up to please the crowds, but lacked the inspiration of Bocca Lupo's other offerings. Still, these few missteps are easy to overlook, given the relative bargain Bocca Lupo offers- if you order carefully. Plates are all between $7 and $14, and the extensive and all-Italian wine list has some stunningly affordable bottles: most notably a wonderul $17 Candido Salice Salentino that Nosher and I have hoarded for years. Very decent, inexpensive wine is reason alone to come back, as few other eateries can resist heavy markups on wine, even in Brooklyn. But more than this, the vibe and the food here make Bocca Lupo a compelling neighborhood attraction that manages to succeed with or without the luck of the lupine.

Mortadella and pecorino aren't really so shocking a combination of ingredients- I might not mix them in a sandwich, but they are sometimes found together in dishes like this one: http://www.apt.frosinone.it/gastronomia/abbuticchi.htm

I wish that the food had a little less salt. Their banana panini and wine is to die for. We went back last week with a friend and stood at the door unattended. We finally ended up leaving after 10 minutes, bit frustrated, when we realized that nobody cared. I wish that could get better.

 Our inaugural podcast took us to the first Manhattan branch of Queens stalwart Singas Famous Pizza. We sat down with owner Manish Chadha to discuss the concept behind baking nothing but 10-inch pies, how potatoes and cauliflower make it onto the restaurant's menu, and why so many customers mistakenly believe that Singas is an Indian business. Along the way, we were lucky enough to sample six different pizzas, including the superb jalapeno pepper pie.

Paprika's Slow Burn, In Reverse

***CONTENT
 Restaurant histories, when they are written, are all too often stories about decline- tales that showcase a creeping erosion of quality of service and cooking. These stories almost only ever end one way: with the kitchen in question slouching through an undignified bathos, disgorging its last unhappy meal, and locking its doors for the last time -Fin-. But, and this only makes sense, downwards trajectories are not the only paths for a restaurant to follow. Sometimes, with much less fanfare, an eatery takes stock of its faults, re-evaluates itself and its business, and pushes ahead, ultimately getting better as it ages. East Village Italian bistro Paprika is just such a restaurant. After emerging six years ago from the ashes of the former Porto Rosso restaurant, Paprika garnered lots of early buzz for its homestyle Northern Italian menu and its excellent pricing. But its menu was probably too ambitious in its early days, and as a result, Paprika also built a reputation for uneven cooking. However, about two years ago, someone appears to have had an epiphany, prompting a change in Paprika's focus. The most obvious indicator of this turnabout is the short permanent menu that today features only Paprika's very best dishes. Even the 'specials' are made up of a recurring cast list that rarely changes. And with this new commitment to work with its culinary strengths, Paprika has reinvented itself as one of the East Village's most reliable and moderately-priced Italian restaurants. Every time we have visited during the past two years, the menu, the music, and even the genial Mayim Bialik look-alike waitress have been the same, and every time we have visited, we have remarked on the consistently fine cooking. As you might imagine, it is difficult to resist finding favorite dishes in a restaurant with such a stable menu, and perhaps that is also the point. HungryMan's standard selections are among the richer dishes on the menu: the roasted red beet, pistachio, and pecorino salad ($7), for example, which is made up of chin-dribblingly juicy sweet beets, salt, and lots of olive oil. It is just the sort of appetizer that segues perfectly into another favorite: the pappardelle with veal ragu and broccoli rabe ($13), which is technically listed as a special, but which has been on offer each one of the many times we have been to the restaurant. Pastas are perhaps Paprika's strongest suit; the complex proportions of meat to garlic, vegetable to meat, sauce to pasta, and cheese to sauce are difficult to get right, but the balance on display in the veal pappardelle demonstrates why it is such a good thing that Paprika fought through its dark years. Whereas HungryMan savors the lustiest of the menu options, I like to taste the simplest, least adorned items to get a sense of how good the chef's chops are- it is for this reason that I also often order side dishes (intended to be eaten as accompaniments to mains) as appetizers. Some chefs show their best in the most intricate foods they prepare, and some shine through their simplest. Paprika's simple artichoke, lemon, thyme, and pecorino appetizer ($9) is a good example of where simplicity yields great rewards when the few components of a dish are of excellent quality. Another of my favorites, the black linguine with shrimp and spicy tomato sauce ($13), also officially listed as a special, is not a simple dish. Squid-ink pasta is notoriously difficult to pair with sauces; it is half-noodle, half-seafood, and its dark, musky taste can extinguish the odors and flavors of other ingredients. Paprika's approach to taming this difficult pasta, topping it with a peppery tomato sauce, is not an uncommon one, but it succeeds through its expert execution. I have always been impressed by the lightness that Paprika's version of this dish retains- it tastes like a perked-up bouillabaisse with noodles. We would love to see Paprika continue its project of self-improvement by adding a few more less-expensive Italian bottles to its solid, mostly under-$30 wine list, perhaps replacing a few of the lackluster Aussie and Chilean wines with Barbarescos and Grignolinos. Alternatives for managing large, loud parties might also help on evenings when the small space is filled with raucous diners, as it was on our most recent visit last weekend. Then again, if there is one restaurant that has probably already taken careful note of the problem and hammered out a plan to solve it, it is Paprika.

Matchmaking for Two Rare Ingredients: Anchoide and Anise Hyssop
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-09-07 04:18:00
***CONTENT
 Very few foods provoke reactions more extreme than anchovies- their adherents will eat them on pizza, caesar salads, eggs, and in vegetable dips, while their detractors often declare anything touched with one to be contaminated and irretrievably inedible. Of course, Italian and French sauces often contain secret anchovies (shh- don't tell) that broaden flavors without ever making the sauce taste fishy, so chances are good that even if you think you're an anchovy-hater, you've probably eaten a few dishes that have been enhanced with one or two briny fillets. I make no secret of my love for the anchovy in all its forms: vinegared, packed in salt, or preserved in oil; I adore them all. So when HungryMan and I made our weekly visit to the Fairway supermarket on 75th Street and Broadway, I spotted something that I could not resist purchasing- a jar of Roque anchoide. Roque, one of two Collioure-based anchovy producers, processes all of its fish by hand, turning a small but significant portion of their catch of tiny fish into anchoide, a Mediterranean tapenade-like spread that until very recently, was unavailable in the US. Anchoide is made primarily of ground anchovies, along with tomato paste, olive oil, wine vinegar, and 'spices' that we're guessing include pepper and allspice or cinnamon. Fairway has an exclusive sales arrangement with Roque, meaning that if you want a jar of anchoide on these shores, you'll have to buy it in New York City. As HungryMan and I loaded up our cart with several jars, we started talking about how to eat the stuff. Anchovy, admittedly, has a strong presence, one that can overwhelm odors and flavors of other ingredients in a dish if it is not used properly. While I anticipated spreading the anchoide directly from the jar onto flatbreads, HungryMan wanted something more- something to stand up to and compliment the anchovy. Fairway's Steve Jenkins recommends radish slices, which we heartily advocate, but we wanted to create a dish with a more unique flavor profile, one that would also pair well with a crisp Provencal rosé or super-dry Muscadet. Our solution: anise hyssop. Ever since our delightful September meal at Park Slope's Rosewater last year, we have been fascinated with hyssop. This spring, we planted three different varieties, including large-leafed anise hyssop, and like two old yentas, we've been desperate to pair this herb up with its perfect culinary match ever since it began to flourish in August. Anise hyssop's leaves are aromatic and just a bit astringent, with background notes of licorice and mint. It is a tricky herb to use in cooking, however, as it can hijack the flavors in a complex, nuanced dish, and for that reason, most cookbooks encourage its use in such minute quantities that all of its pleasures vanish. But anchoide, we suspected, might offer exactly the kind of rich foundation to allow anise hyssop the rare chance to become a major ingredient in a dish. With that in mind, we chiffonaded a few dozen half-dollar sized leaves of the anise hyssop, sliced a crusty French baguette on the bias, grabbed the anchoide, and set to work on two variations on a bruschetta-like appetizer. Eager for another opinion on the results, we invited Chopper over for a taste test and a few glasses of wine. We all loved the toasts with the chopped tomatoes, noting that the flavors of the anchoide were anything but fish-like. This, we concluded, was a bruschetta to serve someone with an anchovy-phobia. The tomato-free version, on the other hand, tasted entirely different to this, bringing the gentle sharpness of the anise hyssop into focus and truly allowing the brininess of the anchoide to assert itself. As expected, I preferred the version without tomatoes, while HungryMan liked the softer flavors of the red-and-green variety. Chopper declared them both a success, nibbling on a few of each. One final word about the anise hyssop: you won't be able to find it in your local supermarket. This very nearly kept us from writing about it- after all, what are the chances of running across someone else growing it in a windowbox? But after much searching, we finally found it for sale at the Union Square Greenmarket, at Keith's Organic Farm stand (on Wednesdays and Saturdays). You may also be able to find it at the St. George Greenmarket in Staten Island, where we understand less-common herbs can be found with some regularity. Regardless of where you purchase it, grab a few handfuls of anise hyssop before it goes out of season in a few short weeks and enjoy this unusual taste of late summer. Anchoide Anise Hyssop Toasts 1 large crusty baguette 2 medium-sized ripe tomatoes, diced small and seeded 1/2 t. balsamic vinegar 18-24 anise hyssop leaves, chiffonaded 3-5 T. anchoide olive oil for brushing the bread fresh black pepper (optional) NOTE: Do not add salt! Anchoide is very salty already. -- Slice baguette on the diagonal into 1/2-inch tall slices. Place on a baking sheet and toast in a hot oven or broiler until the slices are golden-brown. Brush the tops of these slices with a very thin layer of olive oil. Spread a dab of anchoide (1/2 t. to 1 t.) on each slice of bread. Top with a pinch of the anise hyssop and press gently into the anchoide to cause the herb to adhere. Stir balsamic vinegar into the tomatoes. Add a spoonful of the tomatoes to the top of each toast. Crack black pepper and drizzle olive oil over the toasts, if desired. Makes about 18 toasts. 2006 nycnosh.com

Walk-in Vending Machine or Automat? Bamn! Arrives in the East Village
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Mystery No. 13442: How can New York, the city that supports tens of thousands of restaurants and take-out joints not manage to keep a single automat afloat? After all, the 1990s and the present decade have seen a number of trends that might seem to benefit the insert-coin-retrieve-dinner format: the opening of more fast food restaurants, patrons' shrinking free time, and even a tolerance for anonymous financial transactions. Yet the opening this week of Bamn!, the first coin-operated fast food outlet since the last Horn & Hardart automat closed its doors on East 42nd Street back in 1991, offers a few clues as to why atavistic, coin-op dining might struggle in modern-day NYC. For one thing, there's very little fresh food at Bamn!. Unlike the old automats, where homestyle favorites like creamed spinach, baked beans, and salisbury steak were prepared and set out for purchase in identical-looking little glass cubbyholes, Bamn! offers slider-sized hamburgers, reheated pizza pockets, pork buns, and deep-fried macaroni-and-cheese bullets they call 'krokets'. Horn & Hardart's business model depended on rapid turnover of food- if food did not sell quickly, it had to be thrown away, whereas Bamn!'s best-sellers are disconcertingly shelf-stable and can sit around for much longer without much (noticeable) loss in quality. Another difference between the old-style automat and Bamn! is in the restaurants' overhead: earlier incarnations almost all featured spacious seating areas, some quite splashy, where families could eat together and make an evening of grazing from the little metallic window-boxes. At Bamn!, the only place to eat is a small standing counter, where you will be lucky if you don't get bumped by the throngs changing one- and five-dollar bills into quarters for the machines. Some diners take their chances eating on the street in front of the restaurant, but most people seem to grab their snacks and eat while walking, on their way to their next destination for the evening. All of this may make Bamn! a more profitable enterprise in an itinerant economy, but it does little for the atmosphere. Neither does the decor- Bamn! is painted top to bottom in hot magenta, and the pink flourescent lighting makes eating here rather like eating inside a Sanrio store. Brutal lighting aside, our biggest complaint about the place was that when stock ran low (as it did every time we visited this weekend), the bright lights and glass-doored compartments make it seem as if there is almost nothing left to eat in the shop. Think Hello Kitty! in the role of Old Mother Hubbard, and you've got the idea. The food, when it is available, sadly does not make up for its own scarcity with quality. The pork bun ($1.50) tasted reheated from frozen and not at all fresh; the shredded pork and 'asian' sauce inside added up to much less than one can get for perhaps a third of the price and twice the quality down the street a few blocks in Chinatown. This is not to say that the bun was terrible, but it's no better than any of the hotter, fresher food available next-door at the JAS Mart. Both Nosher and I found the macaroni inside the mac & cheese kroket ($2) to be suspiciously similar to both the pasta and the sauce of Kraft Macaroni & Cheese. It may also have been the same color, but under the carnival lighting, it was difficult to determine this- everything we ate was a shade of lavender. That it was rolled around in a coating of breadcrumbs and then deep-fried into a croquette only served to put to rest the myth that everything is better when it is batter-fried; the grease on this acrid, crunch bomb was palpable. The one bright spot at Bamn! was its teriyaki burgers ($2.50): these were half-dollar sized discs of tender, yet delicately chewy beef, with a tart, soy-rich teriyaki dressing and diced onion. The burger was the Platonic ideal of late-night, greasy satisfaction, and except for the bun, which had clearly suffered during reheating, could hold its own against any other mini-burgers in the city, including the notorious Sassy's Sliders on the Upper East Side. Where will Bamn! go next? Its owners promise an ever-changing menu of portable snacks, some of which are bound to be better than the deadly mac & cheese torpedo we tried. And to be fair, Bamn! stocks a broader range of items than we were able to taste, including spam musubi (a spam-topped sushi roll), and Belgian-style paper cones of frites with more than 20 sauces, including unusual ones like truffle and soy ginger. It's hard to read that menu and imagine that it wasn't planned out to entice the beer-soaked East Village party crowd. With that in mind, we're betting that Bamn! will quickly expand into other neighborhoods; the concept would do well in any high-traffic area with a high density of bars and nightclubs, such as in the Meatpacking District around Little West 12th, West Chelsea around 10th Avenue and 27th Street, or even Times Square, with its hordes of hungry, peripatetic, and yes, often tipsy out-of-towners. Suddenly, the absence of seating makes perfect sense. Really, if you think about Bamn! not as a serious dining option, but instead as a place for the liquored-up to spend their loose change, it's a little more difficult to find fault with it. This may not be your father's automat, but it does seem to fill a niche. Now, if Bamn! were to add large glasses of water and aspirin to its menu, it just might guarantee its own longevity. Bamn!, 37 St. Marks Place (at Second Avenue), 646-638-0771

At the US Open, Mind the Crab Cake (If You Can Find It)

 Perhaps the most definitive proof that we are obsessed with food is that, even after eating a few meals at last year's US Open tennis tournament that each required a small mortgage, we just could not resist tasting this year's new offerings. So with snacking in mind, we hit the ATM (conveniently located near most of the restaurant stands) and braced ourselves for the inevitable abuse from the desultory restaurant staffers. There is something very sadomasochistic about ordering a $12 sandwich from a staffer who is happy to simultaneously swipe your credit card and roll her eyes at your foolishness for paying so much. May I have some more please, sir? Burgers abound at the newly-christened USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, but there are a few dozen more options, including salads, burritos, smoothies, fried chicken, and of course, shellfish. Last year's US Open lobster roll experience was neither our best nor our worst, so HungryMan and I decided to give Fulton Seafood (named to make you think 'fresh!') another chance to redeem itself. But no salty lobster rolls for us this year- it was time for a crab cake sandwich ($14.75). Nothing could have prepared us for the Liliputian patty, however. Everything else about this sandwich was very decent, from the tangy sauce to the soft brioche bun and the ripe slice of tomato. All that kept this from being our first genuine success of a US Open dish was the microscopic crab cake- easily no bigger than a small lime. More disappointing was the fact that the crab cake was actually a competent, well-seasoned patty, full of lots of jumbo lump and backfin crab meat. Had there been just a bit more of it, this might have been worthy of its oversized bun, but as it was, this sandwich was a real disappointment. HungryMan opted to test-drive the new Asian offerings, sampling Nooshi's (a contraction of Noodles + Sushi, apparently) Beef Noodle Salad ($11.00), and a cup of unsweetened green tea ($4.50). There is little good to say about either of these two items- the noodle salad was slimy, bland, and loaded up with gristly chunks of meat that reminded us of roadside food from Lviv, rather than premium-priced lunchtime fare at a Grand Slam tennis event. The tea was similarly disappointing, tasting as if it had been made from a chemical-laden powder, and completely lacking any of the subtle maltiness that makes fresh green tea so delightful. One discovery we made towards the end of our visit is worth a mention: bar prices compare very favorably to those of Manhattan and Brooklyn watering holes. Here, you'll get a servicable frozen margarita, daquiri, or pina colada for $7.00, an extra-dry, extra-strong martini for $8.00, and a cup of draft beer for $6.00 (or less, depending on the stand you visit). Alcohol, it emerges, is the only bargain to be found at the Bilie Jean King Tennis Center. Not a huge surprise when you consider that the women's professional tennis tour was once sponsored by Virginia Slims, but just a bit off-message for a sport that puts such emphasis on fitness and endurance. In a perfect world however, one that Bille Jean King and Arthur Ashe could both be proud of, a healthy, high-quality lunch at the US Open wouldn't cost more than a round of mojitos.

brave! I was at the US Open and fearful of both the offerings and the prices. It's heartening to see such variety at a sporting event, afterall this is NY (did you see how some stadium in the mid-west was offering KrispyKreme burgers (everything deepfried? - this was on the news a while back). Given the heat and the lines (labor day), I stuck with lemonade and popcorn.

Hi, I didn't know you were going! I had an execrable chana masala at the Baluchi's stand and a sad, over-mayoed poached salmon sandwich with dried-out waffle fries. Sounds like you made out a little better!

Rainy Days and Polenta Taragna
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE

***CONTENT
 Watching the rain fall on the tomato plants in our little garden this week, all I could think about was salt and polenta. I kept thinking of an old Italian expression, 'a pioggia,' or 'like the rain,' that cooks use to describe a very loose, soft sprinkling of a granular ingredient. Flour is distributed 'a pioggia' across the top of a work surface, salt is spread 'a pioggia' along the split interior length of a fresh whole mackerel, and polenta is always, always poured 'a pioggia' into a pot of near-boiling liquid to prevent lumps from forming. In the interest of full disclosure, this wasn't the first time that week, or even day, that I'd thought about Italian food; HungryMan and I have been on a Northern Italian bender of late, drinking Lambrusco, eating at Via Emilia, and picturing ourselves on the shores of Lake Maggiore, the site of some of our best food memories. So it only seemed fitting that I'd get inspired by urban drizzle and resolve to concoct a recipe for a dish showcasing a Lombardy speciality, polenta taragna. Polenta taragna is, in large part, just simple, coarse cornmeal- exactly like most of the polenta you are likely to find in the supermarket. The difference is that it also contains a portion of ground, unhulled buckwheat, which is why it is also sometimes referred to as 'black polenta,' although this is a huge overstatement. When cooked, polenta taragna resembles a dark yellow porridge that has been very aggressively peppered, but it should never be fully black. Buckwheat's job in the dish is to add a nutty, earthy flavor, one that pairs especially well with cured meats and fish, game, dark meat from poultry, oily fish (especially grilled sardines) and surprisingly, seitan. The recipe below will also work with all kinds of polenta, so if you cannot find polenta taragna, don't worry. In NYC, polenta taragna is available at Buon Italia in Chelsea Market, and at Agata & Valentina on the Upper East Side, as well as at most Italian grocery stores in Astoria. Prices for the raw polenta taragna vary from about $2.75 to $4.99/500 grams. That works out to be very cheap, at about 3 recipes per container. Costs drop further if you make the polenta with water, but HungryMan and I both prefer our polenta very creamy and made with milk. It can certainly be made with either, but we have found that using milk as the cooking liquid cuts down on the amount of cheese and butter needed to enliven the polenta. Milk also softens the buckwheat hulls in this dish much better than water does. We have also found that whisking the ingredients together and then switching to a wooden spoon only once the polenta begins to thicken will all but guarantee a lump-free dinner. Best of all however, this recipe uses quantities that are not only simple to measure, they are easy to commit to memory: a quart and a cup. Having a polenta recipe at the ready at any time might just come in handy one day. And if it happens to be raining outside as you prepare it, then you'll have a story to tell as you pour the cornmeal 'a pioggia,' in the lightest sprinkle, just like the rain. Smoked Salmon with Polenta Taragna For the polenta: 1 quart whole milk 1 cup polenta taragna (or other polenta) 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3 Tablespoons butter 1/4 cup grated hard cheese such as parmesan or romano 2 Tablespoons finely chopped fresh rosemary olive oil for drizzling -- Slices of high-quality smoked salmon Heat milk on medium-low heat in a saucepan or wok. Do NOT let milk boil. Add salt and 1/3 of the rosemary to the milk and stir occasionally to keep milk from forming a skin as it heats. When the milk is nearly boiling (it will start to bubble around the perimeter of the pan), turn the heat down to low and sprinkle in the polenta 'a pioggia,' whisking all the while to prevent lumps. Continue to whisk the mixture as it cooks on low to medium-low heat. When it thickens to the consistency of a thick batter, you may switch to a wooden spoon. Keep stirring until the mixture becomes as thick as mashed potatoes. Add the remaining rosemary, butter, and cheese. If you prefer very thick polenta, you may continue to cook the mixture until it becomes thicker. Transfer polenta to a bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Serve on plates and drape with slices of smoked salmon. Makes 4-6 servings. 2006 nycnosh.com

Better than a Condo on Park Avenue South: Via Emilia
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-08-28 00:47:00
***CONTENT
 Late last year, the popular Northern Italian restaurant Via Emilia was forced to leave its long-time Park Avenue South location because its building was slated for demolition. The reason? Another condo development. Say what you want about the manic pace of apartment construction in the city these days but this was a real loss, a loss felt around the chowhounding world. Fortunately for the hungry among us, Via Emilia has found a way to rise from the rubble in style, moving into new digs about two blocks away on East 21st Street. Last week, Nosher, Chilena and I went to have a look at their modern new space and to see if the food remained as good as it always was. Chilena's first reaction was, \"This doesn't look like an Italian restaurant!\" And she was right, the space is sleek, a little dark, and more downtown than a Gramercy/Flatiron address might imply. The walls have been painted in Necco-wafer colored stripes, Scandinavian-inspired pendant lights line the ceiling over banks of tables and, in the back, diner-style booths round out the ample new dining room. There's nary a red-checkered tablecloth or chianti-bottle candlestick in sight. Of course, all of this makes sense; Via Emilia has long-specialized in Modenese cuisine of the Emilia-Romagna region of Northern Italy and, if you've visited there recently, you'll recognize that modern restaurant design is nothing new. Via Emilia's menu stays true to the region's focus on fresh ingredients and delicate flavors. There's a focus on pastas like ravioli, tortelloni and tagliatelli, as well as on hearty meats like veal, pork and lamb. Strangely absent however is any risotto dish, a staple of Northern Italian cuisine. The wine list makes up for any deficits in the menu, with a few surprisingly under-$30 options. There are several Lambruscos, that once-disfavored sparkling red wine (whose grape orginates in the Emilia-Romagna region), and from the bottles we saw being poured to other diners, we can confirm that it appears to be making a well-deserved comeback. Affordability doesn't end at the wine list, however: appetizers are all $8 or less, and nothing on the menu is more than $16.50. Try finding food as good at these prices anywhere nearby and you'll be searching for a long time. We started our meal with two appetizers: a side dish of asparagus alla parmesana, and an order of the restaurant's legendary gnocco fritto ($8). The latter dish was a delight and more than lived up to its reputation as one of Via Emilia's biggest winners: four puffy pillows of fried dough accompanied a selection of cured meats- Prosciutto di Parma, mortadella, coppa and sorpressata dolce. The dough is tender and light, lacking the oily or heavy quality you might expect, and it pulls apart easily, all the better to use to pick up a slice of the meat. An all-prosciutto plate can be ordered for four dollars more, but we were happy with the variety platter. The asparagus ($8) was a much simpler dish, but prepared with as much care: six perfect green stems, sautéed with a little butter and dusted with shavings of ultra-nutty Parmigiano-Reggiano. My main dish of spinach ravioli ($13) had an intense spinach flavor that came as much from the green pasta as the spinach and ricotta filling. Each raviolo was bathed in a light tomato sauce that kept its gustatory distance just enough to let the freshly-rolled pasta shine. Given the labor involved in making ravioli (as Via Emilia does in house each day), this dish follows the natural law of ravioli -- each plate comes with about 25 percent fewer ravioli than you could hope for. Still, this pasta is worth the price of admission. Nosher's grilled bluefish ($16.50) offered a take on this humble, strong-tasting fish that elevated it to new heights. Resting on a colorful bed of root vegetables, his portion comprised at least 5 ounces of seafood. Nosher couldn't stop talking about how surprisingly delicate it was, and even the wintery accompaniment of roasted root vegetables somehow seemed to fit, even in mid-August. Chilena ordered the spaghetti neri con calamari ($13.50), a heaving mass of black squid ink pasta, mixed with loops of tender squid, chopped tomatoes, and generous shreds of torn basil leaves. Like the ravioli, the black pasta is made in-house (the only spaghetti that is), and is cooked just al dente, matching the texture of the calamari, and playing well off the cooler, firmer tomatoes. The pasta was also inky-tasting to just the right point- not enough to make your sinuses pulsate, but enough so that you know what you're eating. While none of us was in the mood for it, we know that the restaurant's homemade lasagna is apparently a minor celebrity, as are the pumpkin tortelloni, a dish that will doubtless become much more popular when fall arrives in a few weeks' time. There's so much to recommend Via Emilia in fact, that it's a shame that the service toward the end of our meal was so rushed. Ours was a late dinner- we asked for a table around ten o'clock. Still, that should be no excuse for our waiter to tell us that, if we wanted dessert or coffee, we needed to order up long before we were finished with our mains. Nor is a late arrival reason for the staff to begin carting bags of garbage past everyone's table. If a kitchen wants to close down early, it should let the front of the house know in advance, so every diner can linger over his meal. Minor service issues aside, Via Emilia was otherwise a great experience, and an absoultely excellent value for such glorious food. All in all, we'd say that Via Emilia seems to be taking well to its new location; locals and everyone else in New York City should be happy it has found a new home. Via Emilia, 47 East 21st Street, between Park Avenue South and Broadway, 212-505-3072. No reservations. Cash only.

Who Wants a Roof? Riverside Park South's Pier I Café

 Tell a New Yorker that you'd like to eat a meal outdoors, and you'll usually be led to a restaurant where the best you can hope for is to share approximately one square yard of sidewalk or patio space with sixty other diners. But that never stops us; after all, eating al fresco is one of the season's biggest joys. And nowhere is noshing outdoors more of an unalloyed pleasure than on the shore of the Hudson River at Riverside Park South's Pier I Café. And really, there is no choice here: all seats are outdoor seats. Even the kitchen itself is a miniature tent village where the cookers, the barbecue grills, and the bar supplies all sit in full view of the sunset. There has been a mobile café on this site for the past two or three years, but after a nasty accounting scandal surrounding last year's incarnation, a new contract was awarded to a different proprietor. So this year's Pier I Café is not affiliated with anything that may have come before it. That is entirely a good thing, because the team behind the current iteration, headed up by the Frying Pan at Chelsea Piers' John Krevey, appears to know how to make the most of a pared-down kitchen, striking many more sweet than sour notes in the bargain. Their strategy appears to be perfectly simple: focus on serving drinks, as well as a small menu of dishes that either benefit or are not diminished by being cooked outdoors. This explains why, of the ten regular menu items, five are burgers or hot dogs. Not only is this sensible logic comforting, it also yields cooking that is consistently competent. Drinks here are also made to a high standard. We have sampled all three of their specialty drinks (each $8) and two of their frozen cocktails (each $10) over several visits, with the Key West Melonade, the Bahama Coco Mama, and the Frozen Mango Margarita (these last two are shown in the photograph here) ranking as our favorites. Menu specials offer a few welcome surprises that distinguish Pier I Café from a concession stand. On a visit this past weekend, we sampled a Mixed Berry Salad ($8), a dish that was made up of nearly equal parts mesclun and fresh berries, all dressed in a tart berry vinaigrette and topped with candied walnuts. I was impressed by the variety of berries- blueberries, strawberries, blackberries, and raspberries all added depth and complexity to the salad. Plain walnuts would have been a better choice than candied, as the salad was already very sweet, but otherwise, the dish was lovely- exactly the sort of thing you might expect to be eating under the fading sun. Burgers here are also very good. HungryMan is a fan of the Flintstones-thick Classic Hamburger (shown in the first photograph above, $6), which when cooked medium rare is gorgeously juicy. I, on the other hand, love the Veggie Burger (shown in this photograph, $6). Normally, I don't order veggie burgers at restaurants, figuring that they are likely to be frozen and uninspiring, but Pier I Café took me by surprise. Their patty may well be frozen, but it contains light, green edamame, and just enough garlic to make the burger worth ordering. Both kinds of burgers do suffer a bit from being served on potato rolls that are too dense and filling; HungryMan and I generally solve this problem by converting our burgers into open-faced sandwiches, ditching half the bread in order to leave room for fries. French fries ($3) here are long, pinky-wide planks, sprinkled generously with salt and a seasoning mix that tastes similar to Tony Cachere's Creole mixture. French fries are a difficult dish for an outdoor restaurant to get just right, but Pier I manages the job admirably, producing potatoes that are moist inside, slightly crispy outside, and remarkably, not greasy. The portion is adequate, but if you're really hungry, order two, as the woman ahead of us in the line did. Gesturing to a furry lump on her shoulder that we hadn't noticed until that point, she effused, \"The fries are for me- I love them! And the chicken tenders I ordered are for my cat.\" While we have not yet sampled the chicken tenders, we can say that the restaurant staff obliged the woman's request, announcing, \"Chicken tenders, for Cat, Chicken tenders, for Cat,\" over the loudspeakers. We can also report that the grumpy feline did, in fact, eat said chicken tenders. Make of that what you will. Pier I Café is scheduled to remain open well into autumn (or at least until the end of September), so you still have time to pay a visit, with or without a kitty in tow. On weekend evenings, there is also live music (mostly salsa and jazz) on the shore end of the pier- an added bonus that makes this already affordable café an even more compelling summertime destination. Pier I (the letter 'i') Café, Riverside Park South at West 70th Street, Noon- about 10 p.m. every day

What This Country Needs Is a Good Twenty-Cent Dumpling

 I want to make a case for walking a few hundred feet further, for passing by a devil you know, in favor of one you don't... yet. Practically every 'Cheap Eats' guide to NYC published in the last two or three years has mentioned Dumpling House on Eldridge Street, and with good reason: the food is stupefyingly inexpensive and generally pretty good. At the same time, it seems as if every one of Manhattan's several million residents knows about the place- lines curl out the door and around the block during most lunchtimes, and even on a languid Saturday afternoon, we've seen patrons queueing up for cheap snacks. We have also found that, depending on how busy the restaurant is, the quality of their dishes varies in a wide range from excellent to absolutely subpar, and worst of all, the service is brusque. But just south of Dumpling House sits a bright, clean storefront, where word-for-word, mung bean-for-mung bean, a nearly identical menu is offered, and the food? It's better than what you get up the street. Prosperity Dumpling is too new yet to be heaving with throngs of diners, but the locals know it's there, and they stop in every minute or two to chat with the very affable owner- but more telling is that nobody leaves the restaurant empty-handed. Well, almost nobody; there are five bar stools and a short, 8-foot eating counter here, so it is possible to actually sit down inside the restaurant while you eat your food- something that is nearly impossible to do at Dumpling House. If you do choose to sit, be aware that you also will probably end up talking with the owner. He's a precise, very attentive sort, a man who likes to check three or four times with you to make sure he's got your order correct, even stepping out from around the counter to look up at the menu display to confirm he's preparing the correct dish for you. His pride in his cooking also comes through when he talks about how every food item in the shop is made from scratch, or 'made from flour,' as he puts it. Not only is everything made in house, it is all prepared to order, so absolutely everything is as fresh as it can be. The people in the neigborhood know this, because the instant a sesame pancake is spread out into a pizza-like 16-inch circle, sprinkled with seeds, and slid onto a round griddle, customers start to appear for a slice. We found this out after we ordered one piece ($0.50), and realized too late that the owner would have to prepare an entire 10-slice round in the bargain. But we shouldn't have worried, because the instant the smell of the yeasty dough on the stove escaped through the front door, a line of people materialized to buy up the other nine slices. The pancake sat, still warm, on the counter for a grand total of four minutes before it had disappeared. Once we tasted it, we understood instantly why this was the case: tasting uncannily like a Chinese version of a focaccia, the pancake was crisp and salty on top, while still steamy, springy and light on the inside. I have never eaten a better pan-fried bread. We expected the Stuffed Sesame Pancake with Vegetable ($1.25)- a dish not offered up the street at Dumpling House- to look very similar, but were both surprised to see something from a different genus of baked goods emerge from the kitchen. The pancake- more accurately, a flat, pan-seared bun- was a palm-sized pocket of dough filled with shredded pork, Chinese greens, and lots of green onion. It was also very moist, even juicy, inside, just like a hand-held version of a pork pot pie. But what about the dumplings? After all, it is on the quality of this dish that the success of Prosperity Dumpling hinges. Unsurprisingly, given the restaurant's attention to detail and concern with freshness, the dumplings are wonderful. Our favorite, the Chive & Pork Boiled Dumplings (10 for $2), are filled with nearly the same mixture as the Stuffed Pancake, but here, the soft, slightly tacky steamed dough takes on the texture of a noodle, rather than a pastry. Dotted with Chinese vinegar and dipped in Sriracha hot sauce, this generous serving of well-seasoned dumplings makes a quite substantial dinner or a gut-busting lunch- no matter how hard we tried, we couldn't finish all ten after snacking on both varieties of Sesame Pancake. Don't miss the fragrant, gyoza-like fried dumplings on sale here as well. We do wish that Prosperity Dumpling would serve their vegetarian dumplings fried, as well as boiled, but that is really our only complaint about the place; and when you consider that our meal cost $3.75, that is a phenomenal achievement. A bargain dinner on its own is a great thing, but when it comes from such a genial and conscientious cook, it's a modern-day miracle. Prosperity Dumpling, 46 Eldridge Street (between Canal and Hester Streets), 212-343-0683

No, and in fact, I bet they would fry them for you if you asked. We were just surprised not to find a fried veggie dumpling on the menu. It's not on the Dumpling House menu either, interestingly (but good luck getting them to do anything off-menu for you). Thanks for the compliment, too. Nosher

Nosher-I have long been a fan of your site, thank you! I have to say, this review is killing me because now I wish I lived in NYC (though San Fran is not a bad place to be)! How would you characterize the stuffed veggie pancake? Is it as thick as a bun? I am trying to find a recipe so I can try and make these-the photo has been tempting me all day!!!!

Rebecca, Thank you for the kind words. I'd say that the best analogy I can make is this: picture a steamed bao zi bun, and then imagine cooking it in a panini press, and that's the stuffed pancake. It's about an inch tall. Good luck with the recipe hunt; let us know if you find a good one. Nosher

Thanks Nosher! I may have found a good recipe to start with-will play with the recipe this weekend and report back. I am settling for dim sum for dinner tonight since I have no time to cook. BTW-I should have thanked you a long time ago for all the info you have here. Last fall as I was planning a trip to NYC, I stumbled across your site and found out about the Vendy awards. Lucky for us, we were in town for the party. I bought tickets immediately and I am so glad I did!! The Vendy's were one of the highlights of our trip, and my husband still talks about what a great time we had that night. I need a dosa!! The chicken man!! Yum...........it also made me sad to realize that San Francisco has no real street food (nasty hot dog carts don't count! We are planning another trip to NYC to coincide with this year's Vendy awards (Oct 22). And to go to Prosperity Dumpling (among other places!) A million thanks! Keep up the good work! Rebecca

Nosher, thank you! This review is great. That sesame pancake looks suspiciously like the one found in Chinese Muslim cuisine (zhi ma da bing). Since moving from California three years ago, I have been desperately searching for this type of sesame pancake; I grew up in the LA area eating it all the time at Tung Lai Shun. If this is what I think it is, you've stumbled upon a true treasure.

Great post! I checked this place out just last night and while they weren't serving the pancake (it wasn't clear why exactly, but they were certainly effusive in their apologies) the fried pork and scallion dumplings were some of the best I've had in New York. For whatever reason these dumplings were far superior to those served up the block - many more scallions and softer dough. Regardless, thanks for the find. The proprietors seemed like great people and while I'm typically given to keeping such finds such as this one close to my chest - for obvious reasons - I'll certainly tell all my friends to make the switch to Prosperity ASAP. Thanks again!

I went yesterday and it was pretty good, especially the fried dumplings (crisp, but not overly crisp). And Kathryn, the big pancake is called zhi ma da bing in chinese, and it is the same thing that is at Dumpling House. Didn't try that as we didn't want to get it unless it was fresh. It was a bit busy and the workers seemed to be a bit stressed out as they sounded like they were arguing.

Yes, the pizza-like pancake is also available up the street (although it is rarely as fresh), but the stuffed pancake is not. We've never seen the arguing Spencer, so I hope it's just an anomaly- I understand that the shop has been extra-prosperous over the past few days, so perhaps they're getting used to larger crowds. We'll keep an eye out though!

The \"Stuffed Sesame Pancake with Vegetable\" looks like what is called a \"Jiu-Cai Hezi\" or \"Chive Box\". Basically a flattened dumpling with chive and pork filling that is pan-fried. The type I am accustomed to (Northern Chinese) usually has glass noodles and egg in it.

Actually they have Jiu-Cai Hezi as well and it's called Chive-Egg something (that's a bad description if that's what I think it is). The Stuffed Sesame Pancake with Vegetable is called Cai Bing (I think) in chinese, never heard of it before. They also have a \"Bai Cai Zhu Rou Xian Bing\", which is what I would think sounds more like what the picture looks like.

i tried it out today and the veggie dumplings were great! the owner was as nice as you said. the female staff were pretty rude to me, however. one woman took care of a regular as i stood there waiting (i'd gotten there first), and they said they didn't have the stuffed vegetable pancake. the second woman tried to persuade me to order the pork dumplings instead, as they were already done in the pan. well, i don't eat meat. i definitely got the impression she just didn't want to make the veg dumplings or the stuffed pancake for me. oh well. what i got was great, and the guy came in later and made up for their behavior.

thanks for the tip -- will check it out soon. i love dumpling house's dumplings, but the service and super chaotic \"line\" always made me groan. don't get me wrong, chaos can be good, but that place is just whack. i put up with it only for the dumplings. even if prosperity's dumplings are not as good as dh's, but close, i'll be there all the time if the owners are as great as they sound! that's why i love cong ly for pho. great pho, sweetest owners in the world. my idea of heaven.

Wow, thanks for turning me on to this place! I like the dumplings better than Dumpling House's. The meat is about the same, but the dumpling skin is much better. To me, that's the crucial element. I went there around 5 or 6 p.m. recently and, like most other dumpling places at that time, they were out of a lot of non-dumpling items like the chive-and-egg pancake, but they did have the Stuffed Sesame Pancake with Pork etc. The friendly guy even gave me two of them for a dollar instead of just one, I think because he was so apologetic that they were out of everything else that I was interested in. Or because they were the last two of the day and he wanted to get rid of them. It wasn't clear. Anyway, those were tasty too, if a smidgen greasy. I'll have to get over there for lunch soon, when things haven't run out yet presumably. Anyone ever tried the dumpling joints at around 25 Henry St. just east of Catherine St. or at the intersection of Catherine & Henry? The one at the intersection has a lot of other stuff too. I walked past these places recently but haven't had a chance to try them yet. And hmmm, let's see, I walked past another dumpling place recently that I'd never noticed before. Hmmm, can't remember where it was....

nice photos. the flat stuffed pancake looks like something I had in Xian, which people buy for breakfast and snacks- except no sesames, but filled with curry meet and scallions/leeks/chives. Hand-made in batches , then flattened on a big panini press cooker so they became crispy. Have not had it in NYC but maybe someone out there has? best street food I have had

Hey fellow pancake lovers, I am totally addicted. Kathryn was right, it is very similar to a zhi ma da bing. However the problem of a rcipe still exists. I cant find one anywhere. I asked the guys at dumpling house and for some reason, laughed, whispered amongst themselves and ushered me quietly out the door without my food. If anyone finds anything please let me know

 [Editor’s note: Today’s post comes to us from Captain Nosh and the Noshingtonienne, our friends from the UK who previously reported on Seattle’s Matt’s in the Market (which has since been featured on The Food Network). Since their forced migration to Cochise County, AZ, our correspondents have been exploring culinary opportunities for New Yorkers in search of a desert escape. — Nosher & Hungry Man] When was the last time you ducked into an alley for a free shot of organic espresso? If java with a social conscience sounds like your vice, we have found a dealer who can provide an immediate dose for your legal habit. Even if you can't make it out to the arid Southwest, this roaster will ship fresh beans by mail to NYC. We, like HungryMan and Nosher, love coffee, and when we arrived here on the Mexican border, we dreaded our coffee prospects. Fortunately, we had nothing to fear, thanks to Seth Appell, the dreadlocked and well-caffeinated proprietor of Old Bisbee Roasters. It’s now been a full two years we’ve woken to steaming mugs of Seth’s coffee every morning at 4:30 a.m. Throughout this time, we’ve come to appreciate not only his willingness to ply us with free samples at his alleyway stand, but also how easy it is to have our monthly resupply shipped to us through his website. When Captain Nosh was in Iraq this winter, Nosher & Hungry Man sent Zabar’s coffee in a care package, which became part of an unofficial, international taste test against Seth’s beans, sent over by the Noshingtonienne. Nosher and Hungry Man’s champ won, but only because they bribed the judge by sending babka along with the coffee. Seth doesn’t do babka – yet. But he does do chocolate; it just wouldn’t have survived transit to the Middle East. (His chocolate is a whole other post entirely…) Through his importer in San Francisco, Seth sources coffees from the South Pacific, Latin America, and Africa. All beans come from small family farms and cooperatives, which results in an ever-changing selection for his customers. The green beans are roasted upon arrival in Arizona and turned around in a matter of hours. Selection varies by season, which is exactly how it should be. Of course, there is no shortage of coffee in NYC, but the small-batch, artisanal operation of Old Bisbee Roasters make it worth checking out. To gather further compelling evidence, we conducted a morning tasting of the three types of beans we currently have on hand – Timor Organic Peaberry, Ethiopian Washed Sidamo Grower-Certified Organic, and Mexican Organic Chiapas Proish. To gather as wide a variety of data as possible, we held a java-inspired gathering of friends and solicited their feedback. Two of our tasters were former baristas, and all five simply cannot begin their days without their brew. All know Seth, but everyone involved was willing to be brutally honest. Coincidentally, one used to live in coffee-rich Chiapas before moving to Southern Arizona. Writing our tasting notes wasn’t easy, what with all of the caffeinated speed-talking that ensued, but here is what we found. Seth describes the Timor as a “clean, modern Indonesian coffee,” and says “this spicy little pea has a distinctly smoky flavor with a subtle hint of vanilla beans.” However, our team of tasters identified a rich earthiness in the nose, even a bit of cocoa. The uniform little oval beans are relative rarities, as they do not grow as split seeds, and as such, they constitute a minority of any coffee crop. The tasters described this coffee as “velvety,” “smooth with a light finish,” and “very drinkable.” Two highlighted it as their favorite. While there was no bitterness or edginess to be found in the Timor, it was also quite a neutral coffee and perhaps less robust than the others. Seth pitches the Ethiopian as “fruity and “floral,” and his “choice of African sweeties for the month.” He explains that it is “softer than a Harar.” Unfortunately we did not have any Harar beans handy for comparison. Regardless, the nose evoked descriptions of sweetness, vanilla, mint, cherry overtones, and even “cool mountains.” It was pleasantly low in acidity, fuller-bodied, lasted longer on the tongue, and could even be described as \"chewy,\" with a touch of raisin or plum. It was the Noshingtonienne’s favorite, which surprised her as she’s normally a dark-roast girl, more into the chocolate, not so into the fruit. Third up was the Mexican, which all assembled agreed was wonderfully earthy and hearty in the nose. One of the team picked up anise odors, and one remarked with a cheerful “festive!” We found this one to be quite robust with rounder edges than the Ethiopian. The earthiness was all nose though, not on the palate. In his Coffee News, Seth describes this one to be “light, sweet, and fine…as if I'm sampling the finest Darjeeling tea.” He finds it to have a hint of spice, but similarly sans earthiness. Two of our tasters opted to continue drinking it as we nibbled at a decadent chèvre-spinach quiche and orange-currant scones. Fortified with some of the best java around, we concluded our tasting and sent our guinea pigs out into the world, set satisfyingly atwitter for the rest of the day. Old Bisbee Roasters, P.O.

Thanks for this post. The prices are excellent, and I especially appreciate that orders of more than two pounds ship Priority Mail for free (and only $2 for one-pound orders). Also, if you sign up for their mailing list; you get a coupon good for $5 off your first order. When the coffee arrives, I'll post (if I don't forget) some comments about the quality.

Lexington Candy Shop: Liquid Lunching

***CONTENT
 Feeding a recent interest in old New York (see our investigation into what became of Schrafft's), we paid a visit to the much-revered Lexington Candy Shop, one of the few remaining 'old-fashioned' soda shops left in the city. With chrome counters and stools, 1950's style wallpaper peeling slowly off the walls, signed photographs from celebrity customers long since deceased (or unemployed), and waitresses and counter staff that look like they would be happy anywhere else but working there, the LCS plays a begrudging lovesong to New York's mid-century luncheonnettes. And for that alone, it's worth stopping in for a look around. Perhaps desultory service should be seen as adding to the authenticity of any diner, but we found that having to spend several minutes standing at the entrance to the restaurant, waiting for someone to notice and seat us just made us want to leave. Nosher finally figured out that we were supposed to seat ourselves after one of the waitstaff, a middle-aged blonde woman, made the tiniest, wordless gesture with her eyebrow after staring stonily at us for a solid 20 seconds. The lack of any effort to speak to us (or other entering customers) made us believe that she might be mute. However, we discovered later that she could both speak and hear- she evidently just prefers seething to speaking. Moreover, there was no apology for this (or the other nearby booths') filthy condition, just a request to lift our menus as the waitress sponged and dried it. Unfortunately, LCS's food wasn't much better than its service. The menu highlights a cavalcade of 20th century diner favorites: burgers, sandwiches, omelettes, and other breakfast items- just the sort of cooking we were in the mood for when we arrived. I ordered a turkey burger with swiss cheese, lettuce, tomato, and pickle. The burger was well-prepared, but no better fare than what could be found at any diner up and down the East Side, except that here, it sells for fifty percent more. For the price, we also thought the limp lettuce and droopy pickle were a little too lackluster, especially for such a storied venue. Nosher was still in a breakfast mood and received a disappointingly minute order of scrambled eggs. If my hamburger felt plain, then Nosher's eggs looked positively denuded- the eggs were served on a dessert-sized plate (to make the portion appear larger?), and the accompanying toast sat isolated on a separate plate, completing this breakfast archipelago. Worse, the eggs were overdone in parts and underdone in others. To be fair, LCS is more famous for its lemonade, which is made right in front of you from fresh lemons, not to mention their dizzying selection of shakes, malts, egg creams, and floats. While we ate, we saw several people from the neighborhood drop in to order coffee malteds- perhaps LCS's most famous concoction. I chose a cherry Coke float as the perfect complement to my burger- or if not to my burger, then to the burger I had hoped for, at least. The float came in a tall glass filled to the lip with cold soda and with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream bobbing on its surface, photogenically spilling down soda onto a small coaster. The float was fantastic: the ratio of soda to ice cream was nearly perfect (poorly constructed floats run out of ice cream before soda), and even the last few sips were a delight of cherried creaminess. The soda was so good, in fact, that it almost made up for the bad food and slipshod service. As we waited for the check, we took another look at the diner's menu. On its cover is a list of plaudits from the press. We noticed, perhaps a little too late, that nearly every single one of them was in praise of a beverage: lemonade, authentic malts, egg creams and ice cream sodas, in particular. We got the message: stick to liquids. If you're in the neighborhood and craving something sweet and potable, by all means go. But if you're looking for good food to match, it pains us to say it, but you should probably go someplace else. Lexington Candy Shop, 1226 Lexington Ave., between 82nd and 83rd Streets.

For some more of that great authentic nostalgia, why not pop on out to Queens and try Eddie's Sweet Shop (Metropolitan Ave in Forest Hills). They only do ice cream and liquids here, and the service is much friendlier than what you describe at the Candy Shop. You'll definitely get that Twilight Zone feel, like an episode where some guy steps off a commuter train into another, seemingly simpler era of soda jerks, marble floors and dark wooden booths and counters. The one drawback: enough porcelain dolls and teddy bears to make you think you're neck deep in a Mother Hubbard nightmare.

I'm sorry you had such a bad experience at one of my favorite restaurants. Have you tried their weekend brunch? It's amazing. And yes, you're right, the drinks are awesome (their shakes are my favorites anywhere), but I think the quality of the food is also awesome. Even something as simple as their grilled cheese sandwich is better here.

It's Never Too Hot For Berry Pancakes
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-08-12 02:08:00
***CONTENT
 Berry season coincides rather unfortunately with the hottest time of the year. This mixed blessing means that supermarket shelves groan under the weight of plentiful fruit, while at the same time temperatures are so high that there's very little appeal in turning on the oven to bake a cake or cobbler. Our favorite solution to this conundrum is to make berry pancakes as often as our griddles and waistlines will allow: they really require only a single stove burner (which keeps the kitchen from feeling like Calcutta), and if you make them in the morning, you can also take advantage of the coolest hours of the day. Plus, there really aren't too many better ways to start the day. In the past, we've been promiscuous with our choice of pancake recipes, bouncing from Bittman to The Joy of Cooking, The Big Book of Breakfast to Baking Illustrated, yet never really finding a pancake simple enough, tall enough, and light enough to satisfy our needs. So in the end, we created our own recipe, one that produces half-inch tall pancakes that accommodate even the biggest berries. The key to this recipe is cake flour, specifically self-rising cake flour (which already has baking powder and salt added to it); the low gluten content of the cake flour keeps the pancakes ultra-light and soft. We have also found that using cake flour instead of all-purpose flour keeps the dough well-hydrated and therefore very consistent across the batch- this means that the first pancakes to hit the griddle are usually not dramatically different from the last ones cooked. Sifting also makes a big difference to these pancakes. We haven't found any other pancake recipes that require sifting- and in fact, the recipe on the side of the self-rising cake flour we use specifically demands unsifted flour. But especially in warm weather, unsifted flour forms clumps and lumps. Now, the presence of a few lumps is a good thing in a loose batter- that's why we include 3 tablespoons of unsifted flour- but too many clumps quickly turn a batter dense, heavy, and uneven. One quick tip on adding fruit: With berries, we find that it is best to add them immediately before the pancakes are ready to be turned, and not incorporated into the batter before it is poured onto the griddle. This keeps the berries from breaking and spreading into a wet, red blotch, something that also reduces the pancake's rise. You'll know it is time to add the berries when you begin to see the first bubbles in the batter that burst and do not reseal themselves (we have marked one of them with orange arrows in the photograph). These 'pancake tunnels' are a measure of doneness- when they start to appear all over the pancake, it's time to grab the spatula and flip! Pancakes are always best when they're plated up and served immediately after they're cooked, but if you're making a large batch and want to serve all the pancakes at once, you can keep them in a dry oven at 180-250 F until you're ready to serve them. A toaster oven works well for this. We recommend that you give them each a little smear of soft, salted butter, and a generous drizzle of maple syrup- but please use the real stuff on these pancakes- they're worth it. No-Fail Fluffy Berry Pancakes 3 cups sifted self-rising cake flour 3 Tablespoons unsifted self-rising cake flour 1/4 cup sugar 3 eggs, well beaten 2 cups whole milk 1 teaspoon oil (canola, peanut, corn) or melted butter blueberries or raspberries Heat a flat grill pan or griddle on medium-low heat as you prepare the pancake batter. Add all wet ingredients to the sifted flour and mix together by hand until fully combined. Add unsifted flour to the mixture, stirring just enough to moisten the flour (lumps are good). Let the batter sit for 3 minutes. Brush the griddle with oil (do not use olive oil!) and pour 1/4 cup portions of batter out onto the pan, leaving enough room so that the pancakes do not touch one another. Add berries just before pancakes are ready to be flipped (when holes appear in the pancakes that do not reseal themselves). Cook pancakes until they are browned on both sides and serve immediately. Serves 4 hungry people. 2006 nycnosh.com

Pasteis de Nata- The New (Portuguese) Kid on the Block
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-08-10 03:13:00
***CONTENT
 Good pasteis de nata, Portuguese custard tarts, are some of the best pastries in the world. We had our first taste of them last September, on a week-long visit to Lisbon during which time we fell completely in love with these goodies- so much so, that we made a habit of starting every day with two pasteis and a cup or two of strong, creamy coffee, the consistency of chocolate milk. And we weren't the only ones: practically every Lisboan we saw did the same. Invented on the outskirts of Lisbon in the town (and cathedral) of Belem, the pastries- called pasteis de Belem there- became so popular that they were quickly reverse engineered by cooks across the country, reproduced, and then adopted as Portugal's national baked good. Today, it's hard to find a bakery anywhere in Portugal that does not sell their own version. While local species of pasteis de nata vary a bit, they are generally quite similar to one another. All are composed of a sweet, pudding-thick cream and egg yolk custard that may or may not contain vanilla, and the surrounding cup, made from a crisp, buttery pate brisée shell that is very much like a pliable pie crust. The only problem is that, outside of Portugal, they are hard to find. However, as we discovered this week while browsing at our local Amish Market in Hell's Kitchen, Jordan's Baking Company (no relation to Jordan Lobster Farms), a Portuguese artisanal bakery in Newark's Ironbound District, has started packaging and shipping its own version of the pastel de nata ($4.99 for 4) to the metropolitan area. This ought to be a good thing, but if the pastries we sampled are any indication, there are some quality control issues that need to be worked out before Jordan's makes these Portuguese treats popular local nosh. We found the custard to be perfect: eggy like a French clafoutis, thick, and exactly the right sweetness. But the rim of every shell on every single pastel we saw, both in the shop and in the box we purchased, was burned badly, producing an acrid and bitter taste in the pastry. For comparison, the upper photograph in this post shows Lisboan pasteis; the lower photograph shows the pasteis from Jordan's. The airtight plastic packaging also allows for condensation, which moistens the shells to the point where they are floppy at best, soggy at worst. Unfortunately, these two problems render the pasteis pretty much inedible, which is a colossal shame, given the high quality of the custard. But there is no reason at all why these production glitches cannot be fixed with a little more careful baking and a rejiggering of the packaging process (our hunch is that the pasteis are boxed up warm, which leads to the condensation problems). We're keeping our fingers crossed that Jordan's gets this one right though- someone needs to take the ubiquitous cupcake down a few pegs. Pasteis de nata are available at Amish Markets and are made by Jordan's Baking Company, 973-465-4438

looks like the chinese egg custard tarts, except those aren't browned...frequently the bakeries in chinatown will have a \"portuguese\" version too.

They are similar, Sarah- good eye. The Chinese version often uses lard in the pastry though, while this kind almost always uses butter.

i love the chinese ones, but they are not quite the same. the pasteis in lisbon have a flaky, crunchy crust that is more like millefeuille than the chinese ones. it crunches and flakes, unlike the chinese ones which crumble, more like cake. also, the portugese ones are just a little scalded on the top of the custard (but not the crust) but the chinese ones are excellent, and they do okay in a pinch.
Nosher
2006-08-14 19:42:00
Keith, Yes, you're exactly right about the millefeuille comparison- we noticed the same thing. Good call. I'd say that most (not all) of the custard tops are browned or blackened, depending on where in Portugal you are. And we also agree on the Chinese version- they're just fine- not quite pasteis de nata, but not bad at all.

These are my fave pastries (actually any portuguese pastry is my fave). There are many more bakeries in Newark's Ironbound section that make those. Jordan's unfortunately isn't the best (Teixeira's Bakery or Riviera Cafe are pretty good). But again nothing beats having one in a \"cafezinho Lisboeta a beira mar\" with a really good \"biquinha\" (expresso).

RE: millefeuille vs crumbly chinese egg tarts... it really depends on the chinese bakery that you buy the egg tarts from. Egg Custard King on Mott st just south of Canal will have the flakier crusts. They also sell the portugese version.

 If there is some part of you that likes doughnuts- any part, no matter how tiny- you need to head to Alpha Donuts in Sunnyside, Queens immediately. The baked goods you'll find there are not gourmet Lower East Side doughnuts, big as a football and sold in flavors such as Chipotle-Lemon, Fennel, and Dryer Lint. No, these are old-fashioned, traditional yeast and cake doughnuts of the variety that Dunkin' Donuts has spent decades trying to recreate. But these are the real thing- made fresh, on-site, every day, in more than 20 styles, and served in a coffee shop that appears not to have changed since the end of WWII. HungryMan and I have spent the past week sampling doughnuts and muffins from Alpha, sharing our fried dough bounty with anyone and everyone who's willing to take a little bite, and the universal agreement is that these are some truly excellent treats. Our first visit was a trial-run, during which we purchased one lone chocolate glazed cake doughnut ($0.70). But it was that rich, still-warm snack, eaten greedily on our subway ride back to Manhattan (pace, MTA police), that convinced us to head back the very next day to the 46th/Bliss stop on the 7 line for more evidence. The next night, we ate a light dinner in anticipation of the tasting to come: a full-scale, eight doughnut battery designed to leave us with no doubt about the quality of Alpha Donuts' product. To keep ourselves from becoming stuffed after the first two doughnuts, we cut bite-sized, wedge-shaped slices from each of the pastries, with the understanding that at the end, we might want to return to finish off one (or two) that we particularly enjoyed. We also organized the tasting by flavor, starting with the lighter doughnuts and ending with the richest. Our three favorites of the night were: (1) the Boston cream (with sprinkles), a light, chocolate-glazed yeast doughnut filled with thick vanilla custard; (2) the simple plain sugar-raised yeast doughnut, lighter than cotton balls and astoundingly non-greasy; and (3) the toasted coconut crunch cake doughnut, infused with very soft aromas of nutmeg. I also thought the chocolate coconut cake doughnut was pretty spectacular, and HungryMan felt the same way about the crumb-topped apple-filled yeast doughnut, which tasted very nearly like a slice of apple pie. Other flavors, such as the marble cake doughnut, the strawberry-filled yeast doughnut, and the crumb-topped yeast doughnut were almost as good. HungryMan and I finished off the chocolate coconut cake doughnut and the apple crumb doughnut, and the rest of the box went with HungryMan to work the following day, where Candide proclaimed them \"really wonderful.\" Meanwhile, I took advantage of a break in my own workday to head back to Sunnyside for another visit. This time, I sat at the formica counter that unfurls itself, serpentine, from the cash register to the kitchen, and ordered a fresh, homemade toasted blueberry muffin ($1.oo) and an iced coffee ($1.50). I have eaten hundreds of muffins in this city, at least a tenth of which have been blueberry, and not one of those is half as perfect as what I ate at Alpha Donuts: soft inside without being gummy, sweet and salty from a razor-thin layer of butter spread over the split interior, and dotted with constellations of blueberry pieces throughout. I have no idea where the blueberries come from, or what kind they are, and I really don't care- what matters most here is that the final product is superb. As I sat at the counter, I even gave serious consideration to looking for an apartment in Sunnyside. My iced coffee was decent, as well. I suspect that the hot, brewed coffee is probably much better (it certainly smelled good), and from the frequency with which the one lone server ground new beans and refilled the percolator, I'll venture a guess that a new pot of java comes out of the machine at least a few times an hour. Customers at Alpha Donuts also seem to drink quite a bit of the stuff, sitting and chatting with the waitress, grill cook, and baker. As one patron remarked, \"Hey, I've been here for eight hours already- I'll get to see the next shift start,\" I got the distinct impression that it's probably pretty common for customers to park themselves at the counter for hours at a stretch, and that seems to suit everyone concerned just fine. This is a restaurant where the staff address patrons by name when they walk through the front door, a place where the cashier sees a customer on the sidewalk and bags her doughnut for her before she has even set foot inside- it is exactly the kind of coffee shop that makes you reconsider everything you have ever heard about unfriendly New Yorkers... and unhealthy doughnuts. Alpha Donuts, 45-16 Queens Boulevard (at 46th Street)- just outside the 46th/Bliss station on the 7 line, Sunnyside, Queens

Hey! I went to this place about a year ago when I was waiting for the 7 train. You're right about it. It is AMAZING. I got 4 donuts and ate all of them by the time I got to 42nd street.

This review is so on target. I am a regular and everything is accurate. Also, I come for the eggs over-easy and tasty fresh cut home-fries fresh off the grill.The good cook works from about 6 am to 2 PM tues-sunday. Avoid mondays and late night for food as he's not there then. My opinion...Donuts are always good though 24/7!

This is the real deal. FYI, on Saturdays the baker actually starts between 2:30 and 5PM, so if you want REALLY fresh, hot, and yummy donuts without getting up at dawn, come to Queens.

All Mac, All the Time: S'Mac

 Restaurants specializing in multiple versions of favorite childhood dishes proliferate across New York these days. First came Peanut Butter & Co. on Sullivan Street, with its endless variety of homemade, gourmet peanut butters, and whose sandwiches did everything but remind you of Jif or Peter Pan. Then there was Rice to Riches on Spring Street, which gussied up homely & homey rice pudding. The city has even managed to support more than one grilled cheese establishment: Grilled Cheese on Ludlow Street (the best-known of these, but shuttered in January), and the still-kicking Say Cheese on 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen. And now comes S'Mac, a bright, yellow and orange café in the East Village that works the single-theme magic on another classic: mac n' cheese. Unlike say, rice pudding, the trouble for S'Mac is that there is actually already a good deal of competition on the mac n' cheese front here in NYC. While there might not be another restaurant that offers up nothing but cheesy noodles, the comfort food trend that started in the late 90's has produced some excellent local renditions of the stuff, including those at Blue Smoke (thick and creamy), Eatery (topped with onion rings), and Chat 'n' Chew (with extra crunch). While S'Mac may not reach the heights of some of these worthy versions, its inventive take on the humble pasta dish is still worth a visit, as Nosher, our friend Salli Vates, and I discovered last weekend. Among the three of us, we ordered several helpings of the signature dish, all of which were served in steaming cast-iron skillets with wood trivets underneath. Customers can choose from three sizes: nosh, major munch, and mongo (prices below reflect the three sizes). Service is no-nonsense and fast; you order and pay at the counter, and a waiter brings your order to your table when it's ready. Just be forewarned, dishes may arrive at different times. We opted to try four of the restaurant's flavors: Manchego, Brie, Gruyere and 4 Cheese, expecting that they all would probably taste pretty similar to one another. However, despite the fact that all of S'Mac's mac n' cheeses comprise the same soft pasta, the same base bechamel sauce with a hint of nutmeg, and the same gently crunchy breadcrumb topping (dishes can be ordered with or without the topping), we found substantial variations in flavor among them. The Brie ($6.75, $9, $16), has the nutty creaminess you expect from the cheese, but with a bold hit of sweetness that comes from chunks of roasted fig. Pieces of shiitake mushrooms and fresh rosemary balance out this sweetness well, making this one of S'Mac's most successful dishes. The 4 Cheese ($5.75, $8, $14) was Salli's clear favorite, and it was the first of the four dishes we finished completely. This was a surprisingly light mix of muenster, American, cheddar and gorgonzola cheeses -- surprising because the pungent hit from the gorgonzola was cut by the mildness of the other three cheeses. The 4 Cheese did possess more of a tang than any of the others, and interestingly, it was the only dish in which we could taste the nutmeg from the bechamel sauce. Despite the variety of cheeses at work here, the 4 Cheese dish is a winner by virtue of the richness produced in their combination. The Gruyere ($6.75, $9, $16), we found considerably more bland than the others, even though the pieces of slab bacon provided a nice smoky flavor to the noodles. But neither this, nor the pleasant texture of the bacon cubes in the noodle mixture made much difference to the final product; for some reason, while gruyere works quite well as a melting cheese in other recipes, it provides little flavor when paired with creamy pasta. Our last dish, the Mancheg0 ($6.75, $9, $16) seemed out of place. For one thing, I thought the fig from the Brie belonged here, as it is a natural pairing for the Spanish sheep's cheese with its sweeter, drier flavors. Insted of figs, S'Mac included diced fennel and fennel seeds to the dish, additions that mask the delicate Manchego with aromas of anise. In addition to the combinations we tried, there are also six more, including Cheeseburger (with cheddar, onions and ground beef) and the Mozzarella (with roasted tomatoes and fresh basil). You're also not restricted to S'Mac's suggestions: you can design your own macaroni and cheese masterpiece by mixing and matching a selections of cheeses, meats, vegetables and fresh herbs. S'Mac is also kid friendly; smaller and younger mac n' cheese lovers will love the colorful and casual interior, and the delivery of hot pans and trivets is entertaining, especially when the dining room gets full, which it does... a lot. This popularity also poses a liabilty to the new restaurant, as in the middle of being overrun by curious noshers in its first week in business, S'Mac reportedly ran out of pasta. The good news is that we saw no evidence of shortages on our visit during peak dining hours last weekend, but with all the attention S'Mac is getting for its cheesy noodles, it's probably wise to make a backup plan if you go. Even if you do have to come back another day, you'll be glad that you didn't try to take matters into your own hands. S'Mac (Sarita's Macaroni and Cheese), 345 East 12th Street (between 1st and 2nd Avenues). (212) 358-7912. Closed Mondays.

Sirvino's: Garlic Amidst the Gaelic

***CONTENT
 The blackout made us do it. After reading dozens of news articles about the awful Queens electrical outage last week, HungryMan and I wanted to do something to help support businesses there. So once the electricity had come back on, we decided to hop on the subway and eat dinner in our neighboring borough- something we do a few times a month, but generally in happier circumstances. But this time, we also made a conscious effort to patronize a newly-opened restaurant, one that we thought might have been hit hard by the blackout, as it probably would not yet have had a chance to establish a loyal clientele. Consulting Time Out New York and Eater gave us a several good ideas, which we eventually narrowed down to our pick: Sirvino's, an Italian-American chophouse in Woodside. Sirvino's is a large restaurant that, very much like an Italian hermit crab, has taken up residence in the shell of a former Irish pub. No chance that you'd mistake this for a spot to quaff a Guinness, however, as the piped-in music is clearly intended to remind you of what sort of cuisine you've chosen: 'O Sole Mio?' Check. Frank Sinatra? Check. At least one version of 'Mack the Knife?' Check. The menu is, likewise, a greatest-hits compilation of American-style Italian cooking, offering all the pasta, meat, and seafood standards you might expect, plus a few head-scratchers such as Shepherd's Pie ($10.95) and a Teriyaki Burger ($7.95) that make absolutely no sense at all. I began with a Caesar Salad ($5.95), which ended up being the best dish of the night. As I have mentioned before, I use the simple caesar as a litmus-test dish- if a restaurant makes an awful one, things aren't likely to improve much; if a restaurant makes a good one, it is usually a promising sign. In this case, the salad, which was very lightly dressed and dotted with crisp, garlicky croutons, was excellent, lacking only visible slices of anchovy. I should have stopped there, because in my experience, rarely has such a promising salad led to such disastrous entrées. But in fairness, other warning signs were there from the start. HungryMan's Seafood Salad ($8.95) looked appetizing, but we were both a little surprised to see crab sticks on the plate, when 'crabmeat' had been listed on the menu. Crab sticks are not crab meat; they are surimi, a pressed fish product that is processed to resemble crab. But, because all of the other seafood on the plate appeared to be as advertised, HungryMan tucked into it, although not before remarking on the large quantity of scallions in the dressing. A few bites in, he remarked that green onion was all he could taste, and as I popped a piece of scungilli into my mouth, I had to agree. Strong, overpowering flavors when combined with seafood arouse instant suspicion, and this situation was no different. We wondered: was the scallion overdose done on purpose, to cover up substandard seafood, or was it simply evidence of poor cooking? My main dish gave us a chance to solve this riddle, as I had earlier ordered seafood as part of the Wild Fettucine ($13.95- $10.95 without the shrimp). Starting with a few bites of a still-steaming prawn, I was rewarded with a mouthful of tender seafood, but one that tasted like grill fuel, not like spoiled fish. And it only got worse: the sauce, which was described on the menu as a balsamic vinegar sauce, was more acidic than nearly anything I have ever tasted. Imagine eating pasta topped with mushrooms, sun-dried tomatoes, and Sour Skittles, and you're nearly there. The steam from the plate was also enough to make me tear up from the vinegar. Leaking tears into my food, I tasted the pasta, but couldn't manage to eat more than a few pucker-inducing bites. As luck would have it, HungryMan had ordered the... wait for it... Vinegar Pork Chop & Peppers ($14.95), a house specialty that our server promised us was 'just beautiful.' And from a visual standpoint, he wasn't wrong; the double cut chop made a very fine impression, ladled with a generous helping of sautéed red peppers, onions, and rosemary. Sadly, Sirvino's Achilles heel, vinegar, proved the undoing of this dish, as well. Excessive amounts of the stuff must have been added to the pan during deglazing, because the ultra-tangy effect permeated (and ruined) everything except the deepest interior of the pork chop. HungryMan did manage to eat about a third of the chop, but only by slicing away most of the top and bottom layers of the meat- the parts, in other words, that had touched the saucepan. As I sat and watched HungryMan eat, treating his pork chop like a hot artifact from Chernobyl, I was reminded of meals I had eaten a decade ago, right after a previous boyfriend discovered balsamic vinegar- dinners where every (inedible) salad glistened with brown droplets, and nights when entire chickens were soaked in the stuff and baked for an hour, producing a steam that also conveniently removed both the wallpaper and the labels from every bottle in our pantry. Mistakes like those are easy to forgive a novice cook- and I did, smiling as I choked down yet another balsamic bomb- but there is just no excuse for them from a professional chef, crippling blackout or no. Sirvino's, 60-19 Roosevelt Avenue, Woodside, Queens, 718-565-3045

 <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/nycnosh/196687364/\" title=\"Photo class=\"softframing\" style=\"float:right\"Sharing\">Good Enough to Eat is probably best known for its weekend brunch service, and perhaps also for the seemingly unending lines of patrons who queue out the doors and down the block for a table during these times. And generally, the high demand for brunch is well-deserved; Good Enough to Eat makes a mean platter of french toast and some fabulous omelettes. But being one of the Upper West Side's best breakfast and brunch spots apparently isn't enough for GETE, as its ambitious dinner menu, a greatest-hits collection of modern American fare, clearly shows. It's a menu that we've found ourselves perusing many times while waiting for a Sunday morning table, but never giving serious thought to...until a recent steamy Tuesday night, that is, when we returned to check out what happens at GETE when pancakes are just a distant memory. The good news is that, when the restaurant plays to its strengths, especially with the smaller appetizers and desserts, it scores some real winners. Like the house salad, constructed simply of mesclun greens, red leaf lettuce, and dressed in a light dijon mustard vinaigrette. Some might find a little too much mustard in the dressing for their taste, but for us this perked up the greens immensely. Best of all, the house salad is included in the price of most entrées. As we ate our salads, seated outdoors in the picket-fenced enclosure, we commented on the meal's promising start, and even stopped noticing the M11 bus that drove past us every ten minutes or so. Unfortunately, we were in for a let-down with our main courses. My ‘nutty crusted chicken breast’ (a special, $18.50) was far too much protein on one plate, and the cherry-mint sauce that smothered it was painfully sweet. The accompanying sweet potato french fries-for me, normally, a reason to order almost any dish- were cut too thin and overcooked into a brittle mess. A pile of sautéed kale seemed to represent an attempt to include something healthful on the plate, but these greens were cooked in so much much butter so as to be nothing less than decadent. Nosher’s chimichurri grouper (another special, $19) was even more disappointing. Tough and chewy, eating it was like gnawing on a piece of Vulcanized rubber, only with extra gristle. The flavors here were also bland and unhelped by very stingy saucing- the only thing that might have helped to counteract the stupefyingly poor preparation of the fish. Worse, the mountain of mashed potatoes on the plate were similarly tasteless. The only good part of this main dish was the corn, sliced fresh off-the-cob, steaming hot and well-seasoned. It was the lone thing on the plate that Nosher finished. Then, just as we'd given up all hope for the meal, it was time for dessert. Nosher was, understandably, ready to leave, but I persisted, as I had spent the previous hour eyeing the lineup of home-made desserts, displayed like jewels in a prominent case alongside the counter. We were encouraged to get up from our table and inspect the goodies in order to choose one, an exercise that yielded helpful, unsolicited advice from the servers and owners. We finally settled on an apple and cherry cobbler, which was satisfyingly gooey from the dozens of cooked cherries inside, a softness that played beautifully with the texture of the still-firm apples and crisp pastry shell. Lovely stuff, but we already knew that Good Enough to Eat made some knockout baked goods. It pains us to say this, but the mediocre-to-poor quality of our food was bad enough that we're not likely to return for anything other than brunch- a pretty shameful result for a restaurant that really ought to be able to capitalize on its well-earned A.M. reputation- but until something changes, it's nowhere to be found after dark. Good Enough to Eat, 483 Amsterdam Avenue (between 83rd and 84th Streets), 212-496-0163

L'Allegria's Little Brick Oven That Could

 Unless you're lucky enough to live near one of the four major stars of New York City's pizza scene- Di Fara, Grimaldi's, Lombardi's, or John's (Bleecker Street), you probably have to make compromises when it comes to ordering pizza. We certainly have. Now that Fat Sal is officially dead to us and forever written out of the will, we've had to take up the search for a decent pie in Hell's Kitchen again... much to our chagrin. You may recall that we found a pretty wonderful White Clam Pizza at Don Giovanni's last year, and while we continue to appreciate this briny treat, we have noticed that you've really got to be in the right mood to eat one. Sadly, we have also found that Don Giovanni's other pizza offerings aren't quite as good, so when we don't want mollusks with our mozzarella, we have to look elsewhere. In this pursuit, we've tried most pizzerias in Midtown West, but just this week, we finally got around to sampling L'Allegria's brick-oven pizza, which they sell for delivery or carry-out in a tiny storefront on 44th Street, just around the corner from their main restaurant. Having heard both good things (the pizza is very thin and crispy) and bad (rumors about an apartment fire in that building, started by said pizza oven), we put off a visit to L'Allegria for almost two years. Our first impressions are mostly good ones: the pie's crust is indeed pleasantly crispy (if a little charred here and there), and the dough is pulled as thin as a bed sheet before being slathered with a light, moderately sweet tomato sauce and topped. The artichoke and fresh tomato pizza ($18) we ordered was a little pricey, but in general, it was worth the cost, and certainly worth another taste. Slices here are, inexplicably, a bargain, running about $2 apiece. We'll be back to sample a few of them, although we probably won't sit at the bar stools and eat- that oven still makes us a little nervous. L'Allegria Pizzeria, on 44th Street, around the corner from 623 9th Avenue, 212-265-6777

I Love It When You Call Me Beard Papa

***CONTENT
 Choux pastry surrounded by pie crust sounds like a combination that only an American- or perhaps a lipophilic Scot-would invent, but in fact, this particular brand of butter-on-butter action has a surprising provenance: it is Japanese. French cuisine, and especially traditional baking, has been in vogue in Japan for many years now, and by most accounts, some of the very best French chefs hail from the Land of the Rising Sun. If you remain unconvinced, watch an episode of the original Iron Chef, and you'll see that some inventive new twists are being put on the cuisine that Julia Child worked so hard to codify 50 years ago. Beard Papa's two-layer cream puff shell stands as a perfect example of this: it takes the original and solves some of its biggest problems. Perhaps Beard Papa's biggest improvement to the puff is that it has a substantially longer shelf life than its predecessor- instead of going soggy or rubbery after an hour or two out of the oven, the double-pastry puff easily lasts a day. And somehow, the pastry shell is light- we spent quite a long time studying the patented puff to discover just how this is possible, and all that we were able to deduce is that the pie crust layer is rolled tissue-thin and then wrapped around the choux pastry, which prevents the dessert from taking on the heft of a pudding-filled empanada. Clever stuff. Beard Papa also fills its cream puffs to order, baking only enough shells to last a few hours, and whipping up, quite literally, a new batch of their cream custard three or four times a day. When we visited Beard Papa's Upper West Side branch (Beard Papa now operates five shops in Manhattan, one of which takes up about a quarter of Café Zaiya's retail space in Midtown) this weekend, we were lucky enough to stop by on a day when we could grab a truly multi-culti snack: a milk tea custard cream puff and a mango shaved-ice. We both really loved the simplicity of the Mango Madness ($4.50), which was composed of fresh mango cubes in a sweet mango syrup, mango purée, and shaved ice. I don't know how I'd feel about this treat in January, but in July, it was ideal. As was the tennis ball-sized milk tea cream puff ($1.55), whose complexity of flavors owed much to the subtle maltiness of the tea in the custard. All of the cream puffs go well with coffee, but this flavor in particular would be a perfect match for a cup of java (iced or hot), which you can also purchase at Beard Papa. If that makes the pastry sound too much like a doughnut, too much like something you can grab and munch on your walk to work, just remember: this is high-tech, eyes-only, patented dough here. You should probably sit down to eat it, if for no other reason than to avoid dropping powdered sugar and custard all over your outfit. Beard Papa Sweets Café, 2167 Broadway (at 76th Street), 212-799-3770, (one of five locations in NYC)

You could tell the puff isn't traditional Scottish, despite the pastry combo, because it isn't finished by dipping in batter and deep-frying. Though there's an idea...

I hear tell that Beard Papa is coming to Seattle. I can't wait, but I'm sure my dietitian is cringing in horror. Nothing another 30 minutes on the stairmill can't cure, though. I love anything made with freshly baked pâte à choux, sweet or savory. I'd love a meal with a nice chicken salad (maybe curry) in a pâte à choux puff, followed by a fresh cream puff or profiterole of any variety. Mmmm. Does B.P. do savory too?

I don't know the name of it but they serve Hawaiian Kona coffee too (which is really good). I found their puffs to be just as good as Beard Papa, maybe even better. They were less sweet than BP's and just as light and crisp.

rose i have tried the original CHOUX PASTRY shop uptown north of the trump tower and united nations. it's a tasty puff and yes less sweet, but i dk if better than BP's, just different. i do prefer it less sweet like that, but really they both are equally good. also of course the coffee at CHOUX is superb joe.

Nosher, Here is a reason to make a return trip in July, at least to the Broadway branch near Astor Place: the white hot chocolate is right up there with my favorite cups in the city. I know I'll be making the return trip. P.

 There may never again be a more perfect time to watch a documentary about the legendarily traumatic two-block move of Greenwich Village stalwart, Shopsin's. In 2002, the restaurant, one of my all-time favorite places in New York, was forced to leave its old Greenwich Village location, eventually relocating to a new home (its current digs) on Carmine Street. The stars are aligned just right to relive the event on celluloid, because it seems that another move is likely for Kenny Shopsin & family, although it looks as if this time, they may end up fording the Gowanus in the bargain. Regardless of whether Shopsin's finds a new address or stays put, Matt Mahurin's lo-fi documentary is worth a watch when it is given a limited release this Friday. The film is quirky and almost journalistic at times, despite Kenny's rejection of the whole idea of answering short questions with long answers for the sake of narrative. Most of the movie possesses a rough-hewn charm that stems in large part from its fuzzy, unequalized audio- the majority of which appears to have been captured through a tiny lavalier microphone that spent most of its time held between the fingers of the camera operator. Nevermind the crackles and inaudible bits; what the film does capture is fascinating. As an archival document, the film manages to preserve not only some great footage of Eve Shopsin, who passed away in 2003, but also of the entire Shopsin clan in their original context. And listening to Kenny Shopsin (who is in almost all the scenes), it is easy to feel as if you are being granted an audience with an occasionally potty-mouthed Dalai Lama, someone who compares the thrill of mixing unusual combinations of ingredients to the sexual frisson from poking a schvantz into the wrong orifice. But throughout, Shopsin comes off more avuncular than asshole, and ends up thoroughly humanized by the film's warts-and-all inclusiveness. There's something also very Shopsin about the fact that the film's release at Cinema Village this weekend will coincide perfectly with the restaurant's month-long summer vacation- even a media coup like this one won't change Kenny Shopsin, and frankly, that's just the way we like it. 'I Like Killing Flies,' a film by Matt Mahurin, starts 28 July 2006 at Cinema Village, 22 E. 12th Street, 212-924-3363

Urban Archeology: In Search of Schrafft's

***CONTENT
 More than 100 years after Frank Shattuck opened the first Schrafft's restaurant and candy store on the site where Macy's now stands, the legendary restaurant chain has been effaced almost completely from the cityscape. No small feat, this wholesale erasure, when you stop to consider that at its peak, there were more than fifty Schrafft's in New York City, offering three full-service meals a day, drinks, and desserts in well-appointed and obsessively clean dining rooms. Schrafft's occupied a territory somewhere between a diner and moderately-priced American restaurant- there really is no modern equivalent. Despite the fact that both HungryMan and I are both too young to remember visiting Schrafft's, we have been thinking quite a lot about extinct eateries recently after reading Joan Kanel Slomanson's When Everybody Ate at Schrafft's: Memories, Pictures, and Recipes from a Very Special Restaurant. The book got us thinking about NYC dining history, about how food in the city has changed, and about the kinds of grooves we might have worn in the city's sidewalks, had we been alive 75 years ago. Where, we started to wonder, would we have eaten, and even more interestingly, what? None of this is to say that Slomanson's book is a good read- it is not. Disjointed, rambling, and often embarrassingly poorly-written, When Everybody Ate at Schrafft's is little more than a very sloppy corporate kiss with a few recipes thrown in for good measure. But even those disappoint: Slomanson includes a few treasures (Cheese Bread Made Two Ways, and the Hot Fudge Sauce), but she also apparently can't be bothered to scale down some industrial recipes for home cooks- if you find yourself in need of five quarts of barbecue sauce though, this is the book for you. Both HungryMan and I found ourselves entranced by idea of Schrafft's, but appalled by the book's lazy writing and editing, not to mention Slomanson's overly nostalgic bleating for 'the good old days.' So we took matters into our own hands and started a search party for a chain of restaurants that has been gone for more than 25 years. Using the reproduced Schrafft's Walk Guides that Slomanson includes on the front and back endpapers of the book, we set out to see if any remnants of former Schrafft's restaurants in Midtown could still be found. The first two images in this post show the same site: 556 Fifth Avenue, just off the corner from 46th Street. What was once the Frank Shattuck Building is now the Philippine Consulate- with the resurfacing of the facade, there is now no trace at all of the old Schrafft's that once stood there. In many cases, buildings had been renumbered when old structures were demolished and new ones- wider or narrower than their predecessors- were erected. One example of this is particularly striking: A Schrafft's once stood at 1237 Avenue of the Americas (Sixth Avenue), but today there is no such address. The McGraw-Hill Building squats on that entire block, having engulfed all other street numbers in its enormity. And as with every other location we visited, not a single memento of Schrafft's persists. If you're wondering what happened to Schrafft's, there is a not-so-simple answer. In 1978, the entire company was bought out by the Riese Organization, the company that licenses T.G.I. Friday's, Charley O's, and Lindy's franchises. In purchasing the real estate as well as the rights to the restaurant chain, Riese made a prescient move, because as you can see from the photos here, they acquired some of the most prime real estate in Gotham in the bargain. All of the Schrafft's restaurants soon closed (including the ones in Boston, Connecticut, and Philadelphia), and the building space left behind was then either sold or repurposed, until Schrafft's faded away as just a memory in the minds of Northeasterners of a certain age. Well, sort of... . Very recently, the Schrafft's brand has been reanimated like a pet schnauser in a Stephen King novel and put to work selling premium ice cream in the Northeast US. (The name was actually licensed once before in the late 1980's, for the same purpose.) But even more surprising is that there is also now a Schrafft's ice cream shop on The Strip in Las Vegas, where it sits alongside simulacra of the Great Pyramids, Venice, and the Eiffel Tower. It might not be your mother's Schrafft's, but we bet the ice cream is still better than what you'd get at the Philippine Consulate. Update (26 July)- A reader named plainclothes left us a comment last week, telling us that he had spotted just a hint of an old Schrafft's restaurant on Smith Street in Brooklyn. He and Antoinette Indge snapped a few photos of the building and its fading Schrafft's logo, and they've been kind enough to let us put them on Flickr to share with everyone. Enjoy!

Well, I'm old enuf to remember Shraffts. I remember my grandmother forcing a chopped egg on toasted cheesbread sandwich on me--it was probably delicious, but I wouldn't eat it. I think some Schraffts also had bars and served drinks--so secretaries could have the aforementioned sandwich with a few Grasshoppers. Now, does anyone remember Mary Elizabeth's Tea Room (which was near the late great Altmans)? THAT was some good eatin!

This piece got me thinking that maybe the proliferation of shopping malls might also have killed Schrafft's. I can say without even thinking too long that those and the riots did so to Sanders restaurants in Detroit. I understand that someone has opened a \"Sanders\" on the east side of Detroit, but it just isn't the same. When I worked nearby for two summers during college, a friend and I would go to the local Sanders once a week for lunch. They always had a special that was less than $2 and we would usually get whatever that was and then splurge on a sundae. That particular one closed after the riots in 1967, as did most businesses on that section of Woodward Ave. By then, the downtown area was pretty weak. It wasn't too long after that J.L. Hudson closed the store downtown and imploded the building. By the time the riots happened, they had moved out to Birmingham. Several of the killings in the riots took place from their old building where a sniper picked off people walking down the sidewalk. Am sure that building is long gone, too. It should have been gone when I worked there!

If you are willing to expand your search to Brooklyn, there is (or was, not to long ago)the clear remains of a Schrafft's storefront sign (in iron?) near the Jay St. stop of the B61 bus (near the corner of Jay and Willoughby, sorry I cannot recall exactly, maybe near the Brooklyn Tabernacle?). I could try and photograph it for you on monday. I noticed it a few years ago because I believe a few of J.D. Salinger's characters ate there.

Plainclothes, we'd love to see that. We stuck to Midtown, but there were Schrafft's restaurants in all five boroughs. It would be great if there were just a ghost of a hint remaining still of the chain, something not next to a casino.

I remember eating at Schraffts with my grandmother. I believe there is an old Shraffts location -- a white, freestanding building (now an antique shop) -- on East 79th Street, just East of Lexington, on the north side of the street (153?). That Shraffts became a Chinese restaurant in the 70s, whose proud and hard working owner resisted alleged mafia pessure to use their table cloth service. He was shot one night after closing, and the restaurant set on fire. Anyway, so much of the Shraffts experience is connected to parts of our culture that are pretty much lost -- like men and women of all classes dressing in a more formal, dignified way, children being expected to sit quietly in a restaurant. Not to mention the old expectation that you could reasonably leave your desk during lunch, and also live in Manhattan and be middle class. Anyone eating at a Shraffts of the past now would miss modern culinary developments like the abundance of fresh vegetables available year round. Many thanks to NYCNosh for your fun archeology section.

While it still stands, you might try to see the building on the Southeast corner of 13th Street and Fifth Anenue. Once a Schrafft's, then the Lone Star, and most recently a salad-bar-type deli, it had a fire late this past winter or early spring. Demolition doesn't look imminent but somehow seems likely.

The remains of a recognizable Schrafft's were, until recently, still visible at 61 5th Avenue (corner of 13th Street). In the 70s-80s, the building became the famous Lone Star Cafe (with a giant iguana on the roof), but when that moved, the lovely building became home to one more greengrocer/deli in Manhattan. I used to live around the corner from the place, but don't get to that neighborhood much anymore. I was walking by there in April, turning the corner from 13th to 5th when I caught a nasty, smouldering smell in the the air and saw that the former Schrafft's had been gutted by a fire. I had to stop and mourn a few minutes before continuing on my way. No idea what's happened there since . . .

I remember Schraffts very well. My father was one of their house electricians. Poor guy, he carried a heavy toolbox on the subway going from restaurant to restaurant for years. My mother and I would meet him from time to time for an ice cream soda or something. It was a nice place for well-behaved children and the ladies who lunched.....and, yes, they did serve cocktails.The waitresses wore black dresses with white aprons. Didn't Kirk Douglas work at a Schraffts counter once upon a time? For many years my parents had Schraffts china in their kitchen....indestructible stuff. I think I spotted some once at Fishs Eddy. They sold chocolates, too.....how I loved those flat little boxes of chocolate \"cigarettes\".

When I was little, my Grandmother would take me to Radio City to see the Christmas show, and we'd have lunch at Schrafft's. I don't remember the food at all, but I do remember going there. I think there was one downtown on Broad Street, on the west side of the street right by the southern stairs to the J train.

I used to dabble in magic and card tricks and and after my Mother took me to Tannens magic shop on 45th st, we ate at Schraffts downstairs. I totally remember it. I miss those days. Theres remnants of one right off the train near Fulton St still..I gotta take a photo of it next time i'm there.

When I was a kid from Rye, New York in the mid-70's, my folks used to drive us up the Post Road for ice cream at the Schrafft's in Port Chester, just up the hill from the old Capitol Theater. I recall butterscotch/hot fudge sundaes, candy sticks in little glass jars and, perhaps, taffy? Good times.

I remember Schraffts, my mom always used to take me there after we saw a matinee. I also remember Horn & Hardardt - where all the food was behind little glass doors and you had to put coins in a slot to get the door to open. They had great pie.

2006-08-07 12:27:00
Funny that the various comments mention both a Schraffts and Horn & Hardart. The picture that plaincloths posted is actually the Jay Street side of a Schraffts whose entrance was on Fulton St...diagonally across the street from an H&H Automat that was also on Fulton St. My mother used to take me to this Schraffts in the early 60's for an ice cream treat that she was sure I would love...a butterscotch sundae. She never could understand why I didn't like it, since it was always her favorite Schraffts treat back when she was a kid in the 1920's. Schraffts was definitely a big hit with old dowagers and the lace-curtain-Irish set.

It's tragic that this great restaurant chain has been erased from the Manhattan landscape. The sundaes, the chicken a la king, the perfect food and most of all the candy are sorely missed. I wholeheartedly agree that Ms. Slomanson's book is inadequate at best-poorly written and I know that her book is misleading and littered with blatantly false information. She disregards the fact that Schrafft's candy was the backbone of every one of the restaurants throughout the Northeast-if anyone wants to revisit what Schrafft's was, travel to Boston and see the historical landmark Schrafft's candy factory.

THAT'S THE PLACE WITH THE SOCIAL SECURITY WAITRESSES.\" WHEREUPON, BERLE DID A STAGGER OF AN OLD LADY HOLDING AN IMAGINARY TRAY WHILE PUSHING AN IMAGINARY WALKER. HE GOT SCREAMS WITH THAT!

My Grandfather, Gabriele Antico, was the manager of the entire candy floor when I was a child. In the 1940's Mom used to take my sister and me to have lunch in the VIP dinning room at the factory. Then we would tour the candy floor and watch all the ladies at work. I especially remember the \"dippers\". When my grandfather came here from Italy in 1905, he started at Schrafft's as a \"Chocolate Boy\" carrying pails of chocolate. His name is on a plaque in the factory building.

My senior year at Emerson College ('91), Boston, I did an extensive audio documentary project about the history of the Schrafft's candy factory, in Charlestown MA (literally a stone's throw from Boston. One of the people I interviewed was the great-great (if I remember correctly) grandson of W.F. Schrafft. He had some wonderfully intersting anecdotes to share. What prompted that was, when I was a child, my parents and I would drive by the factory on the way to my father's women's coat store in what was the garment district of Boston, up untill the late 1980s. Living in the college dorm, I realized I was a subway ride away from finally seeing the building up close. It was (is) gorgeous, and I loved the Art Deco style anyway. Anyway, the factory (which closed in 1984) had been converted into an R & D property w/ multiple companies renting space. I managed to convince a plant manager to let me up on the roof of the clock tower, on a brisk, windy December day. What a view of the city! I was very lucky to get inside access & interview the people I did. They ranged from someone who actually worked on the line, another with fond childhood memories of the restaurants in New York (\"They were forever chipping things onto toast.\"), to a disgruntled former manager (then working at Necco, at the time of the interview!), and then of course, the relative of W.F. After I graduated, I got to play the documentary on the air, at a little local AM station I was working at.

My father and two of his brothers used to work for Schrafft's at a distribution/warehouse center somewhere downtown (I think)before it closed and moved to the South Bronx. During the holidays, my Dad brought home mince, apple and pumpkin pies. Their fruit cake - unlike the flavorless bricks they sell these days - was to die for. We grew up sampling every ice cream flavor they had to offer. I used to literally cry when my Dad gave away pumpkin pies. When they finally went out of business, I was forced to learn to make my own pumpkin pies which has become an annual tradition in our home. I remember seeing an old menu with ridiculously low prices on it. Sadly, Schrafft's like a lot of other smaller chain resturants could not withstand the McDonalds juggernaut.

Shortly after arriving in the United States from Argentina, I went to work for a fashion store called Famous Fashions Shop on 23rd Street, New York. My english was not very good yet but I struggled through! The funny part is that my future husband’s first job when he was sixteen years old, several years earlier, was at a restaurant across the street named Schraffts. I used to buy breakfast and lunch at Schraffts, small world! Of course we did not know each other then. We met in 1968 and were married the following year. We will celebrate our 38th wedding anniversary in February, 2007.

I write a weekly q&a antiques and collectibles column for a daily paper and am presently researching an inquiry about a demitasse or cocoa spoon made by Oneida, pattern name is \"Shraffts\" (no c). Made in 1922, the spoon was also issued with a fancy bowl inscribed, \"Souvenir of Coney Island.\" Since it is not uncommon to see pattern names incorrectly spelled when recorded, it has been suggested to me that the spoons may have been part of Oneida's restaurant/hotel line of silverware and made for Schraffts. I would like to know if anyone knows if there was a Schrafft's restaurant at Coney Island or if anyone remembers the spoons and I would be very appreciative of any information that can be provided here or at alycehand@aol.com.

As a child I lived in New York on 57th Street. We would go to Schraftts all the time and I remember it well. Their fudge was the best I have ever had. In fact, while I was looking for a recipe for it I found this site. I remember they also had these wax figures with chocolate inside. You would scrape the chocolate out to eat. They also had the greatest chocolate cake with marshmallow frosting and chocolate drizzled down the sides. Boy, that was a wonderful place! Thanks for the memories.

Growing up in San Francisco, the only thing I knew about Schrafft's was that, after a fight between Ricky and Fred, Lucy and Ethel agreed that they could always \"meet secretly for lunch at Schrafft's\". So when I came to New York for the first time in October 1980 and saw my first Schrafft's on Fifth Avenue at 38th Street, across from Lord & Taylor, despite my limited budget (I was staying at the Y for $13 a day), I went in for lunch (chicken sandwich) and a hot fudge sundae. When I came back to NY in 1982, Schrafft's was gone. And gone too is the soup bar on Lord & Taylor's 10th floor, and the Charleston Garden at Altman's.

I remember Schrafft's well. They were scattered around NYC. When I was a boy, my Mom would take me for lunch and I would always order a hamburger and french fries. One memory sticks out. There would never be a ketchup bottle on the table! The waitress ( Irish, dressed in starched black and white uniform) would bring a white paper shaped like a Mr. Coffee filter but the size (small) of a Reeses peanut butter cup with ketchup in it and a flat wooden spoon like you would get with an ice cream cup. The payoff was that they had a terrific ice cream sundae for dessert! It was better table service than Howard Johnsons!

I have been searching for traces of Schrafft\"s Candy Co from Charlestown MA. We have about 35 members of our family that had worked there from the 1920's through 1982. I'm looking for any evidence that they worked there (other than a few obituaries!). Any holiday partypictures or anecdotes or people that would be open to checking their family history for some of my family members. We had many members of the family who used to travel to NYC to see a show and of course, eat at Schrafft's. Seeing some of the old pictures was great. Dean D

I earned my way through both college and law school working at Schrafft's. Indeed I met my wonderful wife in Schrafft's at 2519 Broadway, at the southwest corner of West 94th Street, now the site of a greeting card and gift shop called Urban Cottage. I worked in very many of their restaurants at the soda fountain. Their food was always well prepared and their own brands, especially their ice cream, were superb.

The Fifth Ave. and 13th Street building mentioned in some comments may have been one of the last holdouts. I remember it was still functioning in the early 70s. (When I noticed the building again in the 80s, it was a Tex-Mex bar and nightclub called Lone Star.) The Schrafft's location I knew best, on the north side of 51st St between Sixth Ave and Rockefeller Plaza, has passed through many coffee-shop incarnations, but still has the same shape and approximate layout it had in the 1960s.

I was able to backtrack to the orgins of the restaurant but that is it.

No one has mentioned one of the biggest Schrafft's of all-the one in Scarsdale/Eastchester in Westchester County. I worked there through high school (First I was a relish/bun girl who offered you carrots, celery, and black and green olives from my big brass bowl of crushed ice, accompanied with cottage cheese or corn relish or piccalily or mustard pickles when you sat down. I also offered you warm walnut or corn muffins (the types changed daily) as soon as your entree was served. When I was 18, I became a waitress till I graduated college. Our uniforms were gold with white collars and cuffs and then later black with white. The food was prepared with care and cleanliness was utmost; service was an art, and the customer was ALWAYS right. We'd get you anything you wanted. I have looked all over for recipes for Schrafft's Chocolate Souffle or rissole potatoes; anyone out there know how Molly, the cook, made the potatoes? I have fond memories of the entire experience. (I also went to HS with the Shattucks, but they did not work there.)

The Schrafft's on 13th and Fifth became a Brew Burger in the early 70's, prior to it's incarnation as the Lone Star, in the mid-70's. My Schrafft's was located on the NE corner of 57th and 3rd Avenue. The building is still there. The restaurant was the entire ground floor. Remember the green tea-pots with (2) cups of tea in them? And the Manhattans at the bar. Schrafft's was one of the few places a single woman could enjoy a cocktail in the city back then.

Thanks for an enjoyable read! I am an amateur genealogist and have discovered that George Schrafft's wife Elizabeth Lambert (who later married singer Gordon MacRae) is a distant relative. Nosher, I would appreciate it if you would connect me with any of the other post-ers here (such as Lynn, Frank Shattuck's great grand-daughter) who might have any personal information about George and Elizabeth.

I was hoping that you might be able to shed some light regarding Schrafft's. My Grandmother was the very first Schrafft's Ice Cream Pagent Queen...somewhere between 1920 and 1928 the first pagent was held (I believe it was held for only the empolyees)... My Grandmother has since passed away and were trying to create a Family Biograpghy. We have photos of her as the Queen but unfortunately with her passing, the memory and the story was lost with it. If you could somehow lead me in the right direction of were I can find information on this I would greatly appreciate it.

My mother worked for Schrafft's for over 40 years. When I was young she was the lunch manager of the store on Maiden Lane, opposite the US Treasury building in lower Manhattan. That is now 1 Federal Plaza, I believe - anyway, the older buildings are complettely gone. Late she was at 58th and Madison, then ended her career in the main offices on 34th St. I don't know about the corporate takeover history, but eventually she received pension checks from Pet, Inc. Alan Alda used to come into one store where she worked - I belive his aunt worked there. I remember many nights waiting downstairs in Maiden Lane for her to finish her work so my father could drive her home to Queens - that was a great store with a wonderful soda fountain and a candy counter and a baked goods display on the way to the back and the stairs to her desk.

what about the Schrafft building in Boston? was it part of the restaraunt chain? the sign is still there. I'am a Schrafft from Boston & wonder how the name came to be schrafft from shattucks? Does the book explain the history of the restaraunts and the name?

Does anybody remember Schrafft's hotels? I was raised in Niagara Falls, New York and remember that the closest hotel to the bridge to Canada was Schrafft's. It still operates as a Days Inn. It was built in the late-50s, early-60s. I've seen no mention of a hotel as part of Schrafft's so I thought I'd mention it.

The nearest store to 189th Street was on East Fordham Road in the Bronx. Less than a block from the intersection of East 188th Street and East Fordham Road. I worked there for a while on the soda fountain while attending law school in the late 1950's. My mother worked at the Maiden Lane store mentioned by Michael Moran. There was a Schrafft's hotel in the Rochester, NY area. It was actually in the Town of Greece, on Ridge Road. After Schrafft's closed it, it became a Holiday Inn. It was totally destroyed by a fire around 1970. Schrafft's also operated a hotel in Durham, NC.

Eating Fruit Is Not a Crime (But Selling It Might Be)

 Mangosteens make such a lightning-quick appearance on the New York produce scene that they're very easy to miss- partly because they aren't grown in the quantities that oranges, apples, or even lychees are, and partly because they're illegal to import fresh into the US. When you do spot them, you'll usually find them in Asian markets, often in an unlabeled container or cleverly disguised among the eggplants, which they resemble if you squint your eyes. This weekend, we found several produce vendors hawking fresh mangosteens in Chinatown. One kept them in a large white bucket next to his chair- a bucket he covered up in a flash when he saw me eyeing them, while the others were more brazen about their trade. And in fairness, some of them may actually be selling legal mangosteens: pre-frozen fruits or fresh ones from Hawaii or Puerto Rico. But really, we doubt it. Frozen mangosteens give themselves away immediately because their internal flesh turns mushy and translucent, almost clear, when it is thawed. None of the five fruits we purchased on Baxter Street appeared to have been frozen. Then there's the domestic mangosteen that avoids the ban because it is treated for pest infestations more thoroughly than its Asian cousins- in theory, we'd find these in every local supermarket, but in practice, the mangosteens grown domestically get shipped off to a more lucrative market: Japan. So unless our Chinatown produce vendor managed to get his hands on a case or two of these prime fruits, we' re guilty of buying contraband fruit. Yet despite my concerns about exotic bug infestations, I'm having a hard time feeling bad about it, because the fruit is absolutely luscious. Inside the tough purple skin (pericarp) sit several brilliantly white wedges of edible fruit that taste a bit like a tangy peach, but with the texture of a ripe cherry. There are aromatic high-note flavors and scents at play here, as well, odors that call to mind passion fruits and blackberries. The pericarp is also edible and rich in micronutrients, but it tastes intensely tannic and unpleasant, so juice manufacturers often purée the entire fruit (skin and all) together and add sweeteners to make it palatable. If you've only tasted purple mangosteen juice, you've never really tasted the best part of the fruit. Clearly, we would never urge you to become a fruit outlaw, so in order to help you avoid any produce-related legal trouble in the future, you should probably studiously avoid the open-air vegetable markets on Baxter Street, Mulberry Street, and at the corner of Grand & Chrystie Streets, where a pound of fresh mangosteens costs about $9 (4-6 fruits). Consider this a warning, not a recommendation. No way. Stay far, far away, especially if you want to avoid getting caught with some of the summer's most delicious and elusive fruit.

The mangosteens that you are referring to might be simply frozen and thawed, as are all of the mangosteens that I have ever seen for sale in New York. The vendors generally won't tell you the truth. I asked the woman selling them on the east side of Mulberry last week if they were fresh, and she answered yes, but it was easy to look at the fruit to tell that she was lying -- that is if you know what the fresh fruit looks like. The frozen fruits are easy enough to discern, as although they are mangosteen shaped, they barely look like mangosteens anymore, with a pale leathery look, and a dried out and faded calyx. Although I am sometimes tempted to buy them now and again, tasting them removes all doubt that they are not fresh. The vendors play the same tricks with durian, which are also sold frozen and thawed as \"fresh,\" and with which you can't even get a general sense of what that fruit really tastes like. Don't accept this state of affairs. Write your federal reprsentatives and demand your right to eat wholesome food, and fight to end these absurd bans, which prevent those in the United States from enjoying many of the worlds delicacies.

Makanmata, Yes, some of them might well have been frozen- we've bought mangosteens that have been very grainy and translucent inside, and we've been disappointed. However, a dried calyx isn't necessarily the indicator of a fresh fruit, as the calyx remains green only briefly after picking, and even day-old, unfrozen mangosteens often have browning leaves and stems. I think it's a crapshoot with the New York vendors- some of the fruits on the street are fresh, indistinguishable from the manifestly fresh mangosteens we've eaten abroad and across the border in Canada. You also bring up one other very important point: with fruit that might be genuinely forbidden, caveat emptor applies more than ever. Thanks for the very useful comment!

wow...i haven't had a mangosteen in years! Just looking at that delicious photo of the cut open one makes my mouth water so much, thinking about the tangy juicy sweetness and soft smooth slippery texture. I love that they form little round slices and you can pop them in your mouth easily. I aim to become a fruit outlaw as soon as possible! Thanks for the tip!

The only time I get to eat yummy mangosteens are when I'm in Bangkok. The few times I've seen them for sale in Chinatown, they've been of the defrosted variety and I'm not too keen on those. Hey since we're talking of tropical/SE Asian fruits, how about a post on durian? Frozen durian ice cream. Yum.

From the comments section of Gothamist (by Smitty) When people buy 'em, it gives incentive for more to be illegally brought into the US, and consequently more of a risk of an asian fruit fly devestation. good job.

(I also posted this on Gothamist.) Just took a bike ride through Chinatown looking for this fruit. I hit up about 10 produce spots. I was met with either: 1) \"speak-no-English\" shrugs; 2) feigned ignorance; or 3) indignant denials that they would ever carry the fruit (although they may have suspected me as some fruit-focused law officer). However, one guy was pretty forthcoming. He said they're tough to find and that he gets them on occasion but never displays them -- you have to ask. He said that he didn't know of anyone having them right now, but that I should check back. He said that they are almost exclusively purchased by Thai... logical since it's from Thailand. He also testified to their delicious-ness. Despite Smitty's excellent and agreed-upon point, I doubt we'll be able to put a stop to their smuggling... since I suspect the NYC Thai community 1) reads this site or 2) gives a shit.

NuYawka, I'm not even a little bit surprised at what happened to you in Chinatown- just like the fruit seller who kept covering his bucket of mangosteens, other vendors are probably also likely to keep the fruit out of eyesight of anyone who they suspect might know it's illegal to sell.

I was down in Chinatown and asked around. I didn't see/get any Mangosteens, but they are selling Dragon Fruit. It wasn't cheap: about $3 to $6 a pound. That works out to one decent sized fruit. The best specimens I saw were available in front of the Hong Kong Supermarket on Pike and East Broadway. I'm pretty certain they were frozen on ther way over, though. A few specimens felt unnaturally cold. Thhey tasted ok, though.

Back home in Malaysia and around South East Asia, this fruit is grown abundantly everywhere; even my own backyard. We have a tree in our garden and it's called \"manggis\" in Malay. They're extremely sweet (depending on the variety & species) and usually bears fruits once every 6 months i.e. June & December, in my garden that is! Be careful of the skin though. The reddish black colour is a dye-like substance when comes in contact with water or the fruit's juices. It turns dark brown when it dries up.

I just returned to canada from a month in indonesia where i picked \"manggis\" off trees or we bought a dozen for 50 cents. I am going through withdrawl right now, and haven't found them yet in chinese markets. i am going to keep trying! i never acquired a taste for durian, unfortunately, as it seems to be everywhere!

Everytime I go there, I'm on the look out for any exotic fruits to try out, and am dissapointed with all the everyday fruits! Would love to find Lanzones a.k.a. Lanson, Langsat, or Dokong! BTW, I just found this blog and I already love it!

Upstairs, Downstairs: A Midtown Double-Whammy

 Altitude is one of Manhattan's greatest gifts. Even as it is possible to wander the streets of the city and be dumbstruck by its wholly unnatural beauty, the pedestrian view is just part of a much more complex picture- one that reveals itself only when you break away from the compass rose and begin to move up... or down. HungryMan and I did a little of both recently, kicking off a weeknight excursion with a visit to the newly re-opened Ava Lounge on the rooftop of the Dream Hotel, and then, inspired by the theme of elevation, set off in search of underground nosh in Midtown. Ava Lounge, named for Hollywood legend Ava Gardner, reinvents itself every year or so. This summer, the theme takes its cues from the beach: driftwood trees, lattice teak furniture, and lots of pillows dot the landscape, so much so that we half expected to see a sand dune somewhere. The overall effect is a placid one, and with the breezes that a bit of elevation brings, the space genuinely does feel like a little island. We did not get to taste the signature drinks (Peach Iced Tea and The Platinum Margarita), as the servers were swamped- we were attending a very crowded press event- but we did get a chance to down a mojito and a gin-and-tonic, both of which were excellent. As HungryMan and I sat in the cozy rooftop annex (which apparently also serves as VIP seating when situations demand it), we admired the gorgeous view and started thinking (of course) about dinner. Our first thought was to find a rooftop restaurant somewhere nearby, but when we realized that we'd have to work pretty hard to beat the current vista, we decided instead to return to street level, and then to descend a little further still. Underground restaurants aren't impossible to locate in Midtown, but they're also not trivial to find. We wandered for a short while until I was struck by a Eureka! moment when I recalled that Donburi-ya's dining room sits just a few steps down from the level of the sidewalk outside- it wasn't a spelunking trip, but it was subterranean... technically. We both entered the restaurant, ready to declare it too shallow to count, but once inside, I was distracted by the sight of a crustacean. I noticed immediately that several tables had ordered a crab dish that I had never seen there before. Investigating further, I found it listed as one of the evening's special starters: Blue Crab with Rice Noodles ($6.50). Yes, that's not a misprint: it was $6.50 for some of the freshest crab I've eaten in years. Two steamed blue crabs sat, half-disassembled, atop a palm-sized mound of sweet and salty cellophane noodles about the thickness of linguini. This dish was so wonderful in part because it was seasoned and sauced with a very light touch- just enough to give the noodles a flavor of their own, but not enough to mask the richness of the crabmeat. Honestly, this has to be the best $6.50 we've spent this month. HungryMan's Ishiyaki Sauce Udon ($9.50) wasn't such a bad deal, either. Ishiyaki, which means 'cooked with hot stones,' is a description of the cooking method used to heat the noodles, vegetables, and sliced pork in this dish. The hot stone in this case is the heavy, ultra-hot bowl in which it is served. Just as with Korean Bi Bim Bap, the Ishiyaki Udon forms a crunchy skin along the contour of the inside of the bowl. Some people, HungryMan among them, love to pick at the crispy bits and nibble noisily as the meal is winding down. This was a very hearty entrée, so be forewarned- you'll need a decent appetite to finish it all. My own main dish, the Ten Don ($10) was a traditional shrimp tempura, served on a bowl of sticky rice. The accompanying miso soup was unremarkable, but the shrimp were delightful: searing hot from the fryer and juicy inside, they also made a perfect second act to follow the crab I had just eaten. Donburi-ya offers a dozen varieties of donburi, none of which costs more than $15, a bevy of similarly-priced noodle dishes, and four or five ochazuke- a favorite hangover cure consisting of tea, steamed white rice, and toppings (plum, salmon, etc.). Better yet, it is possible to visit and not hear any English spoken in the dining room whatsoever, as the clientele is as Japanese as the menu. If you watch, you may also witness one of your fellow diners leaving just a bit tipsier than when he or she arrived, only to be warned in friendly-yet-stern Japanese to 'Watch out for the steps!' on the way out of the restaurant. Hearing this, you too might start to think that after a few bottles of cold Asahi, perhaps altitude isn't a gift that every New Yorker can enjoy equally. Donburi-ya, 137 E. 47th Street (at Lexington Avenue), 212-980-7909 Ava Lounge (Dream Hotel), 210 W. 55th Street (between 7th Avenue & Broadway), 212-956-7020

Restricted & Unrestricted Eats at Risotteria
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-07-11 23:41:00
***CONTENT
 Foraging by food restriction may not be the best option for eating out in New York, but if you’re a vegetarian, keep kosher, or are allergic to gluten, let's face it: you have a thinner than average range of dining options. But a smaller universe of choices doesn't necessarily mean lesser quality. We discovered one restaurant, Risotteria, a rice and pizza joint on Bleeker Street, that serves two menus (one gluten-restricted, one unrestricted), while still managing to maintain respectable standards. Gluten, a starch protein found in wheat, takes the rap in causing symptoms of the common-but-controversial celiac disease. Whether or not you take gluten allergy seriously (we're Swiss on the subject, by the way), Risotteria does, serving up pizza made from rice flour, over 35 varieties of its namesake risotto, and even gluten-free beer and pasta on their much-touted ‘gluten-free Tuesdays.’ While we didn't visit on a Tuesday, Nosher and I did take my cousin MiniRabbi for a weekday dinner there this past week. Now, MiniRabbi is not allergic to gluten, but he does keep kosher, making meetups at restaurants nearly as difficult as it would be if we were anti-gluten. To keep things simple, he generally eats vegetarian food as well as hot dairy, which made Risotteria a practical choice for a meal celebrating his recent college graduation and newfound employment. Risotteria is not a big restaurant; it’s essentially a long narrow space with eight or nine tables lining the right-hand wall and a long bar with a few stools opposite. A party of four or more will make their presence felt immediately here, and longish waits for tables to open up are not uncommon. Service is casual, veering at times to the intimate: this is the kind of place where your server, tired from a long shift, will sometimes plop down at your table to take your order (or offer you unsolicited tips on where to find a date, as ours did on another recent visit). Whatever you order, breadsticks will appear sooner or later, towering over the small glass in which they’re served. Considering that they are made without using an ingredient as fundamental to breadmaking as wheat, these rice-based breadsticks (or should they be properly called ‘ricesticks’?) aren't bad at all. A little heavier and chewier than their gluten-laden counterparts, Rissoteria’s breadsticks still manage to be quite delicious, and are further improved by flakes of thyme and rosemary baked into the dough, not to mention their undeniable freshness- new batches are regularly brought out of the kitchen throughout the meal. Apart from a range of salads organized by leaf (baby lettuce, romaine, arugula, spinach), there are very few appetizers on the menu. A calamari and white bean salad ($8) that we’ve ordered several times before is typically quite good, but on our last visit, the usually tender calamari were overcooked and drowning in a pool of very watery tomato sauce. We like the idea of pairing calamari with roasted red peppers, soft white beans and kalamata olives; for the price however, the serving is just simply too small. Another erstwhile fave, the roasted beet and walnut salad ($6.50) was likewise a disappointment - the normally cool, sweet beets and delicate truffle oil were overpowered this time by the addition of an unhydrated dried spice that was very generously sprinkled throughout the salad. Asked on three separate occasions what exactly what this ingredient was, our waiter never came back with an answer, although we're pretty sure it was a mixture of oregano and fines herbes. Either way, it was scratchy and rough in texture and difficult to eat: it made us think that someone might have opened up a catnip toy over our appetizer. Happily, larger plates at Rissoteria are more consistent. My order of shrimp risotto ($13.50) came flecked with shreds of sweet red pepper and small waves of leafy spinach. Like all the risottos I’ve tried here, the arborio rice was stirred to a consistency halfway between soupy and creamy- a steamy, seductive stew that will stick mightily to the spoon of even the most animated of diners. And Risotteria does not skimp on shrimp, there’s enough here to share with the rest of your table-– or, if you happen to be eating with your cousin the MiniRabbi, to keep for yourself. Risotteria’s pizzas can be a little difficult to eat-– the uneven bottoms of the metal plates they arrive in have a dizzying tendency to spin out of control when fork or knife pressure is applied. But they are cooked to-order and are always served hot, which makes up for a lot. MiniRabbi was the soul of simplicity and ordered the margarita ($8.50), with a sweet tomato sauce poking out from under a thin layer of good, fresh mozzarella. This is thin crust style pizza, crispy along the roughly-formed edges and much chewier in the middle. Even chewier dough can be found in the rice flour pizzas, offered with the same toppings for about two dollars more per pie. If you're not keeping gluten-free but are avoiding dangerous nightshades, Risotteria has come up with several pizzas sans tomato. Olive purée or pesto sauce forms the base of these alternative pies, again available spread over rice or wheat dough. Nosher, while not avoiding nightshades or wheat, almost always orders one of these: the olive puree pizza ($10.50), with oven dried tomatoes, luminously white little coins of goat cheese, and heaps of fresh chopped arugula. His preference for this pizza over all others comes largely from the pleasing contrast between its sweet tomatoes and the more savory olive tapenade and goat cheese. It's tempting to see the sign outside advertising Gluten-Free Tuesdays!, roll your eyes, and forget that Risotteria's doors are open to everybody. We’re not vegetarian, vegan or macrobiotic, we don’t keep kosher, we’re not lactose intolerant, and we don’t have any food allergies as far as we know (apart from an aversion to the Olive Garden), and despite all of this, we occasionally do go back when we’re feeling peckish around this part of the Village. As we've discovered, the appetizers are hit-or-miss, but the mains at Risotteria are reliably good. But best of all, we like the idea that there is at least one place in the city where nearly everyone we know can eat- regardless of divine law or diverticulitis. Risotteria, 270 Bleecker Street (between 6th and 7th Avenues), 212-924-6664

The Orchard: It Was All Yellow

***CONTENT
 Taking a good photograph inside The Orchard, a newish Italian bistro on the Lower East Side, is nearly impossible, thanks to the ochre-tinted lighting and very pale wood in the restaurant’s dining room. We tried filters, white balancing, and even a little prayer, but in the end, every snapshot we took required a few heavy blows with the Photoshop hammer, leaving us with what you see here. Fortunately, as we discovered during dinner late last week with Pescatore and Schnicksy, getting a good meal at The Orchard is far, far easier than taking a picture of it. Both LES locals, our companions were eager to give The Orchard a try, while HungryMan and I were more intrigued by the restaurant’s BYOB policy. Very few moderately expensive restaurants in Manhattan allow diners to bring-their-own, primarily because these are the same eateries that make a good chunk of their profits on alcohol sales. But The Orchard has welcomed customers’ bottles with open corkscrew since it opened, and from all of the chow chatter we’ve seen, this no-corkage policy is one of The Orchard’s big draws. HungryMan and I brought two bottles with us: a Californian Petite Sirah (very big and fruity, as you might expect), as well as a more traditional Italian Chianti Classico (mild tannins, slightly spicy). Although we made our selections in advance, we were happy to discover enough variety in the menu that we can’t imagine choosing a bottle that wouldn’t go with at least a few of the dishes. Our meal started with the Royal Trumpet Mushroom flatbread, a cracker-thin layer of dough slathered with polenta, herbs, and mushroom purée. Although polenta might sound like a strange thing to smear on a crispbread, it worked wonders at affixing the mushrooms to the dough without adding extra grease- a very clever feat of kitchen engineering. The appetizer also remained light, as only a tiny amount of polenta was used. It's easy to skip past the flatbreads listed at the beginning of the menu, but don't: this was my favorite item of the evening. Schnicksy's Yellowfin Tuna Tartare appetizer consisted of a half-dozen poker-chip sized fried plaintains arranged next to three large dollops each of minced, raw tuna; fresh guacamole; and creme fraiche. While it's easy enough to spoon out portions of each of the toppings onto one of the crispy plaintains, the yellowfin is good enough to eat on its own with a spoon. We also cleaned up all of the leftover creme fraiche and guacamole with the excellent, thick-sliced bread we were served. Both Pescatore and HungryMan ordered the Rock Shrimp Salad, which arrived as a huge pile of mixed salad greens, tangerines, and deep-fried rock shrimp. This isn't the healthiest salad in town, but it certainly was tasty- most especially the combination of the orange-honey vinaigrette and the lightly battered seafood. This is a dish that would also work well as a main, with the portions inverted. The main dishes we did order (except one) were also wonderful: Schnicksy and I chose the Olive Oil Poached Halibut with Crispy Black Bean Salad, and I have to admit that I poked at my fish several dozen times during the meal, trying to figure out exactly how it was cooked. This was easily one of the moistest filets of halibut I have eaten, and the texture combination of the soft white flesh with the gentle crunch of the black beans was marvelous. I did think the bean salad could have used a little more spicing and a bit less salt, but on the whole, both Schnicksy and I were pleased. Pescatore lived up to his name by ordering the Langoustine Risotto with Braised Octopus. I have long considered risotto (along with caesar salads and puttanesca sauce) to be a litmus-test dish: if a restaurant makes a good one, it's a very positive sign. If not, be wary. Judging from the quality of the starters, I suspected The Orchard would probably make a fine risotto, but I never expected the risotto to be as creamy and precisely al dente as it was. Nor did I anticipate the subtle and rich combination of seafood and seasoning- especially the flecks of roasted peppers that set off the hints of sweetness in the octopus. HungryMan's Veal Paillard with Faro and Arugula Salad was the only mild disappointment of the evening. The whole grain salad, while very healthful, was a little too chewy. Moreover, the veal paillard tasted just fine, but was too greasy and did not seem to have been prepared with as much care as the other main dishes. Overall, the entrée was still decent, and fixing these small problems should be a trivial matter for the kitchen. It might be counterintuitive, but we really think The Orchard's best chance for long-term success lies, in large part, with its inability to serve alcohol (or to retain a no-corkage policy). Here's why: there are dozens of other well-above average, $20-30/entrée Modern European restaurants throughout Manhattan, the kinds of restaurants that open to great buzz and then slowly progress through a creeping decline in business and customer interest. It's the life-cycle everyone expects, and unless the restaurant distinguishes itself pretty strikingly, it usually means that after a year or two of good business, the plywood goes up over the windows. Nothing to be ashamed of, but it happens. Without intending to do so, The Orchard has already done the tricky job of making itself unique in its price category by allowing patrons to bring their own wine, something virtually every single party we saw on our visit did- I haven't seen as much wine consumed in one dining room since our last visit to London. If The Orchard can work out the business calculus to make its food sales profitable without including alcohol in the equation, we suspect it is likely to guarantee itself brisk business for as long as it remains open. I, for one, would love to see that happen. The Orchard, 162 Orchard Street (at Rivington Street), 212-353-3570

Like a Picnic Every Day: Burgers & Cupcakes

 Mitchel London may be a catering legend in New York, but you never would have guessed as much, judging by his former storefront on 9th Avenue, just west of Penn Station. The old interior looked more like a neglected bodega than a cafe, and consequently, business at London’s retail outlet never seemed to be very good. Then, just a few weeks ago, the shop reopened itself as Burgers & Cupcakes, with attractive and appealing seating, not to mention a counter display showcasing stacks and stacks of seductive-looking cupcakes. Now finally the storefront suggests that good things might be found inside. HungryMan and I found a few of them on our visit to the restaurant this past weekend. Although the restaurant waitstaff were a bit rushed (one server told us to sit anywhere we liked, and then came up to our table just a minute or two later to ask if we needed our check), we received good, informed answers to our questions about the food, and were even warned in advance that the toilet flush was broken… just in case we needed it. I ordered the salmon burger with extra avocado, while HungryMan chose the cheeseburger with Swiss cheese and mushrooms. Both arrived to the table extremely hot (a good sign), as well as perhaps a little too greasy, but after all, we were eating burgers, and into every hamburger-eater’s life, a little grease must fall. We agreed that both burgers were moist and cooked competently. The salmon burger gave more of a chance to show off clever flavoring: in this case, lots of fresh dill fronds throughout the patty. Also, there were no capers in the salmon, which I expected, but was happy to see omitted here, as they would have swamped out the other flavors in this remarkably subtle burger. Avocado seems to be, as our sever recommended, the best add-on for this burger, as it is soft, unctuous, and just a little bit sweet—you won’t need ketchup if you stick to the tomato slice and a few chunks of avocado. HungryMan’s burger also needed no extra seasoning, and after a few bites, he was covered in juice—always a good sign when you've ordered your burger rare. The buns, which tasted like standard-issue backyard barbecue rolls, helped a bit, but neither of us was won over by them. We also shared an order of the french fries, which were less greasy than we had anticipated (based on reports from other writers) and generously salted. I was also delighted to see that Burgers & Cupcakes leaves the skin on the fries, which means that they do retain at least a little nutritive value. For dessert, we chose two cupcakes, one chocolate devil’s food with chocolate frosting, and one vanilla with a Matterhorn of buttercreme frosting. The chocolate was by far the better of the two, as it was moist inside and not overloaded with grainy icing. And while the vanilla cupcake itself was decent, it was a little too crumbly and laden with more icing than I’ve seen on a dessert since I tried frosting my own birthday cake at age seven. The buttercreme is tasty enough, but I can’t even picture eating a third of what was on the cupcake. If you’re anxious to avoid too much gloppy stuff on your desserts, stick with the chocolate and coconut varieties, both iced in moderation. Regardless of these few quibbles, both HungryMan and I enjoyed our meal at Burgers & Cupcakes and are very happy to see Mitchel London’s new business off to such a promising start. This neighborhood, stuck as it is in the nether region between Hell’s Kitchen and Chelsea, needs a few more solid lunchtime options, and it’s great to see a longtime local make good on his retail shop’s potential. Burgers & Cupcakes, 458 Ninth Avenue (at 35th Street), 212-643-1200

 Walking into Union Square Wines & Spirits this weekend, I think I got a sense of what visitors to the 1964 New York World's Fair must have felt when they saw General Motors' sci-fi-esque Futurama exhibit. Yes, I have seen the future, and it squirts wine. Enomatic's wine serving system is, essentially, a tasting robot that holds bottles of wine and, through the magic of pressurized Nitrogen gas, dispenses it in perfect little aliquots, just the right volume for sampling. Union Square Wines has installed three of these machines, one with refrigeration to keep white and rosé wines chilled, and two ambient-temperature machines for red wine dispensing. Better still, you can access the machines for free, after you register (with proof of age, of course) at the shop's information desk. Registration earns you a microchipped card with a balance of at least 500 tasting credits- although HungryMan and I both were given 1000 credits when we went. Each bottle sits underneath a simple LED display that shows its price in dollars, and when you insert your card into the machine and push the button corresponding to a particular bottle you'd like to sample, your balance drops by 1 tasting credit per dollar of the cost of the wine: i.e. a $25 bottle will draw down your balance by 25 points, etc. . Purchases also earn you back credits equivalent to the number of dollars you spend in the store, and each month, your balance returns to 500, whether or not you've purchased anything. We tasted about eight wines (two whites and six reds), at a total cost of about 75 credits apiece- so you can imagine how much more tasting we'd have to do in order to use up 1000 credits in a month. What we both liked best about this high-tech tasting system is that it gives customers a huge array of tasting options- when is the last time you visited a wine shop that had 36 bottles open at once for you to taste? Even when the store got a bit crowded, we never had to wait more than 30 seconds or so to sample a wine. Nor was the shop ever short of tasting glasses. I imagine that they'll wash a lot of dishes in the months to come, but given the number of people we observed walking away with a bottle or two of the stuff they've been tasting (us included, I should add), I suspect the costs of the system will be covered in a matter of months. Now if we could just get one for the apartment, I'd be overjoyed.

Update: reader 'Luther' informs us that the free tasting credits are not offered any longer: \"I just checked out USQ in their new location this weekend. I asked about getting some tasting credits and the guy told me that I would have to first make a purchase, and would then receive a number of tasting points equal to the number of dollars in the price of my purchase. No free credits whatsoever - that promotion apparently ended \"a long time ago.\" Too bad, really; I'm sure I would've made a purchase if I could've tasted a few wines.\"

this reminds me of a wierd incident i had with the staff at USQ.... I had accumulated a few tasting points by BUYING WINE in the shop, and couldn't quite figure out how to use the machines to taste wines in order to BUY MORE WINES..... when i asked the clerk to assist me, he took on this attitude not very different from the \"its veeery expensive\" attitude that the julia roberts character in \"pretty woman\" experienced when she was trying to spend money in the snobby boutique on rodeo drive..... the guy starts speaking to me as if i'm trying to get drunk on free wine...saying something with a very condescending attitude like \"these are for tasting, NOT for DRINKING....\" so okay, maybe i was dressed casually, it was my day off, maybe i had a 5 oclock shadow....but it was 11am, i hadn't been drinking, and i'm very obviously not a bum from the street trying to steal free sips of wine, and this is the way the guy was talking to me. over the years i have probably spent more than $10,000 at USQ, but after this incident i have not spent a dime. i am actually a wine-world professional who used to enjoy the street-level in-and-out, well-informed, non-presumptuous, un-snobby atmosphere of the old USQ. to me, the new shop represents a \"new\" New York that is based on the expectations of out-of-towners who have watched too much Sex and the City

Dairy for the Daring: Hand Cheese
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Hand cheese is a food that inspires extreme opinions: people seem either to adore it (me) or detest it (HungryMan), and I can't imagine anyone being indifferent to the stuff. That's because it is quite simply very difficult to ignore- this is no wallflower of a cheese. While it looks innocent and unassuming, it possesses a very strong odor, not too different from that of a mature Italian tallegio, and it is this scent that has doomed it to sit on the supermarket shelf next to limburger, the ultimate pariah of cheeses. And that's a shame, because hand cheese has some wonderful qualities. First of all, the stuff is practically fat free, coming in at a whopping 1% maximum fat by weight. One percent! Most pungent cheeses easily come in at 30 or 40+% fat, by comparison. But of course, if we learned nothing else from the lipid-phobic 1990's, it should be that a low-fat food isn't necessarily tasty. But hand cheese does not lack for flavor: while it smells powerfully of a tallegio, it tastes similar to a briny, sharp Emmenthal. Its texture is also similar to a Swiss cheese or Appenzeller: firm but not hard. Because it is so assertive, it makes a great pairing for a very bold wine, such as a Mourvedre-based Bandol or even a tannic Cabernet Sauvignon. Don't worry, nothing you put in its path will overwhelm this cheese. Hand cheese gets its name not from the fact that you don't want to end up with the stuff on your digits (which incidentally, you don't), but instead from the way the cheese is shaped- by hand. HungryMan still maintains that it was named after the wrong appendage, though. The small packet we purchased at Zabar's for $3.99 looked like an oversized tan Tootsie Roll, divided as it was into four compressed disks that had been pushed together. You may also see a Portugese version of the stuff-called Saloio-for sale in specialty shops in New York City. If you do, it's pretty much the same product, just made a few hundred miles west of hand cheese's more famous hometown of Birkenstock, Germany. The Germans most often serve hand cheese with a mess of raw onions, cumin, caraway seeds, and a sprinkle of vinegar on top. They also tout its 'musical' properties when served this way, although my strong suspicion is that the more, ahem, 'productive' characteristics of such a dish come more from the raw onions and cumin than from the cheese. I prefer a slice of the cheese on a thick slice of bread- challah works well- that is slathered with good red currant or raspberry jam. However, I recognize that this preparation requires a high tolerance for stinky cheese- something that not everyone shares. Inspired by a desire to make hand cheese more accessible and user-friendly, I concocted a pasta sauce that tempers the cheese's odor considerably. The sauce can also be used as a spread for rice or vegetables, or even on a slice of dark, toasted bread. But be forewarned that this is still not a cheese (nor a sauce) for the faint of heart; yet if you've got a vigorous red wine at the ready and a willingness to try something new, you might just discover a new (albeit odiferous) passion. Pasta Sauce of Fortitude 1 medium yellow onion, cut into half-moons or rings 4 oz. mushrooms (crimini, shiitake, or morel), chopped into large chunks 2 large sage leaves, chiffonaded or chopped 1 tsp. fresh chopped rosemary 1 clove garlic, chopped finely 1 200 g. package hand cheese or saloio, cut into 1/2 inch cubes salt and pepper for seasoning olive oil for sautéeing Add onions to about 2 Tbsp. of olive oil in a sautée pan. Salt onions very sparingly. Add sage to the pan. Cook on medium heat until the rings are very soft and just beginning to caramelize. This may take 10 or 15 minutes. Add the chopped garlic and cook for about 1 minute. Add rosemary and chopped mushrooms, and cook until mushrooms have just begun to reduce in volume (about 2 minutes). Add hand cheese and continute to heat on medium-low heat until all the cheese has melted and the mixture is loose and pours easily. Serve over cooked pasta and use immediately. Serves 4. 2006 nycnosh.com

Quartino's Healthy Italian Accent
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Lunch at Quartino, a casual Ligurian restaurant, offers a perfect mid-day escape for downtown diners, providing respite from the crowds pushing to and from the nearby Seaport, as well as a culinary diversion from the same-ness of the dozens of chain eateries of Pier 17 and the underwhelming steam table joints that line the canyons of Wall Street. Quartino also has the distinction of being one of the few restaurants in the city that focuses its efforts on organic foods, a reflection of the health-conscious preoccupations of its original physician/owners. My recent lunch at Quartino with TVGal and Britsky bore witness to this focus on healthy eating and high quality ingredients. As evidence of this, portions at Quartino are modestly-sized, almost a third to a half less food than what you are likely to get at most Italian restaurants elsewhere. Even the wine is available in controlled portions, including the restaurant's eponymous quarter-bottle, the quartino. We decided to pass on the wine (at this stage) and went right for the food, which smelled fantastic. TVGal and Britsky both ordered the same dish, the Taglierini Del Quartino ($12), which was a creamy mix of avocados and tomatoes over al dente wholewheat pasta. Taglierini, also known as tagliolini, resembles a thinner, rounder fettuccini, and while the pasta was delicious on its own, it was much too delicate to support the heavy, at times gloopy, avocado and tomato admixture. The homemade wholeweat pasta, with its sweet, malty taste can also be a challenge if you’re not expecting it. I ordered the more basic Fettuccini Mozzarella e Pomodoro ($12), a much more successful dish of wide-ribboned wholewheat pasta, rough-torn basil, split cherry tomatoes and gorgeously soft chunks of fresh, homemade mozzarella. Other than coming dressed with a bit too much olive oil for my taste, the pasta was clearly the best of the two we ordered. I was even willing to forgive the overzealous drizzling because dishes like this one are intended to showcase Quartino's homemade olive oils. Despite service that was at times painfully slow on a not-particularly-busy afternoon, we decided to throw caution to the wind and order dessert. My lemon ice was billed as a sorbet but came resembling nothing so much as a granita fashioned into scoops. With very intense citrus flavors and a playful balance of sour and sweet, this was the perfect dessert for such a hot day. TVGal’s might not have been as seasonally appropriate, but it certainly was good; her chocolate cake was served warm, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and paired with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. Britsky’s almond cantucci (biscotti's indistinguishable relative) were crispy on the outside and just slightly chewy in the center, but they became positively sinful when dunked in the tall glass of honey-sweet Vin Santo that cast a golden glow over the plate. Quartino has a sister restaurant on Bleecker in NoLiTa - Quartino Bottega Organica – that is sleeker and with an even stronger emphasis on organic ingredients. All three of us agreed that we'd come back, and we also concurred that we ought to have ordered one of the luscious-looking deep dish pizzas we kept seeing whiz past us. But the one thing we can't figure out is how Quartino manages to transmute dessert wines, pasta, and pizza into healthy foods. We'll just have to take it on faith and wash the doubts away with another glass of that Vin Santo. Quartino, 21 Peck Slip, at Water Street (212) 349-4433.

Jordan Lobster: Maine on the LIRR

***CONTENT
 Island Park, NY isn't technically in New York City, we admit. However, it is only 48 minutes by train from Penn Station ($6.75 each way, off-peak) on the Long Beach line- a shorter ride than many subway trips entirely within Gotham's borders. We also know that if you're anything like we are, you're willing to travel for quality nosh, something we found plenty of at Jordan Lobster Farms. Jordan's (which suffers from labile apostrophe syndrome), is home to a huge wholesale seafood business that supplies many local restaurants with their crustaceans, as well as a very sizeable retail shop. About 10 years ago, the Jordan family decided to open their own restaurant on the premises, taking cues from similar establishments that dot the New England coastline from Connecticut to the tip of Maine- the focus here is, entirely unapologetically, on serving ultra-high quality food. Not décor, service, or cocktails. This, like almost every Northeastern lobster restaurant, is not a place to visit if you care more about who designed the dining room than what's on your plate. But if you really, really love fresh shellfish, this is exactly where you want to be. We didn't know any of this when we arrived in Island Park. Following a tip from a Chowhounder, we took the LIRR with the intention of purchasing several lobster culls (one-clawed lobsters) to use in a lobster roll recipe we've been working on recently. Restaurants most often use culls in their lobster rolls (and all lobster salad dishes) because they're cheaper than regular lobsters and still contain lots of tail meat. Jordan's, we were told, sold culls- and probably was where our favorite restaurants got theirs, too. So of course we had to go. And indeed, they do sell culls for about 20% less than the price of their regular lobster counterparts: one-claws go for $7.99/lb., while double-clawed lobsters go for $10-11/lb., depending on their weight. HungryMan and I stood and watched the staff sort lobsters into multi-tiered tubs and debated how many we wanted to purchase, finally deciding that we'd be much better off discussing things over dinner. To eat at Jordan's Lobster Bar, you must wait in line. Everyone waits in the line- there is no table service, although there is an outdoor dining area that wraps around the front of the building. Even when there are dozens of people queueing up to order food, as there are during peak dinner and lunchtime hours, the counter staff at Jordan's is very efficient. We waited no more than 5 minutes at 7:30 p.m. on a Saturday- one of the busiest periods. Waiting for your food to be prepared can take a bit longer, but it's still a short wait- and you always have the option of sitting down and waiting for the staff to announce your number over the loudspeaker system. HungryMan and I thought about taking advantage of an excellent-value special on the menu: three 1-lb. lobsters, plus side dishes (corn-on-the-cob, cole slaw, and drawn butter) for two people ($39.95), but we wanted to sample other dishes, so we decided on a 2-lb. lobster (again, with side dishes, $29.95) instead. What we got was a foil-wrapped crustacean, still steaming from being cooked in a large mesh bag with a few dozen of its siblings, tail meat split, claws cracked, and ready to eat. It was superb: extraordinarily fresh, not at all waterlogged (as some steamed lobsters can be), and gorgeously fleshy. For a minute, as I sat dipping claw meat into the little cup of butter, I thought I was in Ogunquit. Once the lobster was gone- and it didn't really take long- we tucked into an order of the fried clams ($9.95, one of the evening's specials). This was easily one of the best bargains we've found in a long time, as the dish consisted not of stringy clam strips, but of a softball-sized mound of whole belly Long Island clams, breaded in a light cornmeal batter. A Manhattan restaurant (now defunct) we visited in 2004 charged $27.00 for a much smaller plate of similar clams, and honestly, Jordan's were a few thousand times better. HungryMan and I picked at the side dishes towards the end of the meal, nibbling on the french fries, corn, cole slaw, and some gazpacho we'd ordered in a moment of eyes-larger-than-stomach eagerness. All of them were quite good and worth finishing, although by this point, neither of us wanted much more food, regardless of how good it was. Don't think for a minute that we weren't tempted by the homemade Key Lime Pie for sale ($3.25/slice or $13/pie), but we had reached our limit. Instead, we preferred to sit and look out over South Oyster Bay, drinking Blue Point Toasted Lagers ($4.50) and watching the seagulls in the distance, savoring our last half-hour before we had to hop the hourly train back to Manhattan. Just like that, we completely forgot about purchasing the lobster culls we had come to Jordan's to buy. But then again, we now have a perfect excuse to come back again soon, something we absolutely will do. Ayuh. Jordan Lobster Farms/ Jordan's Lobster Bar, 1 Pettit Place, Island Park, NY, 516-889-3314

El Taco Mas Especial: Tehuitzingo
***AUTHOR

2006-06-19 11:18:00
***CONTENT
 Are these the best tacos in New York, or maybe just Manhattan? With such a large and diverse Mexican population, the city has no shortage of authentic and fantastic taquerias, many of them in Jackson Heights, Queens and Sunset Park, Brooklyn- some of these are so good that friends of ours rave about them as being the 'best tacos in the entire universe,' and when people unleash such superlatives, it's best to nod your head and smile. Regardless of how good those taquerias might be, they don't do you much good when you’re in Manhattan and craving the comfort of two cool corn tortillas wrapped around something warm and spicy. So if you find yourself in such a position, I'd like to suggest that you could do far worse than a trip to Tehuitzingo, on 10th Avenue in Hell’s Kitchen. I'm not going to levy the 'best in the galaxy' artillery here, but both Nosher and I believe pretty firmly that Tehuitzingo might just be the best on our tiny island- and that's no small feat. Tehuitzingo is named after a small village in central Mexico where we suspect the owners of the shop hail from, although we could not confirm this because all our conversations seemed to revolve entirely around the televised World Cup match with Angola. Our friend Chilena, recruited to help us because of her native Spanish-speaking skills, was no help either- she was as mesmerized by the football match as the proprietors were. No matter, as long as the food didn't suffer- and it didn't. Tehuitzingo specalizes in homey, meaty tacos, offering more than a dozen varieties of carnivorous options, as well as two vegetarian choices (i.e. already more than most Mexican taquerias offer). We ordered the pork (carnitas), goat meat (barbacoa), and potato with jalepeno (papas con rajas, lined up from left to right in the first picture). The pork taco came with a hefty quantity of sauteed onions and tasted just a little like what I imagine a delicious Mexican take on the cheesesteak might. The goat taco had an appropriately gamey goat flavor, with tender, steaming strips of meat that had a tendency to slip out from the far end of the taco- take precautions messy eaters! The potato/jalapeno taco was likewise excellent, with potatoes reminiscent of hash browns that you might find in a roadside diner, but with much less caramelization- and that's a good thing here, as it allowed the vegetal tastes and the heat from the jalepenos a chance to peek through. On the other hand, like everything we ate from Tehuitzingo’s menu, it was spiced with a cautious hand. While we certainly admire any Mexican restaurant that doesn't try to cover up culinary sins with excess peppery fire, just a touch more chile would have been perfect. We haven’t tried it, but we’re pretty sure that Tehuitzingo will up the spicy heat for you if you ask: “Mas piquante, por favor” should do the trick. We also sampled some of Tehuitzingo's more unusual tacos (top and then left to right in the second picture). The beef (bisteck) tacos we found good, if fairly standard and not quite as satisfying as the other options, especially with the absence of any serious heat. The spicy pork on the other hand (enchilada), was more spicy than anything else we found on the menu, and crispier too; the crunch of the meat and the soft corn tortillas were perfect counterpoints in one of the most successful tacos we have eaten in a very long time. A sausage with potato taco (chorizo con papas) had similar spice and crunch, but Nosher suspected, as did I, that the chorizo suffered more than any of the other meats from being cooked earlier and then reheated for our order. The last of our tacos was a very fine chicken (pollo) taco. Tehuitzingo has even more tacos for the very adventurous, including a beef tongue taco (lengua), beef belly (suadero), pork ear (oreja), pork tripe (tripa), and even beef head (cabeza). Yes, beef head- don't judge. All tacos are stunningly cheap at either $2 or $2.50 apiece; the more unusual meat tacos tend to cost a bit more, but they're worth the extra fifty cents. A person with a decent appetite can easily eat three tacos, four for the very hungriest eaters. Tehuitzingo also makes three varieties of quesadilla, including the unusual pumpkin flower quesadilla (flor de calabaza, pictured) and one made from 'corn mushrooms' (a.k.a. huitlacoche), this last being made of corn fungus, a delicacy in Mexico that grows naturally on the ears of corn in the field. Huitlacoche may not sound particularly appetizing- its nickname is 'corn smut' after all- but then neither does a truffle, if described as ‘Italian ground fungus nodule,’ which it inescapably is. Moreover, some huitlacoche devotees have taken to calling it ‘Mexican corn truffle,' just to further the similarities. Disappointingly, Tehuitzingo's kitchen was out of huitlacoche when we went, but we did try the roasted pumpkin flower, which Nosher raved about, describing it tangy, smoky, and a little musky. Tehuitzingo also has a number of unadvertised, off-menu daily specials which you have to ask about (they’re nowhere to be found on the bilingual menus), as well as a selection of tortas and soups that are available only on the weekend. We ordered a shrimp and tomatillo salsa verde special ($6) with rice and beans that compared favorably with similar dishes costing multiples of the price elsewhere. All three of us were fascinated by the texture of the shrimp: these were slow-cooked, quite meaty, and tender, but not in a flash-fried sense. That is to say, Tehuitzingo seems to understand a cardinal rule of preparing seafood like shrimp: you cook it for either 2-3 minutes or 30, but nowhere in between. This dish featured the longer-cooked variety, and pulled it off like a charm: the shrimp were not the slightest bit rubbery. Seating is scarce inside Tehuitzingo-there are several barstools that line the walls toward the back of the store, but if they're taken, customers are on their own in terms of seating. On the other hand, if the weather is pleasant, the newly renovated Hell’s Kitchen Park is directly opposite the store, with lots of benches and even a few chess tables that could be comandeered as picnic tables in a pinch. Best of all, because Tehuitzingo’s food operations all take place in the back of a well-stocked Mexican deli/market, there are imported drink choices galore: Penafiel, Boing!, and at least six or seven flavors of Jarritos, including Jamaica (hibiscus flower) and my new favorite, the darkly sweet Tamarindo (Tamarind). There are other goodies throughout the store, including Mexican desserts, fresh tortillas, and in fact, all the ingredients you need to make your own tacos at home. But unless you're a real expert, you're better off heading straight for the back of the shop, sliding onto a stool, and checking the soccer scores on the screen. Just remember, there's only one team it's OK to root for at Tehuitzingo, and it's not Angola. Tehuitzingo Mexican Deli, 695 10th Avenue, between 47th and 48th Streets, (212) 397-5956

A rather mundane sounding taco, but that turns out to be quite good is the chicken w/ rice (the egg w/rice is not as good however), tender chicken and the rice is nice and moist. I've had rather spicy (and I like it spicy) versions of the potato and jalapeno, but I appreciate that they have salsas and chopped jalapenos to apply on the counters. That way you can adjust to your spice level, but it would be nice to ask for it more \"piquante\", I'll try it some time. I've also seen people getting specials all the time, next time I'll try out my rusty Spanish and see what I can get.

I used to live down the street. It was my FAVORITE neighborhood ethnic deli...actually it was my favorite place to eat bar none. Now that I'm not in NYC (or on the North American continent for that matter), I am completely homesick after reading this. Ugh, there are wonderful fantastic places to eat here in my little part of asia, but they cannot make mexican food taste authentic.

The Cookie that Dare Not Speak Its Name

***CONTENT
 Sometimes, delicious foods don't have the most appetizing names: stinco, poutine, and pennywort all easily qualify in this category. But there's a new champion in this dubious competition, a Japanese cookie called \"Collon,\" whose name and shape are both cringeworthy. Not only does the branding not shy away from explicit digestive reference, but the cookies themselves leave nothing to the imagination with their tubular shape. But amazingly, these snacks are not simply just a comedy prop; they're genuinely fine cookies. Our favorite flavor (and least scatological in appearance) is the green tea (matcha) Collon, pictured here. These are very light, slightly sweet wafer cookie tubes, filled with a creamy whip that is both extraordinarily soft- think of what's inside an Oreo cookie and imagine if it were three or four times lighter- and pitch-perfectly flavored with green tea. For $2 or less ($1.99 at M2M on 3rd Avenue/11th Street and $1.59 at Yagura on 41st Street/ Madison Avenue), you'll get a small box of cookies that contains about the same amount of food as what might come out of a US vending machine- in other words, about one satisfying snack. What's inside is without any doubt worth the price and agony at having to look at the name on the box (which we toss immediately after purchasing the cookies). To get around saying the cookies' name aloud, HungryMan and I have taken to pronouncing it with a Spanish accent: referring to \"COY-on,\" to avoid any accidental potty-mouthed jokes. We also sometimes just call them Cookie Combos. You may be a little less squeamish; but regardless, don't let the unfortunate branding keep you from trying a few. Just don't talk about them while I'm eating, OK?

Crossing the Cupcake Rubicon at Magnolia Bakery

 Yes, they do make some of the best cupcakes in New York. And yes, this bakery is the epicenter of the cupcake craze. But we'd like you to think twice about what you order at Magnolia Bakery, because quite frankly, it is far too easy to get carried away when you're handed a little cardboard box and told you can only purchase six cupcakes. Focus is what's required here, as there are two desserts there that are even better than the cupcakes, desserts that demand your immediate attention. So focus! First is the Peanut Butter Heath Bar Blondie, a bar cookie that is much lighter than it appears- think of it as a cross between a peanut butter cookie and a chewy slice of peanut brittle. The cake component of the blondie is very rich, admittedly quite buttery, and perfectly salty (from the peanuts). The top layer, on the other hand, is just very slightly tacky-not like frosting, but more like caramel, and full of crunchy nut and toffee pieces. It goes beautifully with a cup of milky coffee (iced or hot). I'll take this over a cupcake any day of the week. Then there's the invisible goodie: the Banana Pudding, which lives in the deli case next to the cash register. There are normally several portions already scooped into tall paper coffee cups, but because they're capped, you might never see the delicious treat inside: a trifle-style dessert made with banana chunks, vanilla wafer cookies, and vanilla pudding. You'll need to ask for a serving of this treat at the counter. Banana pudding is a traditional Southern snack that resembles a tiramisu, but Magnolia Bakery's version improves on the original by using very high-quality pudding- we're not sure if they make it themselves (they wouldn't divulge their secrets to us), but however it's made, it is fluffy and light, with a texture similar to a mousse. It might not be ultra-authentic, but it is fantastically refreshing and cool. We won't suggest that you skip the cupcakes when you're there, but we do think that Magnolia Bakery is more than a one-trick pony. That may be its saving grace after all the Sex and the City tours stop and the appeal of the glitzy cupcake begins to wane. Vive la banane! Magnolia Bakery, 401 Bleecker Street (at the corner of West 11th Street and Bleecker Street), 212-462-2572

Daisy May's BBQ USA: No Matter How You Spell It, Bring Napkins
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2006-06-07 11:23:00
***CONTENT
 Apparently, you can tell a lot about a ribs and pork place just by their spelling choices: is it BBQ, barbecue, or bar-b-que? Or is it Bar-BQ? Legend has it that spelling is somehow related to culinary provenance, that paying attention to barbecue versus bar-b-que indicates whether the food in question is Texas chow, Kansas City or Memphis ribs, or even the vinegar-based pulled pork dishes found across the Carolinas. Then, depending on where you're from, there's another layer of complexity: a BBQ to some people is not a type of food at all, but an event - that is, a cookout. For Daisy May's BBQ USA, a growing constellation of carts loosely tethered to a mothership on 11th Avenue in midtown, it's a little bit of both. Its head chef and founder, Adam Perry Lang, is a former chef whose resume is more haute sauce than hot sauce, with gigs at three of Manhattan's most upscale restaurants: Daniel, Chanterelle, and Le Cirque. The attention to fine detail that he developed over his career comes across loud and clear in his cooking at Daisy May's, where all meat is cooked in an open pit and watched fastidiously to insure that everything is smoked to perfection. All of this makes a trip to Daisy May's a study in both obsession and authenticity, as I discovered as I tasted my way through their menu over the course of several visits in the past few weeks. The Carolina Pulled Pork BBQ Sandwich ($9) comes on a toasted sesame-seed bun and is topped with a layer of carrots, coleslaw and cabbage. The sauce is tart and redolent of mild vinegar, and the rough pieces of shredded pork are sweet and oven-hot. However good it may be, the pork sandwich is perhaps Daisy May's messiest option, so grab extra napkins. Let me repeat that: grab extra napkins! The bun will be soggy toward the end (i.e. not much help), and the sauce gets, well... absolutely everywhere. The 'Texas Chopped Beef Brisket' sandwich ($9.50) arrives with meat that is so tender it falls apart as you eat it, its sauce sweet, with hints of molasses. Bought from one of Daisy May's carts, the sandwich is served deconstructed into its various components: a sesame seed bun (untoasted, but not cold), pickles, diced red onion, and a plastic tub of hot brisket ready to be spread out over the bun. This is done to keep the hot elements hot and cool elements cool, and although they don't serve it from the carts, it would be excellent with a cold beer. Daisy May's chili ($7) is no less satisfying than the brisket, which makes sense, as they share the same meat. Billed as a 'bowl o' red', this is Texas-style chili par exellence, with red pepper and cumin in a sauce loaded with black beans, surrounding generous chunks of fall-apart-on-your-fork brisket. And like the sandwich, the chili is interactive: customers at the cart get separate packets of cheddar cheese shavings and red onion for mixing in the cup, as well as soft tortillas to mop up whatever you can't get with the plastic spoon. Daisy May's also has Kansas City and Memphis style ribs ($11.50 for a half rack, $23 for a full rack) that are thick and juicy, and sold unapologetically with all of their unhealthy-but-delicious pork fat intact. My half order of Kansas City ribs was more food than even I could handle-although I certainly gave it a try after falling in love with its lush meaty flavor, and sticky sauce. Once again, this is not a dainty meal. Napkins will help, as will healthy sips of Daisy May's sweet tea ($3.50), a powerfully sweet, yet addictive mint tea, garnished with a small bunch of fresh mint leaves floating at the top of a 32 oz (yes, that's one quart) Mason jar that becomes your dinner souvenir (and that's great, because empty Mason jars with screw-on lids are perfect for mixing salad dressings). For some aficionados however, the real status of a barbecue joint is revealed in the quality of its sides, and it’s here that Daisy May’s is a bit more uneven. An order of mashed potatoes ($3.50 for a small portion) comes without its advertised bits of spud skin and is overwhelmed by an oily layer of melted cheddar cheese. A small side of rice and beans, a bargain from the cart at $1, has good flavor but is more akin to Popeye’s style ‘dirty rice’ than proper rice and beans. The 11th Avenue location has more choices for what Daisy May’s calls ‘fixins’’ that look a good deal better, including baked beans, creamed corn and spinach, coleslaw and cornbread. Another reason for visiting the midtown HQ is their new dining room, which opened just last month. Looking like a cross between a Finnish sauna and a campground mess hall, what it lacks in atmosphere is made up for by convenience. The restaurant has also extended its opening hours to 10 p.m. most nights and is now open on weekends. No longer do you have to eat outside or hurry home hoping your barbecue stays warm until you can eat it-now you can cover yourself in barbecue sauce and bits of napkin and let someone else hose the room down afterwards. Daisy May's BBQ USA 623 11th Avenue (at 46th Street), 212 977-1500. Carts are located at Wall Street in front of Federal Hall, 49th Street between 6th and 7th Avenues, and 47th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues.

El Centro: Cómo se dice \"Eh\"?

 Pegboards, bright yellow pegboards covering nearly the entire north wall of the restaurant! Glimpsed through the taped windows about a week before the restaurant opened earlier this year, this rather unpromising view was our first peek at El Centro's interior. HungryMan and I looked at each other, disbelieving. We didn't expect the new restaurant to match its flashy predecessor, Vynl, glitterball for glitterball, sequin for sequin, but we had hoped at least for a little bit of flair. Fortunately, pegboards were a means to an end, and not the goal, as they've since been covered over with a museum exhibit's worth of tin loteria gewgaws that give the restaurant a very quirky charm. The food also tries to cultivate the same eccentric appeal, while still remaining as firmly Mexican as possible. For the most part, this is a good strategy, as Hell's Kitchen (like most other neighborhoods in New York) already has several other plain Jane Mexican eateries: unremarkable both in design as well as food, which presents a perfect opportunity for a place like El Centro to fill a gaping hole in the market. And I wish I could report that this is what has happened. But when Chopper, HungryMan, and I visited recently, we found lots of passably decent dishes-and we ordered quite a bit of food-with nary a standout in the bunch. Nothing we ate was bad, by any means, but none of it made us want to rush back to El Centro. We started with two shrimp dishes: the grilled shrimp pozole appetizer ($8) and the shrimp quesadilla with chipotle chiles ($8), and in both cases were underwhelmed by the spicing (too little of it) as well as the preparation (the pozole was undercooked, while the quesadilla was far too chewy). Our entrées weren't much of an improvement; HungryMan's grilled chicken taco with molé negro ($5) arrived floating in an oil slick of molé sauce-far too much for the taco, but worse was that the shredded chicken pieces inside were dry and approaching tough. If there's one dish that could be fixed with very little effort, it is this one: easing up on the sauce and keeping that chicken moist would improve this taco by leaps and bounds. I ordered one of the evening's specials: the grilled black bass taco with molé negro and mashed potatoes ($6), which did not have the same over-saucing issue as HungryMan's dish, but which had a problem all its own-pasty, lukewarm mashed potatoes that sapped the heat out of the fish, leaving just a messy, mostly flavorless gloop inside the tortilla. As I ate, I wondered if I had accidentally requested the Bland Meal from St. Vincent's Hospital down the street. Chopper's taco al pastor (braised pork, served with salsa verde, $5) had few glaring problems, but in the end, it also was not great: none of the ingredients, from the tortilla to the pulled pork, made much of an impression on us. When HungryMan tasted Chopper's main dish, he said, \"It's OK, but I think it's not much better than unnamed fast food tacos.\" Nothing criminal, but food this mediocre left a lot to be desired. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chip cheesecake, as well as an order of the bunuelos-two fried discs of sweet dough topped with scoops of cinnamon ice cream. The cheesecake was decent and not very interesting, but the bunuelos came closest to being a hit, as they were surprisingly light and very well-paired with the cinnamon ice cream. I suspect the bunuelos weren't fresh, however, as they weren't even room temperature when they were served-barely melting the ice cream that sat atop them. But they did end our meal on a high(er) note. Some other reviewers have remarked that El Centro is a good place to drink margaritas, nothing more. While I did think the frozen margarita I drank during dinner was great, I hope that El Centro isn't going to settle for mere adequacy in its food, especially when its problems seem to be simple ones, problems that might be eliminated with a few hours of watchful kitchen supervision on the part of the management. After all, it would be a shame to fill Vynl's old digs with a restaurant that amounts to little more than a margarita bar that just happens to serve food, and where the pegboard is the biggest attraction. El Centro, 824 Ninth Avenue (at 54th Street), 646-763-6585 More photos of this meal are also available on our Flickr photostream.

Don't Mess With Chow Chow, Y'all

 Bruni isn't the only one who's been roadtripping recently- I spent much of last week on a business trip in Texas. During my short stay, I was served steaks at least once each day, the smallest of which was a slab of grilled meat approximately the size of a baseball glove. Texas, I came to understand, is not a place for vegetarians, nor is it a place to watch your waistline. While I wasn't undone by the easy access to beef, I did fall prey to the siren song of one of my personal Southern favorites: chow chow. If you've never seen or tasted it, chow chow is a vinegar-based relish that is often made with peppers, cabbage, and green tomatoes, although there are as many versions of the stuff as there are theories about where the name came from. (My own best guess is that it derives from chou, which is the French word for cabbage, but nobody really knows the answer.) Homemade chow chow tends to be composed of whatever is cheap at the market or overabundant in the garden at the time of canning: hence the variations from recipe to recipe. I encountered chow chow first when I was about 10 years old, at a visit to North Carolina's legendary Sanitary Fish Market in Morehead City, where it was offered as a condiment for their sweet, cornbread hush puppies. That first bite was a shocker-I had selected the HOT STUFF variety-but I smiled through the heat and ate nearly a whole jar at one sitting. From that moment on, I was hooked. That's why I got a little giddy when, during one meal of my Texas trip, I was presented with a basket of corn bread and two little bowls of chow chow and warned, \"This is chow chow. The bowl on the left is mild, and the bowl on the right will open up your head.\" I grabbed the corn bread, a spoon, and the top of my skull, and got to tasting. While the hotter chow chow did indeed pack a pretty atomic punch, it also masked most of the other flavors in the relish. The mild version, on the other hand, was just about right-the tartness of the liquid and the slight sweetness from the peppers and onions opened up more and more with every crunch. I did wish there were another Goldilocks bowl of semi-hot chow chow that fell somewhere in between the two on the Scoville scale, and when I asked my server if such a thing existed, she laughed and told me that yes, it did, and that we'd all been given the 'extra hot' chow chow because the kitchen had run out of the 'hot' version. She also told me that the restaurant had once made its own chow chow, but had switched to a local supplier recently, and better yet, that it was for sale in supermarkets. I'm sure you can guess where I stopped on my drive back to the hotel. I was anxious to induct HungryMan into the chow chow fraternity, but also curious to see if Mrs. Renfro's Gourmet Foods also exports its relishes to New York. And indeed, they do: Dean & Deluca in Soho carries the mild chow chow (although it's almost certainly more expensive than the $2.99 per jar I paid in West Texas). We've been slathering it with abandon on rolls, sandwiches, and in truly sacreligious style, veggie burgers like the one on the left, now that we know that we're only a subway ride away from a new jar. One of our goals for the summer is to see what the garden produces this year and perhaps try our hands at an NYCnosh chow chow, but until then, we're both very happy to let Mrs. Renfro do the work for us.

Dispatches from the Field: Chopper's Tofu Meal

 New York is a great tofu town: there are spectacular fried cubes of the stuff to be had in Chinatown, soft and nutty blocks of sesame tofu in the East Village, newborn and still-warm bowls of freshly made tofu in the West Village, not to mention an entire NYT article about the stuff to guide your search for the best version in Gotham. But we also recognize that there even better places for tofu, places where tofu is the alpha and the omega of a meal, as NYCnosh contributor Chopper discovered on a recent visit to Japan: Try a Tofu Teishoku: All Soy, All The Time To my mind, single-ingredient meals are like cowboy-themed weddings or “dress-as-your-favorite-70’s-superstar” birthday parties: they’re best avoided. When a chef stretches one ingredient—say, basil, or bacon, or chocolate—over three or more courses, the dishes typically suffer from the forced festivity. Too often, the result is monotonous, inedible, and overpriced. But I’ll gladly make an exception when it comes to tofu, perhaps the global champion of single-ingredient meals—although, given its range of textures, it might be unfair to call tofu a mere ingredient; really, it’s more like a separate food group. Tofu can be slippery, custardy, spongy, crumbly, or tough, with each iteration absorbing or repelling flavors in different ways. Buddhist monks in Japan figured this out hundreds of years ago, when they started making multi-dish temple meals centered on tofu and its various byproducts. These strictly vegan meals are still offered in many of Japan’s most beautiful temples. They are lovely, languorous, and often quite formal affairs, with one dish following after another for hours. Temple meals should be part of any trip to Japan, but beware: in addition to taking up a good chunk of your afternoon or evening, they can eat up a good chunk of your change. Fortunately, there is a more accessible option. On a recent trip to Kamakura, a small seaside city one hour from Tokyo, I discovered Kamakura Komachi, an eight-table, all-tofu restaurant that offers two types of vegan teishoku (set menus). Unlike the dining areas in temples, there are no tatami mats here, no Zen-like views of distant mountains, and no super-attentive servers in kimonos. What there is, simply, is fantastic food in a low-key, wood-paneled room. This is not a “special-occasion-splurge” restaurant; it’s a once-a-week place, good enough and cheap enough to make me wish I lived down the block. The menu consists solely of two teishoku options. The cheapest one, for about $13, comes with six dishes, plus rice, miso soup, pickles, and a cup of fresh soymilk that was a revelation, like drinking fresh-squeezed OJ after a lifetime of pasteurized Tropicana. The more expensive teishoku has the same bells and whistles as the cheaper option, but ups the ante to eight dishes (some the same, some quite different) and costs about $18. It was too much food, but I ate all of it…and then bought some crispy tofu chips and a quart of soymilk at the restaurant’s small shop. (All of the tofu and soymilk is made daily on the premises.) Tofu is often called a culinary “blank canvas,” but this isn’t entirely accurate. High-quality, fresh tofu retains some of the soybean’s mild nuttiness, and this subtle flavor makes it an excellent complement to stronger ones. This was apparent in several of the side dishes, particularly the unohana, a starchy blend of vegetables and okara, the soybean pulp that’s left over after making soymilk. Typically, unohana is made by simmering the okara in sweetened soy sauce, but here there was just a hint of sugar and soy sauce; the real flavor came from the tiny chunks of scallions and the sweet slivers of steamed carrots and shiitakes. Many of the other small dishes offer similar twists on traditional teishoku favorites. Take, for example, the yuba, which is sometimes called “tofu skin” because of its ultra-thin, slippery texture. Yuba typically is served with a soy sauce-based dipping sauce, but here it was presented with a small but potent dollop of yuzu marmalade. This blast of tart citrus was the most surprising flavor in the meal, and made me wonder why we don’t add yuzu to everything. The restaurant’s only nod to modern “tofu-as-a-substitute” cuisine was the spoonful of sweet soy mayonnaise that accompanied a trio of green beans and a tofu pocket with sliced shiitakes and a preserved chestnut. This faux mayonnaise was creamy, smooth, and a little sweet; a nice balance to the chewy tofu pocket’s saltiness. In Japan, every proper teishoku has an entrée, and at Kamakura Komachi it is—surprise!—more tofu. The $18 teishoku paired a large wedge of silken tofu with an even larger serving of black sesame tofu, which looked like unstrained blackberry ice cream and was almost as creamy. These two tofus were served together in a traditional cedar bowl, and each came with its own dipping sauce: soy sauce, bonitos and scallions for the “plain” tofu, and a sweet, thick red miso sauce for the black sesame tofu. Both sauces were delicious, but both are unnecessary. The $13 teishoku swapped out this one-two punch for a large bowl of semi-firm tofu simmered in soymilk. Anywhere else, this would be a worthy entrée, but here, accompanied by a cup of the same soymilk, it was a bit redundant. Dessert isn’t a traditional part of Japanese meals, and at Kamakura Komachi only the more expensive teishoku includes a sweet treat. But at least on the day of my visit, the dessert was a winner: a chewy ball of mochi filled with vanilla soy ice cream. I was saddened to find that the restaurant’s store didn’t sell this along with the other tofu products, because I would have bought six or seven and eaten them on the spot. There’s a rumor that Kamakura Komachi will open a Tokyo branch soon, and that it might even become a franchise. But this location will always be worth a visit. Kamakura was the capital of Japan from 1192 to 1333, and you can easily spend a day or two wandering its twisting, ancient streets, taking in the many artisan shops, art galleries, soba shops, and ice cream stores. There is also a 37-feet-high bronze Buddha and more than 70 ancient temples, many of which are nestled into dense green hillsides overlooking the Pacific. This small city of just 168,000 people doesn’t quite have the majesty or scope of that other ancient capital, Kyoto, but it does have Kamakura Komachi.

The Seaport Gets a Boost: Salud!

***CONTENT
 Certain restaurants- most street-facing Chinatown eateries, and the pantry-sized West Village boites, for example-never let you forget that, despite the cuisine, you are still in New York. Salud, with its ample dark wood seats, whitewashed walls, rattan accents and slowly turning fans overhead, plops you right in the middle of Havana or Buenos Aires for an hour or two- so much so that you're surprised to find yourself, after a satisfying meal, back on the sidewalks of New York. A mostly tapas joint just off the main drag of downtown's rapidly changing South Street Seaport area, Salud brings its transportative magic to a part of Manhattan that suffers still, after Fulton Fish Market left for Hunts Point in the Bronx less than six months ago. As the smell from the old stalls slowly fades away, it is replaced by new, much more pleasing aromas coming from the new wave of restaurants and cafés moving into the neigborhood. And of course, some of the most appealing smells come from this very tapas joint. I say 'mostly tapas' because Salud's menu does offer a number of larger plates, like a 'pollo al horno,' a half-roasted chicken or 'mar y tierra,' the Spanish version of surf n' turf, in this case a mango-glazed half lobster paired with grilled skirt steak. While these are a little pricier items than main dishes at most tapas places ($15 and $23, respectively), most of the small plates, from chicken soup to octopus stew to salads, run from $8 to $13. When Candide and I visited recently for a celebratory lunch, we ordered both large and small plates, partly out of habit (we've gone once or twice before) and partly because we wanted to try more of Salud's goodies and had never had a spendy occasion worthy of the extra outlay. Candide ordered the tostones rellenos ($9), an adorable appetizer of braised shrimp, scallop, and lobster pieces, held together by a creamy overlay of queso blanco, all stuffed into crispy fried green plantains that had been cleverly shaped into little cups. Candide thought these were fun and unusual, though I noted he wished for a bit more lobster in the cups (then again, who wouldn't want more lobster?). In terms of presentation, this was the most unique plantain dish I've seen in a very long time. Meanwhile, I was tucking into the paellita, or mini-paella ($9). This continues to be my favorite dish at Salud, and even though it does not compete with the paella I have been lucky enough to eat in Spain, it is pretty great, held together the way really good paella should, with loads of chunky pieces of shrimp and lobster throughout the rice mixture, and with a few just-opened mussels and clams nearby. Its diminutive appearance as an appetizer is inspired: at many restaurants, paella is only offered for two or more. This is excellent paella without the commitment. Our larger plates included Candide's seafood platter ('parrillada de mariscos', $24), which offered an assortment of simply grilled lobster, shrimp, and scallops wreathed around a ramekin of clarified butter. The menu had promised a full half-lobster as part of this dish and, while there were a number of nice fleshy pieces hiding out between the scallops and the shrimp, this somehow did not seem like truth in advertising. For the price, this was a small disappointment. My main, the churrasco, was an Argentine-style (i.e. almost obscenely thick) piece of skirt steak, cooked medium rare and smothered with a piquant chimichurri sauce. Compared to the seafood platter, the steak was much more meat than I expected and, at $17, better value for money. The steak was also supposed to be served with a mesclun salad and tostones but oddly, Salud was out of the latter the day we went, and so substituted rice and beans. We made up for the absence of plantains by ordering an extra accompaniment of the sweet, fried maduros, which were excellent. Two caveats to a meal that I otherwise heartily recommend: One, prices are, as mentioned, somewhat steep. However, there's an easy solution to this issue: the very satisfactory prix fixe menu offered at lunchtime. And two, service at Salud has been known to be excruciating slow, especially when the place is busy. When asked about this, the staff responds that their food is all fresh and prepared to order-good food takes time. So if you're among the Wall Street no-time-for-lunch crowd, you'll fare better someplace else. But if you've got some time to spend in a space that makes you feel like you're a few thousand miles to the south, Salud might just be for you.

Brr-It's Cold in Here, There Must Be Some Buckeye in the Atmosphere

 Ohio isn't the state that first springs to mind when someone says, \"ice cream\"-Vermont has that honor locked up these days, now that Ben & Jerry have become international celebrities. But if B&J have any hope of establishing serious staying power, they should take a lesson or two from Cincinnati's Aglamesis Brothers and their (nearly) century-old creamery. Since 1908, the company has been making ice cream and chocolate candies from all natural ingredients, and recently, they've started exporting their goodies out of the Buckeye State. We first heard about Aglamesis purely by chance, when an Ohioan reader sent us a photograph of a pint container of Aglamesis Brothers' ice cream, along with a swooning article written about their products. So we took the bait and sent an e-mail to Aglamesis, expressing our interest in sampling their ice cream. One week later, a package arrived at the NoshPad-courtesy of Aglamesis Bros.-containing six pints of ice cream and a pound of their Deluxe Assorted Chocolates. We were impressed right away with the way the box was packed: inside a cardboard box sat a disposable styrofoam cooler filled with dry ice, newspaper, and of course, the ice cream and chocolates. Even though the package was shipped Fed Ex Ground, we suspect it would have survived a few more days without refrigeration before the ice cream melted-score one for quality packing. Immediately after transferring all of the containers to the freezer, we telephoned Lady Film Editor and Chopper to invite them over for a light dinner and a very big dessert. Just as we had with our Capogiro shipment, we planned out our tasting and borrowed a tactic I use when running wine tastings: placing lighter flavors earlier in the line-up leaves palates less fatigued and more sensitive towards the end, when the richest flavors appear. HungryMan took excellent notes, and what follows here is a summary of these, in the order in which the flavors were sampled: Raspberry Ice- We loved the bits of berry seeds in this, as well as the strong taste of real raspberries, and the distinct lack of acidity. This was definitely an ice, and not a sorbet, as it was thick, almost rustic in its texture. It might go well with a lime slice. French Vanilla- This was very smooth and perhaps a little bit too sweet, flavored with vanilla extract and not real beans (we couldn't spot any vanilla seeds here). This wasn't anyone's favorite, even though it was decent. Chocolate Chip- Wow. Excellent quality chocolate in this. Maybe even a bit too much emphasis on the chocolate, as the vanilla flavors of the ice cream got completely lost. A little chunky, as well. Butter Pecan- Gorgeous brown sugar flavors. Real pecan halves studded the mixture, which was a real treat. The saltiness of the pecans was also lovely. Two of us liked this best. Black Raspberry Chip- Yes, fruit ice cream with chocolate chips. The strength of the berry flavor worked very well with the competing chocolate taste here, as opposed to the less-complex Chocolate Chip. The taste was also reminscent of a chocolate covered cherry or a liqueur-filled chocolate bottle. This was my clear favorite (and I ate the rest of the pint the next day). Dutch Chocolate- Lady Film Editor's favorite. The cocoa taste was intense and just sweet enough to kill the natural bitterness of the cocoa. We suspect the cocoa was Dutch-process. Lush and very rich. Paired very well with the Raspberry Ice. Our overall impressions of the ice cream were very good, with a few flavors clearly finishing the night as standouts. Everyone also enjoyed the chocolates, which broke open with a satisfying 'snap' that is the hallmark of fresh chocolate. HungryMan and I were especially smitten with the dark chocolates in the assortment and were very happy to discover that Aglamesis offers several all-dark packages. We also really love Aglamesis Bros.' commitment to using all natural ingredients, even though the description of 'calf gelatin' was a little too explicit (and also a warning sign to vegetarians). But at the same time, there is something really refreshing about seeing a product that isn't afraid to disclose all of its contents completely. I also fell completely head over heels with the stylized, late-Victorian style packaging on the ice cream. I'd buy a pint of this ice cream just to stare at the container, and truth be told, both HungryMan and I opened the freezer several times to take a peek at the lovely pink pints inside, during the very short time the ice cream sat in our freezer. If you're in the mood for a regional specialty that you can't buy in a supermarket in this area, Aglamesis Brothers sells 6 pints of its ice cream for $75 (including shipping and packaging) on their website. You'll need to order in groups of three pints, so a 6-pint order could contain 2 flavors, including some very tasty-sounding seasonal flavors such as banana chocolate chip and coconut. Chocolates run about $16 per pound, with an extra $8 for shipping. We've really warmed to the idea of sending people ice cream in the mail instead of flowers-the prices are pretty comparable, and frozen treats make a very big impression. Plus, unless you're going to be in Cincinnati, how else are you going to get your hands one one of those stunning pink pints? Aglamesis Brothers, Oakley Square, Cincinnati, Ohio, 513-531-5196

Ohio has another great ice cream producer, Graeter's, which I have personally ordered from. You can order online from their site at http://www.graeters.com/ Their offerings are seasonal (for example, peppermint candy ice cream, and pumpkin ice cream around Thanksgiving/Christmas), so it's worth it to check back often.

Nicholas, great comment. We read about the Graeters vs. Aglamesis Bros. debate a few weeks ago and both said how much we'd love to do a little comparison tasting- both companies seem to inspire pretty ardent loyalty. Thanks for the link!

Hailing from NE Ohio, I am very partial to Handel's ice cream, it's insanely good with an INSANE amount of butterfat. http://www.handelsicecream.com Also, Harry London's chocolates are very good. (Oprah loves their pretzel joys) Trivia tidbit, the buckeye is not only our state tree, but also our state confection. It's a peanutbutter cream dipped in chocolate to resemble the buckeye. My aunt's are better than anyones.

 Weaknesses come in all shapes and sizes: one of my biggest takes the form of an inability to walk past a new Chinese bakery without stopping in for a treat or two (or seven). Worse, HungryMan is my enabler, holding the door open for me, plopping buns and sticky desserts on my tray, and even sometimes ushering me to a table while he pays the bill. So it was this past week when we walked past the Golden King Bakery Inc. on the corner of Bowery and Hester Street. We had a moment of déja-vu when we realized that this same spot housed another, very different-looking bakery, as recently as six months ago, but the proprietors of the Golden King have redesigned the interior, installing steel tables and benches, modern hanging lamps, and an all-metal bakery case that gives the restaurant a very 21st Century feel. The food, on the other hand, is traditional Chinese pastry-light spongey cakes, vegetable and meat buns, and a variety of sweet-ish rolls. Chinese baked goods, like their Mexican cousins, tend to be less sweet than most European-style pastries, which can be a bit of a surprise if you're not prepared for it. While I normally find the tempered sweetness of Chinese bakery items to be very pleasant, the lemon custard cake I ordered was even less sweet and quite a bit firmer than I had imagined it would be. This might have been a disaster, had I not been carrying a still-hot cup of milky java, and had I not been inspired to dunk. The result was a gorgeous combination-perfect for a quick pre-work nibble. Golden King does sell its own coffee (something I did not know) so if you don't happen to have a cup on you, you can grab some here. Interestingly, you can also order an unappetizing-sounding 'coffee and tea mixed' drink, but I'd recommend picking a side and sticking with it for the duration of your snack, at the very least. HungryMan chose a savory item from the bun steamer, a shredded pork bao zi bun. This, I am sorry to say, was not very good, mostly because the pork was seriously under-seasoned. In a bun where the soft, pillowy exterior does not shoulder much of the flavor burden, the filling is key, and here, it just could not do enough to rescue the bun. HungryMan abandoned half of it uneaten. <img class=\"softframing\" style-\"float:right\" src=\"http://static.flickr.com/47/150968722_55ad1371dc_m.jpg\" width=\"240\" height=\"121\" alt=\"bakerycasefx\" />In the end, we left a little bit disappointed by Golden King Bakery. The space is certainly much sleeker and attractive after its recent renovations, but the quality of the food is not as high as it ought to be, especially in a neighborhood with so many stellar Chinese bakeries. When we did a little research into the restaurant, we uncovered another fact about the building at 92 Bowery: it is where the founder of the Hare Krishna sect, Swami Prabhupada, lived in the mid-1960s. Come to think of it, perhaps it is his lingering, herbivorous presence that cast its shadow over our pork bun experience. I wonder, would a vegan cardamom tofu bao zi fare better?

For Your Consideration, Cookies in a Supporting Role: Bouchon Bakery

 Thomas Keller's Bouchon Bakery seems to have been teleported into the Time Warner Center from another, less chrome-plated universe, someplace where Columbus Circle looks more like Wysteria Lane than the northern tip of Hell's Kitchen. The patrons, too, seem to be recruited right out of central casting: there's the wealthy middle-aged Spanish tourist with his red canvas trousers, the investment banker and her Marc Jacobs ensemble, and of course a few toddlers in super-ergonomic strollers. No surprise then that a seat at either the retail counter (where we ate this past weekend) or in the adjacent café offers a perfect perch for a little (white) people watching. Oh, and the food's not so shabby either. Urged to visit by our friend Salli, we stopped at the bakery counter with the intention of purchasing only a TKO cookie or two, but when we came within sight of the sandwiches, we revised our plans to include lunch. I opted for the very appealing tuna nicoise sandwich, which consisted of very white tuna, minced onions, and an olive tapenade, all served on a rustic country bread that looked and tasted nearly identical to a chewy ciabatta. As I ate, I noticed an unusual taste in the nicoise, something peppery and just a little bitter that I guessed and later confirmed to be cumin and cayenne. The addition of these spices to the sandwich gave it exactly the extra dimension of flavor it needed. At $9.25, this was absolutely a pricey sandwich, but if I worked anywhere near Bouchon Bakery, I suspect I'd end up spending a good chunk of my paycheck on these. HungryMan's Vegetable Jardiniere sandwich (also $9.25) was nearly as good, served on two thick slices of toasted multigrain bread that was unlike any loaf bread I've eaten. It somehow managed to retain its crisp right angles on the outside, while molding on the inside to the curvature of the layers of fillings. Amazing. Our favorite of these fillings was the roasted eggplant, with the perfumey pesto coming in a close second place. We both had hoped for a little more of the gruyere cheese, but even without it, the sandwich was delicious. Then there are the cookies, our very reason for percolating up the escalators to the 3rd floor. We chose one of the aforementioned TKO cookies, as well as a Nutter Butter cookie (both $2.75) and dutifully split them. First, we sampled the Nutter Butter, which in its factory-made incarnation is one of my personal favorite prefab snacks. But Keller's version makes me think now that I'll never be able to eat another one, tree elves or no. At Bouchon Bakery, the dessert is soft and hearty, with visible oat flecks and a magnificent aroma of brown sugar and yes, peanuts. The TKO cookie, on the other hand, is a refined little treat composed of two rich and short cocoa wafers that bookend dollops of sweetened whipped cream. We absolutely adored the very mild but recognizable saltiness of the chocolate discs, not only because it made the wafers a pleasure to eat on their own, but because it reinforced and amplified the buttery sweetness of the cream filling. This is my vote for cookie of the year. Eating in the café costs $3-4 dollars more per item, on average, and given the fact that you'll be eating in a mall either way you slice it, we recommend grabbing a table at the retail counter, if you can find one. There's also a pair of hidden high-backed stone seats nearby that look like a sculpture overlooking the main atrium. Just be quick about claiming a spot to eat when the opportunity arises-otherwise, that woman with the Sephora bag will beat you to it. Bouchon Bakery, 10 Columbus Circle, 3rd floor, 212-823-9366

Upper East Side Gem: Wu Liang Ye

***CONTENT
 Going for Chinese food outside of one of New York’s Chinatowns can be an iffy experience; food is often prepared to the tastes of neighborhood locals who are more likely to prefer tame fare over authentic (often very spicy) fare, such as tripe or jellyfish. But not so at Wu Liang Ye, an Upper East Side mainstay that makes few concessions in its cooking, an as a result, produces some of the best, mosty Sichuan food in the city. Of course not everything at Wu Liang Ye is echt-the menu includes the back-of-the-menu dishes like General Tso’s Chicken, Sesame Chicken, and Singapore Rice Noodles, but just about everything else on the menu richly deserves to be there. Uncle Heraclitus and Abstract Aunt, both Chinese food fans, had somehow had managed to miss Wu Liang Ye, despite having lived in its UES neighborhood for some time. But after our recent gathering there, they have been just as won over by Wu Liang Ye's outstanding food. Our meal began with two apppetizers, a minced chicken 'taco' dish, and a large order of the restaurant's signature Dan Dan Noodles. The chicken ($6.95) was stir-fried until absolutely tender, arrived swimming among generous quantities of minced pine nuts, hot red peppers, corn and green peas. Because this was billed on the menu as a ‘lettuce taco,’ it was served with a barely wet mountain of leafy head lettuce that was intended to stand in for a tortilla. With a spoonful or two of the chicken mixture and a little flipping and folding, what resulted was a crisp green bite-sized packet that was fun to prepare. We fell in love with the multiple contrasts in this dish: the heat of the chicken filling with the cool lettuce, and the crunchy exterior of the 'taco' with its tender filling. It was then that we also found ourselves in an enviable dilemma: should we keep nibbling on the chicken or start in on the Dan Dan Noodles? This dish is all about surprises-it appears simple, but don't be deceived. Underneath a mound of Chinese spinach and crumbs of minced pork (the staff will also make the dish without the pork) sit innocuous-looking pale white noodles. So far, nothing shocking. But at the bottom of the bowl, you'll find a seriously hot chili vinaigrette lying in wait. I am someone with an admittedly low tolerance for certain kinds of spicy heat, but the fiery quality of these noodles worked wonders to bring out the flavor of the pork and accentuate the barely chewy texture of the pasta. I'll offer two caveats: (1) order two servings of these noodles, as they are so good that your tablemates will likely get to them before you do, and (2) be prepared with an alcoholic drink nearby (non-diet soda or a dairy beverage will also do the trick), as water will not help counteract the heat, if you're inclined to try to fight, rather than ride the peppery wave. Positive momentum continued with our main courses, especially Uncle Heraclitus’s shrimp with cucumber dish ($16.95), which brought together stir-fried prawns with fresh cucumber slices. Once again, the interplay here was between the heat of the Yibin chili sauce and the cool of the cukes, as well as the firm cucumber crunch paired with the tender pull of the shrimp, all working together to remind you that Wu Liang Ye is clearly paying attention to balance. Nosher ordered the sea scallops in a spicy chili garlic sauce ($13.95). These avoided the common, overcooked and rubbery fate of many scallops and turned out to be tender on the middle with a just slightly crisp outer shell. Snowpeas, water chestnuts, and broccoli contributed a good deal of crunch, and oyster mushrooms added a nice dose of umami to the thickened, garlicky sauce. Yet again, this was another dish with substantial heat coming from a liberal, but well-warranted, use of chili garlic sauce. Finally, I found my camphor tea smoked shredded duck ($15.95) to be a highlight of the evening. In a sense, I had come to Wu Liang Ye for this dish, having heard people rave about the nuances of smoke and aromatic flavoring that make it a standout. And I was right to listen to them, because not only is the duck seasoned through with the delightfully earthy taste of camphor tea, but it is tremendously juicy. There are green and red onions here too, as well as shavings of bright green onions, but they’re there simply as a crunchy counterpoint to the duck’s starring role. If you are a stranger to tea-smoked meats, they are usually prepared by gently heating a cut of meat (or entire bird) over a smoldering mass of something pleasant that imparts its flavors to the meat. But with tea-smoking, the flavors often remain subtle due to the short time the meat spends in contact with smoke. This is not the same hours- or days-long process that gives bacon its flavor; smoke should never rear its head as the primary flavor in a tea-smoked dish. In the case of my duck entrée, I could always taste the slightly minty camphor, but never found it overpowering the headiness of the duck meat. It, like so many of our other dinner dishes, struck just the right balance. Wu Liang Ye, 215 East 86th Street (between 2nd & 3rd Avenues) 212 534-8899. Midtown location: 338 Lexington Avenue (between 38th and 39th Streets)

Not sure if the ownership is the same, but Wu Liang Ye on 48th, between 5th & 6th Aves across from Rockefeller Cente, is also a very good Sichuan restaurant.

Yep. Same ownership, same menu. The one on 86th is better, I think, but they're both excellent.

If you haven't tried the tea-smoked duck on the bone, go for it next time. Based on comparing the shredded & the half duck at 48th street, I'd say the shredding and the other ingredients dilutes the indescribable amazingness of the duck itself.

 Julie Allen clearly pays very close attention to what she eats, but not for the reasons you might expect. Instead, she converts her scrutiny into an artistic exploration, reimagining and refashioning food as textile, and in the process raising lots of questions about how we perceive what we eat, as well as where the aesthetics of food begin and end. When we visited her gallery show at McKenzie Fine Art, Inc. in Chelsea, HungryMan and I were impressed first by Allen's considerable technical skill with fabric and thread-even her onions are at once structurally sound and realistically striated. Her vegetables are also captivatingly beautiful, especially the mushrooms, with iridescent fabric and a tawny thread standing in for dark gills underneath the cap. But completely apart from the gorgeous construction of everything from kiwi slices to sesame seed buns, we found ourselves talking about the things Allen had included in the show, as well as what she left out of it. While you'll see several salads (both assembled and separated into their components), the aforementioned hamburger, and plenty of fruit, you won't find any muslin mock-ups of soups or stews in Allen's show. That's because the questions it poses seem to be more about the elemental in food aesthetics: Does a caesar salad remain a caesar salad when it is sorted back out into its parts? Is it beautiful in both states? And perhaps most importantly: where does the beauty in food like this reside-does it inhere in the individual splendor of a mushroom or pepper, or does it emerge only in their mixing? No easy answers here, in a room where macramé supplants macaroni. Allen's show runs until the 27th of May and is small enough to see in about an hour, so drop in for a chance to see some seriously impressive needlework, as well as for an opportunity to rethink how you perceive your edibles. Plus, it's free-the cheapest meal in town. Julie Allen, McKenzie Fine Art, Inc., 511 West 25th Street, 212-989-5467

The Clear Ones Mounted to Snow: A Tiramisu Story
***AUTHOR
Nosher

2006-05-09 15:48:00
***CONTENT
 Last week, as we walked with a friend around Brooklyn on our first gorgeous spring weekend, we re-discovered a new fusion sport that combines elements of orienteering, linguistics, and cooking-all thanks to a craving for tiramisu and a quick stop into an Italian grocery. Of course, we had no recipe to guide us. But we guessed that Italians might have adopted the Toll House Cookie approach; we figured that one likely place to find instructions for making tiramisu would be on the side of a package of ladyfingers. Sure enough, we were right. There was only one small problem with the recipe we discovered- it was written entirely in Italian: Il mio Tiramisu 4 uova/ 5 cucchiai di zucchero/ 350 gr. di mascarpone/ Savoiardi Bisconova/ 6 tazzine di caffe/ 5 cucchiaini di cacao amaro · Preparare il caffe e lasciarlo raffreddare senza zuccherarlo. · Preparare una crema con I tuorli, lo zucchero ed il mascarpone · Unire alla crema le chiare montate a neve molto sostenute e lasciar riposare nel frigorifero per 15 minuti. · In una pirofila disporre I savoiardi dopo averli immersi per il tempo necessario new caffe, alternare lo strato di crema e cacao spolverizzato ad uno di savoiardi. · Infine, aiutandosi con un colino distribuire uniformemente il cacao amaro sull’ultimo strato di crema. · Lasciar riposare per almeno 3 ore in frigorifero. Between the two of us, we speak a few languages, so you might assume that puzzling out an untranslated recipe would pose no problem. All the easier, when you stop to consider that we’ve got Italian orthographically surrounded with French and a little Spanish. But the most important fact in this cautionary tale is this: with cooking, as with street directions, every word is crucial. The tiniest misunderstanding can change the course of a dish’s trip from pantry to table, and might just end up producing an inedible trainwreck. We worried that our inchoate, 40% comprehension just wasn’t going to yield anything resembling what we'd eaten in restaurants. But of course we went ahead and bought the ingredients anyway. The ace we thought we had tucked up our sleeves was AltaVista’s language translation protocol, Babelfish. Their computational translation software makes it theoretically possible to take any text, in any of several languages, and convert it instantly into English. Part of Babelfish’s considerable charm is that it is not perfect. All the nuances it misses, the shades of meaning that it glosses over, give everything it produces a fresh-off-the-Internet-boat cachet. Nevertheless, we still thought it would suffice, so we headed back to the Noshpad, diligently typed in the recipe, and hit 'Translate'. This is what Babelfish sent back: Mine Tiramisu 4 eggs/ 5 sugar spoons/ 350 gr. of mascarpone/ Savoiardi Bisconova/ 6 cups of caffe/ 5 bitter cacao teaspoons · To prepare the caffe and lasciarlo raffreddara without zuccherarlo. · To prepare one cream with egg yolks, the sugar and the mascarpone. · To join to the cream the clear ones mounted to snow a lot supported and to leave to rest in the refrigerator for 15 minuteren. · In one pirofila to arrange the savoiardi dopo averli immersed for the necessary time in the caffe, to alternate the layer of cream and cacao spolverizzato to one of savoiardi. · Finally aiutandosi with a strainer uniformimente to distribute the bitter cacao on the last layer of cream. · To leave to rest in order at least 3 hours in refrigerator. We looked at the results, and then at each other, and thought about reaching for The Joy of Cooking. But where was the fun in that? After all, if Babelfish was being so vague in its response, it must be protecting something delicious, no? So we sat on the sofa and resolved to pick through the pidgin English recipe, line-by-line. We quickly uncovered an important detail that neither of us might have caught without our virtual go-between— the recipe's eggs were separated into yolks and whites-“clear ones,” as Babelfish so lyrically terms them. But soon we had new problems. We had no idea how big “tazzine” (cups) were, and moreover, what kind of coffee we were supposed to put in them. Brewed coffee? Espresso? Should the cup be filled to the brim, as an Italian would never do? In the end, we decided to estimate, based on our several groggy visits to Italian coffee bars, that two ounces of very strong coffee (akin to a long espresso) might be a good approximation. Now came the issue of this “cream” that the Babelfish directions kept talking about. We hadn’t seen any listed in the ingredient list. And more troubling still were all of those long, important-looking verbs- “Lasciarlo?” “Aiutandosi?” Clearly, there was something that both we and AltaVista were missing here, and cream was only part of the problem. After a few more minutes of nervously munching through one of our extra bags of ladyfingers (oops!), we took a guess that the “-lo” and \"-si\" at the end of the verbs were grammatical particles, and might be removed. So back we went to Babelfish, this time inserting what we deduced were the verbs. Bingo! What we had left was a mostly readable recipe, with just one last puzzle: what was a “pirofila?” We could discern that the whole mess of ingredients must end up in a pirofila at some point, so we knew that it had to be some breed of container. When we really thought about it, neither of us could recall seeing tiramisu in any sort of serving or cooking dish at all; we had both only experienced it lounging sexily on a serving plate. Babelfish offered no help, and worse still, Google gave us at least a dozen unique images of pirofile that all seemed likely candidates. We started to get the hint-the ladyfinger manufacturer (and recipe publisher) made the casual assumption that any fool would know his or her pierogis from pirofilas. Really, such a presumption isn't at all out of place in an European recipe, where instructions are often simply loose guidelines and not precise templates for cooking- for example, take note of how the recipe above tells the cook to prepare the ladyfingers by immersing them “…for the necessary time in the caffe.” Necessary time? Clearly, we lacked some cultural prerequisites to tackle this recipe, not having an inborn sense of how long ladyfingers should soak in coffee. We pictured the recipe's author asking herself: \"What self-respecting Italian hasn’t made tiramisu?\" For that matter, what self respecting Italian doesn’t have a pirofila? We hazarded another guess that “…mounted to snow a lot supported…” sounded just a bit like “stiff peaks” and therefore that this mystery “cream” was actually just the well-blended mixture of ingredients. Armed with these new deductions, we headed to the kitchen, where we found the tiramisu surprisingly easy to prepare. And as for our choice of ersatz pirofila? Our Pyrex baking dish worked perfectly. We could have gone with a larger dish, but any dish made of glass with a flat bottom (about 50 square inches) and tall, vertical sides (3-4 inches) will work very well. Then yesterday, as she helped us devour the product of this weekend’s kitchen exploits, HungryMan's Italian colleague Vivi shared with us the secret of the pirofila. After all of the hue and cry, the frantic paging through illustrated cookbooks, and the Google searches that taught us all about “porphyrins” and “spirolina,” it turns out to be pretty simple after all. It’s a casserole dish. An Internet-Enhanced Tiramisu 4 eggs, separated 5 Tablespoons sugar 350 grams mascarpone cheese 7 ounces ladyfingers 12 ounces strong coffee (brewed or from long espressos) 5 Tablespoons cocoa powder Chocolate for shaving Prepare the coffee and leave to cool-do not add sugar or cream to it. Cream together egg yolks, sugar and the mascarpone in a standing mixer or by hand. Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold into the yolk cream. Place this mixture to rest in the refrigerator for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, immerse ladyfingers in coffee to soften them-this will not take longer than 30 seconds, as ladyfingers are very absorbent. In a low-sided casserole dish, arrange the ladyfingers in a layer, and do not worry if ladyfingers break. Top with a layer of the refrigerated yolk cream, and then a fine sprinkling of cocoa powder. Alternate the layers of yolk cream and powdered cocoa with layers of the ladyfingers. Finally, distribute cocoa uniformly on the top layer of the cream with a strainer and finely shave chocolate over the top of the dessert. Refrigerate, covered, for at least three hours, and then until ready to serve. Serves 8. 2006 nycnosh.com & Savoiardi

Small But Perfectly Formed: Bouley Upstairs

***CONTENT
 Let's get the bad news out of the way at the beginning: odds are that you will wait for a table at David Bouley's miniature bistro, Upstairs. The restaurant does not accept reservations, and its dining room only seats a few dozen diners at a time, which means that more than likely, you'll spend time wandering around in the Bouley Bakery downstairs with a glass of wine. Of course, there are many worse ways to spend half an hour. The other piece of bad news is that we hear through the grapevine that David Bouley has been spending less time cooking at Upstairs than he did just a few months ago-on our most recent visit last week, he was not in the kitchen, and the staffers in the bakery told us that they hadn't seen him cooking on site for at least a week. But if getting a bargain peek at Mr. Bouley is your only motivation for dining at Bouley, you're missing the point; the restaurant is superb, with or without Mr. Bouley manning the saucepans. The menu might seem a little Sybil-esque, fractured as it is into Japanese and French sections that bear little relationship to one another, but this is more an endearing quirk than a problem-the dishes all somehow manage to work well with one another, even if the mechanism behind this alchemy is unclear. Then again, it is very easy to order from one cuisine stream and just avoid the other, as HungryMan and I did on Wednesday. We chose French mostly because of the chicken liver appetizer-two toasted slices of walnut bread, topped with a few spoonfuls of very earthy and tender liver morsels that tasted strongly of rosemary and the cognac that they were sautéed in just seconds before. Better still, this dish smelled as good as it tasted, prompting the diners at the next (a little too nearby) table to beckon the waiter and change their own dinner order. I don't blame them a bit. My own starter, the a la plancha calamari salad, was nearly as good, featuring diced avocado, tomato, mixed greens, and a pesto-like vinaigrette. The calamari was excellent: very lightly golden and still delicate and barely cooked through, precisely the way it ought to be. All of these ingredients were piled together in a bowl of Bibb lettuce, which I really thought ought to have been included as a primary ingredient in the salad, as I suspect that some diners mistake it for a garnish and leave it behind. For my main, I chose the now-legendary halibut that has become the restaurant's signature dish. Composed of a thick slab of poached halibut atop a very buttery foundation of tiny shiitake mushrooms, peas, fresh corn, and a lemon-thyme sauce, this dish would have been a success even had the fish itself not been sauced. But it was, it was... . Twice. The green pesto stripe was lovely, but the truffled sauce that freckled the surface of the fish was just magnificent, tasting pungent and nearly sweet at once, with a subtle, inexplicable aroma of allspice. This dish is quite simply the best halibut I have eaten in New York City, bar none. HungryMan's lamb chop, served with a generous hunk of lushly soft grilled eggplant, mint and zucchini purée, and sherry vinegar was also very good, if a little too rare. The portion size was more than adequate, barely leaving him enough room for one compulsory dessert- and really, with Bouley Bakery just a flight of stairs away, how could we not have ordered at least one item from the dessert menu? So we chose the dacquoise, which arrived looking like no other dacquoise we'd seen. This one seemed to be more of a custard tart, rather than a multi-layered meringue affair, which is what we expected. While we both really enjoyed the inventive addition of passion fruit to the dessert, the whole thing left us a little disappointed, and we both wished we'd ordered one of the pastries from the case downstairs. In comparison with the stellar quality of the rest of the meal, the dacquoise couldn't compare. I even found that the remnants of my glass of verdicchio made a splendid match with the dacquoise dessert-not what I would have expected from a dry white wine. And in the end, this echoes our lingering impression of Bouley Upstairs: it did not conform at all to our predictions, but it was lovely despite, or perhaps because of this- no matter who's in the kitchen. Bouley Upstairs, 130 West Broadway, 212-608-5829

You Put The Lychee in the Coco Nata and Drink Them Both Up

***CONTENT
 Eight or nine years ago, Clearly Canadian's Orbitz disaster pretty much destroyed any American interest in drinks that feature floating solid bits. While that on its own isn't necessarily a bad thing, I've long thought that their vague resemblance to 1997's disgusting Orbitz beverages kept people from sampling bubble tea drinks until just a few years ago. But not all fruity drink suspensions are created equal- and most especially those that come from Asia. So when HungryMan and I ran across Kato brand Lychee Drink with Nata de Coco (available at Thailand's Center Point at 63rd St. and 39th Ave. in Woodside, Queens), we closed our eyes, forced ourselves to banish all thoughts of Orbitz, and put a bottle in our shopping cart. We were hopeful because when nata de coco is made well, it is delicious. Nata is just gelled, fermented coconut milk that on its own has a very subtle and sweet flavor, but which soaks up other aromas and flavors like a trooper. One of my very favorite desserts is one that exploits this property simply and elegantly: ice-cold nata de coco, soaked in passion fruit juice and topped with a drizzle of coconut cream. It is what Jell-O wishes it could be when it grows up. When we arrived back at the Noshpad, we crossed our fingers and poured ourselves a sample of the lychee drink. Immediately, we noticed that the nata had been chopped very roughly and irregularly, which makes sense, as it provides more surface area to the pieces, making them more buoyant in the drink. All the nata de coco bits were also very soft and just barely chewy, which is exactly right for a beverage, especially one that comes in a bottle-chewing is part of the experience, after all, but it shouldn't keep the drink from doing its primary job of quenching thirst. In this case, the balance was just right. And the taste? Wonderful. Both of us were surprised by this, to be honest. But the tangy, floral lychee flavors balanced beautifully with the sweetness of the drink-this is a high-quality product. In fact, if it were strained and served without the nata de coco, you'd have a hard time distinguishing this from a lychee-infused Snapple. Inspired to improve on the lackluster cocktails we saw on offer at Cafetasia a few weeks ago, HungryMan and I headed for the bar ingredients and began experimenting. We discovered a few things right away: first, lychee pairs well with gin-the high-note flavors of juniper really brighten up the fruit. Second, adding alcohol to a suspension drink changes its density enough so that settling begins to take place. Now, as long as the drink isn't sitting around for hours, this won't be too much of a problem, but it is worth keeping in mind that your nata might start to sink. Finally, we were reminded that there is something really satisfying and familiar about chewing while drinking a cocktail-when you think about it, it is something we do it all the time with maraschino cherries, olives, and pearl onions, so don't let the nata de coco put you off at all. Just think of it as a mixed drink that makes its own garnish. The 6-Hour Clock 1.5 full measures (2 1/4 Tbsp.) gin 0.5 measure (2 tsp.) Grand Marnier or Cointreau 5-6 oz. lychee drink with nata de coco Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Add the gin, Grand Marnier, and lychee drink. Shake, but do not strain. Remove ice cubes with a spoon and pour into martini glasses, making certain to distribute nata de coco equally. Finish with a basil leaf. Makes 2 cocktails. 2006 nycnosh.com

When Pizza Delivery Goes Wrong-Horribly, Horribly Wrong

***CONTENT
 Had we not been in the room to witness the event, we never would have believed our neighbor's pizza delivery nightmare story. But we watched the whole thing play out from start to finish, and it's a shocker. Three of us had spent most of Saturday evening sorting through dozens of boxes of inherited old books that Mr. Penguin had stacked around his apartment, and by the time we realized we were all hungry, it was after 10:00. None of us wanted to go out, exhausted as we were, so Mr. Penguin fired up the laptop and logged on to SeamlessWeb to find us a pizza. At that hour, our only real option was a restaurant we'd never tried before, but we were all game-and ready to eat. So with a click, we placed our order, added in our tip, and locked our fates forever with Fat Sal's. 40 minutes later, Mr. Penguin received a call from the delivery man, saying he was outside. He buzzed the delivery person into the building and went to the door to collect the pizza while HungryMan and I stood in the living room, clearing space for dinner. But our friend didn't leave the door after he closed it. We heard him slide the peephole cover open and remain there at the door, watching the delivery man leave. We asked, \"What's going on? Is everything OK?\" and then scrambled to the hallway when we heard him reply, \"Oh my God.\" The door flew open again, and there stood the Fat Sal's delivery man, in the hallway, pants pulled down around his hips, penis poking through the flap of his underpants, getting ready to let loose a stream of urine into the corner in front of Mr. Penguin's apartment. He looked stunned to have been discovered, wincing visibly when Mr. Penguin began bellowing at him to get out of the building. Even more astounding was the fact that the brazen delivery man took his sweet time bundling himself back up and collecting his things-only when two more building residents walked in the front door did he speed up and leave. We all stood there, door open wide, aghast at what had just happened. According to Mr. Penguin, he had gotten some ugly looks from the delivery person as he signed the receipt and thought that he probably ought to make sure the man left the building. \"I thought-at the very worst- that the guy might throw some garbage in the hall. But I didn't expect that.\" But through the peephole, Mr. Penguin watched as the Fat Sal's employee looked around to make sure nobody was watching, set his insulated pizza bag and coat down in the hallway, and then ambled into the corner and unzipped. Within seconds, Mr. Penguin was on the phone to Fat Sal's, and HungryMan and I were taking notes-it was a Woodward & Bernstein moment. And unbelievably, this is where the story gets even worse, as the man on the telephone refused to tell Mr. Penguin whether the manager was in the store, and then a full 5 minutes into the conversation announced, \"Sorry. I don't speak English,\" and hung up on him. When Mr. Penguin called back and explained the problem again in Spanish, he was told simply, \"Call back tomorrow and talk to the manager. I'm not going to help you.\" Galled but powerless to press the issue that night, we sat down and stared suspiciously at the pizza box. Should we eat it? Was it safe? Mr. Penguin assured us that it was in the insulated bag when it arrived, so we figured that it was probably left untampered. We also wondered aloud what we would do if, by some miracle, this was the best pizza we'd eaten in New York-what sacrifices are worth making for a good slice? Turning your hallway into a Port-a-Potty? Escorting your delivery person out the door each time he brings you a pie? As it happened, these were irrelevant questions, as the pizza was adequate, but not great-the salty crust was much better than the too-greasy, too-sweet toppings. The next day, we all reconvened at Mr. Penguin's apartment, where HungryMan and I sat listening in on speakerphone to the follow-up call to Fat Sal's. It should come as no suprise that the same stonewalling employee answered the phone and insisted that not only was the manager not in, but he couldn't release his name because, \"I don't know who you are.\" Even after Mr. Penguin gave him his name and phone number, he was told that the manager's identity would be kept secret, but that perhaps Mr. Penguin would receive a call in the near future. Perhaps. At this point, we did the only thing we could, and called SeamlessWeb, having seen how diligent they are about following up with satisfaction surveys after some orders. Mr. Penguin lucked out and spoke not only with a live person, but with a very senior, very helpful, and very outraged staffer who reported that this was the worst delivery story she had heard in 6 years. She immediately refunded the entire bill to Mr. Penguin and promised to contact both the manager and owner directly. \"Fat Sal's is going to be getting hit from Seamless Web on all sides,\" she said. And we believe her, even though Mr. Penguin hasn't heard back from the restaurant yet. This cautionary tale of pizza and forced watersports has certainly made us rethink responsibility and culpability. From our perspective, Fat Sal's restaurant can be excused for hiring a bum delivery person, but not for its hostile attitude and complete lack of a response to a serious, potentially criminal complaint. We won't presume to tell you what to do, but I do know there are at least three pizza lovers in Manhattan who will never do business with Fat Sal's again.

Nosher
2006-04-27 10:30:00
Yes. SeamlessWeb offers an option to include a tip in the charge, which is what Mr. P. did. We all wondered if the delivery man's behavior had something to do with the tip (which was more than enough for the bill, by the way), but it leaves you with a real Hobson's choice: do you crassly point out the tip on the receipt or just resign yourself to only ever paying a tip in cash? Regardless, the problems went beyond the peeing.

Lets get right to it. The delivery guy's attitude was pssss poor to say the least. All that you wanted was to have a fresh hot pizza promptly and curteously delivered from Fat Sal's. No one expected or bargained for the miscreant of a sub-human that came to your door nor his unsolicited urine sample. My complete simpathy for you guys and very pleased to find that you have survived this most repugnant and distasteful ordeal. My solution would be to have all delivery agents to be licensed, bonded, and with picture ID's so that the 'we the people' can have assurance that we should not be hassled by disgruntled delivery agents from any take-out operation.

SeamlessWeb's customer service is REALLY GOOD. I was blown away, especially after that other delivery service basically redlined my work building with no explaination.

Spicy Eats on the Go Downtown

***CONTENT
 Just he other day, I went with Oscar, a fellow hungry worker, on a search for spicy food close to our building Downtown. But this was no ordinary mission for hot cayenne or jalepenos. Oscar, you see, hails from India, and he misses Eastern spices of the sort he used to get in his tiffins and the multitude of lunch places crowded around his office in Bombay. He directed us to a lunch cart not far from the South Street Seaport that, while not technically Indian or run by Indians -- and not even serving food described as Indian -- comes tantalizingly close to the kind of food you can get on the streets of Madras or New Delhi. The cart seems to have no name other than the \"Halal Food\" designation and brief menu posted to its bright orange vinyl-wrapped chassis. It is however reliably parked on the Southeast corner of Maiden Lane and Front Street every day at lunchtime, and is easily recognized by the long line of customers in front. Middle Eastern, Indian, Pakistani, South East Asian, North American: its customers are a reflection of New York's ever-changing spectrum of cultures. And its hodge-podge menu reflects an Epcot Center of tastes as well-yes, you can get an All-American hot dog with a Lower East Side-style Jewish knish, but you can also get a Middle Eastern shish kebab and even a Italian sausage, in case you want to pretend as if you never left Brooklyn. But best of all, and the real reason we came, was the chicken over rice, an addictive mix of shredded and cubed chicken, rice seasoned with red and green chiles and onions that resembled nothing so much as a biryani. All the more so because of the 'white sauce,' a cool yogurt that resembles the 'curd' that is traditionally poured over several Indian rice dishes. The optional red vinegar 'hot sauce' is that extra touch that reminds you that, Eastern spices or no, this is still New York. All the chiles make for a pleasing heat, though one that is far from overpowering. Of course, you can always hold the hot sauce. The dish ($4) also comes with a small side salad and a lone falafel ball, though these are clearly secondary attractions. If you want more than just the one falafel ball, then the falafel pita ($3) itself is an excellent choice: at once crunchy on the outside and chewy on the parsley-infused green interior. The pita bread holds up well to the falafel, lettuce, tomato and yogurt, making this one of the best deals for a fast vegetarian lunch downtown. A word to the uninitiated, however: the service here is efficient and no-nonsense. Be prepared with your order and money when you get to the front of the line. And know the lingo: \"chicken and rice - white sauce hot sauce,\" uttered quickly and with purpose, gets you New York-style biryani rice that, for the money, can't be beat... on this side of Bombay, at least. Halal Cart, Southeast corner of Maiden Lane and Front Street during weekday lunchtimes. No phone.

Brunch Where You Least Expect It: Café Mogador

***CONTENT
 Couscous probably isn't the first thing that comes to mind when you think \"brunch,\" but after our trip to Café Mogador last weekend, we're starting to think it should. It was here, in the heart of the East Village, that we met up with a left-coast visitor, BurningMan, as well as our local friend HypoxyDoc, who was eager to take us on our first visit to a restaurant that we had passed dozens of times, but had inexplicably never tried. Thank goodness for friends with an agenda, because the meal we ate at Café Mogador was excellent. We did wait outside (as there is precious little room inside) for 15 minutes, but anyone who has attempted to eat brunch in New York City knows, that is a very short wait. Doubly so, considering that we were below 14th Street. Once we'd scored our weekend noontime 4-top, we quickly ordered drinks and some babaganoush for the table. I'll be the first to admit that I ought to have ordered something other than my traditional brunchtime coffee-eggplant purée does not mix well with a latte. Despite the strange pairing, I could appreciate how fine the babaganoush was: creamy yet not sieved, it retained a very distinctly smoky taste from the roasting of the eggplants, a flavor that was not overwhelmed by too much garlic. The light touch with garlic isn't too common in the Middle Eastern cooking we have eaten in NYC, so it's a welcome treasure when we find it. This subtle flavoring practice made another appearance in HypoxyDoc's Hummus & Scrambled Eggs Platter, a dish that, on paper, sounds as if it might be...well, unpleasant. But you skip it at your peril-the combination of the very smooth, lightly garlicky chickpea purée and firm yet moist eggs is absolutely tremendous. This dish alone is reason enough to visit Café Mogador. The side servings of tabouli and tomato salad were a little superfluous, but don't let that dissuade you: this is one of the best brunch dishes in town right now. HungryMan, being a contrarian at heart (and especially on Sunday mornings), decided to order from the restaurant's regular, non-brunch menu, opting for the Chicken Couscous, prepared in the restaurant's Casablanca style with raisins, onions, chickpeas, and lots of saffron. The healthy portion of chicken (about 1/4 a bird) was slow-cooked for so long that just a touch of the knife caused all the meat to fall from the bones. Not only was the chicken extraordinarily juicy, but the couscous-which we had all expected to be a bit dry-was buttery and moist, and remained so throughout the meal. My new goal is to learn how to prepare couscous even half this good at home. If that means returning to Café Mogador a few dozen more times to figure out how, well then, so be it. I'll just have to drink my coffee before I arrive. Café Mogador, 101 St. Marks Place (between 1st Avenue and Avenue A), 212-677-2226

Thats such a fitting title for the post - I've never been for brunch before, and would have never thought to go, but I just discovered cafe mogador a couple weeks ago when I was looking for some good hummus and falafel without having all the way to Yatagan's or Mahmouns in Greenwich Village.

Mogador had been a favorite of mine for years (I think they opened in the mid-80s when I was living nearby), and it's sometimes a couple of years between visits. They're pretty consistent. They have killer merguez, and I dig the post-hippy vibe and the usually excellent & eclectic music they play.

They're Cousins, Identical Greek Pastry Cousins

***CONTENT
 One of my favorite food memories takes me back to an unusual time and place: Monday mornings in my college Biochemistry lecture hall. It was there that two or three times a month, a very generous friend would hand me a suitcase-sized white cardboard box bulging with unsold pastries from her waitressing job 75 miles away in Queens. But this memory is about much more than the desserts-it is just as much about my friend's bawdy and hilarious stories, populated by people named Kostas, Melina, and Eleftherios. Equally, the memory is about a café I had never yet seen: Omonia. No surprise then, that when we moved back to New York, my first culinary pilgrimage was to Astoria. I ordered my favorite dessert, a citrusy, lemon-syrup soaked cream custard called galactobouriko, and drank two tiny-but-potent cups of Greek coffee while chatting with Omonia's owner. We talked about my college friend, the neighborhood, and how things had changed for his business since my last taste of Omonia 15 years ago. He was careful to point out that even though Omonia gained a bit of reknown a few years ago after a high-profile catering gig for My Big Fat Greek Wedding, the restaurant's recipes remain the same as they have been for decades. And from what I can tell, I believe him. Chopper, HungryMan, and I stopped in again this week for a late-night dessert. I arrived with a dual mission: first, I wanted to share the joys of galactobouriko with Chopper, who had never tasted one before; no less importantly, I also wanted to taste a Greek dessert that, during my college years, I only heard about but never tasted. My friend never brought me bougatsa in those huge white boxes because it is a pastry that is intended to be served warm. If it's not heated and fresh, she told me, it's no good. No microwaving, either. But, she promised, if you like galactobouriko, you will fall in love with bougatsa. Now that I've tasted them side-by-side, I see exactly what she meant. Like two phases of the moon, they are similar enough to be mistaken for one another, but different in a few important ways. Bougatsa is another creamy, custardy phyllo pastry, but unlike its syrup-soaked cousin, it is not flavored with oranges and lemons. Instead, bougatsa is served dry and dusted with ground cinnamon and powdered sugar. Where galactobouriko is sticky and messy, bougatsa is crispy, toothsome, and elegant. Its warmth is also another big asset-heat releases odors from the vanilla and cinnamon, making bougatsa a dessert that is impossible to ignore when it is sitting in front of you. I think I may have to agree with Chopper and HungryMan and admit that I like it just a little bit better than galactobouriko, but as the weather warms up in the city, perhaps my preferences will change once again. And when I do decide to revisit the question of which is better, Omonia is where I'll go-but this time, I'll be the one leaving Queens with a big white box of goodies to offer my friends. Omonia Café, 32-20 Broadway (near the Broadway Station on the N & W lines) in Astoria, Queens, 718-274-6650

I've passed by this bakery a couple times. I'll try it if I'm in the neighborhood. My cousin invented a similar dessert in his bakery: phyllo sheets and bavarian cream are sandwiched between two layers of yellow chiffon cake. The whole thing is dusted with powdered sugar. It tastes best when fresh, or else the phyllo gets soggy. It's kind of like Taco Bell's double-layered tacos: soft and crispy at the same time.

Cadbury Mini Eggs: Not Just For Gentiles Anymore

***CONTENT
 No matter your spiritual affiliation, Easter season offers a chance to take advantage of a tidal wave of candy in every supermarket and drugstore. Not all of it is good-or even edible-especially what passes for the chocolate used in hollow molded rabbits and festive eggs. Much of this stuff is little more than cocoa butter and food coloring, which won't please most people over the age of 8. But along with the junk come a few gems, and chief among these are Cadbury Mini Eggs. Not quite as well-known, but every bit as seasonal as their more famous cousins, the Creme Eggs, these marble-sized candies deserve a little recognition. Mini Eggs, as you might expect, are a British import, but one whose form ought to be very familiar to most Americans: they are solid milk chocolate eggs, coated with a very crunchy candy shell-essentially gigantic M&M's. But Mini Eggs are what M&M's aspire to be when they grow up-their chocolate is far richer, and their shells are decorated in pale pastels and a strange chartreuse-yellow, then dappled in faint brown freckles. Best of all, they're significantly less sweet than M&Ms, which skews their appeal towards the older chocolate lover. They are also kosher. Go figure. If you can track down a bag of the British Mini Eggs (these come packaged in a yellow bag), you'll discover a similar candy shell covering a much darker chocolate interior than in the Mini Eggs on sale stateside. Frankly, the UK version is even better than the already wonderful US version. Why the difference? Because all Cadbury's domestically-manufactured chocolate products are reinterpreted through the confectionary lens of the Hershey Foods Company. And as much of an American tradition as Hershey's candy may be, it is not world-class chocolate. That said, whatever they're doing to the chocolate Mini Eggs is worth replicating year-round in as many products as possible. Before Mini Eggs disappear from the shops, grab a few bags-12 ounce packages range in price locally from $2.99 to $3.99 (CVS and Duane Reade carry them). But be forewarned, Mini Eggs have a loyal group of devotees who make the limited supplies of these even more difficult to find. We, who are as guilty as anyone of this behavior, like to keep them in the freezer, where a good stockpile of a few dozen bags gives us enough Mini Eggs to last through..well, May.

However, living here means I can get cadburies mini eggs all year round in plentiful supply... mmmm, 1kg in one day is no problem.

Men Who Love Crepes and the Bistros That Hate Them

***CONTENT
 An acquaintance of ours owns, by his own admission, a seriously sub-par restaurant in a very hip part of Chicago. The space was rewired, redecorated, and renovated at lightning-quick speed, and the menu was literally phoned in-drafted as our acquaintance walked home from the gym one afternoon. But for all of its faults, the restaurant is a cash cow, turning an operating profit for the owner within a week (!) of its grand opening. Customers aren't fooled though-they complain about the poor food quality routinely, and yet they continue to come back. The reason isn't a mystery to anyone: the restaurant fills a niche in the market, offering mid-priced sit-down meals to its youngish clientele, and because it has no real competition in its category, it is given tacit consent to play Ike to the neighborhood's Tina. What's the alternative? HungryMan and I were reminded of this story several times during our recent visits to The Blue Point, a mostly-French, mostly-crepes eatery on 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen. Because we live nearby, we have watched the restaurant's exterior change and have marveled more than once at the speed of its transformation from empty shell to a chrome-and-tile dining room. Once we set foot inside, however, we started to get a little concerned; some of the tiling work appears to be off-kilter, and there are several places where the grouting is distractingly sloppy. A worse sign-and something that is much more difficult to fix-is that the entire back half of the restaurant smells intensely and very unpleasantly like a hot, oily grill. After sitting at a table in the rear of the restaurant for 45 minutes, we carried the odor around with us for the rest of the night. The Blue Point's menu consists primarily of crepes, both savory and sweet, along with an assortment of salads and appetizers. Featured prominently is the set 'French' menu ($25), made up of a bowl of onion soup, roasted chicken, and a creme brulée-possibly the most appealing-sounding pre-theater dinner I've encountered in the neighborhood. But its execution is another thing entirely, as HungryMan discovered when he ordered it last week. The warning sirens began when he was informed that the kitchen was unable to make creme brulées, and in substitution, he would be offered a dessert crepe. Not bad news at all, really, given the dozen or more sweet crepe options on the menu. But when we asked about whether the chef would choose the crepe, our server looked perplexed, stammered something about creme brulée, and walked away. We never saw him again. Instead, a different waiter brought us a basket of bread and HungryMan's onion soup, which arrived tepid and greasy, with musty-tasting onions and a beef broth that tasted like nothing more than brown salt water. None of this was helped by the very sweet and almost elastic bread. Our server (another new one) informed us that the bread came from, \"France-just kidding!\" before checking with the kitchen to confirm that it came from \"a bread factory in Brooklyn.\" Such a shame, with Amy's Bread located a few doors away-on the same block, in fact. My Mediterranean Salad was just as disappointing. While the goat cheese in the salad was lovely, the tomatoes were crunchy, unripe, and yellowish, and the vinaigrette dressing seemed to contain nothing but salt and oil, with very little vinegar to give the salad an acid kick that it desperately needed. HungryMan and I resolved to withhold any judgment until we had eaten the crepes-after all, they are The Blue Point's specialty. And in the end, the crepes themselves are good. My spinach and egg crepe arrived cooked to a gorgeous shade of brown, with the interior still soft and moist, exactly as a crepe ought to be. The spinach it contained, however, was flavorless and, we suspect, probably frozen. HungryMan's main dish, the roasted chicken, was a mixed bag. The breast meat was tender and very moist, while the rest was rubbery in texture and generally bland. But the worst was to come, as yet another server arrived at the table and announced that the chef had decided to give HungryMan a choice of two dessert crepes: peanut butter or 'orange jelly.' No Nutella, no banana, no berries, no lemon juice & sugar, even-just peanut butter or orange jelly, possibly the two least appetizing desserts on the menu (and in fact, 'orange jelly' was not even on the menu). I figured that the orange jelly was likely to be marmalade and Grand Marnier, so we chose that and crossed our fingers. As it turned out, I was correct about the marmalade, but incorrect about the liqueur; the dessert crepe was just slathered with preserves, sprinkled with a little sugar, and sent out on a plate with a squiggle of caramel. Neither of us would have ordered it under different circumstances, but it was adequate, if a little lackluster and uninspired, leaving us with the distinct feeling that we were helping the chef get rid of his overstocked ingredients. Both of us left reeking of the grill and grumpy, made even more upset when we saw that our two glasses of wine had been charged at $10 apiece, a price that is seriously out of line with the cost of the entrées (which average in the low teens). Yet despite The Blue Point's mediocre cooking and shower-stall décor, business appears to be booming. My prediction is that it will end up thriving in its location for the same reasons that our acquaintance's Chicago restaurant does: it offers something new and different to the neighborhood (in this case, crepes), even though it does so with what feels like total indifference.

I love crepes, so after reading the above, decided to go anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed my chicken and aspargus crepes, as well as the crepes suzette. Thought it was a lot better than some of the other places I've tried on Restaurant Row. My expectations were exceeded (considering Nosher's review). Service was good too.

Anne, that's great. I suspect that was a backhanded compliment when you compared it favorably to other restaurants on 46th, but it's good to know that your meal was better than ours. We've both stopped in a few times since and can't get past the smell. Are they still enforcing their $15 minimum order policy?

My fiance and I went to the Blue Point on the second day it was open. Even though we weren't expecting much, considering how brand new the restaurant was, the service was very good. Can't remember what my fiance ordered, but I got the smoked salmon and sour cream crepe as an entree and a nutella and banana crepe for my dessert, and both were delicious. The outside of the crepes were a consistent light brown, and the insides were soft and warm, and were not overfilled, which is a common crepe mistake. I haven't tried the other \"French\" items on the menu, but I would definitely recommend trying some of their delicious crepes!!

Interesting stuff, Guinn. As I'm sure you saw from the previous comments, we did end up eating a crepe during the meal we reviewed, and it was decent, if nothing spectacular- I only wish that we had been allowed to choose the nutella/banana crepe. And as I mentioned, we've stopped in a few times since the place opened, and repeat visits haven't really changed our minds about the place. Plus, they still need to fix that ventilation problem (which is worse, now that it's hot). The best crepes we've had in New York so far have been at Crooked Tree Cafe on St. Mark's, between 1st and A. They're doing what The Blue Point ought to be doing.

Chanto Dips a Toe In

***CONTENT
 New York's fascination with all things Japanese is reflected in, among other things, the city's near-saturation in Japanese restaurants and sushi bars along the streets and avenues. Whether we're talking sushi or sahimi, yakitori or shabu-shabu, soba noodles or okonomiyaki, it's clear that New Yorkers love their Japanese food and, to their credit, seem willing to try anything once if it is wrapped in rice or beautifully presented on a glazed ceramic plate. But with Morimoto and Masa already well-established as destinations for draining expense accounts, can the city support another consciously upscale Japanese restaurant? Chanto, which just opened this weekend on 7th Avenue in the Village, is making a big wager that it can, and it will. Last week, at a press event before its official opening, Nosher and I got a chance to see Chanto's plan for ourselves. (And as at all press events, the restaurant picked up the tab for all the attendees.) Chanto is the first U.S. outpost of a large Japanese restaurant chain (Chanto New York is their 50th restaurant), although the company claims that this Chanto is unlike any of their other sites, both in its look and its more internationally-influenced cooking. The place certainly doesn't try to look like an archetypal Japanese restaurant- no maneki nekos here as far as we could tell, no kimonos on the walls, no tatami mats, and not a hanging lantern in sight. Instead, Chanto is chameleon, an inviting multi-level space that suprises with five separate dining areas (and there may be more that we couldn't see), each with its own ambiance: comfortable couches sidle up to a long bar near the front, a grouping of tables in the back (where more casual food is served) surround a narrow staircase that leads to a mezzanine; further up another staircase is an trapezoidal-shaped dining room with laquered black and green wall panels and enormous Venetian-style glass chandeliers. A further terrace lined with tables on this upper level makes you wonder how Chanto's architects and designers managed to engineer all these nooks and crannies into one space. Chanto's menu is happily much simpler than its décor. Divided into appetizers, entrees, sushi rolls and desserts, it is easy to navigate, even for those new to Japanese food. The tasting event kicked off with a sampling of the restaurant's smaller dishes: most memorable were the better-than-average California rolls and a remarkably crunchy roll of Japanese pickled yam with plum paste. We were also able to taste Chanto's signature drink, alternately called the 'Chanto Martini,' or the 'Mai,' a syrupy-sweet confection of passionfruit and pineapple juices, Chambord and Shouchu (aka soju)-a potato-based alcohol. While shouchu is supposed to be less caloric than other spirits, when it is paired with the juices, the resulting cocktail won't do much for any attempts to lose weight. Both Nosher and I met the bartender who created the recipe for this drink, and while we thought he was charming and very personable, we did think the cocktail was too sweet. After drinks and sushi, we were escorted up to the main dining room for dinner, where we sampled everything on offer (two dishes per course). Nosher's tuna carpaccio appetizer ($12) suffered a bit from a surfeit of chopped scallions, but the dish was redeemed by the freshness and delicacy of the fish, sliced impossibly thin and and drizzled with squiggles of decadent Japanese-style mayonnaise. My own red snapper ($22) veered in the opposite direction from the tuna's minimalism: the sashimi unexpectedly arrived atop a large bed of daikon radish, watercress and cilantro, making it more of a substantial salad than an appetizer. Our waiter pounced on the dish with his tongs, mixing the radish with the other ingredients: carrots, crushed peanuts, and tiny, sweet red kukonomi, a type of dried berry. Perhaps most surprising was the sprinkling of cornflakes throughout, which lent sweetness and crunch, and which may also represent a culinary bow in the direction of Chanto's American influences. With the arrival of our main dishes, we were again treated to staff theatrics. Those ordering the short ribs ($20, here dubbed 'Choki Choki Steak') receive a table-side visit from waiters bearing sharp kitchen shears that are used to snip each rib joint with a decisive flourish. I enjoyed the display and found the ribs to be tender and not-unpleasantly fatty, but was less impressed with the one-dimensional Japanese barbecue sauce that smothered the meat. Just a little kick, zing, or accent would improve these substantially. Nosher's entrée of black cod was sauteed in a creamy sake kasu sauce and placed on a few spears of steamed green and white asparagus stems. The sauce was by far the best thing about this dish; it tasted intensely fermented and yeasty, thanks to the sake, and, while not to everyone's taste, Nosher found it both unusual and unusally good. On the other hand, this main consisted of a very small, appetizer-sized portion-too tiny really, for its $20 price tag. Dessert was a white sesame tiramisu next to a small scoop of green tea ice cream ($7). Another attempt to integrate Japanese cuisine with Western cooking, but this time much less successful than in the appetizer sashimi: here the combination of sesame paste and heavy cream in the tiramisu was altogether far too fatty-so unctuous, in fact, that it blunted all the flavors in the dessert and made this half of the dessert unpleasant to eat. Most of the other desserts appear to be equally as heavy, and oddly, more New York than Tokyo or Osaka: choices include rice pudding, pecan pie, cheese cake, even a fondant chocolate cake. Chanto certainly packs a dazzling visual punch, and we genuinely loved some of the dishes we ate, especially the yam sushi roll. On the other hand, there was little here that was revelatory and, considering the investment demanded by a number of items on the menu (steaks are $42, and many of the appetizers cost as much as the main dishes), Chanto runs a risk of disappointing customers. But there is a kernel of something really promising here, and with a little time, we look forward to seeing where the tweaks and alterations take it. Chanto, 133 Seventh Avenue South (between Charles and West 10th), 212-463-8686

Yes, some of it was really excellent. We also make a policy of full disclosure when we're writing about something that comes free in a restaurant, or is sent to us by a publisher or manufacturer. The Darfur event looks great-thanks for the link.

HK: Big Mouth Strikes Again

***CONTENT
 Sunday was unseasonably warm, sunny, and gorgeous: perfect weather for brunch outdoors. Then again, it is still April, and few local restaurateurs have been brave enough to open their patios, gardens, and sidewalks up to patrons, but we were fortunate to have a few Hell's Kitchen options. One of which, the eponymous HK, is a restaurant that sits across the street from the Cupcake Cafe and whose terrace opens out onto the neighborhood's weekend flea market. So we headed down 9th Avenue, knowing that not only would we be able to grab a bite to eat at HK, we might even return home with a few tchotchkes and a slab of crumb cake in hand. Let's start with the terrace at HK: it is fantastic. There are currently no better seats in the neighborhood than these. Inside isn't so bad, either. HK's décor features lots of tempered glass, chrome, quilted and puffy wall coverings, white paint, and two long retractable garage doors. The critical element is the glass, however-hundreds and hundreds of feet of acoustically unforgiving glass. When the restaurant isn't packed to the gills as it was on Sunday, the glass isn't a problem. It even adds to the clean, refulgent feel of the dining room. But when there are people willing to sell a kidney for a patio table, it can be a little problematic, as we discovered when we walked in the door and heard a woman I nicknamed 'The Hellmouth'. Easily, and without any question the very loudest person I have ever encountered in a restaurant, she sat with a table of 8 other diners, screaming at everyone in the same strident tones. HungryMan nudged me and asked if I thought she might be deaf, and I responded, \"I'm sure. If your ears were that close to that mouth, you'd be deaf, too.\" For a few minutes, we got a little lucky. HungryMan and I were escorted to a two-top on the opposite side of the restaurant, on the edge of the terrace-a perfect place to enjoy the outdoors while not worrying about getting too much sun. Getting away from The Hellmouth (who we could, incidentally, still hear) solved one problem, but we very quickly concluded that HK needs to rethink the benefits of acoustic tiling, as another large party (this one a group of 18 brunchers) sat down next to us and began to take full advantage of the restaurant's bottomless mimosa and bellini brunch. It soon became a bit like eating dinner onstage during a performance of STOMP. More's the pity, because our food was wonderful. HungryMan's Smoked Salmon Eggs Benedict ($7.75) came with a side of savory, peppery home fries that were as good as any I've had in years. The eggs were also just right: poached precisely to the point where the white is firm, and the yolk is warm and runny. No trace of excess water here, either-a little goof that can ruin eggs benedict if the poached eggs are not drained properly. HK's substitution of smoked salmon for pork might not be their own innovation, but it's one that works extremely well. The French Toast with Fruit ($6.75) was also a big winner, and not merely because of its breathtakingly attractive presentation; the soft banana disks and berries were an ideal accompaniment to the caramelized sugar and crispy batter on the baguette slices. I do think the batter contained far too much cinnamon (cutting it by half will solve the problem easily), but apart from that, I could imagine eating this sort of brunch every weekend of my life. But perhaps not in HK's dining room. That is, unless the managers do something about noisy diners-something that is well within their rights, and which other NYC establishments do routinely-or unless they tackle the problem structurally with better soundproofing. Honestly, it's a shame to avoid a restaurant this good because of noise, but I cannot imagine sitting through another meal like this one. Our advice, which we'll be taking ourselves, is to walk in the door, have a quick listen, and then make a decision. And if you overhear anyone ordering the unlimited mimosa option, pop in your earplugs. HK, 523 9th Avenue (at 39th Street), 212-947-4208

Sassy's Sliders: Better than Botox

***CONTENT
 A few short months ago, every high end restaurant in the city seemed to be offering its own version of the slider: a miniature hamburger or mini-cheeseburger meant to be stacked three, four, or six abreast on a plate. Just enough of an effort was made to placate diners who would never think of setting foot in the slider mecca, White Castle-so brioche buns replaced plain white bread, and curried ketchups or Jufran banana sauce substituted for more pedestrian condiments. But any way you looked at it, you were still eating a slider. The Upper East Side's newest dirty little secret is that scores of its residents (including a fair number of 'Ladies who Lunch') have been sneaking into Sassy's for a slider on the sly-no need to go through the motions of sticking the little suckers on fancy bread; they're willing to slum it. One woman we know has a burger or two as a treat to herself before each trip to the gym, and yet another visits Sassy's Sliders-happily located within a few yards of three megaplexes-after every movie she sees. We even heard her mumble something about how easy the munchkin burgers are to sneak into the cinema. And a quick visit to Sassy's last Friday left us convinced that she might actually be onto something. If nothing else, Sassy's burgers are hot, satisfying finger food. Just greasy enough to satisfy, not greasy enough to inspire guilty repercussions. The burgers are ground sirloin and, Sassy's claims, 85% fat free. Of course, this means that they are also 15% fat, about the same percentage as in half-and-half. They also tend to be slightly oversalted, which may count as another minus for the slider, but nobody ever called them healthy. Teeny burgers aren't the only thing on the menu: Sassy's also sells fries, chicken wings, 'torpedoes' of philly cheese steak, and some excellent soft-serve ice cream, which Nosher tried and really enjoyed. The ice cream is a little salty, as well, but the extra salt is actually very pleasing in this context. Note to Sassy's: Keep the salt away from the meat and in the frozen desserts. To us, the biggest mystery is why Sassy's continues to champion the 'slider' name. Unappetizingly, these pint-sized burgers are called sliders for the ease by which they both are dispatched down the gullet, and also, the ease by which they...ahem...depart later on. Not everyone wants to be reminded of the consequences of their guilty secrets, but apparently the ladies of the UES don't let nomenclature bother them too much. As long as you can smuggle a half-dozen in a Birkin bag, pre-cinema, it's all good. Sassy's Sliders, 1530 Third Avenue (at 86th Street), 212-828-6900

Wow guys, those look ridiculous. I was looking at that burger and couldn't tell if that was cheese or pineapple drooling out of the bun. Slider hawaiian anyone? Those look incredible. Funny I have burgers on the brain-just ate at Burger Joint tonight for the first time...mmmm!

They're $1.09 apiece, and cheese is 12 cents more. No idea how they came up with 12 cents, but it sounds very precise.

I found Sassy's when they left a bunch of menus by the mailboxes in my lobby, so soon after I'd moved to the UES we ordered some. They're not as toxic as White Castle's fare, and the shakes -- and the sweet potato fries -- are indeed awesome. The chicken sliders are kinda freaky, sort of like eating a hammered-thin sponge that sort of seems like it has an essence of chicken. Neither here nor there, for about $25 including delivery, we had good eats for the evening. They're a good alternative to chinese, sushi/japanese, Mexican, italian/pizza and TexasBBQ for us, but every time we order from there it's still the same sense of hesitation, much as if we were on the road and opted to stop at a White Castle. But every time we've ordered we've gotten what we ordered quickly. BTW, the garlic fries are a little over-the-top (not in a good way).

The Art of the Unexpected: Restaurant Saul

***CONTENT
 If you’re looking for an oasis in the middle of the city this spring, you could do far worse than to spend an evening at Restaurant Saul on the now well-established dining corridor of Smith Street in Brooklyn. Located at an intersection of neighborhoods over which Brooklynites fight for naming rights (is it Carroll Gardens, Cobble Hill, or maybe Boerum Hill?), Restaurant Saul and its cooking also seem to live at a similar crossroads of tastes and influences. There is Italian, some French, new American, all put together with a confidence that has earned not only local popularity but a one-star designation from the Michelin Guide in its first New York listings. Saul Bolton, the restaurant’s eponymous chef and co-owner (along with his wife Lisa) was not too long ago a chef at Le Bernardin, but his approach to dinner service is, in one important way, very different from what you'd find at Le Bernadin: Saul himself cooks all the meals that come out of his small and frenetic kitchen. That means when Saul is off for the night, the place is closed. Indeed, when we visited this Friday, Saul greeted us shortly after we arrived, offering an affable smile and a hope that the food would live up to our expectations. Our anticipation came not from the recent buzz around Saul after his Red Guide accolade, but from our dining companions Michou and Willi, neighborhood foodies and huge fans of Saul’s; these two were perfect companions for this dinner, having made an estimated thirty to forty prior visits since the restaurant opened its doors. These same friends have also been known to frequent the Boerum Hill Food Company, another of Bolton's eateries three doors down, so they're about as well-versed in all things Saul as anyone. Saul has a small menu (8 appetizers and 7 main courses), but one that changes frequently with the seasons. There is also a $30 prix fixe option that draws some dishes from the regular menu and adds one or two extras, as well. Our recent meal began with an amuse bouche of one exceptionally smooth and sweet seared scallop in a bright basil purée, topped with frisée and a cheery pink ring of red onion. Among the smaller plates ($12-$15) we ordered, standouts included my leek and spring vegetable salad with faro (aka farro), a type of Italian grain in the same genus as spelt that one rarely sees on New York restaurant menus these days, perhaps because it is widely considered to be peasant food. Saul has wisely reconsidered this view and made faro the proud centerpiece of this dish, even though it arrives initially barely visible through the hazelnut vinaigrette-dressed mesclun leaves, grilled leeks and haricots verts. This salad was one of the best I have eaten in the past year- the counterpoint between the tart vinaigrette, the tender mushrooms, and the nuttiness of the grain made the taste experience something quite extraordinary. Willi's duck confit (a dish our friends have ordered several times before) drew both our attention and forks: its crispy skin supported a coiffure of buttery, impossibly-small baby brussel sprouts and creamy roasted chestnuts, all anchored to the plate on a bed of grits substantial enough to sop up the bird’s intense juice. Michou ordered the pork belly to start, which came divided into two complementary pieces of very juicy, roasted meat bookending a tartelette of fromage blanc that was topped with meltingly soft cipollini onions. Each piece of roasted pork sat on a little base of black lentils, and a sprig of watercress helped to pull the dish together. Nosher took the plunge and ordered the prix fixe menu. He was also, as usual, more adventurous than I was and chose to start with the grilled sardines. We all enjoyed their unusual presentation-two whole roasted sardines arrived arranged in a large 'X' formation on the plate. While the fish itself was grilled beautifully, the sauce was a little problematic: it offered a satisfying crunch, but its acid tanginess was a little one-dimensional. Saul’s main dishes ($24-$28) often follow the same pattern as the appetizers, offering little unexpected yet enchanting surprises (like miniature tartelettes or faro). My porkchop entrée is a good example: advertised on the menu as a pork tenderloin (they did let me know in advance about the substitution), the chop came with a not-very-adventurous whole-grain mustard sauce and a mound of mashed potatoes, yet (and here's where the real story lies) it also sat atop a tidy package of savoy cabbage stuffed with a pork confit. The rich, minerally cabbage and confit really made this dish-doubly so because it was unexpected. Pity only that the chop was a little small. Nosher chose the Scottish salmon option from the prix fixe menu. The tiny fillet of pan-fried salmon was, on its own, just fine, but the ring of smoky red pepper sauce surrounding it was nothing less than amazing. Salmon and smoke are obvious matches, but when they are paired traditionally, it is without an intermediary ingredient. By using the red pepper as the source of the smoke, the entrée acquired a depth of flavor and complexity that made it among the best salmon dishes we've eaten. This alone is reason enough to order the prix fixe menu. Willi and Michou had the venison and the lamb, respectively: the latter being one of the restaurant’s three specials that evening. I managed to tear myself away from my porkchop for a taste of the venison, which I found otherworldly: served with sautéed greens, shallots, and very umami mushrooms, the deer was cooked medium rare to rare and was positively silky. Although neither Nosher nor I got a chance to taste the lamb entrée, there is a photo of it and a few other dishes on our Flickr page. Dessert was postponed briefly by the arrival of a complimentary cheese plate (thanks, we believe, to our dining companions' faithful patronage, and not to our upcoming review), choc-a-block with cow’s and sheep’s milk cheeses from England, France, and the US. The best of these were a liliputian ramekin of soft and runny cow’s milk cheese that spread easily over Saul’s chewy sourdough bread, and an exceptional double Gloucester that needed no bread at all . Desserts were well above average: my warm apple cake with stewed sour cherries was solid, but Michou's lemon soufflé, with its concentrated burst of lemon and lemon zest in each bite was better. Most memorable of all was the baked alaska, served un-flambéed-perhaps respecting local fire code-it possessed a deep carmelized, slightly burnt aftertaste that jumped the bridge between merely good and great. And at $9, it’s an absolute steal that could easily feed two. The wine list also deserves mention, as it features a large selection of bottles, many of which are affordable (a few even dip below the $30 mark). Our choice for the evening was a $33 bottle of Bandol- an intense and inky 100% mourvedre that paired beautifully with the oily sardines as easily as with the lamb and the game. Otherwise, service was pleasant, with just a few minor missteps here and there. And given Saul’s numerous strengths, perhaps this is little more than nitpicking. Indeed, with a serene atmosphere and Saul's very competent cooking, it’s a sure bet that we will be back soon. Restaurant Saul, 140 Smith Street (between Dean & Bergen Streets) in Brooklyn, 718-935-9844

I had an uneven experience at Saul last week. Some of the things we ordered were amazing. The steak was amazing. The desserts (including one chocolate ball enveloped by phyllo dough) were great. But the appetizers were plain odd. I felt like the chef went for textural surprises (bulgur with greens and coat cheese) over tastes. The jerusalem artichoke soup (a special) was great, delicate but a dollop of smoky paprika was added, making the delicate nature of the body of the soup unbalanced. geesh that was serious. but it's a serious place

I live not too far from Saul, but have always shied away from trying it (for no reason in particular-maybe it exudes an overly reserved personality?). After reading this write-up, I feel like reconsidering.

Peter Pan-Asian: Cafetasia's Got Some Growing Up To Do

***CONTENT
 Walking past Cafetasia on 8th Street is an arresting experience-the front wall of the restaurant is all glass, and from the street you can see the interior, which appears to be lighted with a hundred floating candles, hovering like Tinkerbells over the dining room. The first time we encountered the new, Asian fusion (but mostly Thai) restaurant, we stood across the street and just watched dozens upon dozens of passers-by stop to gape at the scene and to pick up a take-out menu from the box outside. The second time, we ended up seated along that same glass window, looking at the panorama from the other side, and we can say with no hesitation that the view of the street is much less enjoyable than the fairy tale décor inside. We had ample opportunity to ponder the setting, as we were left for more than 10 minutes before our server arrived to take our orders. Had the restaurant been full, this would have been just a minor annoyance, but the place was filled only to about half-capacity, and there were at least four other waiters working the same moderately-sized dining room. This was our first bad sign. Our second came in the shape of HungryMan's cocktail, which was supposed to be an Asian-inspired version of the Cosmopolitan. Unfortunately, it tasted just like a regular Cosmo-and a weak one at that. When we glanced at the drinks list once again, we saw that all the cocktails appeared to have been rechristened with East-meets-West names, all thanks to the simple, uninspired addition of lychee to each-no other changes at all. If Cafetasia wants to see how to make inventive Asian-fusion cocktails, they ought to take a little field trip to Xing and bring along a notepad. The menu groups its offerings into four categories: Small, Medium, Large, and Extra-Large dishes. According to the waiter, people generally order a Small or Medium dish as an appetizer and a Large or Extra-Large dish as a main, so we did just that and decided to start out with Cafetasia's take on two of our old favorites, both of which were listed as medium dishes. From what we saw, it's also possible to order three medium plates or four small plates and compose a pretty filling dinner. My appetizer, the Green Papaya Salad ($6) came mounded on shredded romaine lettuce and sprinkled with shrimp roe instead of the more traditional dried shrimp. It looked lovely, but without the chewiness of the dried shrimp, there was little else to love about this salad. The dressing wasn't up to snuff either: all the flavors seemed watery and muted, and there was far too much lettuce in the bowl. It tasted like coleslaw more than Som Tum. The Crispy Duck and Apple Salad ($6) that HungryMan ordered was even more disappointing in its spicing-there was too much chili paste and an order of magnitude too much sugar. While I adore spicy heat, I also know that not everyone (read: HungryMan) likes it as much as I do. If they change nothing else, Cafetasia really ought to flag this dish as 'HOT'. Sadly, there's no equivalent designation for oversweetness, nor is there a menu indicator for 'too little lime juice'. Pam's Real Thai does a very similar dish and manages to get the balance just right, although sans apples. In fact, we're both still puzzling about the superfluity of those apples. They had gone limp in the bowl by the time we were served, so they offered no textural contrast, and they were so coated in the sweet-hot sauce that their own flavors were completely lost. When we ordered our mains, we both felt a little gluttonous: on top of our two 'Medium' plates, HungryMan and I chose two of the 'XL' dishes. As it turned out, 'XL' is pretty loosely defined at Cafetasia, as neither of us found the portions to be too big for dinner. HungryMan also chose this meal as a chance to indulge in one of his guilty pleasures: fried rice. The Seafood Fried Rice ($12) sounded great on paper, with sea scallops, shrimp, and eggs (even though egg isn't always found in Thai fried rice), but what he got was an unappealingly greasy pile that contained precisely one scallop. Playing the role of scallops in this dinner performance were squid pieces-a strange substitution. As unexpected as they were, the squid pieces were not overcooked and were probably the best thing in the dish. And interestingly, while his previous course was too hot, this course was under-seasoned, despite the name-check Sriracha chili sauce received in the menu. I still held out hope that the Red Snapper Rad Prik (also $12) I had ordered would put a few more marks in the plus column for this meal, as the snapper's three-flavor sauce (a tarry concoction of oyster sauce, tamarind purée, fish sauce, and chili-garlic sauce) is pretty robust and is hard to do badly. That much was borne out by the dish-the sauce was excellent. But the fish itself was dry on both the inside and outside, absorbing the sauce like a paper towel might. No amount of sauce could have rescued this fish. My best guess is that it probably sat around after being fried, but before being sauced, and lost much of its moisture through evaporation. Regardless of how it happened, it was deadly to the quality of this dish. I also received plain white rice in place of the advertised home-made crispy potatoes, with no explanation or apology-not a good policy. Only one dessert is listed on the menu: Black and White Sticky Rice ($2). Normally, I'd jump at that as a potential bargain, but by the time we both had finished our main courses, we were well and truly ready to leave, and so instead we jumped in a taxi and made our escape from this particularly unsatisfying Never Land. Cafetasia, 38 East 8th Street (near Greene Street), 212-529-2386

Hi there! I was searching for bagels on google and stumbled onto your site. I LOVE IT! Especially since the page I got linked to had latkes on it too. I'm fascinated! I don't know many jews, and there isn't any jewish restaurant where I am, so I haven't tried any Jewish food as yet. But you know what, jewish food looks soooo good!!!! I'm bookmarking your site!

 Though it would be an overstatment to call me a pastry purist, I do tend to prefer traditional flavors in my breakfast sweets: berry, chocolate, vanilla, ginger, maple, and even mascarpone. But my experience this week with Arte Around the Corner may have given me a reason to reconsider my preferences. The shop on Columbus Avenue in the Upper West Side is seriously tiny-about the size of a big bathmat-but inside there is just enough room to fit an espresso machine and 2 or 3 café tables. And these are the things that matter. The walls also perform dual-duty as shelves for a pretty decent selection of Italian groceries, from pasta and olives to Nutella, but on my two visits this week (one for pastry and the other for coffee), I managed to tune out the shopping opportunities and focused my attention on the goodies in the window. Some of them are the tarts and cookies you might expect to find in a little bistro-cum-bakery, but the loaf cakes are unexpectedly unusual. Three flavors: rosemary-honey, thyme-honey, and sage-honey appear to be in pretty constant baking rotation here; sage is one of my very favorite herbs, one that can be lush and subtle when used with skill, so I knew the instant our friend Chopper pointed out the sage-honey cake to me that I had to taste it. I purchased a thick slice ($3.00) and took it home, where HungryMan and I poked it, smelled it, and ultimately, devoured it with gusto, both of us impressed not only by the balance of sweetness and starchiness in the cake, but also by the bold inclusion of a large quantity of sage pieces in the loaf. I call it a bold move because sage is notoriously overpowering when it is used in excess, and while it deserves its reputation as a scene-stealer, sage gets such a bad rap that cooks often err too far on the side of caution when they use it. Not the bakers at Arte Around the Corner, however. They're confident with the sage, and it shows in the powerful perfumed and mineral overtones that permeate this cake. I ate my portion with a very hot cappucino, and I'm afraid that I managed to spoil myself forever-I may never be able to face an ordinary scone or muffin again. Arte Around the Corner, 274 Columbus Avenue (between 72nd and 73rd Streets), 212-875-2195

Cheap Nosh at Sophie's : A Downtown Taste of Havana

***CONTENT
 Searching for cheap eats downtown can be a dispiriting experience, especially when you’re out with friends and hankering for something different from the chain restaurants or pushcarts. That's why it’s a relief to know about Sophie’s Cuban Cuisine on New Street, an unassuming yet very popular new eatery located within spitting distance of the New York Stock Exchange. Sophie's has about half a dozen other outposts around the city, including its flagship restaurant on Madison Avenue and 33rd Street, all of which specialize in hearty lunch-counter Cuban fare that inspires evangelical devotion in diners. On a lunch break last Thursday, TV Gal, Candide, and I all decided to see if Sophie's food lived up to the restaurant's considerable buzz. Candide and I had visited once before and liked it-although we were in a rush, and TV Gal had been to another Sophie’s on Chanbers Street and remembered that she liked what she had there enough to try it again. What we found, once we pushed past a phalanx of hungry Wall Streeters to the only empty table in the place, was simple homestyle Cuban food, satisying and greasy in all the right ways. Sophie's serves a rotating array of daily main dishes alongside a permanent menu of appetizers, soups, and side dishes. Be forewarned though: Rarely is the place anything less than packed, so the servers bring your order when the kitchen sends it, not when you're ready for it. This means that distinctions between appetizers and main courses more theoretical than real. But don't let this dissuade you from ordering small plates. We started with the tostones, fried green plaintains that are much crispier than the sweeter (and more popular) maduros that are made from riper plantains. Our tostones came with a tart, vinegary sauce that we greedily poured over the golden flat discs. The tostones were also just fine on their own, sprinkled with a little extra salt. We also couldn't resist ordering two small meat empanadas that were hot enough to fog up my glasses as I split them open. An absolute steal at a dollar apiece, these were filled with lightly spiced ground beef and stewed peppers. TV Gal ordered the pechuga a la plancha (grilled chicken breast), a dish that resembled nothing more to me than a Wiener Schnitzel with onions, black beans and rice. She did enjoy it, finding the chicken more tender than most, albeit a bit less spiced than she expected. Like most dishes at Sophie’s, it can be ordered with either white or yellow Spanish-style rice. With dishes like the very simply-prepared chicken breast, I would recommend the yellow rice for a little extra kick. Candide, being a big pork fan, ordered the pernil. The roasted, shredded pork arrived absolutely glistening, and was tender and just fatty enough to keep the meat moist. This is also where Sophie's accompaniments really shone-scooped up with the black beans and yellow rice, the pork's flavors seemed to develop new dimensions of smokiness. TV Gal also remarked that the pernil looked like the pork butt (or leg of pork) she enjoyed as a child in Costa Rica. She did try to stop our harried server to inquire about the cut of meat the pernil was taken from, but abandoned her question when she saw that it meant an extra trip back to the kitchen-exactly the last thing our overworked waitress needed. I had no time for conversation; I was too busy working my way through my pollo guisado (stewed chicken), a quarter of a bird that was easily the best thing we ordered at Sophie’s (although I must admit we did not try the Cuban sandwich, which we hear is excellent). The chicken was stewed for so long the meat fell off the bone at the touch of a fork and was smothered with juice and pillowy-soft potato cubes. My only complaint about this dish is that I found the black beans a touch too dry, and overshadowed by the smoother yellow rice. It hardly needs saying that Sophie’s is a great value. All the daily main dishes are 7 dollars and almost all of the appetizers and side dishes are less than three dollars. There aren’t too many places left in Manhattan where you can get lunch this good, with table service, for about 10 dollars a person. The only catch is that everyone else seems to know this too, as the cafeteria-style takeout line snaking through the front of the restaurant and sometimes out onto the street attests. Don’t be put off by the crowds however: they tend to thin out after 2pm, offering a somewhat more comfortable dining experience and perhaps even a chance to linger over a café con leche. Sophie's Cuban Cuisine, 73 New Street, between Beaver and Exchange Place, 212-809-7755 (Another location can be found at 96 Chambers Street, between Church and Broadway)

Sadly, the Sophie's on Lexington and 40th seems to have veered from the standard. The pernil is way overlarded and camarones in camarones al ajillo, mingy. Cubano is ok. Everything seems to have spent too much time under a heat lamp. I was so hoping for a great Cuban in my neighborhood, but Sophie's is not the place.

 After seeing quite a bit of Sturm und Drang over on Chowhound about Café Zaiya's closure today and the health inspection notice on the door, we went over there to talk with someone in person. We managed to catch the manager as he was closing and locking up for the evening and got the full story. Apparently, Café Zaiya just purchased and installed a new refrigeration unit (to address an old inspection issue from last month) and had to have the machine approved before they could re-open today. It was approved, in the end-although later in the day than they had hoped- and the store will open tomorrow.

Rabbit Redux

2006-03-24 16:38:00
***CONTENT
 Rabbit seems to be undergoing a mini-resurgence in popularity this season, due in no small part to Randy Kennedy's New York Times Magazine piece from March 12. We've read the chatter on the foodie websites recently and have seen the clamoring for information on restaurants that serve the stuff. We do know that I Trulli, Prune, Noodle Pudding, Al Di La, and Barbounia all offer at least one decent bunny dish on their regular menus, but we anticipate more to come in the next few months. Much, much more, as 2006 is shaping up to be another Year of the Rabbit. Contrast this to the situation in contintental Europe, where in many restaurants and food shops, rabbit is more common than chicken-and it's almost always more common than turkey. Even across the Channel, there is lots of rabbit to be had, even in some surprising places such as the pet food aisle. When we go back to visit the UK, we buy Mr. Packets a treat that he can't (yet) find in the US: Rabbit & Game cat food. Waitrose, an upscale British supermarket, makes the best (at least that's the impression we get, as we're not tasting the stuff) version, and at the equivalent of $0.94 per packet, it's about as cheap as beef- or chicken-based foods here. All of this just goes to show how popular rabbit is in other parts of the world-so popular that the surplus winds up in the pet food. Although, another way of looking at it is that we've all been scooped on the latest culinary trend...by a cat.

In Soviet Russia, Joe Trades You

***CONTENT
 Despite its corporate keenness for pre-prepared foods, Trader Joe's is a welcome addition to the city. We have always loved their store-brand baking ingredients, pastas, and cheeses, and have been really eager for the new Union Square outlet to open, if for nothing else than for a chance to get our hands on some Three Buck Chuck for cooking. Since its debut last week, we have stopped in three times, and I'll be honest here: each visit is worse than the last. Wednesday evening's trip (the real capper) featured three entire aisles that were all practically stripped bare. By bare, I mean pre-glasnost USSR bare. Nothing on the shelves except for a few packages of pecans and a bag of kamut flour. That bare. Then there are the lines of shoppers queueing up pushing carts loaded with the few items kept in good supply (cereal, baby spinach, packaged bread, and juices): these lines run around the perimeter of the entire shop at times, adding to the Iron Curtain ambiance. We have great sympathy for long queues-Whole Foods Market has them and has managed to keep them from ruining their business by keeping 20+ cashiers working full-tilt during the shop's busiest hours. Yet Trader Joe's had only 8 cashiers working to clear a line that stretched 2/3 of the way around the shop last night at 9:00. This explains a comment I overheard a woman make to the man behind her in the line: \"I've been waiting here for 15 minutes just to buy a package of soy burgers and some frozen basil. What the hell am I thinking?\" A better question might be: What the hell is Trader Joe's thinking? First week snags are understandable, but shelves should never be as empty as they are on Union Square. Is this all due to errors in planning? Did nobody anticipate that the store would be this busy? I can't imagine that's true-a quick look at Chowhound.com's Manhattan board reveals several weeks worth of anxious anticipation on the part of NYC shoppers. And even if the magnitude of the crowds took the store's management by surprise that first weekend, there is no excuse for not diverting more stock to the Manhattan store, STAT. It almost feels as if the management is playing a waiting game, hoping potential patrons will get frustrated, causing the lines to shrink to the point where the budgeted stock meets the store's demand. Well, color us frustrated. Trader Joe's, you've got two strikes left. Trader Joe's, 142 14th Street (at 3rd Avenue), 212-529-4612

Trader Joe's addition to Union Square has only been disappointing. Each time I have been there the shevles have been bare. And I also tried to go three times so far. I give up. I will go in the summer, when I just happen to be walking past and have a craving for Trader Giotto's frozen pizza or some prepackaged zucchini. But most likely, I will forego their awful vegetable selection and their signature items and head to overpriced whole foods where the vegetables are fresh and the fish won't make me sick, like one package of trader joe's tuna did in the past.

Trader Joe's have been in my area for about 2 years and while the lines have shrunk the stocking of shelves continues to be a problem. It's frustrating but I still continue to go - I'm addicted to certain products. Check out the Slate article - apparently the things you mentioned are a problem at all TJ's.

Excellent find, Ann! It's always nice to have some independent corroboration when you're pointing out faults, especially in a company that you honestly want to see succeed. Rose, I don't know about the fish, but I do have to admit that I like the lettuces at Trader Joe's-bags of baby spinach and arugula for $2 is a pretty welcome change. But I'm with you on the selection at the Union Square shop- all they had in stock on Wednesday night were onions and peaches.

I was scared away from Trader J's by that serpentine line, too. I walked in and then about-faced several times. However, I do think things have quieted down a bit since the initial stampede. (But please keep it hush-hush - I'd hate to precipitate a new rush!) I braved the moderate crush last Thursday at 8:30, and the lines were no worse than Whole Foods. Plus, they've hired more checkers and started an express line, so it really isn't too bad. I didn't wait more than 5 minutes. The stock of produce was still pretty pitiful, but the rest of the shelves were decently stocked. Perhaps I got lucky, but I'm hopeful that this TJ is on its way to becoming a viable grocery option for those of us who live in the neighborhood.

Boca Chica: It All Averages Out
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-03-20 10:48:00
***CONTENT
 All credit to a Latin restaurant that offers as many vegetarian options as Boca Chica does-several main dishes and at least four of the appetizers are herbivore-friendly. The mojitos also are pretty good-if a little heavy on the sugar. As HungryMan, Chopper, and I sat at the bar, checking out the menu, we discussed these positive signs and crossed our fingers that the meal would live up to Boca Chica's promise. And for a while, it did. We ordered the Coco Shrimp and Croquetas de Platanos as appetizers and were all quite happy to sit at our table and nibble as we finished our drinks. The Coco Shrimp were completely enjoyable: dredged in a savory coconut batter and deep fried, these were served with a sweet fruit sauce and a lime wedge. And in this case, it was the lime that made the dish-it added just enough tang to enliven all the other flavors. If I were the chef at Boca Chica, I'd squirt the lime juice on the shrimp myself and not leave this important step to the patrons, as it shouldn't be optional. Our other fried snack of the night, the Croquetas, were perfect tawny marbles of mashed starchy green plantains, served with a minced onion salsa that Boca Chica calls a vinagreta. Frankly, there was 30 times more onion vinagreta on that plate than necessary-when used in the quantities implied by the serving, it was overpoweringly oniony and completely drowned all the subtle plantain flavors in the croquetas themselves. On the other hand, we found that with a dab of the vinagreta about the size of a pencil eraser, all the flavors remained harmoniously intact, and the result was gorgeous. At this point, the meal took several turns for the worse. HungryMan's Pastel de Choclo, a casserole-like dish made with chicken, tomato, golden raisins, olives, and a cornmeal topping smelled absolutely fantastic. We all wanted a taste the minute our server set the plate on the table. But after his first bite, HungryMan's look of disappointment told us all we needed to know. Too little spice and a burnt tomato taste together destroyed any chance of this dish's success. Chopper's main, the Grilled Chicken Breast with Black Beans and Avocado, should have been an easy home run, or at least a base hit. And the wonderful Coco Yams accompanying the chicken again gave us hope. Yet the chicken breast's interior was rubbery and desiccated, and worse, the cardinal sin of chicken cookery was performed to cover the dryness of the meat-the breast was served swimming in a salty lagoon of broth and oil. Moist outside does not mean moist inside. Is anybody really ever fooled by this trick? The Arroz con Camarones I ordered was better, but not much. While the colors of this dish were impressively vibrant, the tastes were not: the shrimp were significantly overcooked and too chewy, many of the peas had shriveled into little green ball-bearings, and the rice was crunchy in parts. It was all too much like bland hospital food that had undergone a department store makeover to tart itself up. Ultimately, I didn't want to eat more than about half of it. The three of us left Boca Chica a little perplexed. Chopper apologized for suggesting the restaurant, HungryMan countered by praising the Coco Shrimp, and I just nodded, seeing both sides. We all agreed that with a menu as small as Boca Chica's, the food ought to be quite a bit better-the chefs have taken on quite a challenge in selecting dishes from several very different Latin traditions, but the small scale of the endeavor makes this seem managable. So why aren't the entrées up to scratch? Some of the problems-dry chicken, overcooked shrimp and peas, crusty rice-are clearly due to lack of attention and care in preparation: a kitchen issue. But others such as underspicing and mismatched flavor ratios in the croquetas are early-phase problems whose solutions demand a little rethinking on the part of the chef. It's an evaluation worth doing though-there is no reason why Boca Chica shouldn't offer a caliber of food that matches its ambitious pan-Latin menu and thoroughly decent drinks. Boca Chica, 131 1st Street (at 1st Avenue), 212-473-0108

I had fried plantains filled with stewed meat and good friend had steak all with rice and beans. first of all, the gratis plantain chips were just a pile of salt with a cold \"dipping sauce\" of refried (canned?) beans. My dish was alright (repeat, just alright, not too oily but didn't have any love) and my friend's dish tasted boring. i would say, cut the prices in half and then i would go again. i still prefer flor's kitchen or that arepa place on 7th.

The NYC Dairy Time Bomb

***DATE
2006-03-16 17:53:00
***CONTENT
 We have often wondered why dairy products get two expiration dates here: one for New York City, and one for the rest of the world. Often, the in-city date is a full two or three days earlier than the out-of-city date, which is a pretty significant discrepancy in the life of a quart of half-and-half. Does milk spoil faster in the five boroughs than it does elsewhere? Yes and no. Thanks to a recent Ask Metafilter post, we found that the ever-reliable Florence Fabricant actually tackled this question in the New York Times way back in 1982. It turns out that NYC has its own rules and dairy dating systems, rules that require shops to stop selling fluid dairy products four days (96 hours) after 6:00 a.m. on the day they were pasteurized, instead of a more common 6-10 day window used in other places. Dairies that sell within the city as well as to other nearby locations double-mark their products-hence the baffling date stamps. The rationale behind the short sale span is simple: sometimes dairy products are left out on the sidewalk in front of stores or are left unrefrigerated in grocery delivery trucks for significant periods of time. Here's our take: if you purchase your dairy products from a 24-hour corner store or major chain grocery (places where someone is always around to accept delivery shipments) and bring it home right away, you are likely to have avoided any extended period of non-refrigeration and might want to use the later date as your guide. If, on the other hand, you choose to have your dairy products delivered to your door (as many New Yorkers do), you should probably pay attention to the earlier date. But keep in mind that those dates are the sell-by dates and not the consume-by dates; as Flo Fab writes, you can usually still drink your milk for a few days to a few weeks after the expiration date, as long as it is kept cold and sealed. But if it stinks, pitch it.

Is Malloreddus-Pasta's Missing Link?
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-03-15 05:20:00
***CONTENT
 Just when we thought we'd seen every shape of pasta Italy has to offer, Sardinia went and surprised us. We ran across a bag of four-flavor Is Malloreddus (or Sardinian gnocchetti) at Balducchi's this weekend and immediately stopped to get a closer look. Striated along their length and tinted with tomato, spinach, and saffron, the pasta pieces look decidedly, well...worm-like. According to La Casa Del Grano's website, the distinctive vermiform shape traditionally comes from rolling the pasta between the fingers and then against the side of a straw basket-think gnocchi, only much narrower. Never ones to shy away from unusual noodles, HungryMan and I began plotting and planning how to prepare these. A little research revealed that Is Malloreddus are at once more and less exotic than you might think. First, there is apparenly only one place on Earth where these are produced commercially: Sardinia. That qualifies them as a speciality food in my book. There are also several sizes, ranging from very tiny (orzo-sized) to large (rigatoni-sized), although all of them look conspicuously grub-like. At the same time, they're made of regular semolina dough, so they cook the same way as any other typical pasta does, which made it a little easier to build a new recipe around them. In the end, we took one of our favorite sauces, a butter and sage sauce with fresh pecorino romano, and added butternut squash and pine nuts to give a little sweetness and crunch. This is a fantastic sauce that we make all the time-it is very simple and can be made in a hurry. You can also add extra ingredients to it: a clove or two of minced garlic towards the end of cooking, poppy seeds, green peas, even smoked salmon. We find that it works best with smallish pieces of pasta such as cavatelli, radiatore, or orecchiette-anything that, like the malloreddus, has a few dents or ridges to collect cheese and butter. One final note on this recipe: sift through your malloreddus before you boil them, as we found several incorrectly sorted pieces of larger pasta in the bag, pieces that take much longer to cook than the little ones, and there's nothing worse than an uncooked noodle, even if it is bathed in sage. Malloreddus with Butternut Squash, Sage, and Pine Nuts 250 g. (about 1/2 lb.) Is Malloreddus (Sardinian gnocchetti) 15 large sage leaves, washed and pressed dry 3-4 tablespoons butter 1/4 cup pine nuts 1 cup diced, cooked butternut squash (steamed, baked, or boiled) 3/4 cup grated pecorino romano cheese salt and pepper Boil malloreddus for 10 minutes in a gallon of very salty water. As pasta is cooking, prepare sauce. In a large saucepan, melt butter on medium-low heat. Bruise sage leaves and add to melted butter along with pepper and salt. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. When butter begins to brown, add butternut squash and pine nuts and cook until butter turns golden brown (this may only take a minute or two). Remove from heat. Drain pasta when it is fully cooked, and toss into saucepan with butter-sage mixture. Add pecorino romano cheese and stir to mix well. Serve topped with a small mound of pecorino romano cheese. Serves 3 (or 2 hungry people). 2006 nycnosh.com

Vosges Black Pearl Chocolate Bar and the $6 Lesson

2006-03-13 03:23:00
***CONTENT
 Chocolate has apparently gotten so complicated that we need instructions for how to eat it. Or, at least that's what the Vosges company seems to want you to think. Granted, the Black Pearl Bar we purchased from Balducchi's does contain a few unusual and exotic ingredients: ginger, wasabi, and black sesame seeds. But it's not as if this candy bar has multiple moving parts or a satellite navigation system; it's chocolate. I do understand what Vosges is trying to do though-they want to help you understand precisely how their product is superior to other chocolates. Why? Well, perhaps because one 3.4 ounce bar costs $5.99. Even following their strict protocol for looking, smelling, snapping, and tasting the chocolate, the results aren't spectacular. HungryMan and I purchased the bar because we both love ginger and wasabi and thought they'd partner beautifully with dark chocolate-in the case of the ginger, this is true. But there's almost no wasabi to be tasted or smelled here. I tried several times, but couldn't pick up even a little hint of the stuff. The black sesame seeds, on the other hand are a perfect addition, giving the chocolate a very gentle crunch. The dark chocolate itself is entirely decent, but I'd be willing to bet that the mysterious disappearing wasabi flavor would reappear if the chocolate were upped from 55% cacao to around 70%. Then there's the troubling issue of the powder mounds in the photograph on the box: Any company that refers to its product as 'haut chocolat' probably ought to be using fresh wasabi and ginger in its candy, not attenuated, pulverized ingredients. And it's not as if the fresh approach hasn't been taken already. Take Dolfin's ginger chocolate bar as an example. The grated ginger there is evident in every bite but never comes close to overwhelming the senses. Add to that the fact that even including the different bar sizes, Dolfin's bar comes out to an equivalent cost of about $4.40- about 25% cheaper than the vastly inferior Vosges candy. There's a lesson to be learned here, and unfortunately, it has nothing to do with the instructions on the back of the Black Pearl Bar's box.

I bought this bar last year along with two others. While I applaud the interesting ingredient mix, it just didn't didn't deliver the zazz I was hoping for. I was, however, amused by the instructions and eve took a photo of the text: http://www.typetive.com/candyblog/images/vosgesdirections.jpg (feel free to use it on your site) I too had a hard time detecting the wasabi. Of the three I tried (Naga and Aztec being the others), I really liked the Aztec bar, however, now that I've found a few other chili bars, I think I prefer the Dagoba for both taste and of course price. (BTW - I really enjoy your candy reviews.)

Thanks for the comment, cybele. Sounds like we're on the same page about the Vosges bar. We'll have to try the Dagoba chili chocolate; neither of us has tasted that yet.

So glad you wrote that. I was given a bar of the Oaxaca and was puzzled by the enormous amount of text. Why the instructions?? Yeah, i get that one is supposed to savor good chocolate, but I'd do that anyway! Btw, Nosher, your site is terrific and I love your Chowhound postings as well. Thank you!

I wonder if the instructions aren't meant to differentiate the eating experience as something more than a snack. No matter the reason, it still comes off as condescending. Thanks also for the kind words, Brownie!

How funny, i just bought this bar of chocolate last weekend myself-albeit from the Vosges shop in Soho. I really like the Aztec bar (as well as the hot chocolate version) and I've tried that one many times, so I figured I'd try something with a different element of \"zing\" in it. I actually like the subtlety of the flavors-I did make out a hint of wasabi on my palate. However, I agree that the 6 bucks is rather steep. As to all the writing-I tend to ignore the hogwash on most labels-except for the ingredient list/nutrition table-I think a food product is best judged without reading the BS a marketer was paid to write.

could not agree with nosher more: vosges bars are utterly disappointing -not even a hint of the flavors advertised. my advice if you want fabulous exotic and vibrantly flavored new york chocolate bars: chocolate moderne grapefruit, havana heat and pear bars. strong bold flavors made here in NYC daily!! chocolate moderne also has DIVINE lychee flavored filled chocolates. other excellent flavored chocolate bars (dolfin is okay but the chocolate quality is lacking...): jacques torres (aztec and caramelized pistachio) and richard donnelly -- award winning from santa cruz. call him and find out what flavors he has made. i can vouch for lavender, chipotle pistachio and cardamom. SO BOLD, fresh and fabulous!!! totall worth shipping.

Thank you, I too thought Vosges was overhyped. I don't know why they got so much Valentine's Day press. For $6 a bar, much better chocolate can be had, like Valrhona.

I too bought into the Vosges hype and was totally disappointed, I bought the wasabi and chipotle pepper bars for my boyfriend. But I felt moved to comment because Dolphin chocolate, on the other hand, is incredible. Their Pink Peppercorn chocolate bar is the only chocolate I've ever hunted down on the internet.

Tastings Among the Tenements: Thor
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-03-12 03:14:00
***CONTENT
 Looking up from our table at Thor last week, Nosher and I noticed an uninterrupted view of a decidedly New York City cityscape: a brightly lit series of tenement fire escapes just on the other side of the restaurant’s expansive back skylight. It was a vertiginous and disorienting view, as if we had stumbled onto the backstage of Rent– and it’s a view that contrasts both with Thor’s other-wordly interior and earthbound cooking, the latter with obligatory references not just to Hapsburgian Delikatessen (chef and owner Kurt Gutenbrunner also owns German accented Wallse and Café Sabarsky) but also, unexpectedly, to France and Italy. We were there with our friends Schnicksy and Pescatore, happily liberated for the evening by a babysitter. Fortunately, they did not have to venture far, as our friends count themselves among the lucky many increasingly calling the burgeoning culinary mecca of the Lower East Side their home. Thor occupies a strange territory in this world, one that juxtaposes slick glass architecture and still-grotty street scenes, and it barely manages to pull the trick off, as Pescatore commented when we walked from the soggy, grey street through the building's white entrance tunnel and into the leather-appointed bar area looking out to the street. We were there for an early dinner and the complete absence of other diners made the bar look more like an airport lounge circa 2050 than a comfortable and convivial place for drinks. Happily, my espresso martini had enough kick to make me forget the upholstery and bring me back to 2006. Once Nosher and Schnicksy arrived and we found our table, our server and menus launched us into disorienting orbits all over again. With a studiedly casual manner and perfectly disheveled hair, our waiter could have walked straight out of an episode of The O.C.. And the menu he handed us prompted too many questions: with so many categories (cold plates to start, warm plates in the middle, dishes from the market, hot plates), were we supposed to order two courses or three? Where were the main courses? Would a restaurant named after a Norse god serve tapas? (On this last point, we soon discovered that any link to mythology is pure coincidence; 'Thor' is an acronym based on the name of the venue: The Hotel on Rivington.) In the end, we ordered a little bit of everything, although our plates ended up with more surf than turf. I started with the foie gras terrine, which turned out to be one of the better choices of the night. Smooth and gamey, the duck liver paired nicely with slices of poached bartlett pears and a lemon and fig reduction. Smallish even for an appetizer, it was gone in an instant, which made giving little tastes to our dining companions tricky. But not all of our starters were worth sharing: both Nosher’s Bibb lettuce salad and Pescatore’s black squid pasta were oversalted in the extreme-don’t get me wrong: we love salt and have been known to point out where there needs to be more of it (see our recent reviews of Levain and Buttercup Bake Shop). But it is also possible to use too much salt. In Thor's case, we started to think that someone in the kitchen might be trying to escape a run of bad luck by throwing the stuff over every shoulder.The pumpkin seed vinaigrette on the salad should have been a delicate counterpoint to the greens, but the seeds were dusted with salt and the entire mass was liberally sprinkled with fleur de sel, making the whole thing impossible to eat without frequent sips of water. Nosher's salad also suffered from being an entire head of Bibb lettuce served on a tiny plate, which forced him into contortions in an attempt to eat it. Pescatore's pasta was actually an order of magnitude more salty than Nosher's salad; Pescatore, who rarely complains, said he could barely taste the squid and scallops, let alone the other ingredients in the dish. And what a shame-the presentation and aromas made this seem like the most promising thing we ordered to begin our meal. Schnicksy’s beet terrine was better, certainly less salted, and beautifully presented. Goat cheese, beets and a hint of horseradish combined in a smooth swirl of flavors alternately sweet and savory, if a little one-dimensional. A brush stroke of beet reduction sped across the plate, echoing presentations at fellow Lower East Sider WD-50. A crisp wafer of beet teetered on top of the terrine slice, and from the other side of the plate came texture in the form of a jumble of peppery mache. When it came time for our main courses, I ordered a sweetbread and spinach spaetzle special, in the process quietly horrifying our mostly vegetarian (well, pescatarian) friends. The dish was about twice as large as anyone else’s and this fact, in combination with my usual chattiness, left me eating after everyone else had finished. I wanted to like my entrée-sweetbreads are a favorite of mine and are far too rare at New York restaurants, but, like our appetizers, it was completely, disastrously oversalted, blotting out the delicate flavors of the organ meats and the pillowy soft spaetzle. Nosher enjoyed his brook trout well enough, though not nearly as much as he had hoped, finding it both a little greasy and smallishly portioned. The fish was exceptionally fresh, however, and sat in a creamed spinach purée, dotted with tart caperberries. Schnicksy’s red snapper was better: steamed to just tender and, while its green sauce looked similar to the spinach from Nosher’s trout, it was a traditional basil pesto. Underneath, it managed to hide a good number of artichoke pieces and little neck clams in its multiple folds. Schnicksy declared this a good choice-and Nosher (who normally does not like red snapper very much) agreed. For his part, Pescatore lived up to his name and ordered the lobster from the 'Hot Plates' section of the menu. This was a half lobster, poached and removed from its shell, then topped with a rich Bernaise sauce, bing cherries, and fava beans. The combination of fruit and creamy sauce was an inspired idea: mixing colors, textures, and sweet with savory. A pity, then, that the portion size was more appetizer than main course. We were lucky that we took our server up on his suggestion that we order a small bowl of special quark (a low-fat white pure curd cheese) spaetzle- those of us left a little peckish after our mains nibbled at it before dessert. I liked it despite the fact that its taste bore a very strong resemblance to boxed macaroni and cheese. After a meal of small plates, we required few entreaties to order dessert. We opted for two desserts: twin kumquat dumplings, fried crisp like elephant ears sidled up to an equally intense scoop of kumquat-infused ice cream, and Thor’s deconstructed 'Snickers' bar. Here, finally, was where Thor acquitted itself well. The two plates worked wonderfully in perfect counterpoint to one another and could not have been more different-Pescatore and I happily see-sawed back and forth between the two desserts, moving from gooey, nutty, and fudgey 'Snickers' to refreshingly tart kumquat and back again until Nosher and Schnicksy caught on far too late and asked where the two desserts had gone. Walking back out through the white tunnel in the foyer and wandering into the night, we chatted about the meal. We agreed that Thor seems to be very much a product of its time and place. It seems perfectly positioned to appeal to wealthy Lower East Side scenesters in search of an exclusive-feeling bar and a self-consciously complicated menu. But for us, the pretty pricey food (appetizers were in the teens and mains were in the 20s) and too-often careless cooking left us feeling as if a night at Thor is a bit of a gamble. We'd much rather just sit with a drink and take in that sodium-lit urban vista out back than battle with sodium in our dinner. Thor, 107 Rivington Street (at Ludlow Street), 646-253-6700

Hi Alexia. I can't be certain, since we ate that dessert nine months ago, but I think it was a fudge brownie (with a crumbled cookie base). You'll have to contact Thor to get the details, but I'm pretty sure they'll tell you. Good luck! Nosher

Birth of a Nosher: New Wonton Garden
***AUTHOR

2006-03-09 09:39:00
***CONTENT
 Here is where it all began. Like Peter Parker's radioactive spider bite, my first meal at New Wonton Garden almost 20 years ago is what transformed me into Nosher. And it was all thanks to a friend of mine who could only afford to live in Manhattan by renting an apartment on Bayard Street. That summer, I made a habit of taking the train up from my depressing laboratory internship in New Jersey and spent almost every night in New York with my friend and her seven rescued street cats. We drank a lot of Pinot Grigio and resolved one evening to undertake a block-by-block quest to find the best food in Chinatown. That, by far, was the best part of my entire summer, and the turning point was the night of my first visit to New Wonton Garden. I say my because my friend was still in classes when I arrived late that afternoon, but I could not hold out for her. So, not wanting to spoil our methodical plans (I think we were moving west from Eldridge Street at that point), I decided to walk into Little Italy for a bite to eat. But then I saw the crowd inside New Wonton Garden and did a double-take when I realized that the kitchen appeared to be inside the dining area. I gawked as I figured out that the restaurant was (and is today) just one large, irregularly shaped room. But most importantly, it was absolutely packed. I saw diners being seated at tables where other people already sat eating-chairs and table space were at such premiums that patrons seemed happy just to have a place to sit. I had never seen anything like it. How could I settle for overcooked gnocchi when such a place stood beckoning? So I went in, vowing to hide my secret from my absent friend. The minute I sat down though, I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my discovery from her. I sat among fifty or sixty very happy looking diners, all chattering away in Chinese, all eating from their melamine plates and bowls with real gusto. The man seated to my left (at my four-top table) looked over at me and gave me a huge grin, handed me a menu, and said, \"Order anything, just don't order from the last page. That's for the tourists,\" then called over the waiter and reported to him what he had told me. The waiter confirmed this, saying, \"Last page is for people who don't like Chinese food.\" I thanked both of them and couldn't resist the temptation-I peeked at the last page and laughed out loud when I saw it was labeled Chef's Suggestions. I think it's an ironic use of the term \"suggestions.\" I have almost no idea what I ordered that evening, because that first meal started my second internship of the summer, this one at the hands of the cooks at New Wonton Garden, one that took me through at least fifty of the dishes on the menu and planted the seed of a real passion for food. Fortunately, the average price of dishes is about $5.00, and it was equivalently inexpensive then as well, making this kind of culinary exploration possible for two teenagers. While I can't recreate that first experience today, despite the fact that the menu has remained almost wholly unchanged, I do know for certain that I ordered the Fried Bean Curd With Special Sauce ($4.15). I know this because from that point on, I ordered it just about every time I went to New Wonton Garden. Almost 20 years later, this is still the case. When HungryMan and I take friends to dinner here, we warn them in advance that one dish of the meal has been pre-determined: the tofu. Nobody has ever complained. Cut into chunky cubes, very lightly battered, and fried rapidly, this dish always arrives at the table blisteringly hot. It takes serious willpower to let it cool for a few minutes, so when we can, we order this while we're looking at the menu, so that by the time we've placed our orders, the tofu has cooled enough to (just barely) avoid burns. But it's best when it's still hot. The dipping sauce is a scallion, soy, and black vinegar combination that showcases the tofu's natural sweetness. I also enjoy the tofu sprinkled with a little salt and a tiny dot of chili-garlic sauce from the bottle on the table. We have eaten fried tofu in dozens of restaurants in New York City (in 3 boroughs, even) and this version remains our clear favorite. In part, this is probably due to the proximity of the kitchen: the tofu never has a chance to get cold. On a recent visit with Chopper, HungryMan and I also ordered the Steamed Cantonese Roast Pork Buns ($1.65), which were spongy, rich, and still tacky from the steamer. For a long time, these were also sold frozen in the deli cases at the front of the restaurant, but now they have been replaced with the much trendier (but also excellent) shumai. Another of my personal favorite appetizers is the very unusual Turnip in Oyster Sauce ($3.65), which is large enough to be eaten as a main dish. The sauce tastes of Five Spice Powder and soy, and the turnip pieces are incredibly tender. Wonton Garden's noodles are another of its specialties: bowls of noodle soup, 'macaroni dishes', noodle casseroles, and Cantonese lo meins are all on offer. HungryMan and Chopper both ordered lo mein dishes after I reassured them both that the New Wonton Garden version is genuine, true lo mein: it is not stir-fried, and it does not contain the thick, bucatini-wide noodles that most American lo meins do. Instead, thin noodles (similar to Singapore noodles or Japanese soba noodles) are cooked in broth and mixed with other ingredients, while the soup broth is served on the side. HungryMan ordered the Noodles Stewed with Sweet & Sour Deep Fried Chicken ($5.50), another atypical turn that resembles crispy French goujons of chicken, just barely sauced, rather than the drenched, overly-sweet nuggets most of us are used to seeing in the US. Chopper got a little spendy and ordered the Noodles Stewed with Jumbo Shrimp & Vegetables ($7.55), which featured 7 or 8 very large pink shrimp sautéed together with Chinese kale and a light oyster sauce. Both are fantastic dishes, ones that benefit immensely from a short trip to the table. Cantonese lo mein dries out just as any pasta does, so it is important to keep in mind something that we forgot: eat the noodles immediately and save conversation for later. Alternatively, you can opt for one of the many soup noodle dishes on the menu or select one of the cast iron casserole dishes, as I did. My Seafood with Rice Noodles in Casserole ($6.15) came to the table on an 8\" square trivet of wood that served to keep the iron casserole from burning the plate and the table beneath. The unusual presentation is necessary, as the cast iron pot sits directly in the stove flames while the dish is cooking. When removed, it is probably several hundred degrees Fahrenheit: hence the long-handled spoon that accompanies the dish. My favorite part of these casseroles is the little chewy scrolls of rice noodles, most of which end up at the bottom of the pot. They absorb much of the cooking liquid and swell up like little rolls of paper towels. The seafood casserole I ate on this visit also offered a really satisfying contrast of textures with the soft noodles, the crunchy carrot pieces, and the fleshy squid, shrimp, and fish balls. The Braised Lamb & Rice Noodle Casserole (also $6.15) is another good (and very surprising) bet in this category. Congees that rival (and in some cases, surpass) those at Congee Village are also on the menu at New Wonton Garden. Our favorite is the Rice Soup with Fresh Fish Meat ($4.35) that always contains good-sized hunks of shredded fish- whatever is fresh in the restaurant. Don't be afraid to ask for recommendations, either. The staff is not uniformly fluent in English, but every one of them is friendly and willing to help. I can't guarantee you an education on the order of the one I received from them, but work with them, ask for lots of advice, and whatever you do, don't order from that last section on the back page of the menu...no matter what it's called.

Hi Nosher, I'm a fan of your website, and I decided to try New Wonton Garden based on your rave review. I must agree about the tofu - fresh, crisp, tasty, must be given some time to cool off. I also got the lo mein with mushrooms, and while it was good (I love chinese mushrooms), I may prefer the big noodles like the ones served at New Green Bo. My friend ordered sesame chicken from the last page (I should've probably warned her), which is probably why we were subjected to some brusque service. Next time I might try one of the soups or casseroles, those looked good. Thank you for the suggestion!

Marseille and the Minty-Fresh Archives

***CONTENT
 Here is our dilemma: we visited Marseille more than a few weeks ago with our lovely friend Lady Film Editor, promptly put all of our notes and images onto a CD, and then dropped and scratched it. Badly. All was lost, or so we thought. Then, thanks to a brilliant Heloise-inspired Lifehacker post, we Aquafreshed our way to a readable disc. But in the meantime, Marseille has changed their menu so much that only two of the dishes we ate are still listed as regular options (some may reappear as specials, of course). What to do? We debated the merits of making a post for historical interest and came to the conclusion that we ought to post something about our visit, if only because it then allows us to say that we are very happy that they have changed the menu. This does not mean that we did not enjoy anything we ate. HungryMan's foie gras with grilled toast batons was smokey and very smooth, tasting rich without being too fatty on the palate. His hangar stake was also a real treat, served with very crispy, thinly-sliced shallots. Marseille, like most good French bistros, can always be counted on to prepare its steaks to an extremely high standard, and that alone is reason enough to add it to your roster of solid Midtown restaurants for a pre-theatre dinner or lunch. Its desserts are also very good- far better than at its Hell's Kitchen sister restaurant Pigalle. On this most recent visit, the three of us shared the mango-cardamom panacotta with berries and two crisp Alexander Calder-esque triangles of ginger pastry. Not only was the presentation gorgeous, the tastes were also balanced and very fresh- not an easy accomplishment for a winter dessert that features tropical flavors so prominently. This is also one of the dishes that remains on the menu. Bravo. But almost everything else we ordered had minor or major problems. Lady Film Editor's skate looked lovely and possessed the kind of crunchy, golden crust that home cooks dream of being able to achieve. However, the love affair ended there; the whole grain Dijon sauce took the tastes in one direction, while the sautéed spinach and green apple pieces underneath the fish pulled and yanked them in a different direction. It was like Kramer vs. Kramer on a plate, and we all know who wins in a divorce. That's right: nobody. Certainly not the skate. Another seafood choice, the tuna nicoise salad, was the night's biggest disappointment. First, the serving was small. It would have been better off in the Appetizers section of the menu. Second, there was far too much tuna and not enough salad-it resembled a nicoise-inspired carpaccio more than a salad, even one that is traditionally served without lettuce. Finally, the chopped green peppers were unpleasantly floral and tasted a bit mushy. We all liked the finely chopped egg and the few (very few) black olives bobbing around on the plate, but not enough, as even our little portion went unfinished. Although this dish is still offered on the menu, we're hoping that at the very least, the quality of the peppers improves. Despite the mediocrity of this meal, we still hold out hope that it is just an aberration for Marseille, an establishment that has historically been one of our local recommended eateries. The restaurant has so many assets: its swish décor, its outdoor seating that makes it one of the few places in the area where diners can enjoy an al fresco meal, and its decent, if unadventurous wine list. With so much going for it, there is no reason why Marseille should be serving merely satisfactory food, which brings us back to the menu changes, alterations that we truly hope will bring about real improvements. Our plan is to revisit soon and update this post, and we'll keep the toothpaste ready, just in case. Marseille, 630 9th Avenue (at 44th Street), 212-333-2323

I've never eaten food at Marseille and your experience doesn't make me want to try it (with so many great options in the area), but I did have drinks there not too long ago and I can tell you one thing I was very dissatisified with: the bar service-some of the most unfriendly I've ever had in all my years in NYC. Nothing turns the taste of food and drink bad than nasty negative staff.

Garish and Delicious: Bagna Cauda Canary Mushroom Flounder
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-03-05 06:00:00
***CONTENT
 Canary mushrooms (also known as yellow oyster mushrooms) might be the most dramatic fungus in the supermarket, but that's not why they're my new favorite. You'd be excused for getting a little distracted by their appearance-even the smallest clump of them looks more like a forested meteorite than something you'd be likely to choose for dinner. Their Van Gogh color scheme might also make you want to stare at them rather than eat them, but that would be a huge mistake- their secret is that they taste nutty, mellow, and very slightly sweet. In order to preserve their visual appeal, I like to cut them with a very sharp chef's knife into half-inch thick slices, just as I would cut a loaf of bread. The resulting irregular discs still retain both stalks and the meaty substrate and are ideal for quick-searing. It is important to note that canary mushrooms (and oyster mushrooms in general) can become bitter if they are sautéed for a very long time, so I prefer to cook them just until they are golden-brown and crispy and then remove them from the heat to be added back to a dish later. The recipe for Bagna Cauda Canary Mushroom Flounder that follows uses this very technique to preserve the texture and taste of canary mushrooms. While I do admit that their brilliant yellow color fades a bit with cooking, some is preserved in the stalks when the pieces are pan-fried quickly. Plus, the tawny crust and unusual shapes of the slices add even more visual interest. If you worry about losing too much of the original color in cooking, you can save the pieces that fall off of the clump as you slice it and add these raw bits back as a garnish to your finished dish. Personally, I prefer to toss these little crumbs back into the pan, as they add a richness to the sauce; but the choice is yours. A few other notes about this recipe: It takes its inspiration from the classic Italian bagna cauda, a rich and savory dip made with anchovies, olive oil, butter, and garlic. Rather than prepare a separate sauce and add it to the flounder and mushrooms at the end, I've come up with a way to make the bagna cauda on the fly, as the rest of the ingredients are cooking. It's not a purist's version of the sauce-I have added vermouth and rosemary to it- but the fundamental tastes remain very similar to those of the original. Be very careful not to burn the garlic in this dish-if you do, it will become bitter and acrid and will ruin everything-if you think that your garlic is in danger of burning, you can add a tablespoon or two of white wine to cool down the pan. Also, don't omit the anchovies; you might be tempted to do so, but they dissolve into the olive oil and butter and lend a real fullness of flavor to the dish. If you do opt to leave out the anchovies, you can add a pinch of salt in their place, but really, just take the plunge. Finally, if you've never seen a canary mushroom cluster before, you can find them now at Garden of Eden Market on 14th Street, as well as all three Whole Foods Markets in Manhattan (where they are called yellow oyster mushrooms) for about $10-$13 a pound. Even if you don't plan on cooking with them, just stop and stare a little-they are mesmerizing. Bagna Cauda Canary Mushroom Flounder 1/2 lb. (225 g.) cluster of canary/yellow oyster mushrooms (one large piece, if possible), cut into 1/2-inch slices 1 1 lb. (450 g.) flounder fillet (sole, whiting, ocean perch will also work well) 3 tablespoons olive oil 1.5 tablespoons butter (salted is fine) 2 teaspoons fresh rosemary, finely chopped 2 cloves garlic, crushed 2 salted anchovy fillets (or equivalent amount of anchovy paste) 2-4 tablespoons vermouth or other white wine 1 cup roughly chopped italian flat-leaf parsley salt and pepper Heat olive oil and butter together over medium to medium-high heat in a frying pan or skillet until butter is dissolved and oil begins to pop gently. Add canary mushroom slices and cook until golden-brown on both sides. Remove slices and drain on paper towels. Keep mushroom slices warm in a very low oven until they are needed. Add rosemary to oil-butter mixture. On medium heat, pan-fry flounder fillet on its skin-side (if it still retains the skin) first, seasoning the top side with pepper and a very small amount of salt. When the fish is ready to be flipped, add crushed garlic to the pan. Cook flounder until it is lightly browned and just barely cooked completely through. Remove flounder, add flat-leaf parsley to the pan, and deglaze with vermouth, stirring until all the crusty bits from the bottom of the pan become dislodged into the sauce. Place mushrooms around and on top of the flounder, and drizzle sauce over both. Serves 3 (or 2 hungry people). 2006 nycnosh.com

You Can Get With This, Or You Can Get With That: The Half King

***CONTENT
 Your first clue that The Half King is not your prototypical Irish-style \"literary pub\" is the fact that it is named after a wily and obscure eighteenth century Native American leader. But the name is evocative and poetic-echoing the hybrid status of the bar itself as a pub in a city where smoking is banned and Guinness is a mutual fund company. Then of course, there's the food: The Half King has complete dinner and lunch menus that feature traditional bar fare, such as french fries, nachos, and potato skins, as well as some decidely non-pub-grubby selections like salads, wraps, and tofu dishes. If you're wondering what kind of writer might be at home in such a place, there is an easy answer: Sebastian Junger, The Perfect Storm author and journalist, is one of The Half King's co-owners. While we did not run into him on a visit this weekend, we did see several patrons reading, which is the kind of thing that the bar probably encourages. But we weren't at The Half King to snoop into other people's reading habits or to search for celebrities, we were there for a meet-up with our friend Lunchlady, in part to celebrate the publication of a glowing article about her and her website in Sunday's Washington Post. So we parked ourselves at a table at the rear of the dining room-trying to distance ourselves as much from the frigid winds blowing outside-and ordered drinks and dinner. In all fairness, we should warn you that we didn't drink heavily, which is of course one of the allures of eating dinner at a bar. Instead, we temperately stuck with a cup of tea, a pint of Kronenbourg 1664 (mystifyingly misspelled on both the printed menus and the bar's website), and a glass of French Sauvignon Blanc. The Half King has more than a dozen beers, ciders, and ales on tap, encompassing the entire spectrum from Strongbow Cider to Guinness Stout, as well as a small but decent choice of wines on offer by the glass or bottle. And the best thing about The Half King's own neither-nor vibe is that there is no pressure to order something macho or Irish-anything goes. In this same spirit, HungryMan and I decided to throw caution to the wind and do something dangerous: order a salad in a pub. Normally, I like to use caesar salads as a litmus test of a kitchen's mastery of good prepwork and division of labor; most head chefs never touch salads, so it's also a good indicator of how skilled the staff (as a whole) is. However, in a bar or a pub, I generally don't even try- the stakes are different, and sometimes kitchen workers are not actual trainee cooks, but repurposed bar workers. But The Half King seemed ambitious and frankly, different, so the three of us ordered the day's special onion ring appetizer and a caesar salad. While it looked nice, the salad wasn't good: it was dressed in something very tart that tasted and looked like nothing much more than sherry vinegar. No anchovies in sight, nothing creamy, just lettuce, cheese, and croutons. While all the romaine was fresh and the parmesan shavings were good, this wasn't really a caesar salad as much as sour lettuce with croutons and cheese. Disappointing, but hardly surprising. By contrast, the onion rings were fantastic. Very crispy, very hot, and very thin, these sweet slices of red onion were coated in a peppery batter and then fried en masse, so that eating them required a fork and at least a ream of napkins. The dipping sauce was another hybrid creature, tasting like a combination of tartar sauce and thousand island dressing, but it was unctuous in all the right ways and did a nice job of cutting the sweetness of the onions. HungryMan couldn't get enough onions that night and ordered his Sirloin Burger topped with some of the sautéed variety as well as a few slices of swiss cheese. Hands-down, this was the best thing we ate at The Half King: the burger was juicy, cooked exactly to order, and its glossy brioche bun made even vegetarian-leaning Lunchlady envious. It even compensated for the lackluster french fries, which were a bit dry and starchy- only edible bathed in ketchup or the leftover onion ring dip. I was grateful to see that the Salmon Crabcake Burger (which Lunchlady also ordered) came served on a toasted brioche bun, and even happier when I saw that the patty appeared to consist mostly of fish and crabmeat, not filler. Studded with capers and diced red peppers, the burger offered up huge chunks of salmon in almost every bite and was too much for me to finish. The patty could have used a little more flavoring (fresh herbs, garlic, spicier peppers, perhaps?), but on the whole, it was a satisfying if unusual sandwich. Of course, there are more standard bar offerings on the menu, such as Shepherd's Pie Casserole, Fish & Chips, and steak. But really, how could we not have ordered a mix-and-match burger (and a salad) at an Irish-inspired pub/restaurant named after the person who kick-started the French and Indian War? Our advice is just to embrace the schizo flavor of the place, order a drink, and perhaps sit and read a book while you eat-no pressure to read Joyce, though. Whatever you've got will do just fine. The Half King, 505 West 23rd Street (at 10th Avenue), 212-462-4300

Mind The Baby: The King Cake

***CONTENT
 Fat Tuesday is this week, but we’re suffering through a spate of sub-zero temperatures that only serve to remind us how unlikely we are to see colorful costumes and bead-strewn parades down Fifth Avenue. Plus, we are a good 1,500 miles away from New Orleans, where celebrations are noticeably more sedate than usual. So what's a New Yorker in a festive mood to do? One good option- and our favorite Mardi Gras tradition by a longshot- is accessible to those without the werewithal to buy a plane ticket to the Big Easy. Better still, it’s a tasty one, too. The King Cake, a braid of sticky, coffee-cake style brioche, iced and sprinkled with carnival colors, is the perfect reminder that even in the dead of winter, there’s always a party somewhere. King Cake Parties are common during Mardi Gras, which officially began on Twelfth Night (January 6) and which ends on Fat Tuesday. So while it's late in the King Cake season, there is still time (and we promise not to tell if you want to celebrate post-Mardi). Nosher has been known to make his own King Cake during past Mardi Gras, but this year we heard that there were excellent cakes on sale at Mara’s Homemade, a Southern/Cajun restaurant in the East Village, so we had to sample one. Mara makes her cakes to order, using all of the requested 24 hours’ notice to give the sweet brioche dough a chance to rise two times. She then braids it with rivers of cinnamon, nutmeg, and unlike in some King Cakes, chopped nuts. The whole thing is formed into a ring, symbolizing unity of faiths, smeared with a moist sugar icing, and then liberally sprinkled with large crystals of purple, green, and gold sugar. These represent, in the language of Mardi Gras, justice, faith, and power, respectively. There’s one more secret to the King Cake, and it’s all in how you slice it. Like the Gateaux des Rois made this time of year in France (and to which the modern King Cake is related), each cake has a small trinket hidden in its folds that sits, waiting to be found by the lucky guest who gets it in his or her slice. The trinket is often a tiny plastic baby that always reminds me not of a baby Jesus, but of my favorite children's book. Some bakers also use a plastic king, a coin, or a bean stuck in through the bottom of the cake after baking (Mara’s uses the traditional plastic baby). But whatever is hidden away in your cake, finding it is supposed to bring the lucky diner good luck for the rest of the year and, depending on tradition, an obligation to buy the next King Cake. Should it be you who finds yourself so obliged however, you could do far worse than to get your next one from Mara’s. Mara’s Homemade King Cake ($25 each), 342 East 6th Street (Between 1st and 2nd Avenues), 212-598-1110. **Note: Mara needs 24-hours lead-time (at least) and makes cakes throughout the year, on demand. Call to see if she'll have any extras on Tuesday.

I was calling all over looking for a King Cake for my Mardi Gras party in September 2006. No one could accomodate me because they were \"not in season\". Finally, I came across this site and not only did I get my King Cake overnighted to me, but it was everything I would have expected in a King Cake; delicious and with baby. Mara went above and beyond to accomodate me on short notice and I would highly recommend her to anyone looking for a King Cake.

 Walk too briskly up 2nd Avenue and you'll miss Blue Owl. Perhaps that's the idea, come to think of it- there's nary a word on the outside of the bar, just a lightbox mounted at foot-level on a tiled wall, glowing blue with the silhouette of a stern-looking owl. In all honesty, the slight edge of creepiness to it is probably there to dissuade you from wandering downstairs if you don't belong. Inside, the space is divided so that surrounding the bar, there is a suprisingly large amount of seating (stools and low-slung tin tables towards the front), and then an odd chair or table scattered around in alcoves and in a small room jutting off from the bar's main space. But the real secret, if it can still be called that, is the narrow VIP 'room' that runs behind and parallel to the bar. It's more of a VIP corridor, in truth, but it does have its charms: a private soundsystem, soft bench seating, and when it's being used as a members-only area, a bouncer and a server of one's own. Don't know the password? Too bad. Hint: it's not 'egalitarian'. We took a peek inside during a press event this past week, and while there, we snapped a companion photo to go with Eater's shot of the room. Ours is taken from the halfway point, looking back towards the entrance of the VIP hallway. Cozy place, actually. We could imagine spending a few hours back here...as long as we could bring along a plate or two of the upscale cold cuts we sampled on our visit. I think we'd have to rename the area though and let in anyone with a taste for cured meats and cheeses. We're thinking the Ham Hallway or the Bresola Bunker, but I wonder what Diddy would have to say. Blue Owl, 196 Second Avenue (between 12th and 13th Streets), 212-505-2583

Dandy Andean at Pomaire
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-02-23 11:09:00
***CONTENT
 If Pomaire were on any other street, it would garner significantly more respect. As it stands, out on the 9th Avenue end of 46th Street, it suffers from guilt by association: association with a block crammed full of middling, uninteresting restaurants. But Pomaire is not one of these. It is not perfect, by any means, but I can't help but wonder if Pomaire wouldn't be more a part of NYC's culinary geography if it were, say, 20 blocks north or south. It is, after all, New York's only Chilean restaurant, as they proudly advertise. Learning this, HungryMan brokered a little dinner date with our good friend Chilena (born and raised south of Santiago), who promised to be our very own dining sherpa on an Andean dinner adventure. Without her, I have to admit, we would have had a much different experience-probably a worse one. In fact, I'll impart some of her good advice to you right away: don't order the Chilean sea bass. Not because it's endangered and overfished- which it is- but because Pomaire's real gems are its homestyle dishes, and not the food it prepares for the pre-theatre crowds. Chilena got us started with a hands-on lesson about the pebre sauce on the table. Pebre, an olive oil based sauce made with mild peppers, vinegar, lime juice, and garlic, has more in common with pesto than it does with salsa. Generally, that surprising connection holds true across most of Chilean cuisine- it is emphatically not about searing, spicy heat, the way Mexican food sometimes is. Instead, it resembles nothing more than Italian or Greek cooking, featuring potatoes, olives, grapes, and wine prominently. My hunch is that some of what keeps Pomaire from really gaining the esteem of New Yorkers is diners' expectations: they go in anticipating what they imagine a South American dinner ought to be (fiery and rice-based), and are shocked to discover that they've been served a Mediterranean-style tomato salad with onions, salt, and olive oil, or a seafood gratin with spuds. The gratin, by the way, is excellent. It features large chunks of fish, shrimp, and scallops in a densely rich tomato-cream sauce, and is held together with a web of gooey strands of melted parmesan cheese. It's even better spooned over a rough segment of the sweet and crusty white rolls served at the beginning of the meal. Another dish we spooned out with shreds of bread was HungryMan's pastel de choclo, a pie/stew chimera made up of chicken, olives, onions, and topped with a crunchy sweet corn crust topping that cracked like a creme brulée when a fork was inserted. Also very good is the cazuela, a traditional stew of short ribs, diced squash, corn-on-the-cob, and potatoes. According to Chilena, there is very little that is more Chilean than this dish. Pomaire's version is spiced with cilantro and parsley, and is extremely filling, thanks to the addition of a scoop of rice to the clay pot in which it is served. However, nothing made our dinner guest more nostalgic than the empanadas; here served as an appetizer, these could easily be eaten as an entrée, as they are the size of a shoe. HungryMan and I, used to Salvadorean or Mexican empanadas, gasped when we saw our order of two portions arrive at the table, covering an entire dinner plate. Even more surprising to us was the filling: composed of minced beef, onions, black olives, boiled eggs, and- wait for it...raisins, we thought these tasted like Greek spiced meat pies, rather than Latin American cooking. And all the better for it- these were everyone's favorite dish of the evening. Not everything at Pomaire was pitch-perfect: the humitas, a Chilean take on the tamale, were probably a little too sweet and reminscent of canned creamed corn, and our dessert trio (pushed hard on us by an overeager waiter) was nothing special, even taking into account the unusual lucuma meringue and the panqueques. Yet on the whole, and with the right guidance, we think we've uncovered a treasure on the so-called 'Restaurant Row'. If you visit Pomaire, approach it like a Mediterranean eatery- just keep thinking of Sicily or Crete- and whatever else you do, don't skip the empanadas. Pomaire, 371 West 46th Street (at 9th Avenue), 212-956-3055

There actually are other Chilean places in NYC, just not in Manhattan. JC & Family in Jackson Heights comes to mind. It’s much less high end than Pomaire, it’s more of a fast food/take out shop. They have a crazy hot dog called the “completo” which comes topped with tomatoes, sauerkraut, mashed avocado and mayonnaise. Yikes, that's complete, alright.

Very interesting. I wonder if Pomaire's management doesn't think of that place in Queens as more of a deli and therefore not as a 'restaurant'. Sounds like it's worth a visit, though.

I just happened to walk by JC & Family this afternoon (surprisingly, I don't live anywhere nearby) and they still had the Chilean menu posted on the wall, but were now advertising a Brazilian buffet with tons of signage and had lots of chafing dish things set up. Very strange.

Invention and Reinvention at Xing

***CONTENT
 Xing has been open for about a year now, but has until recently seemed to us like a puzzling underperformer on its bustling stretch of 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen. By rights, this is where a quirky, neo-Asian bistro with entrées in the mid-teens and an extensive special cocktail menu ought to thrive. But there was that old menu... not bad in theory, but never really very compelling. So when the former chef parted ways with the restaurant and new chef Lulzim Rexhepi (introduced to us as 'Lou') came on the payroll, we hoped for a little change. What we got, as we discovered at a menu relaunch and press event last week, was a massive overhaul of Pimp My Ride proportions. Very little of the old menu remains, and that is a wonderful thing. Xing now has a menu that holds its own against the cocktail list, a menu that is as imaginative as the zany interior it inhabits, a menu with some long overdue panache. Our favorite dishes of the night were the sliced hamachi in mandarin and sweet chili sauce appetizer, an uncooked preparation of soft triangles of white fish that had us and our two table companions wishing for a larger portion. The sauce is pretty peppy, but subtle enough not to overwhelm the flavors of the thin, light-meat slices of yellowtail. And then there were the ribs: two kinds of them. The first was another appetizer of BBQ Chinese Spare ribs, which were at once briny, sweet, and lightly sprinkled in furikake confetti. Some of the most tender pork we've eaten in a long while, these ribs were absolutely gorgeous. They're also the most straightforward Asian dish on the revamped menu. The second appearance of ribs came in the form of the guava poached short rib entrée. Served with a luscious sweet potato purée, this dish encapsulates the modern, fusion approach taken by Chef Rexhepi, one that emphasizes pan-ethnic flavors that might be equally at home in a restaurant like Alias or Cru. Our meal ended with the delivery of still-warm doughnut holes, rolled in a mixture of sugar and five spice powder. HungryMan declared them inspired, while I just sat back and took in their scent- the heat from the doughnuts created a table-enveloping aroma that I found bewitching. Although the doughnut holes were delivered with a small dish of strawberry sauce, neither we, nor our table companions thought it was a particularly good match for the five spice powder. Something creamy or chocolatey might have been a better pairing. But on their own, they were lovely. There were just a few minor missteps in the menu we were served: the black cod with black truffle and galangal would actually have been much tastier without the truffles, whose flavors were completely buried by the galangal; and the pepper-crusted scallops were a little cold when they arrived to the table. Yet in the case of both of these dishes, the greens- designed to act only in supporting roles- were phenomenal. Overall, the new Xing impressed us enormously with the quality and creativity of its food. We can't wait to see what the Rexhepi Dynasty will bring next. Xing, 785 Ninth Avenue (at 52nd Street), 646-289-3010

A Temple to Cheese: Artisanal

2006-02-19 20:37:00
***CONTENT
 Despite its Francophone signage and straight-out-of-the-7th-Arrondissement brasserie feel, Artisanal Fromagerie and Bistro is the kind of place that reminds you most that you are in New York. From the scrum in front of the reservations book, to the impatient diners on cell phones waiting for precious last-minute tables or bar seating, to the wait staff laden down with meals of enormous proportions, to the large, acoustically aggressive dining room where conversations bounce around its café poster-lined walls, Artisanal seems at first glance as if it might be a hostile environment for something as fragile as cheese. We wondered: Do cultured curds and a see-and-be-seen audience really mix? Perhaps this feeling was heightened by the calendar-we were there on February 13th, a day we learned is sometimes also known as Valen-swine’s Day, the evening when adulterous men take their mistresses out to dinner, saving the 14th for their wives. This naughty nugget came to us courtesy of two former Minnesotans at the table to our left who, curious about our picture-taking and perhaps emboldened a bit by their wine, encouraged us to look around and take note of the unusually large number of tables occupied by couples of older men seated across from younger women. Perhaps our new friends were right, but we had little time for cuckold-spotting. We were there for the cheese. Opened last year by Terrance Brennan, also executive chef at Picholine, Artisanal is a restaurant with one simple, unifying focus: it is a temple to cheese. As such, the dishes incorporate cheese in any of its forms whenever possible. This theme extends from the obvious- the fondues which seem to be on every table, served in special-designed pots and with a choice of crudité, apples, beef tips, kielbasa (!), or fingerling potatoes- to the surprising- the grilled cheddar and apple sandwich. While we avoided the fondue, we did indeed find cheese in every dish we ordered. Nosher’s beet salad ($13.50) was generously sprinkled with rough chunks of soft and pungent goat cheese, and my ‘onion soup artisanal’ ($10.50) came topped with no fewer than three kinds of cheese: gruyere, mozzarella and parmesan, a combination that illustrates Brennan's clever and complex approach to a bistro classic. The beets in Nosher's salad were tender and sweet, complementing the bitterness of the endive, yet Nosher found the dressing a bit unexpectedly skunky. The onion soup was serviceable, but could not live up to the hype that its ‘three cheeses, three onions’ billing built up for me- the flavor nuances of the three cheeses disappeared in their mixing and melting. Sadly, the same was true of the onions. It was the larger plates at Artisanal, however, that really shone. My hanger steak ($24.50) was presented splayed out like a blackjack hand, and came served with a cabernet reduction and a mass of crispy, starchy frites. It was juicy, very warm, and exquisitely tender. Nosher’s skate ($20.50), however, was the star of the night. Served filleted away from the cartilage, the moist flesh was coated with a crispy, light crust, all served over tiny cauliflower florets in an addictive grenobloise. In this case, the grenobloise was made of toasted croutons added to the pan after cooking, along with butter, a bit of vinegar, and the syrupy-sweet blood orange juice. It was a perfect combination of savory and sweet. The large dollop of white purée on Nosher's plate was also a pleasant shock: it was a very smooth cauliflower cream that we suspect may have had a little cheese added to it. Why not? Our parting shot was one of Artisanal’s cheese courses; we left our choice up to the staff (there are several affineurs on staff) and received a trio of excellent cheeses, taken directly from the counter at the back of the restaurant (which also allows you to pick up something for the cab ride home, if you are so inclined). On our plate were an aged Humboldt Fog goat cheese, an English white cheddar, and a Shropshire blue. All were excellent and represented a range of tastes and textures, although we found ourselves wishing for some fruit in addition to the high-quality bread served alongside. Although Artisanal is a little on the pricey side of the cost spectrum, the restaurant does offer a few concessions for the added cost. There is a $35 weeknight prix fixe, with more good choices than you might expect-the soup, the steak, and the cheese plate are all options. And while mostly neglectful of bottles under $30, Artisanal gets kudos for offering every single wine on its list by the glass. On the other hand, a very large percentage of the bottles were quite young; not many bottles under $50 were older than 2004, which is a little surprising. Artisanal is not for everyone. If you’re bothered by noisy dining rooms, tight seating arrangements, and occasionally harried service, it’s best to steer clear, or to come early on a weekday. And if you’re not into cheese, there will be less on this menu than you might like. On the other hand, the atmosphere can be invigorating, and if cheese is your thing, you can do much worse than spend an evening here. We'll definitely be back, and might even skip the appetizers and just order two cheese courses- if there were ever a place to try such a trick, it's Artisanal. Artisanal Fromagerie & Bistro, 2 Park Avenue (entrance on 32nd Street), 212-725-8585

Red, Hot, & Semifreddo

***CONTENT
 There is a chance, a significant chance, that you have extra candy loitering around your living space this week. Chocolate is no trouble at all- it tends to disappear quickly. The same goes for anything made with fresh caramel or butter. But what to do with the mounds and mounds of red cinnamon Valentine's hearts? These are the very candies that usually end up neglected in a bowl in the living room, spurned and silently rejected by every visiting guest from now until April. Until now-because we found a use for them, and a delectable one, at that. One of our favorite ultra-simple and luxurious treats is semifreddo, an Italian dessert with the texture of a frozen mousse. It is so light, in fact, that it almost disappears in your mouth, leaving just a residual creamy sweetness. We have a tradition of preparing a crushed candy-cane semifreddo in December each year-a tradition that has been very popular with guests-but why, we asked ourselves yesterday, couldn't we do something similar with those lonely little red hot candies? With that in mind, we went to the kitchen to do a little experimenting. First, we tasted the candies to get a sense of how strongly-flavored they were. We found that the larger heart-shaped candies were milder than the smaller specimens (which are also sold year-round as 'cinnamon imperials' or 'red hots'). But even the large candies tend to be intensely infused with cinnamon, and too much cinnamon essence can be overwhelming. So we decided to forgoe using cinnamon extract in the cream/egg white matrix of the semifreddo. Instead, we opted for a good strong dose of vanilla, a complementary flavor that also mellows the sharpness of the candies. Additionally, we discovered that because the red hots are so sweet, the whipped egg whites and cream need less sugar than they often do. Our first test batch also yielded an unexpected result: when the cinnamon candies melt a bit in the semifreddo (as they do), they slow the freezing process, especially if they congregate together in little veins and layers. So be prepared to wait at least four hours before the semifreddo is ready to serve (and longer if your freezer is not very cold). Once the mixture is completely frozen, it can be scooped with a warm spoon or an ice cream scooper and served in bowls, ramekins, or even teacups. The result is a rich and complex dessert that provides pleasing visual, taste, and texture contrasts-including a very enjoyable crunch from the cinnamon red hots. If you don't have caches of candy squirreled away, take advantage of the post-Valentine's Day sales and snag a few bags of these candies before they become more difficult to find (and more expensive). Now if only we could figure out something to do with those chalky conversation hearts... . Cinnamon Red Hot Semifreddo 6 egg whites (or equivalent quantity of pasteurized or powdered egg whites) 1 pint (16 ounces) heavy whipping cream 2-4 teaspoons vanilla extract (to taste) 2/3 to 1 cup powdered sugar (to taste) 1/2 to 2/3 cup cinnamon red hot candies (crushed if they are large hearts) Beat egg whites to the soft peak stage in a bowl. Add about 1/3 cup powdered sugar and 1 teaspoon vanilla to the mixture and beat egg whites until they reach the stiff peak stage. Taste to make sure that the egg whites are sweet enough. Do not overbeat! Refrigerate egg whites until they are needed. In a separate bowl, whip the cream until it begins to thicken, or until the beaters leave trails in the cream. Add about 1/3 cup powdered sugar and 1-1/2 teaspoons vanilla (or more if you prefer) and taste the cream to make sure it is sweet. Continue whipping until the cream is stiff. Again, don't overbeat. Add red hots and fold into the cream. Fold in egg white mixture very gently, taking care not to deflate the egg whites completely. Transfer to a pan or baking dish to freeze (if the dish is made of metal, it should be lined first with plastic wrap). Cover and freeze for at least 4 hours. Semifreddo is ready to serve when it is firm and solid to the touch. Makes 12-16 servings. 2006 nycnosh.com

No Seating, No Problem: Otafuku

***CONTENT
 Otafuku seems to have no idea that it is wintertime. You might imagine that a restaurant with no indoor seating whatsoever would close during the colder months (see also: Shake Shack), but Otafuku in February is the same as Otafuku in July: busy, busy, busy. Most patrons opt to take their food and eat it elsewhere, but you'll see the hardcore fans of Osaka-style cooking standing cheek by jowl inside, desperate for a little warmth as they chow down on their takoyaki and okonomiyaki. In case you missed it, that's the menu right there. Otafuku specializes in two dishes, offering them alone or in combination, and we recommend that you taste them both. The first, takoyaki, is a spherical egg-and-flour octopus dumpling that is made in a very hot, oiled mold. Position yourself outside Otafuku looking inside, and the bubbling takoyaki are what grabs your attention-because these are perfectly round little balls, they must be turned inside the mold's greased indentations in order to ensure that they cook completely over their entire surface. The staff at Otafuku have this tricky maneuver down to a science: two chopsticks are stuck into the batter, catching hold of a bit of the cooked batter on the bottom of the mold, and the entire mass is yanked briskly upwards and rotated to the side. I watched in awe, knowing that my own kitchen would be splattered in egg and octopus if I were to attempt the same moves at home. Fresh takoyaki are almost always being made, which means that if you go, you not only get a chance to watch the show yourself, but you also will taste these little dumplings at their very best-still just barely runny, slathered in sweet brown okonomiyaki sauce, drizzled with Japanese mayonnaise, and topped with a fluttering pile of nori and bonito flakes that curl and melt when they touch the takoyaki. Okonomiyaki are served with these very same toppings, but the two dishes are so different, there is no confusing them. Some writers compare okonomiyaki to pancakes, some compare them to omelettes, but I tend to think of them as more similar to latkes than anything else- but none of these analogies is very good, as okonomiyaki belong to their own culinary phylum. These thick fritters get their name from the phrase okonomi, which means \"whatever you want,\" and yaki, which means \"grilled.\" The name is a clue to the fact that they are sold much as pizzas are: you indicate what you would like to add to the batter of cabbage, egg, dashi, flour, and onion, creating a personalized meal for yourself. Otafuku offers four choices of extras: pork, shrimp, squid, and beef. The add-ins are cooked on the grill separately from the rest of the patty and are then added in at the very end, immediately before the okonomiyaki begins to set on both sides. And yes, if you prefer a fritter with nothing extra, that is also an option. [Strict vegetarians should take note that dashi contains fish, as do the bonito flakes.] Our favorite item on the menu is the combination platter, served with six takoyaki and the okonomiyaki of your choice ($7-9). If you have never eaten either before, order the combination platter, which takes about ten minutes to cook-you can stand inside and groove along to the Japanese hip-hop CDs on constant rotation while you work up an appetite and watch the cooks prepare your meal. My personal preference in okonomiyaki is the ika (squid) version, stuffed with a very large portion of diced and lightly-grilled squid. HungryMan loves the buta (pork) variety, but they are all absolutely divine. Where to sit is a bit of a problem-the only real problem with Otafuku. If you live nearby, you could take your meal home with you and eat it there, but if it is cold outside and you live far away, you may end up sneaking your snacks into a nearby Astor Place bookstore café and eating them there. Ahem. Or you can just do as we did and take a seat outside on the wooden bench in front of the shop; the takoyaki and okonomiyaki should keep you pretty warm as you eat, and if our experience is any gauge, you won't even notice the cold after a few bites. Otafuku, 236 East 9th Street (between Second and Third Avenues), 212-353-8503

Thanks for the note for vegetarians! To clarify further, bonito flakes are fish, so they always contain fish.
HungryMan
2006-02-14 14:45:00
Yes, they are shaved fish flakes, although some varieties contain other ingredients as well- one brand makes its bonito from a big block of pressed fish and fillers (corn starch, yam paste), which is frozen solid and then shaved into a freeze-drying machine. And some brands are just pure fish, that's absolutely true.

Hi, I tried the combination platter with shrimp! It was fabulous to say the least. I was very impressed with the way the food was prepared, just a foot or two away from me and even more impressed with the presentation style and the extremely tiny size of the place. Thanks for the post, i would have never found this place, if not for your blog.

An Indian Rice Krispie Remix
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-02-12 05:54:00
***CONTENT
 Very few things seem as out of place at upscale food outlets as boutique variations on the Rice Krispie Treat theme. But they're everywhere, pre-cut into hefty bars, gussied up with sleek sans-serif logos, and stickered with a price tag that might make Snap, Crackle, and Pop blanch. When we're away from home, we have both been known to buy one or two of these goodies, but as long as we've got access to the kitchen, we like to make our own, slightly-altered version of the treats for about 1/10 of the cost. Last week, after spying a few individually-wrapped bars for about $3 apiece, we decided to cook up a batch at home. After eating all we could, we were left with six or seven brick-sized pieces, which HungryMan brought to work to share with his colleagues who are always game for impromptu tastings. By sheer coincidence, a visiting employee from India happened to snag one of our snacks, and after taking a few bites, he claimed that they reminded him of a nearly equivalent Indian treat. HungryMan was understandably a little sceptical, but his colleague promised to provide real, comestible evidence when he saw us later this past week. So it was that we became the lucky recipients of a large package of 20 Sahara brand 'sweet ball of puffed rice'. Firm globes about the size of golf balls, these are held together not by marshmallow mortar, but by a concoction of molasses and cryptically-described 'spices'. We couldn't wait to open the package. When we did, we first got a soft and very pleasant whiff of molasses, followed by what we think was the tiniest hint of ginger. Tasting didn't help differentiate the spices, but it did call to mind another familiar taste right away-these puffed rice balls taste almost exactly like another sweet cereal neither of us had eaten in years: Sugar Smacks. Although Smacks are made with puffed wheat, the sugary coating is nearly identical to what is used in the Indian rice balls; if you enjoy Smacks, you will also enjoy Sahara Sweet Puffed Rice Ball[s]. Even better, they appear to be fat free. And at $3 for 20 at Sinha Trading (28th Street and Lexington Avenue), they are an absolute steal. If you are not up for a sub-continental Rice Krispie remix, you might want to try something a little more familiar, but with a few unique twists. Our personal favorite tweaked version of the Rice Krispie treat is one that we invented at right here at home, using almond extract purchased at Kalustyan's, which is right next-door to Sinha Trading, along with a handful or two of slivered almonds to add crunch to the elastic chewiness of the marshmallow treat. All told, this recipe should take about 5 minutes from start to finish, and if you can't wait for the goodies to cool before you cut them, they taste just fine warm, as long as you have a napkin at the ready. We're also big advocates of serving these with a cup of hot chocolate, doctored with a dash of Grand Marnier to pick up the flavors of the orange zest. You may never buy another pre-packaged rice snack again. Marshmallow Almond Crispy Rice Treats 3 tablespoons butter (don't use margarine) 4 cups (950 ml) miniature marshmallows (or 10 ounces/285 g. regular marshmallows) 6 cups (1420 ml) crispy puffed rice cereal 1 teaspoon almond essence, or 1/2 teaspoon almond extract 2/3- 3/4 cup (about 175 ml) slivered almonds zest of 1/2 orange Melt butter in large saucepan with marshmallows and stir until the mixture has melted completely. This can also be done in the microwave, by heating on high for 3 minutes, stirring halfway through. Add almond extract and orange zest and stir. Add rice cereal and almond slivers, and combine so that all the rice is coated and sticky. Press into a baking dish with a spoon, and then press firmly with hands when the mixture has cooled a bit (if hands are just barely moistened, the mixture will not stick to them). Allow to cool for a few minutes and then cut into squares and serve. Makes 12 large bars. 2006 nycnosh.com

Underground Dinner at the Oyster Bar

***CONTENT
 Last week, before the recent cold snap took hold, Nosher and I went out to celebrate a successful speaking engagement of mine. On the basis of a recent Time Out mention, we originally intended to meet at Papillon, a new French bistro in Midtown, but the prices advertised in the window were almost twice as much as we expected and so, despite the nice-looking menu, we decided to pass. Remembering a fine meal I ate at the Oyster Bar last year, I took us on a detour 12 blocks to the south and into the great hall of Grand Central Station. Grand Central's Oyster Bar is a real New York institution for several reasons. For one thing, it’s been around in one form or another since 1913 and retains lots of character, architectural and otherwise, from the grand days of pre-war New York dining. Half the restaurant is given over to serpentine stretches of diner-style counters and their companion barstools, with waitresses moving up and down their lengths, serving customers with cool efficiency. Notably, the restaurant is also entirely underground (‘below sea-level’ as the marketers would have it), with massive arched white brick vaults (supporting the Grand Concourse?) lined with smart rows of lights crowning the room. On the other side of the dining area, red and white-checkered cloths cover a few dozen tables, and commuters catching a bite before their trains to the ‘burbs seem to be everywhere. Best of all though, is the approach to the restaurant: the Oyster Bar is off to the side of the station’s lower-level food court, reached via a large foyer famous for its ‘whispering columns’ where if you stand in one corner of the tiled cave, you can hear everything that’s said in the opposite corner. So be careful what you say around here. If the architecture outside is hushed, the atmosphere inside is positively raucous with the sounds clinking glasses and shouted bursts of conversations among the servers. Once the menu arrives, you'll need to tune out the noise and focus on choosing what to eat- no easy task, as the Oyster Bar offers an enormous list of fried and grilled seafood, and of course, an extensive raw bar replete with over 20 varieties of oysters. Deciding on just one or two things means forsaking a lifetime’s worth of wonderful-sounding options, a process that wasn’t helped much by, at least on our visit, a harried and impatient waitress. Nosher and I both ordered clam chowder, he the New England and I the Manhattan ($5.75 and $4.95, respectively). I prefer the red stuff because it is less creamy and often, less cloying. Here, substantially meaty pieces of clam were in evidence, yet there was also something metallic and amiss: we think at least one ingredient might have come out of a can. Based on my spoonful or two, I found Nosher’s chowder to be better, yet he didn’t think much of it, describing it as not very meaty, too bland, and worst of all, suspiciously dense, almost as if a fair amount of thickener such as corn starch had been added to the soup. Our main dishes were also a mixed bag. I loved the chewy and well-fried Ipswich clams in my clam platter ($19.95); these were piping-hot, less greasy than I sometimes find, and they telegraphed a pleasing hint of seafood brine. The dish's best attribute, however, may have been the light homemade tartar sauce that helped erase any negative thoughts I might have had about the food. Nosher’s Point Judith squid salad ($19.99) was a different story. Served as a cool plate of marinated squid tossed with red onions, all accompanied by avocado and a purple basil vinaigrette, this appeared to be a good choice-it smelled terrific when it arrived at the table. However, some of the squid had dried out substantially and none of it was tender; Nosher described eating the rings ‘as like chewing my way through a plate of something you might buy at an office supply store.’ Unfortunately, there was also too much red onion and barely any of the advertised purple basil. Of course, neither one of us tried the oysters (raw or cooked), which we understand are actually quite good, nor did we try any of the desserts, among which the brioche pudding with crème anglaise ($6.25) looked so good to me I wondered if it could match those we get at our favorite Chicago panaderia. But given our uneven meal, I think we'll have to wait until we are both craving some deep-fried seafood before we return to find out. That, or killing a little time before we start out on our next railway adventure. Grand Central Oyster Bar, Lower Level, Grand Central Station, (212) 490-6650

Thanks for the report. I have found the best way to go at the Oyster Bar is to sit at the counter and order off the board. The oysters are fabulous raw or in a pan roast or stew. I really find this is what they excel at. Wash it down with a Whale's Tale Pale Ale and you don't need to mess with the other items.

I've eaten at the Oyster Bar a few times, and have always been a bit disappointed. The last time I was there I had the Oyster Stew, which was terrible. It tasted like cream of tomato soup with a few oysters thrown here. The soggy bread that came with it was also a disappointment. I've had better at City Hall.

Too, too bad. Two generations of Ottos have called the venerable Oyster Bar our favorite NYC place to eat raw oysters. Why else would you brave the bowels of that place other than to have the freshest best selection of oysters available in the city. Stick to the basics. Fresh fish. Simply prepared. Splurge on the desserts which have all be wonderful. The shallot sauce is einmalich. Squeeze of lemon, little fresh horseradish... slurpers heaven. Forget the \"cocktail sauce\" if that's what you like go to red lobster and save a ton of money.
Nosher
2007-01-02 20:19:00
Hi Mike. With all due respect to the generations of Ottos, I think you must have misread our review. Nowhere did we mention cocktail sauce, and I think if you re-read carefully, you'll see that we did order fresh seafood-it was even advertised as such. I'd argue that deep frying in cornmeal batter is about as simple a preparation as you could argue for, as well. Regardless, I don't think it's expecting too much of a restaurant to hold them to a high standard where fried molluscs are concerned, especially when the word \"oyster\" is half of their very name. There's no reason to serve poorly prepared shellfish, plain and simple.

Capogiro Encore: Our Number 11

***CONTENT
 A little less than a month ago, we wrote a post about Philadelphia's Capogiro Gelato- not at all negative, but our conclusion was that while we liked their product just fine, we did not really think that it was worth $10/pint (at Whole Foods), especially when local artisanal gelato is available for much less at places such as Ciao Bella and Il Laboratorio del Gelato. We thought that was the end of that. But Stephanie, one of Capogiro's owners, quickly wrote us to say that she was upset that we might have felt cheated and wanted a chance to try to convince us of the merits of her company's frozen desserts. We let her know about our sample policy, which is that companies, publishers, and PR firms are welcome to send us whatever they like (and they do), but we generally only write about these free items if we like them. So within a week, Stephanie shipped us a box containing six pints of dry-ice packed gelato tubs-most of which represented flavors not sold in Whole Foods. In the meantime, we planned an informal tasting with HungryMan's Uncle Heraclitus, Abstract Aunt, and Cousin Pluck, all of whom were game to sit down to 96 ounces of frozen treats from Philly. Our approach was simple: we'd remove two tubs to let them sit out (as recommended), and then taste the flavors one-at-a-time, beginning with the sorbettos and ending with the heavier flavors-this is the same order I use when I run wine tastings, and it seemed like a good method here, as well. At the end of the tasting, we would all be free to take more of whatever we enjoyed most. So HungryMan and I opened the Fed Ex box and the tissue-and-ribbon wrapped styrofoam cooler inside (Capogiro earns points for making a white cooler look attractive), and called our session to order. What follows are our tasting notes (in the order in which we ate the gelatos and sorbettos): Sicilian Blood Orange: Very pure, intense, there is clearly whole peel (including rind) in this, a few tasters called it \"a little strong and harsh.\" Pomegranate: Subtle, perfect transfer of pomegranate seed flavors- unlike what you get with grenadine, there are hints of berries, very smooth. Figs in Mascarpone Cheese: Loads of fig pulp and seeds, pleasingly creamy, something missing here though, the masacarpone's tang never really shows through. Butterscotch Bourbon: Rivulets and veins of caramel, rich, gorgeously balanced, the bourbon's overtones are very identifiable. Bacio: Plenty of crisp chocolate and hazelnut pieces, warm brown color is lovely, there is possibly Frangelico in this (and if so, it's too hazelnutty), good texture balance with the crunch, this one grows on you. Turkish Coffee: Dotted with little constellations of espresso flecks, tastes quite a bit like a Frappucino, some light floral notes to the espresso (are these La Colombe beans?), not very densely packed for a gelato. Everyone's unanimous favorite was the Butterscotch Bourbon-all its elements worked in perfect concert and it left all of us wanting to eat more of it. (For that very reason, the Brits use the term 'moreish' to describe foods like this.) We were almost as pleased with the Bacio flavor, and when the time came to return to the tubs for further helpings, both of these containers got pretty well pillaged. As we passed around the leftovers, all five of us talked about prices once again. We still came to the same conclusion as before: we all had a very hard time imagining ourselves buying a pint of even the Butterscotch Bourbon for $10 in the supermarket, even though we did enjoy it quite a bit and took into account that the high-quality, local ingredients explain much of the high price point. Again, this sentiment seems to be pretty firmly connected to the fact that there are comparable (and some tasters still maintained, better) handmade gelatos available for less in New York City. But, there's one catch here. We really think that this stuff makes a fantastic gift, especially for someone who does not have the luxury of living- as we do- in a city with amazing gelaterias. What's more, Capogiro beats out Il Laboratorio del Gelato soundly when it comes to pricing on their gift packages: $60, plus about $20 in shipping, will get you a gift box almost identical to what we received. That's six really good pints of gelato, packed on -190°F dry ice, and delivered in a day or two to your doorstep. Il Laboratorio also ships, but they include only 4 pints for about the same price. So in an ironic twist to the story, Capogiro turns out to be a bargain when it is shipped. We love the idea of sending someone gelato as a gift, especially since the total cost of doing so is about the same as buying a nice bouquet of flowers. And honestly, wouldn't you much rather have six pints of gelato than a few limp carnations and some baby's breath? So consider this Number 11 on our list of last-minute Valentine's Day ideas, especially if you or your love is far away from a local artisanal scooper.

While I love food in general, I am particularly passionate about ice cream and gelato, and I thoroughly appreciate your adroit handling of the subject. Reading your second pass review of Capogiro Gelato, I couldn’t help but wonder how the gelato at the Bent Spoon in Princeton compares to Capogiro, Il Laboratorio and CiaoB. Would you ever consider trekking out to wilds of New Jersey in quest for superlative ice cream? During a brief sojourn in Princeton I enjoyed their cardamom-ginger and wild blueberry gelatos regularly, but I never conducted an official “tasting.” If you are ever in that vicinity, please do give it a try and let us all know what your seasoned palettes think. Oh, and thanks for your fantastic site that makes living in Manhattan that much better.

Alycia, we are glad you enjoy the site; thanks also for the kind words. We have never been to Princeton's Bent Spoon, but we're going to add it to our out-of-town list. We have a few friends who either work at the university or who are graduate students there, so I think we'll probably have a chance to investigate sooner rather than later.

Romance in a Rush: Help for a Last-Minute Valentine's Day

***CONTENT
 Eleven days. That's all the time you have left to plan something special for Valentine's Day, and in this city, it's not a lot of time. If you've tried making a reservation at an upscale restaurant recently, you are pretty likely to have been told that they're all booked and have been for weeks. Oops. So what can you do with just 11 (or even fewer) days left? Actually, plenty. Here are ten crunch-time suggestions for you, each of which showcases some element of New York City's gastronomical greatness. So take a deep breath and read on... . 1. Dinner and a Movie at the IFC: They haven't scheduled the movies this far in advance (although a call to the box office yielded \"strong odds that 'Transamerica' will be one of the films playing that night.\") Felicity Huffman aside, you'll have at least a couple of movies to choose from, and if you pair this with dinner at the IFC's own Waverly restaurant, you've got your evening planned. But you'll have to act relatively fast on Monday- Waverly has not yet accepted bookings for the 14th, but they'll begin doing so early next week. According to the restaurant staffer we spoke to, there may also be a dinner-and-a-movie combo in the works, so give them a ring at 212-924-8866 to find out more. 2. Put a Lobster on Hold: The Lobster Place (locations both in Chelsea Market and on Bleecker Street) will reserve a lobster for you if you give them a call at least 24 hours in advance. Practically speaking, this means that you should call them during the weekend prior to Valentine's Day. Most adults can eat a 1-1/2 pound crustacean with no difficulty (and anything smaller than 1-1/4 lb. is just a cruel tease), so specify the size of the critters you want, and then on the 14th, stop in to collect them. Steam or boil the lobsters in a large pot and serve steaming hot with clarified butter, Italian parsley, and a great loaf of bread from Amy's Bread (which has branches co-located with both Lobster Place stores). Perfect. 3. You Point, I Make: Give your loved one a gorgeously illustrated cooking magazine (Saveur, Gourmet, Food & Wine, Cooking Light, etc.) or cookbook (Nigella Lawson's Feast, The Silver Spoon, or even Mark Bittman's generalist classic How to Cook Everything) along with a card that says, \"Choose any item from this magazine/book, and I will make it for you.\" Just be prepared to pay up. 4. Italian with No Reservations: Grab a deck of cards or your Travel Scrabble set and head out to one of these three solid standbys that do not take reservations: Gennaro, Celeste (Amsterdam Avenue and 84th/85th Street), or Al Di La (Fifth Avenue and Carroll Street in Park Slope, Brooklyn). You'll put your name on the list and probably wait for a while, but that's where the game comes in-arriving prepared for a wait will make it look as if you planned ahead. Don't forget cash at the first two places; Al Di La is the only one of the three that accepts credit cards. 5. The Lazy Lunch: Call your sweetie at work about an hour or so before s/he normally eats lunch and tell him/her to stay put and not to eat. Then, hop onto Seamless Web and poke around for something scrumptious to have delivered. Seamless Web's new service offers dozens of choices in almost every neighborhood of Manhattan (we hope Brooklyn and Queens are in the pipeline), and even better, you might be able to save a few bucks on your order if you choose one of their affiliate eateries. You'll also earn extra brownie points with this Valentine's stunt if you show up at the office to share the lunch you've ordered. 6. Aural Pleasure: If you have two MP3 devices or CD players, you can both do a tandem Soundwalk tour of one of twelve different neighborhoods in the city (discs are also available through Amazon and at bunches of shops in NYC). Even native Gothamites will get something out of these tours, we promise. Just be sure you and your honey press 'play' at the same time. When you're finished, there are fantastic ethnic restaurants very close to the end-points of all of the Soundwalk tours, and chances are good that they will probably have a few tables free. [Our favorite Soundwalk tour is the Chinatown walk. Plus, it drops you off in the heart of ethnic food heaven.] 7. BYO & Buttercream: Purchase a nice bottle of bubbly: Pol Roger champagnes are fantastic, even the non-vintage bottles, as are sparkling wines from Charles Heidsieck and Peter Rumball. Remember that this is the time to splurge if there ever was a time. Then take your bottle along to a no-corkage bistro in the West Village like Ivo & Lulu on Broome Street or Tartine on West 11th Street. Again, you might have to wait for a table. When you finish your meal, work off the bubbly by taking a wander east to Magnolia Bakery (Bleecker and 11th Streets) where you can pick up something sweet to complete the evening. 8. Pastiche Prix Fixe: At Williamsburg's Monkey Town, you can opt to sit in the back dining room and watch four Valentine's Day themed films play at once (with soundtracks mixed and crossfaded with an assortment of love songs) while you eat dinner. The restaurant is offering a prix fixe menu at $40 that includes three courses and champagne. Not bad. Plus, you can sit in the front dining room, if you'd rather not watch the postmodern mash-up of Lady and the Tramp, Minnie and Moskowitz, Sid and Nancy, and Harold and Maude. It's certainly a dinner you won't forget too soon. Book now (718-384-1369), because tables are going fast! 9. Who Needs Torino?: Most people seem to forget that the ice skating rink at Rockefeller Center remains open until April every year. That's good news for you, since it means that the crowds will be smaller than over the December holiday season and you'll stand a good chance of getting some ice time if you head over in the early evening. The night session costs $9 without skates, $16 with skates, and doesn't end until 10:00 p.m. . You may even have time to stop for a bite to eat. We recommend the nearby branches of Sushiden (there's one on either side of Rock Center on 49th Street)- just be careful not to soak yourself in sake before you get on the blades. 10. There's Still Hope: If you jump onto Open Table, you may still be able to score a two-top at a romantic spot. When we last checked, there were a few 7:00 and 7:30 spaces around town, and several 5:30 bookings left to be taken. If you're scrambling, you can also call restaurants at around 6:00 p.m. on the big day and inquire about cancellations-many people book themselves into three or four restaurants on the 14th, and their loss is your gain. But be very polite to the restaurant staff on the telephone-they are probably more stressed out on Valentine's Day than you are.

Pass the Salt: Levain Bakery Cookies
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-02-01 05:31:00
***CONTENT
 Let's get this out of the way at the beginning: these are genuinely good cookies. They're not tremor-inducingly delicious, but they are good enough to draw me back in to Levain Bakery twice in one month. Only here's the rub: they could be a lot better. Two of the cookies of the four varieties we've eaten: the oatmeal raisin and double chocolate chip- the two featured in the image below- show a considerable potential for greatness. They are dense and substantial, moist inside, and honestly huge-nearly the diameter of a CD. What's more, the bakers always seem to be generous with the goodies inside: that means a high chip/raisin:dough ratio, which is is one of these cookies' greatest assets. But still, there is a nagging problem. It's the salt. Or rather, the lack thereof in the batter that tarnishes the otherwise wonderful chocolate chip (both single and double chocolate) and oatmeal cookies. On the other hand, the chocolate peanut butter chip cookies are luxurious and as nearly perfect as any cookie I have eaten in New York City. The reason behind the disparity is simple: the saltiness of the peanut butter works its magic in the mahogany dough, elevating the cookies from creditable to incredible. We're starting to think that this fear of salt in baked goods is becoming an epidemic. One of our favorite commentaries on the wonders of salinity in chocolate desserts comes from Dorie Greenspan, in her December 6, 2003 interview on public radio's The Splendid Table. Here is a clip from that episode (8 minutes long, in Real Audio format), which you can listen to just by clicking the link, although we recommend you visit the site and check out the program's archives, if for no other reason than to get acquainted with the ever-charming and ebullient Lynne Rosetto Kasper. Greenspan's contention is that a little fleur du sel intensifies the flavors in her favorite Korova cookies, and from what we've tasted, we think she's onto something important. While we won't go so far as to suggest a change of recipe, we do think it might be a useful experiment for Levain's bakers to taste-test the double-chocolate cookie and the chocolate peanut butter cookie side-by-side to see what a little extra pinch of NaCl can do for their already fine treats. This is of course an experiment you should join in on-consider it the tastiest homework assignment you've ever had.

My roommates and I did almost the same thing last weekend with 4 of levain's cookies + we ended up throwing out 3 of them because of what you are saying. you will be happy to know the only one we kept was the peanut butter one.

Glad to know that I am not the only one who was not totally BLOWN AWAY by the double chocolate chip due to a lack of salt. DOn't get me wrong, I heated it and it was borderline dead good, but the SALT, not there. Hehe, I would horrify most bakers nowadays anyway because I use salted butter when I bake so I guess my opinion would be void in this whole matter now that I just wrote all that.

I found their recipe in an old article online, so you can make the cookies with salt if you wanted to. I've always wanted to try their cookies because I'm a raw dough fan.

Very interesting, Jessica! We'll have to try the home version of the game with a little extra salt. Still no substitute for Levain doing it themselves, however.

2006-03-12 03:15:00
[...] But not all of our starters were worth sharing: both Nosher’s Bibb lettuce salad and Pesactore’s black squid pasta were oversalted in the extreme-don’t get me wrong: we love salt and have been known to point out where there needs to be more of it (see our recent reviews of Levain and Buttercup Bake Shop). But it is also possible to use too much salt. In Thor's case, we started to think that someone in the kitchen might be trying to escape a run of bad luck by throwing the stuff over every shoulder. The pumpkin seed vinaigrette on the salad should have been a delicate counterpoint to the greens, but the seeds were dusted with salt and the entire mass was liberally sprinkled with fleur de sel, making the whole thing impossible to eat without frequent sips of water. Nosher's salad also suffered from being an entire head of Bibb lettuce served on a tiny plate, which forced him into contortions in an attempt to eat it. Pescatore's pasta was actually an order of magnitude more salty than Nosher's salad; Pescatore, who rarely complains, said he could barely taste the squid and scallops, let alone the other ingredients in the dish. And what a shame-the presentation and aromas made this seem like the most promising thing we ordered to being our meal. [...]

wow - I must say that I am quite surprised at all the brew-ha-ha with NYC's most desired cookies from Levain Bakery... my new favorite place! Actually, I find it quite offensive and I challenge the depth of your food intelligence especially when it comes to cookies and salt. The cookies actually DO have salt in them but remember,salt is often used to enhance and bring out the best in other flavors, not dominate. Needless to say, I completely disagree with the whole \"salt\" debacle...I can't recall ever of biting into a cookie and thinking ''hmm, am I going to taste the salt\"? The cookies are not meant to be \"salty\" my dear (said with much affection), but rather sweet, doughy and rustic with just the right amount of crisp when you bite in to them. The cookies actually do have salt in them but remember, salt is often used to enhance and bring out the best in other flavors, not dominate. And to the person who threw them away (oh my...say it isn't so!!!) - at the very least you could have given them to a homeless person in need...wasteful, don't you think? I give the cookies 2 thumbs up! I challenge you to give them another try without the bias on \"salt\". If they taste sweet to you, then the salt has done it's job! Happy tasting~
Nosher
2006-06-17 22:31:00
Verlie, I think it's a bit of a stretch to call any of this a \"debacle.\" Yes, of course there is some salt in the cookies. The issue is the quantity, and if you listen to the link, you'll see that we're far from the only people who've commented on the undersalting of American baked goods. I think you're also confused about just how salty we thought the cookies ought to have been- if you re-read the post, you'll see that we thought the balance was just right in the peanut butter cookies. Now, obviously these are not baked goods with a dominant flavor of salt- not pretzels, for example- but what was so good about them is exactly the thing you seem to think we missed: the peanut butter cookie's other flavors (including sweetness) were enhanced and bolstered by the salinity. Nobody wants a salty cookie- just one with enough salt to do its job properly.

Next Stop: Hong Kong Station

***DATE
2006-01-30 05:23:00
***CONTENT
 Hong Kong Station looks just enough like an actual subway stop that I did a little double-take the first time I saw it while walking down Bowery one evening. All credit to their sign designers, I walked over to check it out, which is probably precisely what they intended. Inside, I saw dozens and dozens of Chinese diners jockeying for tables-some even eating while standing-and smelled one of my very favorite things: soup noodles. As it turns out, my Saturday night encounter with Hong Kong Station was not typical-I witnessed it at its very busiest time. Normally, there are plenty of tables and ample seating in the restaurant. But I found the bustle a little exciting, and better than that: promising. So the next chance I got, I dragged HungryMan out for lunch at Hong Kong Station. All orders begin at the counter. First, you choose your noodle type: udon, lai fun, chow fun, ramen, and several other Asian pastas are on offer, both in fresh and dried varieties. Then, as one of the cooks adds broth to your noodle base, you choose items to add to the bowl. There are several vegetable options, including shiitake mushrooms, Chinese broccoli, and turnip greens, and an even broader selection of fish and meats, including roasted pork, curried fish balls, shredded beef, squid, and chicken gizzards. Once you've finished building your soup, you are confronted with a difficult question: \"How hot?\" This is never easy to answer, as every restaurant and every diner seems to have a different definition of peppery heat. Hong Kong Station places \"mild\" at the same place on the spectrum where I tend to place \"pretty hot.\" Our friend from Boston who joined us for lunch last week asked for her lunch \"a little hot\" and ended up with a healthy quarter-cup of chili paste dropped into her bowl, so take that under advisement. The best way to control the heat of the soup is to ask for a very little bit of of heat, and then request more chili paste on the side, in a small cup, rather than swirled into your soup. The counter staff will be happy to oblige, and contrary to what you may read elsewhere, they all speak English. All items added to the soup are $1, so no matter how many extras you request in your bowl, you will still struggle to spend more than $10 on a bowl of noodles and a drink. And you must have a drink. Really. Hong Kong Station offers regular soft drinks and bottled waters, but the secret treasure of the place is its vast beverage selection, with items as unusual as Salty Lemon 7-Up and hot or cold Honey Water on offer for $1.50 apiece. I order the almond drink (also $1.50), which tastes like a smooth version of Mexican horchata, and which also contains no dairy. It offers the perfect tonic to any overenthusiastic use of the chili paste. Our favorite dish here is lai fun noodles with curried fish balls and a few vegetables. It's a popular choice, as HungryMan, our friend from Boston, her friend from Connecticut, and I all ordered the same thing without seeing or hearing one another order. The curried fish balls are my own favorite part of the meal, as they are very subtly spiced and manage to sop up the soup once they're split open. I also really love the plump mushrooms here-always just bursting with juice and gloriously briney. When I placed my most recent order, the woman behind the counter said, \"Mmmm. Yes, mushrooms. Very good. Everbody loves them. We use so many in Hong Kong.\" And on Hester Street, too. Although once you're inside, bent with your face two inches from the surface of your soup, you won't be able to tell the difference. Hong Kong Station, 128 Hester Street (East of Bowery), 212-966-9382

Nosher
2006-02-04 15:54:00
Great question. My first instinct with places like this, the seriously authentic ones, is to say no and guess that it's probably a beef or chicken stock. But I did see two different-looking vats of stock bubbling, so I think there is hope. Here's what I'd suggest: go and ask if there is meat in the stocks. If it turns out neither is vegetarian (and if you're an ovo-lacto vegetarian), order (and this is going to sound strange) their peanut butter & condensed milk toast from the yellow strip menu you see above. You can actually read the whole thing if you click the image and view it at 'Original' resolution. That way you won't leave hungry.

Il Laboratorio del Gelato's Cheddar Fugue
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-01-26 19:50:00
***CONTENT
 Eagle-eyed Chowhounders might just deserve a mention in our wills, especially when they clue us in to such once-in-a-blue-moon finds like Il Laboratorio del Gelato's cheddar gelato. Apparently, Il Laboratorio brews up a big batch of the stuff every month or so for 24 Prince, a Modern American restaurant in Soho that serves it as part of an apple crisp/cheddar ice cream combo. But on the rare occasions when the gelateria decides to make a bit extra, they sell it in the shop. You just have to be ready to pounce when it's there. And with a quick afternoon e-mail to HungryMan, who works Downtown, we pounced. HungryMan hurried back to the NoshPad, calling me three times from the taxi to let me know the status of the tub- he couldn't have been more diligent if he'd been carrying a transplantable kidney. You probably have already guessed that we grabbed a few spoonfuls before we stuck it into the freezer. Doing so made us realize that we needed to forage for something to serve it with, because on its own, it's a little odd-tasting. Not bad, by any means, but also not the kind of thing you'd imagine eating while curled up in front of a movie. Like most Il Laboratorio goodies, cheddar gelato finds the purest expression of its fundamental flavor and then announces it, like a oboe sounding a perfect A-440 to tune the rest of the orchestra. This gelato brings to mind every dish of macaroni and cheese, every Wisconsin or Orgeon cheese plate, and yes, every Cheez-It you've ever eaten. But at the same time, the sugar and the cream work to jar memories of mellow cheesecakes and cannoli. Cheddar gelato also seems a little lonely on its own. So we found it a few companions, some better than others: the first was a pretty literal gloss on 24 Prince's own dessert, an apple tart that we procured from the only place selling apple tarts in Hell's Kitchen at this hour- the Bread Factory. Not normally our first choice, but it did the job. HungryMan enjoyed this pairing much more than I did, but both of us thought that the cheese flavor was muted and blunted by the pastry and the cloying goo on the fruit. I am sure that 24 Prince's apple crisp is much finer than this, so I won't speculate about it, but I will say that the Bread Factory tart was not an adequate substitute. Next up was our low-tech dessert: simple slices of crisp Granny Smith apples enlisted as rudimentary scoops for the cheddar gelato. This was our resounding favorite: the apple's tang distracted attention just enough from the cheese flavor, and at the same time it echoed back a bit of the cheddar's sharp bite. I imagined scooping out the center of a halved green apple and filling it with the cheddar gelato as a way of turning this into a more table-ready presentation. But who needs the table? HungryMan and I polished off half the tub this way before we knew what we had done. Our final dessert was also a winner. Here, we drizzled good quality sweet Spanish amontillado sherry over a tiny scoop of the cheddar gelato. The rationale here was that cheese and sherry are so good in tandem, as are ice cream and sherry. So by some transitive property of cooking calculus, that means that cheddar gelato and sherry should meld beautifully. And they did. What we would like to try is an amontillado sherry and Granny Smith combination that brings together both of these flavors with the cheddar gelato. But that will have to wait either for Il Laboratorio del Gelato to begin churning the stuff on a regular basis or for our next lucky break on the Lower East Side. If you feel inspired to try the cheddar gelato, give Il Laboratorio a call first to find out when it's on their schedule, and if you do, don't forget to drop us an e-mail to tell us about it. Il Laboratorio del Gelato, 95 Orchard Street (just south of Delancey), 212-343-9922

Mission Impossible: Three  Eat for $20

***CONTENT
 The Mission: Find a proper, sit-down restaurant with table service, somewhere in the five boroughs, where three hungry people can have a high-quality, satisfying meal for $20 or less...total. Oh, and that includes wine, tax and tip, too. Sound familiar? If you read our post last Friday, you'll recall that we were featured in the NY Metro newspaper and were set this very challenge. [Right-click this link and download the PDF of the newspaper if you haven't read the original story yet- we're on p. 10.] This is the story of how we managed to pull it off. The Backstory: About a week ago, Nosher and I were contacted by Paul Berger (author of Englishman in New York), also apparently a big NYCnosh fan and best of all, a journalist at NY Metro, the free daily newspaper available outside of most subway stations. Paul writes a weekly column on New York blogs, and he wanted his second column to be about food blogging. More than that, he wanted to meet us for an interview and had a great- albeit difficult challenge for us to test our NYC food IQ. He asked us to find a restaurant where three people could eat a tasty sit-down meal in New York for $30. Yes, $30. Nosher and I looked at each other, smiled, and accepted the mission, even cockily suggesting we could do it with wine. So we brainstormed some ideas and quickly got to making our plans. Only, that wasn’t the end of the story. Paul had told his editor about the idea and somewhere along the line, the paper mixed up the idea and printed a teaser about the column that announced boldy that the three of us were going to eat out with a reduced total of only $20- 33% less than our original paltry sum. Worse still, we had made our own bed by saying we were going to include wine in the original total. So there we were, with 20 bucks and a deadline. It required more creative thinking, but as you know, we figured out a way to do it. And in the end, we solved our own puzzle with a visit to Lomzynianka. The Restaurant: No, that isn’t a typo. Lomzynianka (pronounced: wom-zhee-nyan-ka) is in Brooklyn's Greenpoint neighborhood, in the middle of what should rightly be called Little Warsaw. The restaurant's name means ‘girl from Lomza,’ a town in North East Poland near Bialystock (Bialystock, by the way, is also where the the delicious bialy comes from). The owner, Janina Grzelczak, is the girl from Lomza in question, and together with her partner Darek, they cook up some of the best Polish food I have had west of the Vistula (and, it must be said, east of the Chicago River). Lomzynianka is one long, narrow room with tables lining the glass-covered walls. On a typical night, the clientele is largely or entirely Polish, but everyone is welcome. A large stag’s head-decorated at this time of year for Christmas- presides over the restaurant with an absurdist smile, reminding diners that this is Polish food, hunter’s style, and that however good the food, this will not be a light meal. The Food: To achieve our goal of $20 or less, we knew we would have to stick to three of the main dishes and skip appetizers, which we had included in our original $30 plan. This was unfortunate, because it meant missing Lomzynianka’s famous (and astoundingly inexpensive) borscht. Served white ($2.50) or red ($2.00), these soups are substantial alone or eaten with hearty Polish rye bread. It also meant skipping the fried pierogies which are crisp, golden brown, and aromatic. They are also available boiled, but where is the fun in that? Lomzynianka’s pierogie selection runs the gamut from classic potato and cheese to sauerkraut and mushroom and sweet farmer’s cheese (all for $3.50) As for our own meals, Nosher ordered the potato pancakes ($4.25). The Polish version is very different from the latkes we wrote about in a previous post: these were flatter and denser and contained nary a shred of potato. Our best guess is that they use very lightly mashed boiled potatoes instead of grated potatoes. The Lomzynianka version was also pleasantly peppery and benefited from being served straight out of the pan – hot and crisp yet chewy. A generous dollop of sour cream complemented these nicely. Paul ordered a plate of Polish Kielbasa ($4.50), a spiced Polish sausage, that became the highlight of the evening: the sausages were split lengthwise down the middle, grilled until crunchy on their edges but still juicy, and then smothered in hefty rings of sauteed onions. The kielbasa (and all entrees, for that matter) was served with a side of potatoes that were just a bit dry- we're guessing that this is by design, however, as they can be used to sop up the kielbasa and onion juices left on the plate. My order of bigos ($4.25) was the meal’s only disappointment. Bigos is a kind of hunter’s stew made of various meats (pork mostly), cabbage, and sauerkraut. It is practically Poland’s national dish, even if it is considered peasant food-if this were French food, we would be talking about cassoulet-and I’ve often found it served as the star dish at parties (in a previous life I worked in Krakow). Here, the bigos suffered a bit from being prepared much earlier in the evening, allowing the flavors to blend in with one other a little more than they should have, and it didn’t hold together as other, better bigoses I have had (including the excellent bigos at Czerwone Jabluszko, or Red Apple, on Chicago's West Side). This is something that can probably be avoided by eating earlier than we did- the restaurant closes early (9:30-10:00 p.m.), and we were the last patrons left in the place. Served gratis alongside our entrees were plates of mixed cabbage: equal portions of sauerkraut, sautéed red cabbage, and a Polish cole slaw. Each one of these three cabbage dishes was superb. And then of course there was the wine: a very dry crisp French white, a 2002 Tirecul La Graviere blend of Muscadelle and Semillon grapes that we picked up at Warehouse Wine & Spirits in Astor Place a few weeks back for an unbelievable $3.25, including tax. We originally bought this wine to use in a risotto we served at our New Year’s Party and somehow it found its way out of our kitchen and into the living room where, to our surprise, our guests preferred it to another wine purchased for almost ten times as much. Lomzynianka is BYOB and does not charge a corkage fee, which is how we managed to get away with including wine in our total. We would encourage you to do the same, as Polish food pairs well with hearty reds and substantial, dry white wines. The Total: All told, our bill for food came to an astonishing $14, including tax. With the wine, it was $17.25. This allowed us to leave a proportionally generous tip of $2.75, about 21 percent– bringing our total payout to exactly $20.00. Mission accomplished. Even better, we not only ate quite decent food (with some dishes far exceeding this mark), but none of the three of us left hungry. Mission Notes: Lomzynianka is right near the Nassau Avenue subway station on the G line, which makes it very convenient. Finally, it’s right to disclose that Paul paid for our dinner, though we insisted on paying for the wine. It cost less than our subway tickets, after all. Lomzynianka, 646 Manhattan Avenue (at Nassau Avenue), Greenpoint, Brooklyn, 718-389-9439

I ate there today!! but not because of this site, which i came across afterwards while looking up the address/tel # for my favorite Lady for Lomza. I've been eating here for a couple years and rave about it. Wine was a good idea; I suggest getting two bottles each of Okocim polish beer at the corner before going -- at something like $1.50 with quite high alc content. It's a perfect marriage. Nice blog. I'm glad you enjoyed this thoroughly delicious restaurant...

If You Eat Nothing Else in Midtown, Make It Yakimochi

***CONTENT
 I have a little fantasy about taking a job in Midtown, not so much because I want to spend all day overlooking Bryant Park or Times Square, but because if I did, I would be close enough to eat lunch every day at Café Zaiya. I imagine myself wedged into the tiny dining area at the front of the shop, surrounded on all sides by Asian tourists, and even my claustrophobic self backs down when I remind it that I'd be eating chili ebi, yakisoba sandwiches, and katsu bowls. Find the food and the job will follow, is what my stomach keeps telling me. In the meantime, I have been visiting Café Zaiya on weekends or in the late afternoons with HungryMan, Lady Film Editor, and well, pretty much all of our other friends. The verdict is a unanimous thumbs-up from all camps. Some people prefer the baked goods- Café Zaiya makes its own impressive selection of sweet treats and replaces them with fresh items throughout the day. Keep that in mind if there is a particular goodie you're after, as the current inventory changes often. When Lady Film Editor and I visited recently, we ate only sweets: I ordered the yomogo pan, a porous and spongy cake infused with very strong green tea and topped with sweetened red beans. The yomogo pan takes the flavor experience of green tea ice cream and amplifies it by a few orders of magnitude, making it a perfect companion for a cup of milky coffee (and the coffee here is good, so don't overlook it). Lady Film Editor's éclair was a very traditional French-style paté-choux pastry, filled with a brilliantly white vanilla cream. Both snacks were fantastic. On that same visit, I picked up a rice-filled omelette for HungryMan (who had missed lunch and was waiting, starving, at home). Omu-rice is exactly what it looks like: a thin envelope of loosely cooked eggs surrounding pan-fried short grain rice, seasoned with onion, peppers, and a little ketchup. There's more ketchup on top, in case you missed it in the rice. It is simple food, but very satsifying. It is also one of perhaps 20 different lunch items that Café Zaiya serves, not even counting the chili shrimp, fried oysters, octopus patties, and sushi kept in the deli cases. We especially like the fried fish and pork bento boxes, the mackerel noodle bowls, and the chicken cutlet sandwiches. But more than any of those foods, we are madly and passionately in love with the yakimochi. These little discs are made from pounded glutinous rice dough, flecked with black sesame seeds, and filled with a velvety sweet white bean paste. They are grilled or baked (Café Zaiya seems to bake some of them) until they are just barely golden brown, and if you are very lucky, sold warm. I handed a very skeptical HungryMan his first toasty yakimochi just a few weeks ago, and after taking a small bite out of it, he moaned with pleasure. I completely understand why- this one dessert provides so many taste and texture sensations that it takes a first-timer completely by surprise. It is chewy and smooth, grainy, soft, slightly crunchy, mellow, and sweet, all at once, and all in perfect concert. Yakimochi alone is reason enough to stop in to Café Zaiya, but if you happen to miss it, don't despair- eat something else. You'll be back. Café Zaiya, 18 East 41st Street (between 5th and Madison Avenues), 212-779-0600 [NB: Yes, there is a Beard Papa in Café Zaiya, but it deserves its own post.]

YAAAAY, I love Cafe Zaiya! The Cooper Square one isn't as large as the midtown one, but it's loads better than no Cafe Zaiya at all (*gasp*, what a sad world that would be). I took Melody there once and she loved the yakimochi. I tried a sample and liked it too, but perhaps I should buy an entire one. That's some good stuff. [rubs belly]

Oh, I am a big advocate of buying yourself at least one whole yakimochi. We just bought one with red bean filling, so ask first if you prefer white bean.

Upside Down and Right Side Up: Whym
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-01-19 04:59:00
***CONTENT
 For weeks before it opened, Whym's front window was papered over in zebra-patterned contact paper, prompting questions about the interior design as well as the food. But in the end, the exotic hints were all proven to be red herrings-Whym's dining room is sleek, dark, and tame, and thankfully, the menu leaves out any trace of safari animals. Instead, Whym concentrates on pepped-up remixes of hearty traditional dishes-playing with classics the way their logo toys with form (it reads the same even when it's flipped). Take for example the chopped salad, which here features asparagus, bosc pear, beet cubes, crumbled feta, and a basil vinaigrette. The best thing about the dish though is that it works and is delicious: this is not a reinvention for originality's sake, it is an exploration with real purpose. My own best clue that real thought was at work here was the temperature of the beets-they alone were ice-cold in the salad, offering a lively contrast to the room temperature feta and lettuces. This is not your local diner's chopped salad, but it is still recognizable and a lot more interesting. Nor is the calamari precisely what you might predict: served very lightly battered and dredged with a sweet chili sauce and a touch of harissa, it imports elements of Chinese and Middle Eastern cuisines in equal measure. The result is a genuine winner of a dish. Our only quibble was that the sauce soaked through the crunchy coating on the calamari, which meant that in order to enjoy the texture contrasts, we had to eat this quickly. No great demand for us, but if you're someone who lingers over appetizers, you might request some of the sauce on the side. Between courses, HungryMan and I overheard a group of animated patrons at a nearby booth discussing the differences between Whym and its sister restaurant Eatery. One remarked, \"Well, I think your pork chop speaks for itself.\" Both of us craned our necks to see what this meant, but unable to catch a glimpse, we instead double-checked with the server to make sure we had ordered one of these revelatory cutlets. We had. While neither of us is really sure what our fellow diner intended by his comment, we got the gist once our entrées arrived. First, the stuffed chop was hefty and rich-looking, even ignoring the vein of smoked mozzarella that ran through it. Additionally, it was very well-cooked- something that is tricky to get right with stuffed meats. But the real star here was the polenta. HungryMan and I spent at least five minutes doing nothing but tasting very small amounts of it and discussing the transformative power of the mellow, smoky roasted shallots. I'm nominating this for a place on the menu of its own, either as an appetizer or a side dish-it was superb. If the pork chop spoke for itself, the wasabi pea crusted tuna might have had a few words of its own to say. It certainly wasn't a dish I would describe as shy-the coating surrounding the two substantial pieces of seared tuna contained not only wasabi, but a good dose of peppery heat. This preparation would work in many other contexts and with a variety of side-dish pairings. We both thought that the braised bok choi here was a good idea in theory, but its green leaves became too sweet in the dark, molasses-thick reduction. The stalks, on the other hand, were still very juicy and gave the dish a much-needed crunch. Tweaking the sweetness of the sauce should be a top priority to take this entrée from very good to excellent- it clearly has that potential. The Lodi Petite Sirah we drank during dinner was another big hit: unusually fruity for a petite sirah, it was sturdy enough to match up with the calamari without overwhelming the chopped salad appetizer. It is also available by the glass, as are several of the wines on the short but well-considered wine list, which we expect will expand a bit when the restaurant begins serving lunch and weekend brunches in February. Our server alerted us to the upcoming schedule additions by telling us that Whym will soon be \"the new hot spot for brunch,\" and if our visit is any indication, we have no trouble believing this prediction will come true. Whym, 889 Ninth Avenue (between 57th and 58th Streets), 212-315-0088

The eatery used to be the best place for good, wholsome American fare on 9th ave and now Whymm takes the reigns. This is by far the hippest, contemporary design on 9th ave. The food is excellent, the service strong, and the prices surprisingly reasonable(considering the high end decor and presentation). I just wished it was bigger, because there is allready a wait for tables.......sheeesh.

Stopped in last night for a 7pm reservation. Place was packed. The setup of the room is a bit cramped, so don't expect to have a quiet, personal conversation unless you snag one of the booths towards the back. Started off with the Calamari and the Duck Negamaki. The calamari was excellent, just as you had described. The duck negamaki was good as well, but the pomegranate glaze was a little too sweet. The duck itself was tender and moist, if a little anti-climactic. The scallions inside held a nice treat, as they had a nice char which reminded me of yakatori. I'd probably pass on this app next time. I had the pork chop as an entree, and must agree about the polenta. Everything from the intense sublety of the smoked mozzarella to the consistency of it was ethereal. The chop itself was also a star, perfectly cooked and devoid of almost all fat. My friend had the pan roasted cod entree. The fish was excellently cooked and seasoned, but was overshadowed by the absolutely masterful sundried tomato and asparagus risotto. Words can't describe the sublime risotto. It is a must have. Shame about the cod that accompanies it. It never had a chance.

I think, Scott and Joe, that we were really lucky just to score a table that opening weekend. Because you're both right that it's very busy these days. Not a bad thing, really. Joe, that cod dish was offered as a special when we went, so it looks as if it was popular enough to earn itself a promotion. Maybe they'll tinker with the cod though. It wouldn't surprise me.

Buttercup Bake Shop (UWS): Salvo or Squib?

***CONTENT
 You can't walk 50 feet in New York City without running into a cupcake. Over the past eight years, the one-handed gateau has taken over not just ours, but several other urban centers, toppling the scone, the muffin, and the danish as the new baked good of choice and driving the replacement of old-style bakeries with colorful boutique cupcake shops. If nothing else, the 2000's are going to go down in history as The Cupcake Decade, mark my words. And honestly, I don't mind. I love a good cupcake. I even love a pretty good cupcake when I'm hungry. But in a city where we're so spoiled for choice, I've started to feel as if I shouldn't have to brook cupcake mediocrity- all I need to do is stroll over to Cupcake Café or Magnolia Bakery for easy access to tremor-inducingly delicious treats. There is tough competition out there, and we sweet tooths are the beneficiaries. One player- some would say the main player-in the Frosting Wars is the Buttercup Bake Shop, founded by one of the original owners of the Magnolia Bakery. The Midtown East store has flourished there for the past six years, but very recently, there has been quite a bit of talk about expansion. Massive expansion. The company is apparently planning to open at least eight new locations during this calendar year, and if you visit their website, you'll notice that much of the content is about franchising. It's pretty clear that growth is the goal. The first franchise in the chain opened its doors very recently on 72nd Street on the Upper West Side, occupying a storefront that was once rented by Krispy Kreme. Now, after renovations, it no longer resembles its former incarnation, but with its floor-to-ceiling tiles and bright yellow hues, it feels instead like a Beard Papa themed bathroom. But decor aside, what matters here is the quality of the cakes. HungryMan, Chopper, and I purchased three flavors of cupcake last week and put them through a very thorough taste test and finger-licking protocol. We're disappointed that there wasn't more cause for finger-licking though, as we found one of the cupcakes very good, one merely OK, and one terrible. Let's start with the good news. The lemon cupcake was our favorite of the bunch: slathered very generously with a citrusy buttercream frosting, it possessed the best integration of flavors, with the lemon essence carrying through into the cake as well. The pale turquoise vanilla cupcake came a close second, tasting much like the lemon cupcake, just without the addition of the fruit flavor. In both cases, our complaints were the same: the frosting was far too sweet and insipid, tasting like nothing more than powdered sugar- it could have been exponentially improved with a dash or two more of salt. The devil dog cupcake did not have the same problem; its icing, a modified seven-minute, meringue frosting was excellent. Everything below the frosting, however, was not. The first problem was that the cake did not taste very much like chocolate- it was more brown-flavored than devil's food. The second, and much graver issue, was its very dry, crumbly, and frankly unpleasant texture. One bite of this cupcake and we all needed a swig of liquid. The dryness might have come from the age of the cupcake, a bad recipe, or overbaking, but whatever the cause, it ruined the cupcake utterly and completely. It feels so wrong to criticize such beautiful baked goods. I wish I could make cupcakes half that gorgeous in my kitchen. At the same time, I don't eat cakes and sweet treats because they look nice, I eat them for their taste. It's a pretty rudimentary principle, but it is one that Buttercup Bake Shop's 72nd Street location seems a little unclear about- I hope only temporarily. Buttercup Bake Shop, 141 West 72nd Street, 212-350-4144

[...] But not all of our starters were worth sharing: both Nosher’s Bibb lettuce salad and Pesactore’s black squid pasta were oversalted in the extreme-don’t get me wrong: we love salt and have been known to point out where there needs to be more of it (see our recent reviews of Levain and Buttercup Bake Shop). But it is also possible to use too much salt. In Thor's case, we started to think that someone in the kitchen might be trying to escape a run of bad luck by throwing the stuff over every shoulder. The pumpkin seed vinaigrette on the salad should have been a delicate counterpoint to the greens, but the seeds were dusted with salt and the entire mass was liberally sprinkled with fleur de sel, making the whole thing impossible to eat without frequent sips of water. Nosher's salad also suffered from being an entire head of Bibb lettuce served on a tiny plate, which forced him into contortions in an attempt to eat it. Pescatore's pasta was actually an order of magnitude more salty than Nosher's salad; Pescatore, who rarely complains, said he could barely taste the squid and scallops, let alone the other ingredients in the dish. And what a shame-the presentation and aromas made this seem like the most promising thing we ordered to being our meal. [...]

Big Burgers, Big Nick's

***CONTENT
 Walking into Big Nick’s on the Upper West Side is a lot like walking into a dive diner from a 1970s Woody Allen film: it’s crowded, with tables clotted close together, line cooks knocking elbows behind a counter while taking orders from sharp-tongued waitresses, all surrounded by walls lined with fading headshots of aspiring celebrity customers. There’s also the unmistakable odor of grease in the air to complement the cinematographic visuals. If this sounds a bit down-market, that's because it is- there's no denying that this is not Babbo. Big Nick’s is the kind of place that people walk by hundreds of times without going in (we certainly have), but because of its expansive sidewalk patio, which seats people pretty much year-round, it's also an Upper West Side eatery that everyone seems to remember, even if they don't venture inside. But as we found out this week, Big Nick's is a local landmark for good reason: its burgers. We know because Nosher, our friend Chopper, and I wandered in to Big Nick’s series of connected and cluttered dining rooms and set about ordering a cross-section of the restaurant's burger options. This is not as easy a task as it is at most diners, because Nick’s menu is so vast and varied. Resembling a playbill from a hit show further down Broadway, the menu covers everything in its 28 pages from Hot Grecian Style Spinach to Chicken Curry to Linguine Carbonara; it is almost as bulky as the menu at Shopsin’s, if quite a bit less adventurous. Big Nick's sticks to classic diner fare, and with a menu as large as this, even the most minor classic is represented. I ordered the Bistro Burger ($9.95), a hearty patty of Angus beef with mushrooms, onions and tomatoes poking out from under a drippy layer of melted gruyere. The meat was cooked to order and held up tolerably well to the mass of vegetables and cheese teetering on top of it. Too bad, then, that the toasted challah bread wasn't brawny enough to handle all of the fillings- the sandwich quickly became soggy, forcing me to my Plan B: that time-honored trick of inverting the burger so the thicker top bun sits on the bottom, all the better to soak up the juices. Thankfully, it worked. Crisis averted, burger saved. Chopper’s Big Nick Burger fared better, looking every ounce of its advertised half-pound and cooked over charcoal to medium rare. Nosher and I kept sneaking glances at those beautiful grill marks throughout the meal. Chopper also told us how an acquaintance of his has a habit of ordering the double-sized version of his burger, the Sumo Burger, because the leftovers feed him twice for $9.25. And I have no doubt that's the truth- even the Big Nick Burger probably could produce another meal. 8 ounces with no fillers is a lot of beef. Nosher, going meatless this evening, was the odd man out and ordered the Crabcake Burger from the Specialty Burgers section of the menu. Much better with ketchup than the over-salted ‘lobster sauce’ that came with it, the crabcakes were decent, but not great: the large, flat patties were made up primarily of lump crab meat (which is what we expected) and an awful lot of binder. They also tasted a bit too sweet- we wonder if the lobster sauce isn't intended to cut some of this with salinity. But despite those few faults, the crabcake was pretty good- better than what any of us expected from a diner that looks like a cross between a Pullman-era railroad dining car and a rabbit warren. We didn’t stay for dessert – and we didn’t try the pizza either, which we hear is also above average for the neighborhood and, depending on who you ask, for the city as well. I am sure that after a night out, we'll find our way back to Big Nick's and will be able to sample more of their offerings. Better yet, the restaurant is open 24 hours a day, so if we're ever struck by a wee-hours craving for a burger we can barely lift off the plate, we'll know just where to go.

I love Big Nick's - OK, so it's a cheesy dive, but that's part of its charm. The price is right and the food is surprisingly good. Plus, with a novel-sized menu, you can be sure everyone in your group will find something to eat. I can totally vouch for the pizza. Though I wonder what they do during that one hour that they close...

How Much Would You Pay? Capogiro Gelato

 Ten dollars for a pint of gelato is a lot of money, especially when it isn't being served in a restaurant. A $10 price tag really stands out when all the other pints of ice cream and sorbet are marked $3.99, $2.79, or even $5.49, and perhaps this is the gimmick intended to differentiate Capogiro from hundreds of similar products. We certainly took notice. At first, I thought the sticker was misprinted, but after asking two employees for confirmation, HungryMan and I began a debate over whether or not to buy the stuff. My argument: it cost ten dollars. His argument: by charging so much for their product, Capogiro was setting the bar incredibly high for themselves, and it would be quite a coup if they managed to clear it. You know already from the pictures that he won the battle, and we ended up with a pricey tub of gelato in our cart. So did Capogiro acquit themselves? In a word, no. That's not to say that the Rosemary Honey Goat's Milk gelato wasn't good. It was dense and buttery, with enough fat to support the volatile oils in the rosemary, and it had the milk-to-sugar ratio almost exactly right. The honey was also clearly distinguishable as a discrete taste component: something that is worthy of praise on its own. But as a whole, it tasted more like an ingredient that had been extracted from a more complicated dessert- it just was not transcendently good. The best indicator of this is that we had no trouble popping the top back on the pint after eating about 1/3 of it and putting it back into the freezer. Worse, it sat there for almost a week before we finished it. This kind of thing does not usually happen to frozen desserts around these parts. Hell, we ate a pint's worth of the durian ice cream before sticking it back in the freezer! But with the Capogiro, we just couldn't get excited enough about it to go back. While Capogiro Gelato Artisans, based in Philadelphia, offers several other really appealing-sounding flavors of sorbetto and gelato: burnt sugar, mint stracciatella, black walnut, to name just a few, I just can't fathom choosing a pint of this over a $7 pint of pretty much anything from Lower East Side kindred spirit Il Laboratorio del Gelato. I even have a hard time picturing myself choosing Capogiro over the cheaper and widely available Ciao Bella gelatos and sorbettos: there just isn't $10 worth of artistry in that tub, as gorgeous as the packaging may be. **Update coming soon (early February).

Thanks for the review! When I was at Il Laboratorio del Gelato yesterday, I was thinking about Capogiro as something else I should try...or not. The idea of a pint of ice cream sticking around for a week in my freezer is almost unfathomable, hehe. Once a friend and I a pint of Ben & Jerry's one night just cos we could. Haha.

While I agree $10 for a pint is crazy, I'll rant a bit about the goodness of Capogiro. I used to live in NYC but nowadays in Philly. I think sometimes store packaged ice cream tastes different and not as good than when it's scooped in the store. I've been to their stores here a couple of times and they have really amazing stuff. They have flavors such as Mexican Chocolate, Dark Chocolate (my favorite-so amazing), Almond, Bourbon Butterscotch, Lemoncello, Lime and Cilantro and Thai Coconut Milk. They have very unique flavors that change often, and I seriously think it's better than anything I've had in Italy (and I lived there for 6 months and probably ate gelato at a different place everyday). However, the best part of the store is that they willingly give you free sample after free sample-they almost push it on you. So really when I pay $5-6 for a tiny small I almost feel like I'm getting my money's worth because of its richness and all the free samples I got. I suggest if you're ever in town chekc out the store because you'll have a different experience and probably have a different opinion about this brand.

I am sure the gelato is better when it's closer to its source, but I still have to wonder how they can justify the steep cost. It really sounds as if they're building the cost of those \"free\" samples into the price of the product. Thanks for the thoughtful comment!

I own Capogiro Gelato Artisans and make all the flavors. I never expect to please everyone, who can? $10 is a lot and you should know why. Our milk is from a small Amish farmer in Gap, PA. It costs more wholesale than you pay retail for organic milk. It is from a single herd of grass fed, hormone free, med free cows. The cows are milked on Wednesday and I receive the milk on Thursday. The goat milk is from his neighbor. The honey is from a small bee farmer in Delaware. It is black and not so sweet and from Buckwheat. The rosemary is from a herb farmer in Lansdale. Every batch is only 1.3 gallons and each pint is hand packed. We make everything from scratch with nothing artificial and no preservatives. We stick to the season and pay a premium to small farmers. I know the quality and do not want to use cheaper, inferior products. They just do not taste as good. Gelato is far denser than ice cream. There can be up to 80% more \"food\" in your cup, rather than air. Rosemary Honey Goat's Milk is not my favorite either. Right now, the pomegranate is my favorite. I hate the fact that you walked away feeling cheated more so than the fact that you disliked the flavor. I can fix the flavor thing. I bet I can find something you like. I hope this shines some light on our pricing.

Stephanie, We really appreciate your comments; thanks for writing. Of course, we understand that your costs are higher than those of many other gelato makers. And honestly, we did feel that $10 was too much, especially here where we have such easy access to other sublime gelatos. Perhaps the premium cost becomes worth it if you are somewhere with no high-quality local options. Since that post, I've tasted two other flavors (one sorbetto and another gelato- paid for by friends, not by us) and while I did enjoy them a bit better than the Rosemary Honey Goat's Milk, I am still unconvinced about the price point. If we're in Philly though, we'll stop in and let you try to convince us. Nosher

Their sorberts are tasty but I agree the $10 price tag is a bit too steep for my blood. But I did once try their creme fraiche with candied kumquats gelato (bought it from a store) and it was amazing. My husband and I ate almost the whole pint in one sitting and the next morning when I woke up, I went to the freezer to finish it off because I could not stop thinking about it. But my huband had left it on top of the freezer, not IN the freezer. The dark chocolate I found amazing too.

Well, I'll add my name to the chorus of praise. I'm from New York, live in Montreal and have visited Italy often and have had excellent gelato in all of those places. For the past couple months, I've had the pleasure of working on a temporary project down the street from CapoGiro in Philadelphia. It's seriously the best gelato I've had anywhere (and trust me, I like my food and have had the occasion of tasting excellent gelato on more than one occasion.) The flavors are intense and the gelato is dense and silky. If you didn't enjoy it, I'd probably chalk it up to the shipping/time from source, etc., but as the man says, it's not really possible to please everyone. For what it's worth, here are my respective favorites in NYC and Montreal: Montreal: Bilobquet (Outremont), 1311 Rue Bernard Ouest New York: Cones, 272 Bleecker. CapoGiro, though, wins in my book.

Homemade from Start to Finish: Falai

***CONTENT
 Eating dinner in Falai’s display window is a lot like getting an unexpected upgrade to First Class: you’re pleased with yourself that you’ve got the special seat at the front of the plane, you’re ready to enjoy the pampering and the service, but you’re also self-conscious that all the pedestrians walking past you on their way to the back are thinking, surely, how ostentatious it all is. But don't think for a minute that we would rather have been sitting anywhere else on our recent visit to Iacopo Falai’s eponymous Lower East Side restaurant. Nosher, our new friend Chopper, and I were escorted up three small steps to what was once the former stationery store's showcase window. Yes, we had a few goldfish bowl moments with passersby, but on the other hand, and in a way unheard of at New York restaurants short of booking a private dining room, we were given a little sliver of near-privacy to help us enjoy Falai’s incredibly good cooking. Despite a misstep or two on the desserts, Falai served up just that: tremendously executed and conspicuously home-made food. The restaurant bills its food as all ‘fatto in casa,’ or made in the restaurant itself. No need here to ask if the gelato is home-made or brought in from Il Laboratorio down the street- if you're putting it into your mouth, it began life about 20 feet away from where you're sitting. Even the bread is made in house, although we understand that much of the baking burden is shifting to the recently opened Falai Bakery across the street, which will allow them to sell breads like our favorite, the black cabbage roll, a la carte or bookending a sandwich. Our meal began with an amuse-bouche of tender pasta spirals dressed in a light parsley-basil pesto. This set the stage for a trio of well-prepared small plates. Nosher ordered one of his favorites, Polipetti, or grilled baby octopus. Polpi can be difficult to get right, as any home cook knows; it jumps quickly from smooth and just barely toothsome to tough and rubbery. Here, it was grilled to precisely the right texture and served with a cannellini bean puree and a piquant oregano reduction. Nosher ranks this octopus among the best he's had in New York. Chopper's appetizer went down his gullet so quickly he barely remembers what was in it, but after some e-mail debriefing, we've worked out that it was two kinds of crisp flatbreads, chanterelle mushrooms, and a duo of foamy cream sauce and olive oil surrounding wedges of sweet potato. Chopper reports that the flatbreads were fantastic, balancing the softer textures of the vegetables with their sharp crunch. My chicken liver starter was just as successful. It was artfully served with a decadent chanterelle mushroom sauce over a crisp square of pan-fried polenta that, split down the middle, revealed a buttery center. The liver itself was other-worldly in its smoothness, and the whole thing was topped with an angle of toasted flatbread. My only complaint here is that the portion was smaller than I would have liked: something other reviewers have noticed as well. But we felt that this was the exception to our meal and not the rule, especially as regards the main dishes. Nosher's Garganelli arrived first, with its stark contrasting colors grabbing our attention like a young starlet used to hogging the stage. The pasta was cooked very al dente, with a firmness that only hand-made pasta seems to have, and was tinted a dark black from the addition of squid ink to the dough (a word to the squid-squeamish: you can't taste the ink). Accompanied by chunks of lobster, clams, shelled mussels, the concoction sat marinating in a briny and rich lobster bisque that tasted strongly but very pleasantly of tomalley. My duck entrée gave the Falai kitchen a chance to shine, although in this case, for completely different reasons. First, duck breast is easily overcooked, and can call unwelcome attention to itself if left relatively unadorned, as Falai has done here. But in the case of these sweet, fork-tender slices, the meat was cooked exactly to specification (medium rare) and stretched languorously over a bed of slippery-soft roasted red onions and soaked pears. Second, that purée!- a lozenge of broccoli rabe- which sounds strange but in fact lent the dish a vibrant vegetal flavor, not to mention its eye-popping green color. But perhaps the highlight of the night was Chopper's Gnudi. Often compared to (and confused with) gnocchi, gnudi have nothing to do with potatoes; instead, they are (usually) much larger and made from ricotta, cream, and a mix of other cheeses. Falai adds crema di latte and spinach, bathes it all in a 'nut-brown butter' sauce, and garnishes the dish with a few Flying Walenda sage leaves teetering on a gnudo or two. Picking up on a hint of cardamom that wasn't listed as an ingredient on the menu, Nosher remarked on the taste similarities between these gnudi and an unsweetened version of an Indian dessert like gulab jamun, but regardless of comparisons, Chopper's main was voluptuous and light. Given Iacopo Falai's reputation as a dessert master after his tenure as pastry chef at Le Cirque, it was curious that the only disappointments for us came during dessert. My Profitterols and Nosher's Millefoglie (the Italian versions of the French profiteroles and millefeuille, respectively) both suffered some problems. The paté choux in the profitterols was too dry and even a bit eggy in places, although the melted chocolate was very satisfying. Worse was the millefoglie's overpowering orange flower cream that made the experience of eating it like chewing on a doughnut soaked in perfume. Chopper's Napolitan baba gave us hope, however. Comprised of one round cake, soaked through with dark rum and poking up like Kilroy from a ceramic tea infuser, the dessert was adorably quaint. But don't let that fool you: the rum packed a solid alcoholic wallop and the sweetened, thickened cream made this every bit a grown-up sweet. Falai's wine list is an all-Italian affair that offers options across the price spectrum from the high 20s to the stratosphere. We quaffed a delicious Dolcetto D'Alba that is also offered by the glass- a rare treat, so order a glass if you've never tried it. The name means 'sweet little thing' in Italian, a phrase that we think could just as easily be applied to Falai itself, with its gorgeous food presentation and modern-yet-friendly jewel box interior. Falai, 68 Clinton Street (at Rivington Street), 212-253-1960

Posssibly the Best Latkes We Have Ever Eaten (Sorry, Bubbe)
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2006-01-02 04:23:00
***CONTENT
 If you have ever eaten a latke (potato pancake) in a restaurant and then tried to replicate the experience at home, you will know what I mean when I say that disappointment is part of the process. I don't care how good your recipe is, your latkes probably don't turn out like the tall, frisbee-sized discs at the 2nd Avenue Deli, Barney Greengrass, or Katz's. Generally, the home version of the latke game show involves flat, slippery, and brown rounds that would be better used as coasters than as dinner. So why bother? Many people don't. This time of year, you'll see huge stacks of potato pancakes at Eli's and Zabars-towers taller than a child- and people who have suffered through bad latkes in years past are willing to shell out $2-$4 per latke to avoid repeating the experience. Not that there's anything wrong with purchasing your latkes from a deli or a restaurant, but we'll let you in on a secret: with a little help, you can make better latkes at home. Seriously. Better. And they're easy too. Of all the recipes we've created and all the time we've spent cooking this past year, we are probably most proud of this one: not only are these latkes sublimely delicious, they are better than anything we've ever eaten in a Jewish deli in New York. And given the quality of the latkes at every place I've mentioned in this post, that is saying something. Our secret (no longer a secret) isn't a new ingredient but a slight departure from traditional latke methodologies: we take half the potatoes used and boil and mash them before adding them to the shredded potatoes. You can get away with using 1/3 of the potatoes, if you prefer lots of shreds, but frankly, the latkes that we have made with half-and-half combinations of potatoes have been very light and crisp. Yes, I did just use the word \"light\" to describe a latke, and I'm not lying. The pre-mashing of half the potatoes creates a natural matrix for very thick latkes and allows you to add a little architectural height to the pancake without adding bulk. When only shredded potatoes are used, they tend to spread, even with a substantial amount of egg and matzoh meal to bind the pancakes together. In this recipe, the height of the patty at the beginning is the height of the patty at the end- you are limited only by your imagination and supply of vegetable or corn oil! Just a few hints before you begin: (1) Be sure to use at least 1/4-1/2\" of oil and heat this oil to somewhere between 250°F and 320°F. This is a lower temperature than you'd normally use for deep frying, and that's because you're not really deep frying the latkes; you're shallow frying them. If the oil is too hot, the latkes won't cook properly in the middle. Our rule of thumb is that if the latkes are very slightly browned after 2 minutes, the oil is probably at the right temperature. You don't even need a frying thermometer. (2) Don't skimp on the squeezing! Wet shredded potatoes make slimy latkes. There's a picture of me squeezing the shredded potatoes (not the mashed ones) on our Flickr page, if you want to see what this looks like. (3) Use about 1 medium onion for every three potatoes or one large onion for four potatoes. If you like more oniony latkes, you can increase the onions by as much as half, as long as you double the amount of matzoh meal (or flour) you use. (4) Eat the latkes immediately after you make them, if you can. This is when they are best. If you really need to store them, freeze them, even if you're only keeping them for a day or so- refrigerating latkes makes them soggy and rubbery, but freezing preserves some of the original texture. If you do need to reheat them, do so in a toaster oven or regular oven and slowly increase the temperature until the latkes re-crisp. But honestly, you're fooling yourself if you think there are going to be any left to save. Just be ready with a fork and the sour cream! Mind-blowing Homemade Latkes 2 3/4 lbs. (1.25 kg.) white potatoes (about 4 medium potatoes) 1 large onion 2 eggs, well beaten 1.5 Tablespoons matzoh meal (or flour) 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon black pepper Peel and cut half of the potatoes into one-inch chunks. Boil in salted water until tender (about 20 minutes). Drain and pass through a food mill (or process smooth in a food processor). Sprinkle matzoh meal on top of this. In a large bowl, shred one large onion. Then shred both peeled potatoes into the onion, mixing together the potato shreds with the onion to keep the potato threads from discoloring. Squeeze as much liquid as possible from onion-potato mixture by placing the shredded vegetables into a piece of cheesecloth and twisting until no more liquid can be extracted. Return to large, dry bowl and add egg, pepper, and salt. Add the puréed/milled potatoes to the shredded potatoes and combine thoroughly. Form into palm-sized patties that are about 1/2 to 3/4 inches high. Fry these patties in 1/4 to 1/2 inches of corn oil (do NOT use olive oil) . The patties will need to cook for about 5 minutes on the first side, so if they do more than go slightly brown after a minute or two, your oil is too hot. Flip after five minutes with a spatula and fork and cook on the other side for about 2 minutes, or until dark golden brown. Drain thoroughly on paper towels. Serve with applesauce, salt, and sour cream. Makes approximately 10 latkes. 2005 nycnosh.com

I made your latke recipe last night and they were unbelievably scrumptious. I strongly urge anyone who needs a real treat to get your butt in the kitchen and make some now! I've tried numerous latke recipes and techniques and while some have been very good, these were by far the best yet. I had to cook them in two batches because I was concerned that if I tried to fit them all into the pan at once that the oil would cool down too much and leave them greasy. I served them with homemade applesauce and sour cream.
Nosher
2006-10-13 10:33:00
So glad they turned out well for you, Lisa! Mashing half the potatoes really makes a radical difference. Smart too, that you didn't cook them all at once- hot oil is key.

Hi Lynne, Good question. This recipe made about 10-12 for us recently, but it depends on the size of the latkes, of course. If I were having 24 people over, I'd probably triple this recipe and work with 2 pans of oil (just to make sure you're not in the kitchen for a month). Nosher

I made these for the first time this Hannukkah. They were easier to make than any of the other ones. I'm known for making good latkes, but this time, people were just raving about them. I have to say, I don't really like potatoes or greasy latkes, but I ate about 15 of them. They were out of this world. You should post recipes for briskets and other holiday treats. Thank you!!

Thanks Bonnie & Paula- we aim to please. We just made them for a celebration in Tampa and discovered just how important it is to keep a close eye on the potatoes. Don't let them get too waterlogged, or else you'll end up having to dry out the batter a bit with flour. Not the end of the world, by any means, but these latkes are always best when the potato mixture is as dry as a bone before the egg is added.

I make great latkes, but I will definitely give this recipe a try. Why not use olive oil though? Cause it will alter the flavor? I use olive oil for everything cause it is healthier and it works beautifully. So, why not olive oil?
Sharon

Nosher
2007-09-06 00:49:00
Hi Sharon, You could certainly use olive oil, but if you use the good stuff, it has a flavor that while pleasant enough, isn't really quite in the style of most traditional latke recipes. You can use other monounsaturated fats if you like, and if you want a totally neutral, very high smoke point oil, apricot kernel oil works very well. And yes, we have a great kugel-a sweet one-that we make every chance we get. It's not our own recipe though, so we'll add it to our list of dishes to play around with and see if we can create a perfect kugel!

Wow, you're not kidding! I tried this recipe and they are definitely the very best latkes I've ever tasted. I gave them a try ahead of time to see if maybe I'd like to make them for Hanukkah, and the answer is an enthusiastic YES! My husband doesn't want me to wait that long.

Fantastic recipe. We just fed them to nine college kids and every last one disappeared, and I made a mountain of them. My husband just said they were the best latkes he had ever had. Thanks for the recipe!

Hi: I am going to try my hand at this for the very first time. I am making these for my sons class. A little girl in his class is a little sad that we are not celebrating Jewish holiday's and I asked her her favorite treat this time of year and she said latkes. I hope I don't mess it up!

Hi -- I've been trying to make a good latke for years, but felt that I never had the right recipe. I plan to try yours. When you say \"shred,\" is this the same as grate? Can I do this by hand or does it have to be done with a food processor? Also, which do you prefer -- flour or matzoh meal? I used flour and baking powder in a different recipe for the first time tonight, but the latkes had a bitter taste. I don't know if it was the flour or the baking powder. Can't wait to try your recipe! Thanks! Judy

A Rising Austrian Star: Gruner Veltliner

***CONTENT
 Okay, so it sounds more like the name of some Euro-pop rock star ('Have you heard the new Gruner Veltliner album?') than a lesser-known European wine varietal, but that doesn't mean this wine should be underestimated or overlooked. Nosher and I have enjoyed several bottles of this Austrian wine recently and have been surprised by its accessibility, easy drinking, and affordability. Gruner Veltliner is by most accounts the most widely grown grape in Austria and, while its reputation has perhaps suffered from its ubiquity and a number of iffy vintages in the past, a growing number of winemakers are doing wonderful things with the stuff, especially in the Wachau, Kremstal, and Kamptal regions North-West and East of Vienna near the Czech Border. The wine is also known as Veltlinske Zelene in Czech- a pretty direct translation of its German name- but I don’t remember seeing much of it when I lived there in the mid-1990s. This is probably because over the past decade, vinification technology has gotten much better, and with these improvements have come new export markets for Gruner Veltliner, some just across the border to the Czech Republic, and some across a continent and an ocean to the USA. Here in New York, the wine is showing up on more and more restaurant wine lists, perhaps in an effort to show off the sommeliers' widely-cast wine nets. Nosher and I found a Gruner Veltliner on the wine list last month at Market Café, one that was typically fresh and light, and better yet, priced under $25. And this week, we picked up a bottle of 2004 H &M Hofer for a shocking $8.99 as part of our monthly wine foraging at Astor Wines. The bottle is unusual in that it is one liter in size (not 750 ml) and comes sealed with a crown cap (beer cap top)! No cork means that it's easy to open, making this wine perfect for parties. I found it a bit peppery and slightly citrusy– you can definitely see the comparisons with very dry German Reisling and even un-oaked Chardonnay. But it is the vegetal notes in the wine that make it perfect to pair with a wide range of food, including all kinds of vegetables. Jay McInerney, in his essay collection, Bacchus & Me: Adventures in the Wine Cellar, dedicates a whole chapter to Gruner Veltliner, in which he extolls the virtues of pairing the wine with shellfish as well as practically anything that grows in the dirt (“Gruner Veltliner Loves Vegetables”). McInerney may be better known for Bright Lights, Big City, but the man also knows his wine; this is a great book. And if you happen to be into eating lots and lots of vegetables right now in expiation for a Christmas binge or for plowing through a stack of Hanukkah latkes, this may be just the thing to help make your atonement go down easier. Gruner Veltliner, Weinget H und M Hofer 2004, available at Astor Place Wines and Chelsea Wine Vault. A nice selection of other Gruner Veltliners are also available online at Sherry-Lehmann.

 When Eater asked us last week to participate in their year-in-review project, HungryMan and I immediately started debating around the clock. Names were called, foul words were used, reviews were re-read and read again, and in one case, an extra meal was consumed (I know, poor us). But in the end, we managed to agree that we've both been lucky enough to eat some pretty phenomenal meals in restaurants this year. Some were expensive and some were amazingly cheap, but all of our year-end favorites have one thing in common: they all deserve another mention as 2006 comes into view. Enjoy! NYCnosh Restaurant Newcomer of the Year 2005: Falai. Our review is coming very soon to this space, but in advance of that, we can say that this dinner was one of this year's real highlights. Not to mention the fact that we got to eat at the coveted display window table. NYCnosh Restaurant Standbys of the Year 2005: (1) Market Café. When we have guests who want to eat well, but not too far from our Hell's Kitchen digs, we almost always end up at Market Café. The food is consistently excellent and the prices are even better. Plus, their wine list offers the best bargain bottles in the city, bar none. (2) Gennaro. The one place in town where we could leave the menus unopened on the table and still order well, Gennaro is a charmer. And if you don't like what's on offer one night, return the next to an all-new array of specials. (3) Shopsin's. Speaking of variety, you won't find a bigger selection of creative and well-prepared dishes anywhere in the world than at Shopsin's. It's entertaining just to read the menu- a thousand-item encyclopedia of Kenny Shopsin's culinary adventures- but if you really want the full experience, flip off your cell phone, grab a table, and chat with one of the many Shopsins who run the place. NYCnosh Restaurant Meal of the Year 2005: WD-50. For the tender pork belly alone, this meal ranks in our Top 5. But the real strengths of Wylie Dufresne's flagship restaurant lie in his twin abilities to reimagine classic dishes in altogether new forms and to kick their flavors swiftly up the backside and into the 21st Century. Foie gras served as a beet juice-filled 'bullet' delivered the shot across the bow that forced us to pay attention, and the onslaught of genuine innovation did not end until we had polished off our butternut ice cream and pumpkin seed cake. This won't be a Michélin one-star for long. NYCnosh Biggest Dining Surprise of 2005: Rosewater. We knew Brooklyn had great restaurants, but we never suspected that one of our very best meals of the year would happen on a nondescript stretch of Union Street in Park Slope, al fresco on a wooden patio. But we're so very glad it did. Ethan Kostbar's $48 tasting menu was an absolute steal- one that gave us the chance to see serious talent in action. Neighborhood of the Year 2005: [Or more precisely, \"If you could only have eaten in one NYC neighborhood in 2005, which would it have been?\"] Easy. The Lower East Side. As much as we want to plump for our own beloved H.K., in our heart of hearts, we know that the LES has our home turf beat. For now, at least. With all three Wylie Dufresne restaurants (including Alias, another of our favorites), Il Laboratorio del Gelato, Gus's Pickles, Falai (and its new satellite bakery), Yonah Schimmel Knishes, and Sugar Sweet Sunshine Bakery (to name only a few), the Lower East Side is our own personal Temptation Central. If we moved to Orchard Street, we'd weigh 400 lbs. more. Apiece.

Wylie DuFresne opened both 71 Clinton and Alias, and from what we've heard, still has a hand in both (although a silent one).

Gingerbread: The Seasonal Anti-Cookie

***CONTENT
 We are back from our holiday hiatus. On with the nosh! Everywhere you look at this time of year, you see cookies. Even our last post was all about cookies, and we weren't even aware that we had unconsciously played into the theme. But right around now, during the very last sip from December's glass, it's easy to feel a little cookie-fatigue. Our solution is to channel our baking inspiration into other equally seasonal efforts such as coffee cake, sticky buns, and my personal favorite, gingerbread: a dense and moist spice cake that tastes like it was invented for the wintery months. This is also one of the desserts that I missed desperately when we were living in England, as molasses is nearly impossible to find, even in London's specialty supermarkets. There is a British near-equivalent called black treacle, which tends to taste quite a bit like dark corn syrup. Black treacle isn't a perfect substitution* because it lacks much of the complexity of molassses. During sugar cane processing, molasses is created as the residue that forms as pure sugars are removed and turned into crystals and powders- the result is a very black, very viscous liquid that retains a high concentration of nutritious minerals as well as a hint of bitterness. In baked goods, it imparts sweetness (even though it's a by-product, it still contains 48-57% sugar), but much more importantly, it gives a richness and depth to spice flavors, especially allspice, mace, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg. It also darkens batters and doughs so that when they are baked, they do not need to stay in the oven as long to achieve an appealing brown color. This gingerbread recipe is adapted from one my mother used when I was a child. It has, over time, mutated and morphed into a different creature than it was when it was extracted from a Betty Crocker cookbook in the 1970s- and I think it's far better for it. Since coming to New York, HungryMan and I have experimented with the spice mixture, screen testing a few new guest stars and axing a few that didn't make much impact. One surprise addition to the mix, inspired by our friend Lunch Lady's adventurous use of spice in her chocolates, is black pepper, which gives the cake a tiny zing of its own and really amplifies the aromatics in the ginger and cloves. You can certainly leave it out if you like, but I love the tingle it provides. You should be aware that this recipe produces a batter that is thinner than most cake batters, so don't worry if the mixture looks runny at the end. Also, be careful not to let the cake burn: according to my mother, \"Nothing smells worse than burnt gingerbread. Oh God.\" You have been warned. But don't let that dissuade you- gingerbread is so perfect for this time of year, especially topped with a sprinkle of powdered sugar and accompanied by a cup of coffee (or milk). Best of all, it's not a cookie. *I did manage to engineer a pretty acceptable workaround to the black treacle/molasses problem: For every cup of molasses required, add 1/4 teaspoon of instant coffee powder to 1 cup of black treacle. Stir it in and let it sit for 5 minutes or so to help the powder dissolve a bit. This approximates some of the slight bitterness and mineral complexity of molasses, and in baked goods it is nearly indistinguishable from the real thing. Gingerbread New York Style 2 1/3 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar 3/4 cup molasses 1/4 cup corn syrup (light or dark) 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon allspice 1 teaspoon ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon finely ground black pepper 3/4 teaspoon salt zest from 1/2 of a medium orange 1/2 cup shortening or European butter 1 egg 3/4 cup hot water Preheat oven to 325°F. Grease and flour one 9\" cake pan or 9\" square baking pan. You can also use a springform pan here. Combine all dry ingredients in mixing bowl. Add egg, molasses, corn syrup, and begin mixing on low power. Add hot water and continue to beat all ingredients on medium speed for three minutes. Pour the batter (it will be a bit runny) into the pan and bake for about 50 minutes to an hour, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack and do not remove from pan until ready to serve. 2005 nycnosh.com

Thanks, Nosher! I'm on a personal quest to replicate my grandmother's gingerbread. I'll give yours a try over the weekend. My most recent attempt was a Mollie Katzen recipe that involved grated fresh ginger root briefly sauted in butter. It really gave it zing. A little too much. Maybe your Mom's black pepper is the answer.

Let Them Eat Cookies: A Change of Royalty at Ruby et Violette

***CONTENT
 We are very lucky to live close to Ruby et Violette, surely one of the most fabulous cookie emporia in all of New York. Named after Wendy Gaynor’s daughters, this is one serious chocolate cookie operation. It started in Ms Gaynor’s Manhattan kitchen in 1989 and quickly grew into a sizable operation supplying gooey and unusually flavored cookies to luxury department stores and mail order catalogs. When we recently chatted with her in the company's dollhouse-sized 10th Avenue storefront, she told us how she leased the inexpensive space several years ago expecting to be busy with wholesale orders but, to her surprise, despite its far west location, most of her business has been retail: from neighbors like us and from growing street traffic as Hell’s Kitchen gentrifies, not to mention from the foodies making their pilgrimages from locations near and far. Nosher and I had heard about Ruby et Violette when we were still living in London three years ago, thanks to a very complimentary piece in The New York Times Magazine. The best thing about the article was that it also included a recipe for the shop’s ‘Perfect’ Chocolate Chip Cookies, and this quickly became our chocolate chip cookie recipe of choice– one that astounded all our British friends who believed that the store-bought ‘American-style’ cookies from Waitrose were the pinnacle of our country's baking achievements. Thank Ruby et Violette for a little impromptu ambassadorial work. Once in New York, we quickly grew to love stopping by the Ruby et Violette shop, sometimes sneaking cookie breaks in the middle of the day up to several times a week (sshhh, don’t tell anyone!). Our favorites include the malted milk cookie, with its strong malty flavor balancing the large, hand-cut chunks of semisweet chocolate, and the rose-flavored cookie which, unlike almost any other rose petal flavored food I’ve tried, is not overwhelmed by a powerful rosewater flavor and instead has a soft, background taste of rose that accents the dark chocolate perfectly. Perhaps most surprising is our love of the lemon-white chocolate cookie, which Nosher, normally not a fan of white chocolate, actually likes well enough to ask for in advance. These days, it seems that change is coming to Ruby et Violette. With success comes a lot of other obligations, and Ms. Gaynor, happy to make small batches of cookies in the back of her small store, is ready to move on. She has just sold the store to a 70-ish year old mystery investor, who has agreed to retain her original recipes and work towards a significant expansion of the current store into space next door or nearby. There is even talk of franchising or further expansion both within and outside of New York. The new owner expects to take over day-to-day operations after the New Year; in the meantime, Ms. Gaynor is still at the store, but only for a few more days. So hurry in and say hello (and goodbye) before her reign as the real Queen of Chocolate Chips draws to an end. UPDATE Wendy Gaynor (the owner of R&V) wrote us a comment to let us know that apparently they've changed their minds about selling the shop. Here's the text of what she wrote: Ruby et Violette is not being sold to a mysterious 70-ish man…our plans have changed. Come by the bakery and say hello. Happy New Year! Wendy Gaynor Can't wait to hear what happened to prompt this change in direction! Ruby et Violette, 457 West 50th Street (at 10th Avenue), 877-353-9099

Kasadela: A Reason to Go East
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-12-20 20:23:00
***CONTENT
 Japanese food, to most Anglo diners, is synonymous with one of three things: sushi, noodles, or tempura. We were as guilty as anyone of this conflation before we started exploring our old neighborhood in London, a little enclave near the Finchley Road Tube stop that brought together Serbs, Poles, Mancunians, and Japanese in approximately equal measure. Our favorite grocery store (especially where produce was concerned) was a place called 'Natural Natural' that always seemed to have scandalously good prices on onions and pumpkins. They also had a miniature cafe at the front, popular mainly with Japanese tourists and workers, where the shop's chef prepared octopus (grilled and in balls), filets of fresh pork and chicken, and long caramelized tranches of eel with tiny tofu cubes dotting their tops. This little grocery is where we were taught just how much more there is to Japanese cuisine than salmon rolls and udon. Credit Kasadela for teaching us a few new things. After first hearing about the restaurant from a friend who lives in the Lower East Side, we took our first trip east on 11th Street very early this year and have gone back as often as possible since then. The thing about Kasadela is that they hook you quickly: almost everyone orders the black edamame (which disappeared from the menu for a short time but have now returned) to snack on while perusing the menu, not realizing that they are cooked in some sort of habit-forming brine. Once you have eaten a few beans, you won't be able to stop thinking about them. Perhaps ever. They're called 'black' because the beans themselves are sheathed in a very thin skin that is darker than that of most soybeans; the name is an exaggeration, as the beans are not even forest green, but they do taste much richer and more buttery than normal edamame. Also, unlike edamame in almost every other restaurant, these are never dry and never slimy inside. Each time we visit Kasadela, HungryMan and I try to order two appetizers, no matter how hungry we are. It's not so much that the small plates are better than the larger ones, but more that because Kasadela is a true izakaya-equal parts a bar and dining establishment-the kitchen really knows how to prepare excellent snacks and finger foods. It would be a shame to skimp on these, so we occasionally even order three appetizers and a single entrée item. This week, when HungryMan and I popped in for a pre-WYSIWYG Talent Show meal, we were delighted to see that a few new appetizer specials awaited us. One was the Kasadela Hiyayakko: a long rectangle of cold tofu garnished with chiffonaded shiso leaves, green onions, seaweed, and a spicy red sauce. The astringent shiso and the very mild heat of the sauce emphasized the tang of the tofu, while its mineral flavors were brought out by the seaweed. I'd call this a master class in garnish. One of our old favorites is the goma tofu- we order it every time we go to Kasadela, and for good reason. Goma (sesame in Japanese) tofu is a cool, very slightly grainy flan made not from soybeans, but from sesame, sake, and kudzu starch. Eaten wiith the accompanying wasabi and soy broth, it tastes like a delicate, savory tahini pudding. It is worth ordering just to taste another genus of tofu, one with the fragility of a custard. As a main dish, HungryMan opted for the steak teppanyaki special, an iron-grilled fillet of thin steak slices that were once again garnished with panache: this time with matchstick slices of green apple and zucchini, all capped with a tiny mound of watercress leaves. Normally, I think of teppanyaki cooking as a style that showcases the seared flavors of meat to the neglect of everything else (think Benihana). But HungryMan's entrée was more of a rare beef salad that played with textures and aromas to great effect. Tart green apples might not be a traditional companion to grilled beef, but after eating this, we think they should be. For my main, I chose the rock shrimp donburi- another big favorite in the NYCnosh camp. This dish is a steamy sauteed concoction of shoyu, dashi, mirin, onions, juicy rock shrimp. The mixture is served over a bowl of rice, drenching it in the salty broth, and then finished with the addition of a beaten egg that cooks completely in the bowl. At Kasadela, the donburis are topped with a few shreds of nori seaweed and a sprinkling of hot pepper flakes. If rock shrimp isn't your style, there are also chicken, vegetable, and eel donburis that are all just as good. In warmer months, HungryMan and I order from the Grilled or Fried Dishes sections of the menu, but in the winter, especially when the temperatures fall below freezing, I find donburi warm and soothing. I've saved the best information for last: Kasadela's most expensive entrée costs $10.00. It is easy to sit for a few hours, snacking and talking, drinking Kirin, Asahi, or one of the dozen sakes on the drinks menu, and still escape without spending more than $20 or $25 per person. According to Kasadela's own website, such izakaya establishments sit on practically every urban street corner in Japan. I confess to being a little jealous of this- I imagine the world would be a much better place if we all had a Kasadela just down the street. But I'm just happy that there is one within easy reach on the Lower East Side. Kasadela, 647 11th Street (close to Avenue C), 212-777-1582

 Here, in a city with such a strong Italian heritage, you might think that excellent Italian restaurants would abound. Before coming to New York City, I believed just that- I pictured myself popping out to the corner Italian bistro every week or so for a gorgeous meal that I could never prepare at home. But the reality is that New York is home to a lot of really disappointing Italian cooking, much of it ironically in Little Italy. I really have never figured out why this is the case, especially with the easy access Gothamites have to the best-quality ingredients, imported and domestic. Because of this confusion, it took HungryMan and me months to locate the good stuff in NYC. Of course, there's always the Babbo option, but most of us mortals can't afford weekly visits to a Mario Batali establishment, as much as we'd like to do so. What we were searching for is more in the mold of what you find in Milan or Rome: a casual restaurant with excellent food and a sensitivity to seasonal freshness of ingredients (something you will rarely see on Mulberry Street). Luckily for us, at a dinner party around this time last year, HungryMan sat opposite a Fran Drescher doppelganger and joined her in an animated conversation about the poor state of Itailan food in the city. He came home that night telling how this woman kept cawing, \"Gennaro! Gennaro! You haaave to go to Gennaro! Just bring cash- they dont take caaaads.\" How could we resist? We did what we were told. I count this as one of the wisest moves we made in the past 12 months, because since that time, Gennaro has become our standby restaurant. When all other options fail, we know that we can always hop into a cab going up 10th Avenue and be eating well in 10 minutes. It wasn't until we sat and talked about the restaurant in these terms that we realized how this was a turning point for us: having an Old Faithful dining spot is what makes urban life manageable for a foodie. Once you find it, you wear a groove in its floorboards, stake out a favorite table, and if you're very lucky, eat several dozen good meals there. We're working on doing this at Gennaro. Part of the appeal is the antipasto platter, which is a muscly affair that serves at least two people- three or four if you're each ordering main dishes. This appetizer is served on an elevated ring stand that holds the platter eight inches or so above the table- there's a candle underneath, ostensibly to keep the plate warm, but it doesn't need it. The height just adds to the drama of the platter, which is covered from end to end with an assortment of appetizers. There are always a few bruschette and a pile or two of juicy black olives, frequently several slices of golden grilled fennel and strips of marinated eggplant, and occasionally discs of roasted onion. We've also seen rock shrimp, white bean salad with fresh rosemary sprigs, tuna in oil, and a caponata dotted with pine nuts. But the antipasto changes with the season. What doesn't change is how superb it is- not to mention filling. Our strategy has been to order the antipasto and one entrée (two if we're ravenous). That is almost always plenty of food for us when we're alone. But another of Gennaro's charms is its specials- they make it hard to resist ordering more food than you could possibly eat. On any given day, the number of special main dishes usually approaches or exceeds the number of permanent menu fixtures. Waiting tables at Gennaro must be a little like acting in a play whose script is being rewritten before each performance. To their great credit, the waitstaff always seem to know not only what the day's featured dishes are, but what is in them and how they are prepared- no small feat. On our visit this week, we were offered five appetizer specials and five main dish specials, several of which featured zucchini, endive, and cauliflower (all in season right this very moment). It's pointless to go into Gennaro with a plan that extends beyond the antipasto platter- inevitably, the specials woo you away. Case in point: this past January, we took Captain Nosh and Noshingtonienne for their first Gennaro meal with the intention of suggesting that the Captain order the Stinco di Agnello, a braised lamb shank served over couscous. Wishful thinking. When he and I heard about the special appetizer of sardines stuffed with golden raisins, rosemary, bread crumbs, and Italian parsley, we begged the chef to make us each a main-dish sized portion. He did, and since that day, those grilled sardines have become the stuff of legend. It's like our own Beowulf, but a little fishier. On our most recent trip to Gennaro, HungryMan ordered the special beef ravioli sauced very lightly in a rough and chunky marinara. Unsurprisingly, it was lush and tender. Ordering one of the smaller mains was probably a wise decision; my own choice of the special seafood risotto was too much food as a sequel to the massive antipasto platter. Nevertheless, it was delightful, with mussels, shrimp, and squid interspersed throughout. I also found the chopped radicchio to be a genius addition; it gave a very slightly bitter punch to the rice, a perfect counterpoint to the sweet sautéed onions. You may never see this risotto again, as it was a special item, but if you do, don't hesitate to order it. Wine at Gennaro is also very reasonable, with several bottles hovering around the $20 price point (including a delicious Montepulciano d'Abruzzo) and many more at around $30 and up. Coffee is very good, and desserts are great, but it's a rare visit that finds us hungry enough to order it. That'll be part of our long term Gennaro plan, I think- paring down our main dish orders so that we can peck away at the desserts. There are usually a few dessert specials in the mix, as well, so perhaps we're setting ourselves an unreachable goal. But I can't think of one I'm more looking forward to failing at than this one. Gennaro, 665 Amsterdam Avenue (between 92nd and 93rd Streets), 212-665-5348

A Rustic Fruit Tart for All Seasons

***CONTENT
 Leftover pastry dough from Thanksgiving pies has been taunting me for a few weeks now. Every time I open the freezer, I see those discs there and think to myself that I really ought to use them. But I haven't been in the mood for a pie recently. So when I heard that we were going to have a late-afternoon surprise visit from Lady Film Editor (recently promoted), I pulled one of the packets out of the freezer and went hunting for something to bake. In the end, I turned to an old favorite that I used to make for HungryMan years ago- the rustic [some might call it ugly] fruit tart. It's such a versatile recipe that works with most fruits. Plus it really does look impressive, even though it's not baked in a pie tin. Perhaps the best way to describe this dessert is as a mound of fruit set into a pastry bowl. The fruit collapses down, leaving a free-form, open-faced treat with brown and sugary pastry sides. I've made this recipe with apples, peaches, apricots, blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, cherries, pears, raisins, and once with gooseberries- the only warning I have is that the filling always manages to find its way out of the tart, so bake it on a cookie sheet or a pizza pan with raised sides. The last thing you want is for the filling to drip onto the bottom of your oven and generate smoke! When I've used only very wet fruits (blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, gooseberries), I have found that it helps to put a piece of aluminum foil underneath the tart and turn up the foil's edges to keep the excess juices from spilling out too much. They'll boil and brown along the exterior perimeter of the tart, but that's OK- the juices taste delicious and can be spooned back over the top of the tart (into the hole) as it is cooking, if you want to try to keep all the liquid inside, where it belongs. A few things to keep in mind: (1) Measure fruit in volume, not weight, wherever possible. I try to use about 3 cups of fruit, but don't worry too much if you aren't precise, because... (2) Fruit collapses substantially when it cooks, so even when you think there is too much in the tart, it should still work. (3) If you're using fruits without much natural thickener (i.e. anything except apples), you'll need to include either corn starch, arrowroot powder, or finely ground tapioca to keep the juices from remaining runny after the dessert cooks. As heretical as it might be to some cooks, I prefer corn starch- it has no taste and thickens a phenomenal amount of liquid- just sift it first to keep out the lumps. Oh, and about the tart in the picture: HungryMan, Lady Film Editor, and I ate the whole thing in one sitting. It's that good. Nosher's Rustic Fruit Tart approximately 3 cups fruit (if using stone fruits, chop them roughly) 3-5 tablespoons sugar (to taste) 1 teaspoon cinnamon or allspice 1-2 teaspoons sifted corn starch (use more for wetter fruits) pie crust dough (enough for a 9-inch single-crust pie) milk and sugar for the outside of the tart Combine fruit, spice, and sugar in a large bowl. Sprinkle or sift corn starch over the mixture and stir to insure that the fruit is coated completely. Roll pie dough into a 14-inch round (it will be thinner than pie dough normally is) on a very lightly floured surface. Mound about 2/3 of the fruit into the center of the round. Fold the sides of the dough up and into a rough bowl shape to hold the fruit, pinching and sealing any holes that appear. Pile remaining fruit into the center hole, pressing gently on the mound to keep it stable. When all the fruit is in place, brush the outside of the pastry with milk, and then sprinkle sugar over the milk. Bake on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper or aluminum foil in a 375° F oven for 45 minutes to an hour. Be sure to watch the tart carefully and remove juices that boil out (you can return them back into the center of the tart, if you like). Let the tart cool for 5 minutes on a wire rack before serving. 2005 nycnosh.com

Nosher
2005-12-15 14:14:00
Yes, absolutely. Rhubarb works really well in this tart. I always combine it with another fruit (apricot is my personal favorite) and add a few extra tablespoons of sugar to make sure the rhubarb absorbs it, but there's no reason not to use it! And you're right- it is very easy to do.

Valomilk: It's All About the Goo
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-12-10 16:25:00
***CONTENT
 Valomilks were my candy obssession for the better part of a year, despite the fact that I had never tried one. I first read about them in Steve Almond's very entertaining Candyfreak: A Journey through the Chocolate Underbelly of America, but because I was several thousand miles away in England at the time, my chances of finding these micro-batch candies were slimmer than my chances of winning the lottery. If you think I'm exaggerating, I'll offer two pieces of evidence that Sifers Valomilks are rarer than a David Foster Wallace essay without footnotes. First is the fact that even Dylan's Candy Bar- a shop that sells just about every regional US candy you can name, from Abba Zabas to Sky Bars-struggles to keep Valomilks in stock. They receive a box or two every few months, and when all 24 pieces sell out, the wait begins again. This means that sometimes, Valomilks are on the shelf for a scant few hours a month. Second is this telling excerpt from Candyfreak: [Russ, the owner of Sifers] checked the production schedule taped to the wall outside his office. It listed each day, followed by the word cook or a blank space. The inventory as of that day was one box. When Russ told people that Valomilks were made to order, he meant it. But the appeal of the Valomilk for me has always been its biography, not its rarity. The official story is that a Sifers employee with a penchant for sneaking sips of the highly alcoholic vanilla extract bungled a batch of marshmallow filling intended for another candy. Russ's father capitalized on this happy accident and poured the runny white filling into chocolate cups and named it after its ingredients: VAnilla, marshmalLOw, MILK. And with that, a star was born. It's not a fortuitous mistake on par with the discovery of penicillin, for example, but it illustrates the same principle that wonderful things can come from failure. So I loved the idea of the Valomilk before I'd even eaten one. Yes, I'm guilty of romanticizing my confections. So sue me. Fortunately, the candy itself is exceedingly good. Figuring out how to eat it without making too much of a mess is a puzzle, but if you just throw caution to the wind and resign yourself to a goopy chin (and collar, shirt, hands, sofa...), you'll enjoy the experience more. Or you could wear a bib. No shame in that. The filling tastes of high quality vanilla and has a depth of flavor that I imagine the perfect marshmallow would- better still, there is no hint at all of any kind of chemical additive to it. The Valomilk tastes remarkably like something you might make in your own kitchen, if you had the time and the hundred gallon copper pots to do it in. The chocolate is decent, but I have to admit that I don't enjoy milk chocolate very much, so my focus was on the drippy concoction spilling out everywhere as I ate. And I think that's the goal of a Valomilk: the chocolate cup is the delivery mechanism, and a pretty tasty one, but the true soul of this candy is the goop. Valomilks aren't cheap: each package of two cups costs $1.99 at Dylan's Candy Bar- if you're lucky enough to find them, that is. But frankly, they are worth every penny- you'd pay as much or more for imported specialty candy. More to the point, with a few packages of Valomilks in hand, you can share with your friends while telling the story of how the runny snack they're munching was accidentally invented by a boozy Kansan with a serious weakness for vanilla essence.

I LOVE Candyfreak! I'm not actually a candyfreak but reading about them made me curious about a few old-time American candies, which I picked up at Economy Candy. No Valomilks, although I'd love to try one. It seems like you're best off eating it by putting the whole thing in your mouth at once, like the creme brulee truffle from Kee's Chocolate. Man, why doesn't someone make a marshmallow truffle? :O

Valomilk...I'm convinced I could be in a homicidal rage and all it would take to get me out would be the name alone...Valomilk. They have been my drug of choice since I first had one when I was a small, small child. Valomilk used to be oh so plentiful back then...so plentiful they even showed up in Halloween bags. (And were promptly hid from my mother and brother.) Halloween bags! People gave them to you for free! Life in the 50's was glorious! Now, even though I live a scant five miles from the holy shrine where they are made, I am sorry to say they are as rare in their hometown as they are halfway across the country. When I need to get my fix, I trek to a local Cracker Barrel and buy them out, this time hiding them from my teenage son. Russell Sifers is a god and the Sifers family all deserve sainthood.

Mandoo Bar's Peep Show on 32nd Street
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-12-08 05:10:00
***CONTENT
 Koreatown is one place in Manhattan that everyone should visit at least a few times, but somewhere that many lifelong New Yorkers never think to go. Literally overshadowed by the Empire State Building, people walk right through it without recognizing the urban treasures they are neglecting. Most importantly, there's some fantastic food in this little quadrant from 31st to 36th Streets between 5th Avenue and Broadway, much of it on the sparklingly lighted stretch of 32nd Street. Even better still, this is one area that provides pedestrians with a little street entertainment in the form of shopfronts that allow you to peek inside and watch people pulling noodles, chopping onions, and best of all, assembling mandoo. If you've never heard of them, mandoo are filled dumplings about the size of a ping pong ball- they're similar to big wontons with a slightly more doughy skin. Several of the restaurants in Koreatown make their own mandoo, but only one, Mandoo Bar, lets you watch the entire process from dough rolling to filling. HungryMan and I have both stood in the doorway of this establishment at least a dozen times over the past year, marveling at the speed and skill of the women (it's always women when we visit) who tuck the little green, orange, and white mandoo skins into the folds of their thumbs and firmly press a spoonful of ground meat or seafood inside. It's almost hypnotic to watch. This week, our friend TVGal met us for dinner a few blocks south of Koreatown and suggested (with no prompting) a quick meal at the Mandoo Bar. And quick is precisely what we got. The instant we sat down at the table, we had two small bowls of banchan in front of us: one containing cubes of daikon radish in a chili-vinegar sauce, and the other a preserved gourd pickle. We nibbled at them as we read the menu, which includes the greatest hits of Korean dishes as well as several mandoo and noodle dishes that are more difficult to find elsewhere. Never having eaten fried tofu in a Korean restaurant- I usually think of this as a Chinese or Japanese specialty- we started our meal with something new. Korean fried tofu ($3.99) is pan-fried in very little (if any) batter or flour, and is always prepared in slices, as opposed to cubes. This gives the bean curd an almost eggy, crisp crust that is as thin as a sheet of paper. The hot sauce, soy sauce, and chopped scallions add more than enough flavor to enliven the tofu without overwhelming its subtlety. In the end, this dish felt much more substantial and filling than the less healthy deep-fried versions I am used to eating. I could certainly have made this my main dish, had I been so inclined. But I had mandoo on my mind. I didn't have to wait long for them, either. Three or four minutes after ordering the ten seafood mandoos ($7.99), they arrived still wet from the pot and glistening. The orange dumplings on a blue plate certainly made for a visually arresting contrast, which may well have been the intention, as the dish was otherwise completely ungarnished and unadorned. That's not a problem when the mandoo are this good- from the very first bite, I knew I'd eat them all. Each one contained at least one shrimp, and several also offered up nuggets of cooked squid- there was no skimping on the seafood here. Even without any sauce, these seafood mandoo tasted rich, fresh, and complex. With a tiny dab of kochu jang (red hot sauce), they popped and jumped inside my mouth. Then, all too quickly, they were gone. In the meantime, HungryMan ordered the japchae ($8.99), a stir-fry of glass-noodles and vegetables. Normally a safe bet for vegetarians, this version of japchae featured thin slivers of pork. Unsurprisingly, this posed no problem for HungryMan, who even went so far as to say that the added pork improved the japchae and made it more perfectly suited to a bracingly cold December evening. TVGal took a different route and, on the recommendation of the waiter, ordered the mandoo soup ($7.99), a pellucid brew of pork, pork mandoo, and shaved seaweed slices. It looked impressive, and did contain eight freshly made dumplings, but as with many clear broth-based Korean soups, it teetered on the edge of blandness. As part of a larger meal that achieves the traditional Korean balance of flavors, I imagine this soup would have fit in nicely, but as the main part of TVGal's dinner, it could have used an intensifying kick or two. But this is a small complaint about what was an otherwise very solid meal. All the more impressive that three of us ate manifestly fresh food for about $18 a person, including beer, tax, and tip. I can't think of many restaurants in this city where the same can be said, and even fewer where it's as much fun to stand outside and wait for a dining companion to join you.

From New York to Bermuda for Ginger Beer
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-12-06 13:27:00
***CONTENT
 Just this week, I took a short business trip to Bermuda, a wonderful place to travel with New York so newly cold and snowy. A surprisingly short hour and a half flight from the city, Bermuda is toasty warm (it’s still in the mid 70s most days this time of year), sunny, and free from the crowds, noise, and grime of New York. People really do walk around in coat & tie with Bermuda shorts, and the buildings, at least in Hamilton, the major town on the island, really are pink with gleaming white roofs. Unfortunately, the food scene on the island is nothing to write home about: Bermuda restaurants all seem to cater to distracted travelling businesspeople on expense accounts. In fact, the most interesting nosh I found on Bermuda was not in its restaurants at all, but in its shops and grocery stores: Bermuda, like many Carribbean islands, makes its own version of ginger beer that is out of this world. When in Bermuda, the brand to get is Barritts Ginger Beer, a spicy, sweet, and tangy concoction that they sell by the caseload, and will ship to homesick Bermudians abroad. Barritts, like other ginger beers, is nothing like Canada Dry, Schweppes, Seagrams, or even Boylan ginger ales. Instead, Barritts presents an extra-fierce kick of ginger, one that might make the uninitiated tear up or cough when sipping too quickly or sniffing too deeply (we learned this the hard way!). The intensity of the ginger can take some getting used to, but once you’re acclimatized, you’ll wonder why you ever drank anything else. Barritts claims the ginger concentration is achieved through fermentation in vats of Bermuda stone, a honey-colored volcanic rock found everywhere throughout the island and likely what’s holding up all those pink structures. Barritts is the base for the Dark and Stormy, a combination of ginger beer and dark rum that serves as Bermuda’s national drink. As great a combination as this is, Nosher and I both think ginger beer goes better with Scotch, as unorthodox as that sounds. The inspiration for this combo comes from years of drinking the seasonal whiskey and ginger wine that appears across the UK around this time of year. Ginger beer works just as well (and perhaps even a little better), cutting some of the whiskey's harsh peaty taste with its mix of aggressive bubbles and spice. We've dubbed our new favorite drink the Bermuda Sleighbell and have included a quick how-to below. In New York, you can buy Barritts at Whole Foods Markets, and there are also several beverage supply companies that import the stuff, so if you keep an eye open at Caribbean markets you should be able to use the genuine article. If you want to go the direct route, ginger beer is available online through Beveragesdirect.com (at $19.99 for a 12-pack of glass bottles). If you follow the instructions, you'll almost be able to imagine yourself sitting there on Front Street, sipping and looking out over the harbor and the Atlantic Ocean beyond. The Bermuda Sleighbell 1 full measure (1.5 Tbsp.) scotch whiskey (use blended, not the good single-malt stuff here) 4-6 oz. Barritts ginger beer (or strong ginger ale like Vernor's) lemon slice Fill a lowball glass very full with ice. Add whiskey and pour ginger beer over ice slowly. Mix very gently with a spoon. Garnish with lemon slice. 2005 nycnosh.com

My husband is Jamaican, and we make our own Ginger Beer. He wouldn't think of drinking Canada dry or any other store brand. I remember on my first trip to Jamaica, when I ordered a ginger ale, I was shocked at the taste! It had so much kick to it, it pretty much burned my mouth!! It had very small slices of ginger that had managed to excape the mortal and pestle. There is nothing like fresh ginger beer, it helps with an upset stomach and taste darn good too!

Yes, ginger ale and ginger beer are like cousins, twice-removed. You know, Saltycracker, you should give him a taste of Vernor's, just as an experiment. He won't think it's anything like authentic ginger beer (because it's not meant to be), but it is very sharp in the same way.

The combination- warm, spicy, sweet, but above all, refreshing, was our drink of choice for this party. My favorite was the ginger beer mixed with the $4 champagne from the store around the corner. $4 champagne, when mixed with other, tastier beverages, is not that bad. [...]

Privately Public: The Four Course Vegan Supper Club

 In the hip microcosm of New York City, it's a wonder there aren't more options for vegan diners. You'd think that an upscale restaurant that serves all animal-free foods would flourish here, but for whatever reason, such restaurants have struggled in Gotham. Instead, what seems to have happened is that most restaurants across the city have added a vegetarian option or two to their menus. A nice gesture, but it's still not a vegan 'room of one's own.' But perhaps there's an even better solution- one that inverts the equation so that even the carnivores want a little taste. You probably already know that supper clubs are hot these days; every food-lover we know wants an invitation to one, and after Ken Gross's article in the New York Times this May, interest in them seems to have exploded. Meanwhile, back in Williamsburg, Chef Matteo has been running the 4 Course Vegan dinner club for the past two years, flying well underneath the mainstream radar. But shh!- don't tell: 4 Course Vegan is a populist affair- you don't need to know someone to get an invite, you just need to make a booking before all the dinner places are filled. Our friend Pisces (herself a vegan) has been itching to give 4 Course Vegan a try for a few months now, so when she found a week when we and our food blogging friend Salli Vates were all free, she made the reservations and sent us all out to the dinner club's top-secret location in Williamsburg. HungryMan and I received directions through e-mail (much like a rave party, you only find out where the dinner is when you've reserved a space), and made our way to the Brooklyn side-street at the appointed time and day. Once inside the dining room- a large and airy converted living room space with high ceilings and long glass tables- we took our seats. Eight other diners were already seated and waiting for their first course, which through the open-plan kitchen, we could see Chef Matteo preparing for us. We popped open the cork on a bottle of good champagne we received as a gift (4 Course Vegan is unlicensed, so you'll need to bring your own alcohol) and started munching on the first of two amuse-bouches we were served: ravioli made from two tissue-thin slices of watermelon radish, filled with a tofu and black olive mixture. The very slightly crunchy magenta packets sat atop a dollop of delightful and fragrant green pesto that forced me to lick my fork after I had finished. Twice. Our other pre-dinner starter was a raw taco salad of avocado, pineapple, garlic, and cumin over a chipotle walnut paste. It was a little less daring than the first appetizer, and perhaps a little underspiced- the pineapple and avocado combination could easily have balanced out more heat in the dish- but it was still a fine non-menu surprise. I do not know if two bonus dishes are standard, but they certainly were welcome additions to the 4 Course Vegan experience. My least favorite of the courses and the first one listed on the official menu followed these two nibbles. The jerusalem artichoke bisque looked absolutely stunning- almost like a very pale pumpkin cream, swirled with Jackson Pollock-inspired streaks of goji berry puree and dill fronds. But the flavors in this dish were very unidimensional- even the fennel shavings did not add much to the complexity of this soup, which tasted for the most part only of sunchokes and salt. Keep in mind that it was still decent, but perhaps a little less exciting to the mouth than to the eye. Things picked up dramatically with the butternut squash griddle cakes. When joined by the aggressively tangy cranberry-kaffir lime compote and the pungent horseradish cream, these sweet patties transformed into psychedelic latkes. The flavor combinations were of the sort that make you wonder why you've never thought of them, but grateful that someone else did. One other aspect of this dish is worth noting: the griddle cakes were not even a little bit greasy, despite having been pan-fried and transferred warm to the plate on which they were served. The star of the next course was a bit unexpected. Clearly, the shiitake 'mignon' balls which received top billing on the menu were intended to shine brighter than their accompaniments, but in this case, the wine-braised leeks stole the show- they were savory and incredibly soft, almost falling apart on the fork. The gravy they were cooked in was a juniper-rosemary jus (that might also have paired well with the butternut squash griddle cakes), and when spooned onto one of the super-crisp lotus chips, I completely forgot about the mushroom patties. Yes, the mignons were meaty in texture and very tasty, but they were unquestionably no match for those luscious leeks. Our fourth formal course was dessert. In this case, a spiced-pumpkin tea cake served with yin-yang drizzles of maple caramel syrup and pomegranate thyme syrup. This was HungryMan's favorite part of the meal, and deservedly so; the cake was moist and studded with pecans and pumpkin chunks. I kept dabbing at the lighter syrup, trying to figure out what gave it its high-note kick, but overtaken by the aroma from the cake, I just dunked, smeared, and dipped my way through this course, pleased to be eating something at once so traditionally seasonal and yet inventively seasoned. All of us left very satisfied and impressed with the quality of just about everything we ate- it is telling that of the four diners in our party, we had four different favorite items. So here's how the 4 Course Vegan dining club works. First, you'll need to contact the chef by e-mail or telephone and reserve as many spaces as you need. A critical mass of at least ten diners (not all from your party, of course) is necessary for a dinner to go ahead, so be forewarned that a meal might be cancelled if not enough other people make bookings. But with recent interest in supper clubs, I'd worry more about finding an opening. The charge is $40 per person, cash only, with no corkage fee if you bring your own wine (which you should). Despite my early skepticism, I'm a real fan- the 4 Course Vegan dinner is a memorable and unique eating experience that is bound to impress just about any foodie. I'll even bet that after a few bites, they won't pay too much attention to the fact that they're eating vegan food. 4 Course Vegan, Williamsburg (Brooklyn), 718-599-5913 & http://4coursevegan.com

HungryMom Weighs In on Pearl Oyster Bar

***CONTENT
 Last week’s Thanksgiving holiday was an extra special one this year because we were honored by a visit from HungryMom, HungryMan’s mother. She came all the way from Florida and gamely accompanied us on our restaurant adventures, suffering through our picture taking and lots of prodding for her to try different kinds of food. In the spirit of the holiday, we decided to give HungryMom a guest spot on the site, and in turn, she has even made suggestions for a future site called FLANosh: “the spinach and artichoke dip at the Boca Raton Applebee's is really far better than the one in Boynton Beach… .” Okay, okay, we don’t intend to make fun of the food scene in South Florida– there is excellent nosh to be found there for those who look, and HungryMom knows better than to suggest an Applebee's review– though she did point out the Times Square outpost with some surprise (and couched excitement?). So without further ado, we present her views on Pearl Oyster Bar, a Village seafood spot that is famous among local foodies for its lobster rolls: It sure looked like a hole-in-the wall restaurant, not at all like Monstah Lobstah in Tampa, Florida [a lobster place in the town where HungryMan’s sister lives–Ed]. But I was delighted to try it because one of my favorites, the lobster roll, was on the menu. Fortunately, we only had to wait a few minutes to be seated at a tiny table, and we were greeted by a very friendly and helpful server. The menu was much more varied than the previously-mentioned Tampa hot spot and was I delighted when Nosher, HungryMan and I agreed to share three small appetizers while waiting for our orders of lobster rolls. We devoured the Smoked Atlantic Salmon, Johnnycake and Crème Fraiche appetizer. The sweetness of the Johnnycake (whose main ingredient was corn meal) was in juxtaposition to the stacks of smoked salmon and peaks of crème fraiche, and the whole thing was welcome to my very empty stomach. Of course, the food could have been awful and I would have been satisfied to be with HungryMan and Nosher. The little neck clam appetizer that we also shared was not my cup of tea, so I was all too happy to shove the slippery, icy platter across the table -- but HungryMan has described them to me as salty and chewy and served with shallot and sherry vinegar and a home-made sweet cocktail sauce. If I ever build up a tolerance to raw shellfish, I'll come back and try this again, since both Nosher and HungryMan were impressed. Maybe. These two appetizers were joined by a salad of baby lettuce, tomatoes and Fourme D'ambert cheese. Although I am not a salad person, the accompanying cheese went well with the smoked salmon already on my plate from the Johnnycake appetizer. It was fine with me when Hungyman and Nosher ate most of the salad because my stomach was gearing up for the lobster rolls. The roll was erved with crispy shoestring french fries that were as thick as matchsticks. But the warm, sweet roll and the thick chunks of lobster mixed with very little mayo thrilled me and my stomach. That place in Tampa should be ashamed of calling their entrée by the same name, these are lobster rolls. This one Greenwich Village was worth the whole 1,300-mile trip and endless circling over JFK before landing. At the considerable risk of not leaving HungryMom with the last word, I will only add my agreement: Pearl’s lobster rolls are among the best I’ve had in New York, better even than the ones you can take out at The Lobster Place in Chelsea Market and now on Bleecker Street. More meat, a better bun, and more interesting presentation make the whole experience better at Pearl’s, even if it is more expensive ($22 versus $12). It's so good in fact, that it’s even worth bringing your hungry mom along. Pearl Oyster Bar, 18 Cornelia Street (near 6th Avenue), 212-691-8211

My Wife and I think that Pearl's Lobster Rolls are better than any we've had in Maine including Reds in Wiscasset. We live in Pittsburgh buty whenever we are in the Big Apple we always stop in at Pearls. Any comments on Mary's Fish Camp around the corner?

Pearls Oyster is by far the absolute best for preparing the most scrumptuous lobster roll in the world. This is coming from a die-heart New England girl who has been eating lobster for the past 55 years. Not only is the roll orgasmic, but the fries are incredible too. Too miss Pearls is to miss your first kiss.

It's Dark in Here: Frank

***CONTENT
 Let's start with the good things about Frank. First, it is a very cozy little restaurant just a few doors down from the corner of East 5th Street and Second Avenue. The homey decor reminds me of many of the tiny bistros that have opened in London in the past five years, with its painted tin ceiling and shadowy interior. And by shadowy, I mean it's almost pitch black in the dining room, with an occasional candle casting faint light out over a radius of about, well, 4 inches. That makes it a fitting place to take a date but a horrible place to take photos of food. Then there's the bread- it is gorgeous and thickly crusted with massive holes spreading the loaf apart in a network of doughy threads: exactly what good Italian bread should be. But that's not really enough if the rest of the rest of the food isn't also good, and sadly, on a recent visit with HungryMom, Cousins Wack and Pluck, and their parents Abstract Aunt and Uncle Heraclitus, we didn't achieve a critical mass of high-quality dishes at our dinner. This is not to say that some weren't successful- the mushroom soup was a hit with two of us, and the salmon with spinach arrived golden brown, crispy, and matched well with the very lightly sautéed greens. But greens in general seem to be troublesome things at Frank. My arucola and parmesan salad was grittier than a corn mill and was impossible to eat because of it. I left more than half of it- something I almost never do with a salad. The sandy arugula appeared again in HungryMan's antipasto platter, contaminating the fresh mozzarella with hard little grains. By the end of the meal, I think half of us had worn our molars flat. Not washing lettuces properly is a cardinal sin among food flubs; it's simple to fix and should quite honestly never happen. That's all the more true when the leaves are meant to be used in a dish that is made up of mostly arugula. Pastas also fell all over the spectrum: the spaghetti and anchovies was so undercooked that I found a tree-branch sized clump of uncooked noodles in my bowl, and the sauce left much to be desired, as all the anchovy flavor came from a few limp, jarred anchovies that lay languishing atop my pasta. HungryMan's rigatoni al ragú was also disappointing in its greasiness and lack of much flavor apart from tomato. On the other hand, the fava purée and roasted chicory platter was great. I ate one of the roasted tomatoes from Uncle Heraclitus's plate and started to wish I'd ordered what he had. But I chose based on a recommendation from our waiter, who in addition to leading me astray, was often inattentive and frequently just absent-minded, forgetting several refills of water and an extra spoon. I'm willing to forgive scatterbrained service-yes, even the platter auctioning that went on: \"Who had salmon? Salmon? Salmon?,\" and even the fact that everyone on my side of the tables was jostled and knocked around whenever a busboy or waiter passed-but when our bill came and we found an entirely unmarked 20% gratuity added to the total, I gave up on Frank. There is much better mid-priced Italian in the city, and for the cost of a subway ride to the Upper West Side, you could travel from Frank to Gennaro or Celeste and witness Italian bistro cooking at the top of its game. You might even come out ahead when you factor in the relatively pricey wine list (almost nothing under $30) and the surprise gratuity. Frank, 88 Second Avenue, 212-420-0202

Seasonal Food Part Two: Citrus Cranberry Sauce
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Regardless of how you feel about the canned stuff, nothing beats fresh, homemade cranberry sauce. Nothing. But so few people bother to prepare their own, and I think this is mostly because they think that cranberry sauce has to be a mealy, nearly tasteless mess with the consistency of a gummy bear. But fresh cranberry sauce bears no resemblance at all to the canned variety- it has a concentrated tang and a lively sweetness that is a little like a fine sour cherry jam, but with much more bite. Best of all, homemade cranberry sauce is simple to make. So before you plan your entire menu for tomorrow, here is my personal recipe for my favorite part of the Thanksgiving meal. This version of the classic sauce contains a healthy dose of citrus flavor, in part from the substitution of orange juice for water, and in part from the extra kick that comes from the zest. The lemon and orange essences give this dish a complexity that you'll never get from the canned stuff. All told, this recipe will take about 30 minutes from start to finish (not including cooling time) and can be done a day ahead of time. This means that there's still time to make some tonight and get a head start on tomorrow's preparations. Enjoy! Fresh Citrus Cranberry Sauce 2 12-ounce bags raw cranberries 2 cups sugar 2 cups orange juice (with as much pulp as possible) 2 tablespoons Grand Marnier or Chambord zest from one lemon or lime In a very large pot (a pasta pot works well), combine cranberries, sugar, and orange juice. Heat over a burner set to medium-low until the berries begin to burst. Begin stirring constantly until the mixture foams at the sides. Boil gently for at least 10 minutes, stirring constantly or very regularly to keep the mixture from burning. About 2 minutes before the boiling ends, add the liqueur and stir. After the boiling period ends, turn off heat and add the zest. Pour into a heat-proof container and allow to cool at room temperature. DO NOT place the sauce into the fridge until it is cool. If you do, it will not set properly. Once the sauce is cooled, it can be kept in the fridge for up to a week (or frozen for several weeks). 2005 nycnosh.com

Seasonal Food: Cranberry Orange Nut Bread

***CONTENT
 Figuring out what to make for Thanksgiving dinner isn't normally too difficult- most people base their current menu on what they ate on Thanksgivings-past. It's a great strategy. That is, as long as you're the one making the dinner. What do you do if you're going as a guest and want to bring something special to the meal? Generally, there are two approaches: the first involves offering to take the burden of one of the traditional dishes (stuffing, potatoes, etc.) from the host. But this is iffy because inevitably, someone complains about missing Aunt Rita's (or Zabar's) version of whatever you've made. Best then to stay away from the staples. The second approach is to bring something new, but something that fits well with the Thanksgiving theme- a fruit pie, a hearty casserole, or our favorite, a quick bread. I remember watching my mother make this bread in enormous batches- she'd cover every available surface with batter and nuts and would bake a dozen large loaves and twenty or thirty mini-loaves at a time. For months afterwards, our freezer would be bricked-in with stacks of baked goods, just waiting to be defrosted and taken along to a dinner party. To this day, I still associate late autumn and early winter with the flavors in this sweet, citrusy bread. When I say it's sweet, I do mean that too. It's not insipid, but it does occupy a middle-region between bread and cake. I've served it as a dessert, accompanied by a disc of fresh goat cheese and a very thin drizzle of honey or maple syrup, but it also works well in a bread basket on the dinner table. It's also one of my personal favorites as a morning snack, one that stands up to a strong cup of coffee. In the end, it doesn't matter how you serve it or when you eat it, as long as you have November on your mind. Cranberry Orange Nut Bread from Moose Ma 2 cups all-purpose flour 1 cup sugar 1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 cup shortening or European butter 3/4 cup orange juice 1 egg, beaten 1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts 2 cups chopped cranberries zest from one medium orange Sift together dry ingredients (they're listed together above). Chop cranberries, nuts, and orange zest together in a bowl or food processor. Add the shortening to the dry ingredients and cut in until the mixture resembles cornmeal. Combine the orange juice with the beaten egg and pour this into the dry ingredients. Mix until just damp. Fold in berry mixture very gently, being sure not to overmix. Pour the batter into a large loaf pan or several mini-loaf pans lined with parchment paper and greased, and bake at 350° F for about an hour. Test for doneness with a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf- if it comes out cleanly or with just a few small crumbs clinging to it, the bread is done. Cool the bread on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before removing the loaves from the pan. 2005 nycnosh.com

 Last Thursday, like every year on the third Thursday in November, the new crop of Beaujolais Nouveau hit the shelves of New York's wine shops. The attention and brou-ha-ha surrounding the release has reached such a frenzy of marketing (at least two of our friends attended a Beaujolais party this year) that it's easy to forget that there's wine involved, wine that can on occasion, be quite good. If Nosher's purchase of the 2005 Georges Duboeuf is an indication of things to come, there is a great chance that at least one bottle of Beaujolais will grace our Thanksgiving table this year. Beaujolais Nouveau is called 'nouveau' because it is literally the first of the wine made from this year's harvest in Beaujolais, a region in the Bourgogne (Burgundy), in France. It is often criticized by wine snobs because it is so new and, perhaps, unsophisticated compared to the more complex Beaujolais of Brouilly, Chiroubles, and especially other Burgundies like Nuits-Saint-Georges or Pommard. Despite these commonly held views, I usually find Beaujolais Nouveau very drinkable and simple, and this year the vintage seems as good as ever. I found a bright red, almost ruby color and a very fruity, orangey nose; after leaving the wine out just a few minutes to open up, you can taste molasses and a host of other fruits. Even though it's made with different grapes, Nosher likes to compare Beaujolais Nouveau to something resembling a 'ticking Cabernet-Franc time bomb' - after all, it has a very similar flavor profile as does Cabernet Franc, goes with a wide variety of the same foods-not just with turkey, but pretty much anything that's not incredibly delicate like shellfish or overly spicy, which will swamp out the flavors of the wine), and gets little respect from 'serious' oenophiles. The difference with Beaujolais Nouveau is its ephemeral nature: after 4-6 months, the wine is pretty much past its prime, and much longer than that, you can almost use it in salad dressing. This last rule was not always well understood in my family. I remember a visit to my parents in Florida several years ago where I went rummaging through the liquor cabinet in search of forgotten goodies. After seeing me give up pretty quickly, my mom accused me of not looking hard enough, went in after me and came back to the living room triumphantly holding up a Beaujolais Nouveau from the early 1980s. It was a gift from a friend that she had been too sentimental to throw out, but apparently not thirsty enough to drink. Laughing a little too much, I opened the bottle at arm's length, finding, as I thought, a bottle of vinegar. This year when HungryMom comes to visit, we'll be sure that all Beaujolais Nouveau is consumed on the premises, and what we can't manage to drink will be added with a few bay leaves to a nice pot of stew. Tick...tick...tick... .

Southern Fried Lunch at Amy Ruth's

***CONTENT
 This weekend, TVGal and I left Nosher in Hell's Kitchen with his reading and embarked upon a quest to find some great Southern cooking in New York. TVGal, a die-hard Brooklynite, had a few recommendations in Kings County, but in the end, we ended up meeting in Harlem, a neighborhood with a perhaps unsurpassed concentration of Southern and soul food cooking. I had heard of a few of the best-known purveyors of soul food in the area, such as Sylvia's, Miss Maude’s, and Miss Mamie’s Spoonbread restaurants, but TVGal had eaten at Amy Ruth’s before and was stark-raving mad about returning there, so to how could I argue? Named after the proprietor’s grandmother, at whose Alabama home he spent childhood summers learning all the restaurant's recipes, Amy Ruth’s is a Harlem institution. We arrived late Saturday morning– still early for brunch in New York– and found a long line of people already behind a velvet rope, waiting for a chance to enter this temple of home cooking. The clientele at Amy Ruth’s is a cross section of this diverse part of New York: black and white, young and old; everyone seems to go to Amy Ruth’s, and everyone receives an equally warm reception from the hostess at the door. Menu items all bear the names of prominent African-American cultural and political figures: the Atty. Michael A Hardy (Savory Turkey Meatloaf), the Dr. Walter I. Delph (Fisherman’s Platter), and I swear I saw a Miss Beyonce Knowles sandwich, but then again, there was a mind-boggling array of dishes on the roster, so I can’t really be sure. While TVGal and I made up our minds about what to eat for lunch, we made short order of the moist yet crumbly cornbread and ordered drinks: one glass of the restaurant’s famous homemade lemonade and another of the Kool-Aid of the day (on Saturday, it was lime). TVGal hemmed and hawed over her order while regaling me with a very entertaining story about her recent dismal speed dating experience. She finally chose a classic, the Rev. Al Sharpton ($10.95), which turns out to be chicken (fried or smothered-you can get most chicken dishes here prepared either way) served on a crispy-on-the-outside, fluffy-as-a-pillow inside, freshly made waffle. I watched as she poured a long, slow rivulet of Amy Ruth’s homemade syrup over the whole thing. TVGal also opted for the fried, dark-meat-only chicken (you get a choice of white or dark, too) because, she told me later, she often finds white meat often disappointingly dry. She needn’t have worried. My order of Councilman Bill Perkins ($13.95)- Southern fried chicked dipped in honey from Amy Ruth’s own bees (the restaurant’s apparently illegal rooftop apiary is the subject of much discussion) was nothing but tender and juicy below incredibly crispy, sweet and sticky skin. While I usually shy away from ordering chicken in restaurants-I remember the mother of one of my exes wagging her finger and braying, “Never order chicken out because you can get it at home.” That relationship ended in the late 90s, but the dictum has stayed with me- this was clearly a case where an exception had to be made. And I think now this was one of the most successful fried chickens I have tasted. My only problem was finding enough napkins to deal with the honey which, in spite of my best efforts, I managed to get absolutely everywhere. Speaking of the home-cultivated honey, you can buy jars of it yourself at the restaurant ($10 for a small jar), just in case your hands aren't tacky enough by the time you leave. But believe it or not, even these delectable main dishes were outshone by the variety and consistency of the side dishes, two of which are offered as accompaniments to most of the entrees. We both went for the macaroni and cheese, which arrived baked and piping hot, part creamy and part crusty- more like a casserole that can be sliced into squares than the soupy, stew-like mac n’ cheese that finds its unfortunate way onto New York restaurant tables under the guise of ‘comfort food.’ We also made sure to order a side of candied yams, which came as hot as the chicken, slightly flaky and approaching the color of garnets. Regrettably, we had no room left for dessert, a real tragedy given the looks on the faces of the diners around us happily making their way through sweet potato pies and red velvet cakes. But portion sizes at Amy Ruth’s are Olympian, and I had barely gotten over the previous night’s adventure at Soba Koh. Skipping dessert was probably the only thing that kept the restaurant’s management from having to roll me out of there like Violet Beauregarde. Looking back, there was very little at Amy Ruth’s not to like: from the pretention-free service and honest Southern cooking, to the emphasis on homemade ingredients, to the at-times raucous atmosphere, I am itching to go back and try something else (like the short ribs: another TVGal recommendation). On the other hand, Harlem has so many good places to eat these days, I really feel spoiled for choice.

Subtlety in Buckwheat: Soba Koh

***CONTENT
 A few months ago, HungryMan and I shared a midnight taxi ride home with Cousin Wack. Her apartment was the first stop on our trip, but our itinerary changed rapidly when we arrived at her building and said our goodbyes- it was then, over her shoulder that we spotted Soba Koh on the same block. Quicker than a flash, all three of us had abandoned the cab, and HungryMan and I stood peering into the windows of the darkened restaurant, smacking our lips and wondering aloud if the restaurant was any good. We knew, with both a relative and a soba restaurant on the same city block, we'd be back soon. So this weekend, we accompanied Cousins Pluck and Wack to their local neighborhood buckwheat noodle house- I wish we all had one. Starting with a bowl of edamame, we sat in awe of the sheer variety of dishes served at Soba Koh. Almost half of the items on the menus were daily specials, printed very neatly in both Japanese and English on an insert. We find that in general, an abundance of specials tends to indicate the presence of a chef who believes in cooking what is freshest and in-season, and often one who isn't afraid of a little improvisation. We ordered from both menus, just to get a sense of the interplay between the cameo players and the recurring characters, a dynamic that even very creative and competent chefs have a difficult time controlling. But subtlety reigns at Soba Koh, so there are few clashes. One excellent illustration of this is the Chicken Wing with Sansyo Pepper appetizer special; it is extraordinarily juicy for a wing and seared with the floral exclamation points of the sansyo. Looking at the three wings, you could imagine thinking that three might not be enough, but somehow, they are plenty. These are not the sort of wings that you would make a meal of- they are accent pieces that prime the palate for something hearty and soothing to come. And of course, for that very reason, they fit in perfectly with the homey soba dishes that comprise the bulk of the main dishes here. Another of our appetizer selections, the agedashi tofu special, was among the very best I have ever eaten- the tofu was creamy and supple inside, while the dashi was gorgeously rich without the overbearing fishiness of bonito that often mars this dish. Cousin Pluck commented that this was the most delicious fried tofu she has ever eaten. I'm not too far from making that statement myself. Our Goma-ae appetizer special was beautiful and forest-dark, but tasted slightly too bitter. The sesame sauce might have been better suited to a sweeter vegetable, because with the leafy parts of the broccoli rabe there was a sharpness that never felt balanced. Had we been drinking wine, this would have killed it. As it turned out, the bitterness was very pleasant with the Sapporo I was drinking, so just proceed with caution. HungryMan's Ebi Ten Seiro Soba was a diptych of cold, hand-pulled and cut soba noodles on one plate, accompanied by a simple tempura of three large shrimps on the second plate. That, plus a cup of soy dipping sauce, rounded out an impressively artful presentation. The idea behind separating the pieces is that you can eat this dish however you choose. I saw a few patrons opting for the shrimp + noodle + sauce jumble approach, but just as many (including the off-duty waitress eating in the corner) chose to eat and dip items at random. HungryMan raved about the contrasting textures of the tempura batter and the firm, cold noodles, as well as the concentrated brininess of the dipping sauce. For someone who does not enjoy soup noodles, this seems like an excellent option. Both cousins chose from the 'Hot Noodle' section of the permanent menu, with Cousin Pluck selecting the Vegetable Tempura Soba, a crunchy selection that included a fleshy and soft sweet potato that she insisted we mention. The green chili that features so prominently in the image here was not as fiery and threatening as it looks- it had a bit of a kick, but the dashi broth and warm noodles tempered it nicely. Cousin Wack ordered what I probably would have- the Kinoko Soba, another hot soba soup, but one overflowing with three varieties of mushrooms: enoki, shimeiji, and shiitake. This is the sort of dish that should only be eaten by people who love umami, but for those that do, it is loaded with deeply earthy flavors that contrast with the simplicity of the soba noodles. I plan to make a return visit to order this. On this particular trip however, I chose one of the special main dishes: the Fried Tofu Balls with Eel and Hijiki Soba. I love the inky, peppery flavor of hijiki and imagined that it would work well with eel- another of my favorites. Combined in the tofu balls, the flavors did blend nicely, but I do wish that the tofu balls had been served on the side of the soup where they would not have absorbed as much broth as these did. Even still, this is a small complaint about an otherwise solid entrée. Prices at Soba Koh range from about $4 to $9 for appetizers, and from $8 to $17 for mains, which makes it a relative bargain for the quality of food. There aren't many places in New York City where you can watch buckwheat noodles being made from scratch, let alone order up a serving of them for about $10. There is also a set meal for $16 that includes an appetizer, a main dish, and a dessert, but it is only for early birds (pre- 7:00 diners) on the weekends; during the week, the meal is offered until 10:00. If you're not familiar with soba noodles, this might be the perfect way to sample a few of the unique specials and let the chef guide your meal. Regardless of how you order, just be sure to choose one or two of the inventive selections as well as something that includes a slurp or two of Soba Koh's truly superb dashi.

Route 66 Café- Just Don't Call It a Diner

***CONTENT
 Route 66 Café would probably never cop to being a diner. But that's what it is, and that's not necessarily a bad thing. New York City (and much of the state) diners are home to a lot of great short-order cooking, good brewed coffee, and hypnotically rotating deli cases stacked with pies and cakes. Some, like the uppity Brooklyn Diner, have become hollowed out shells of their former selves, replaced and refilled with expensive casual dining restaurants. Route 66 Café seems to have reversed this transformative process- changing the décor to resemble a more upscale restaurant while retaining the diner offerings. Prices here seem to have undergone the same cosmetic surgery: take what you'd normally pay for a dish at a diner (and they serve almost all of them), add about 50%, and you'll come close to estimating the cost of a meal at Route 66. What you get for your extra few bucks is, well, good Italian bread and olives on the table, but not a lot else. The food is pretty standard diner quality and doesn't really merit the cost increase, as borne out by our most recent visit tonight. Take HungryMan's New England Clam Chowder as a perfect example of this. It's a dish that quite a lot of diners serve to varying success, and one that really needs to be watched carefully if it is being served throughout a 4-7 hour dinner service. HungryMan and I both suspect that such care wasn't being taken at Route 66, as the soup appeared to have a very thin skin forming over its surface. What's more, the soup had hit that end-phase of its life cycle where it starts to become so thick that it is almost like a stew. The flavors were all fine, but the texture and the viscosity of the chowder made it hard to enjoy. My caesar salad had some of the same issues- the lettuce tasted as if it had been sitting around, pre-chopped, in a container for hours. Much of it was limp, and there were stray flecks of aging brown lettuce in the mix. In a neighborhood diner without social aspirations, I'd accept this and move on, but when I'm paying upwards of $7 for the privilege, I expect fresh lettuce, at the very least. The dressing also needs a little anchovy, although it does trump the too-creamy varieties served around Manhattan by virtue of the fact that you can actually taste the egg it contains. Speaking of eggs, that is what I ordered as my main course. Perhaps it's unconventional, but that's the beauty of diner food- you can order anything at any time of day. At night however, no hash browns are served at Route 66, only french fries and mashed potatoes. The fries were crisp and hot, but otherwise pretty unexceptional. My eggs, on the other hand, were a classic study in contrasts. The poached egg on top, and the one visible in the image, was perfectly cooked, with a slightly runny yolk and a fork-tender white. Underneath lay its exact opposite, a Quasi Modo of a poached egg, looking balefully up at me with its solid and overcooked yolk surrounded by a layer of rubberized white. I ate the good one and left the bad one in the cup. If there is one section of the menu where Route 66 Café makes the best case for its high prices, it is in the sandwiches. On previous trips here, I have ordered and loved the egg salad sandwich on toasted rye. Perhaps I should have done that again this time, instead of opting for my eggs in a purer form. HungryMan had his wits about him on this visit, thankfully, and made the best choice of the evening with the Turkey Burger Platter. He describes it as juicy, without a lot of filler, and grilled exactly right. The swiss cheese was pre-melted on the kaiser roll, which again is a good sign, because sometimes restaurants will try to hide defects in their burger patties by smothering them with layers of melted cheese. The fries were the same as mine, but overall, this was a real winner of a main dish. As we left the restaurant, we both remarked that the moral of the meal seems to be: stick with the sandwiches at Route 66. And if a sandwich or burger is not what you're after, perhaps you should just go to a diner, one that isn't ashamed to call itself by that name. Route 66 Café, 858 9th Avenue (at 56th Street), 212-977-7600

After trying this place twice, it's on our \"never go back\" list. Every place is different of course, but each of the dishes we ordered were of the \"it's really hard to mess up variety\", and yet, they did. I can still remember the taste of the omelet I sent back on our last visit. I'm a bit saddened, but not surprised to see from your review that it hasn't changed.

The Durian Dilemma
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-11-09 23:07:00
***CONTENT
 If durian were one of the flavors of Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans, would it be considered a pleasant or a nasty experience to eat one? That's the question I found myself pondering as HungryMan and I sat on the sofa, passing back and forth a tub of Sweety brand durian ice cream. I think much of the durian hype has to do with contrast. Yes, the fruit smells absolutely sickening when its spikey shell is opened, and yes, a ripe durian ferments in just a couple of days, creating a mound of putrefaction where there once was a fruit. And again, yes the fruit is, after all that, comparatively pleasant. But that level of description is where most food writing stops. Nothing more than just the tired Heaven/Hell comparisons and a suggestion that you eat one when you get a chance. That's never been enough for me, so I've made it a goal to seek out durian wherever possible and find a way to describe it that actually means something, a way of saying something more than just that it tastes a lot better than it smells. But in doing this, I've discovered why it's so hard to say how a durian tastes- there are layers of flavors there that defy description. But here is what I know: it does have a very lovely custardy texture, as well as a flavor profile that resembles banana and lemon. If you imagine a custard apple (cherimoya) combined with a ripe banana and a lemon drop candy, that's a start. This is where things get tricky: there is a taste harmonizing there underneath everything, like a drone note played by a bagpipe- and it's not a fruity taste. It's alliaceous, like a crushed shallot, and you can't avoid it. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it's not pleasant, but it's not what I tend to associate with fruit. Here's the best approximation I can give you: take the custard apple/banana/lemon drop description and imagine that you're eating that flavor with a spoon that has just been used to scoop minced shallots, and that's the flavor of a durian. When I bought the Sweety Durian Ice Cream ($4.98) from the Dynasty Supermarket on Hester Street and Elizabeth Street in Chinatown, I thought that the dairy in the dessert might mitigate the effect of the oniony undertones, but to my disappointment, it did not. The cream certainly does enhance the custard flavors, though. I ate a few scoops of the sweet confection, but I can't say I'd order durian ice cream if I had my choice of flavors. I am starting to think that durian is simply an acquired taste, one that demands the same kind of open-minded thinking that some really barnyardy Burgundies- the ones that smell 'of cattle, the ground, and fertilizer'- do. I adore those wines for that very scent, as incongruous as it may be in a drink made from grapes, and I also freely admit that it took me some time to enjoy that taste and odor in my Volnays and Pommards. So perhaps becoming a durian lover is just a matter of patience, time, and further exposure. At the very least I'll give it a chance and work my way through the rest of the tub. It might take me a few months, but I'll get there, and when I do, perhaps I'll be the durian's most recent convert.

Perhaps your problem is the types of Durian that you're eating and the state in which you're receiving them? Undoubtedly, in NYC you are getting hybrid fruits that are picked early and then specially ripened with ethylene (I'm sure the ice cream you've been eating is made from the same varieties). If you've ever had the pleasure of a real banana picked nearly ripe right off the tree as oppossed to the green picked gassed and consequently blandly poor subsitutes sold in the US you will have some idea of what I'm talking about. Real durian, by this I mean traditional, unhybrdized varieties, fall off the 100-200ft trees they grow on only when fully ripe. They have much less flesh per fruit than the hybrid varieties and must then be eaten within a few days, hence they cannot be shipped very far aand it's not economical to do so, certainly not to the US mainland. However, the flavor is well worth a trip to Southeast Asia for the real deal. Whereas the hybrid varieties do have a greater deal of funk that is not complemented by any real depth of custard flavor, in contrast, the best traditional durian have a flavor that can most accurately be described as butterscotch custard. You can't eat just one. If you go to Thailand, ask for \"durian bahn\", literally home durian, or local durian. Enjoy!
Nosher
2005-11-23 01:00:00
Great comment, James. I am sure you're right that the quality of exported durians is lower than the quality of those that stay in Southeast Asia. I'm not convinced that it's all ethylene's fault though, as some gas-ripening produces pretty acceptable results. The hybrid/purebred durian issue though is something to consider. You may also be right about the ice cream's fruit source- apparently it's made in the US for the Asian-American market, so I bet they also use the hardier durians. Lots of good stuff to consider here.

Bagel Trekking Part Two: Chelsea

***CONTENT
 There is a great debate going on in our household at the moment over our Saturday morning bagel routine. At our place, Nosher is a committed H&H fan, and it helps his case that we live a very brief walk from their main Manhattan factory. To me though, there is nothing better than a hot onion bagel fresh from the wire rack bins at Murray’s Bagels in Chelsea. I'm not expecting a resolution any time soon, though, because this is New York, and after all, nothing says Gotham more than the perennial question of who makes the best bagel. In Manhattan at least (leaving the several artisanal-quality bagelries in Brooklyn for another post), there are those who swear by H&H Bagels, others who will walk far out of their way for an Ess-a-Bagel, and those who are ready to change subway lines three times just to visit to Tal Bagels on the East or West Side. Therefore I consider myself fortunate that my own personal pick is a comparatively short 30-block walk away. Murray’s bagels are less sweet and doughy than their counterparts at H&H, and they also don’t suffer from being too dense or chewy like those criminal supermarket-style bagels that look good but taste like a shoebox. Murray’s makes their bagels in a huge variety of flavors-yes, you can find the standard onion, poppy-seed, and sesame varieties, but there are no misplaced purist ideals here-Murray’s sells spinach bagels, sundried tomato bagels, even marbled rye bagels. And the folks behind the long counter at the Chelsea location will schmear a reasonable amount of one of their many flavors of cream cheese on your bagel for you: no half-inch thick artery-clogging layer of cream cheese on these bagels, thank you very much. Like a few other bagel shops in the city, there is a we-know-best policy in full effect at Murray's, one that prevents them from toasting bagels for their customers. The argument is that a well-made, fresh bagel should not need to be toasted, though I have to admit I did not test this rule when I went, since my bagel was already hot when I got it. Murray’s also sells a small, but well-chosen selection of smoked fish, salmon, and sable, all of which can be ordered by the pound or on a bagel of your choice. They even sell slices of gefilte fish next to an amusing sign reading, “Imported from Brooklyn.” I think that tells you all you need to know about the atmosphere of this deservedly popular breakfast spot- they're cocky and Manhattan-centric, but with bagels this good, it's hard to argue with them. My new goal is to make a convert out of Nosher, but until we declare a winner in our own little bagel pageant at NYCnosh, we intend to savor every crumb of the competition. Murray’s Bagels, 242 8th Avenue (at 23rd Street). Also at 500 6th Avenue (between 12th and 13th Streets)

Blowing Hot & Cold at Hell's Kitchen

***CONTENT
 This weekend, Nosher and I accompanied our friend Misha on a very short trip down the block to pay a long-delayed visit to Hell’s Kitchen- the restaurant, not the newly happening Manhattan district where we live. In a normal week, we walk past its glass-fronted storefront on Ninth Avenue at least a dozen times, but we had not yet gone inside because of the restaurant's notoriously long wait times for a walk-in table and it just seemed a little crazy to make a reservation for a place that you can practically see out your bedroom window. At the same time, friends of mine had expressed surprise that I live in the neighborhood but hadn't yet been in for a meal, so when the chance appeared in the form of a game Misha, we all thought it was time to rectify the situation. It was the perfect plan. True to form, we did in fact did have to put in our name with the host (and yes, for those who plan ahead, they also take reservations), and then lingered outside, talking in the unseasonably warm weather for about ten minutes before we were ushered into a round and very dark banquette at the back of the dining room. Hell’s Kitchen advertises its culinary approach as modern ‘Mexican Fusion,’ and the décor reflects this in a quirky, Latin rhythm in the colorful, comfortable seating, flickering candles, and the chandeliers constructed from tiers of upturned wine bottles. Along the side of the room runs a busy bar serving forth margaritas, caipirinhas, cosmopolitans, and a few good selections of draft beer. I found the menu very appealing: lamb, sirloin, and a ‘seven-chile’ pork chop headlined the entrees, many with indications (like those chiles) that the restaurant’s name might have something to do with the heat of the food as well. While we looked through the menu, we munched on the complimentary cornmeal bread and its sidekick: a yummy black bean dipping sauce. For an appetizer, I ordered the lobster fritters with tamatillo corn salsa and Serrano mayonnaise ($10). Unfortunately, this sounded much better on the menu than on the plate, as the fritters came out over-salted and almost burned. Their texture and temperature were pleasing enough, but the confusion of spices and overfried and acrid onions was so overpowering it drowned out the lobster. Misha and Nosher’s butternut squash soup (one of the night’s specials) was no improvement. Nosher described his soup as too sweet, almost as if sugar had been added to the squash puree and apple chunks in the bowl. Worse, a couple of greasy fried squash blossoms swam limply on the surface, adding little to the soup except increased difficulty in trying to eat it. Our main courses were a little better, especially Nosher’s ancho-crusted tuna ($19), which came with an excellent sweet yucca cake that added to the dish immeasurably. The tuna was well-prepared, not over- or under-cooked, and even more spicy than you would expect a dish like this would be. The not-insignificant amount of bland spinach sitting under the tuna might have been a poor choice as an accompaniment, but if Nosher’s clean plate was any indication, he seemed to like it nonetheless. Misha’s wild mushroom roll ($8, an appetizer ordered as an entrée – Misha claims he noshed earlier in the evening and wasn’t as hungry) was also quite good, at least my forkful was. Artfully presented, the dish came with a hot, chipotle pepper sauce that worked well with the mushrooms and the crispy tortilla. My salmon entrée (grilled wild salmon with sweet corn pudding, baked vegetable cake and salsa roja ($21)) was not as good. I don’t usually order salmon in restaurants because I associate salmon with business lunches, where I always order an easy-to-eat fish in order to focus on the conversation and not the food, but I think I was seduced by the description of the sweet corn pudding, which was indeed sweet and ended up being the best thing on the plate. It was so good, in fact, I mostly picked around the overly dry and almost tasteless fish and filled up on the corn pudding and vegetable cake. We didn’t stay for dessert; we were getting tired and, frankly, the service was a little terse and snappy for us to stick around as the night wore on and the tables slowly emptied. I really wanted to like Hell’s Kitchen just as I do its eponymous neighborhood– and to be fair, the food is unusual and somewhat adventurous. But if you’re going to spend between $19 and $23 per entrée in New York, there are many more consistent options not far away. Hell's Kitchen, 679 Ninth Avenue (at 47th Street), 212-977-1588

Persimmon Season Begins- Don't Be Afraid

 Gourds, squashes, and pumpkins are not the only seasonal produce that arrives in markets at this time of year. In case you haven't spotted them yet, persimmons have been absolutely deluging supermarkets and green grocers around the city for the past few weeks. So start the clock now- you've got about 2 months to buy and eat as many as you can. The two most common varieties we've seen around town are the Fuyu and the Hachiya. Fuyus are small and almost mustard yellow, while Hachiyas are at least the size of a tennis ball and are a much deeper red than the other persimmon types. We like the Hachiyas more, because when they are ready to be eaten they are lush and soft and can even be spooned out of their skins and devoured plain. However, don't even think of buying a Hachiya persimmon unless it meets two criteria: (1) it is almost the color of a blood orange, like the ones in the picture shown here; and (2) it is so soft to the touch that you think you might damage it if you pick it up too roughly. Only when Hachiya persimmons are this soft and dark are they ready to be eaten. If you try eating them before this stage, you will be sorry. Persimmons are so rich in tannins that if they are not consumed very late in their ripening, they are unbearably astringent and harsh. The sensation of eating an unripe persimmon is quite a bit like chewing on green banana peels- it is mouth-puckeringly awful. But even with that warning in mind, a ripe persimmon is so sticky, so moist and sweet that it is still worth the effort. Unquestionably. Now that you've got the secret to picking out a good persimmon, grab one or two. Cut the leafy calyx off and remove the rest of the skin with a knife. You can slice the fruit if you do it carefully, because remember, the berry is soft- almost fragile. Divide it into discs or chunks and serve it plain or drizzled with honey, balsamic vinegar, sprinkled with a little black pepper, or splashed with an aromatic liqueur like Strega or Chartreuse, or all of these. We have also found that persimmons work well in vegetarian stir-fries, but only if they are cubed and added at the very end of the cooking. One final option is to make jam from them- you can even use the instructions we posted in September (and the follow-up post), as long as you go heavier on the sugar than you might normally, as cooked persimmons need more sweetening than do strawberries or raspberries. Persimmon jam tastes a bit orangey, a little like rose hip jam, and pairs beautifully with creamy cheeses. But no matter what you do with them, don't fear the Hachiya persimmons invading your neighborhood- just do a little gentle squeezing and enjoy them while they're in season.

I LOOOVE persimmons!...but just the fuyu ones. Most people I know, if they even like persimmons, go for hachiya. But fuyu! (rubs belly) It's my favorite fruit in the world. During my freshman year of college my mum would bring me cases of them and I shared them with some friends (some thought I had some kind of tomato obsession). I have to admit, I wasn't too crazy about persimmons at first, and one of the reactions I got was that it tasted like feet. Or. A sweaty mango. ...oh well, more for me!

I myself prefer the Fuyu persimmons - I love the crunchy texture. They remind of me of particularly sweet carrots. Did I mention that I *love* this blog? Makes me miss home while I'm away at college. New York is amazing.

You know, I do like Fuyus in a crunchy salad- that's where they beat the Hachiyas hands down! So Robyn and E., I concede. E., thanks for the very kind compliment. You've got a pretty great idea for yours & I can't wait to read more!

The Other Brooklin

 I just returned from a week-long business trip to São Paulo, Brazil and I have to say, the food I ate in that city was extraordinary. Aside from enjoying some of the best sushi I have ever had (did you know that São Paolo has the largest Japanese population outside of Japan?), I found an unexpected emphasis on fresh ingredients and an openness to different cuisines and traditions that reminded me very much of the food scene back home in New York. Even more jarring, my hotel was right in the middle of a newish financial district and emerging hot neighborhood called, of all things, Brooklin Novo, or New Brooklyn. That's really what they call it. When I asked a colleague about this, he told me with a straight face that it was named after 'the big financial district' in New York. Although the details of the translation might be a bit off, it seems that the Brooklin/Brooklyn name carries its cachet far and wide, even with a Portuguese accent. If you go to Brazil and in particular São Paolo, there are three things you absolutely must not only try, but throw yourself into unreservedly. First, the huge variety of tropical fruit that seems to be available everywhere, but most especially on the never-ending breakfast buffets of most hotels in the city. If New York has three or four kinds of bananas (normal, baby, red...), Brazil must easily have 20, along with varieties of mango and passion fruit that I have never seen before (and with US import laws, probably never will). What's more, I was stunned time and again by the quality of the fruit- biting into my first piece of local Brazilian pineapple was as revelatory as when I saw color TV for the first time and realized the astonishing inferiority of black-and-white. Second, even if you are not partial to java, you have to drink at least at least one cup when you visit- it is spectacular. This may come as no surprise, Brazil being the land of coffee, but it’s still a shock to taste how smooth well-made espresso can be and to see the volumes of it that are consumed. Brazilians as a rule seem to like their coffee hot, concentrated, and sweet; every business meeting I attended in São Paolo opened with the arrival of a woman carrying a tray of small espresso cups and glasses, one for each participant. And like clockwork, a new round of coffee was brought in each hour, whether anyone asked for it or not, as if the office staff understood that the only way we could keep going was with more caffeine. Best of all, espresso in Brazil is less bitter than its Italian counterpart; my friend Daniela taught me to ask for a ‘Carioca’ which, in addition to its meaning as someone hailing from Rio de Janeiro, also is the word for a shot of espresso with extra water, resulting in a less intense experience. I also learned another alternative, which is the ‘café com leite,’ or a coffee with hot milk- not quite a cappuccino, but like the Italian counterpart, it is drunk mainly in the mornings. The third thing you must try is feijoada, Brazil’s national dish. Part barbecue, part social gathering, feijoada is often prepared in restaurants only on Wednesdays and Saturdays, so make sure you schedule time appropriately. I went on a very sunny Saturday afternoon with two old friends from my Washington days, Daniela and Mario, both Cariocas but now reluctant Paulistanas (São Paulo-ers), along with their wonderful children, Ana and Julia. We met at Figueira Rubaiyat (1739 Rua Haddock Lobo, in the swanky Jardim Paulista neighborhood), part of a small chain of feijoada-cum-churrascaria restaurants in the city. While more expensive than many places, Figueria has a wonderful atmosphere, loads of outdoor seating organized around an ancient and overgrown fig tree, and English-friendly waiters and menus. It turned out that the girls’ school had organized its own Feijoada da Primavera springtime celebration for students and families the very next day and, as having feijoada twice in one weekend would be far too much (it is a very heavy dish), my companions and their children ordered off the regular menu, while I was heartily encouraged to head straight for the enormous buffet. I did not need to be told twice. The feijoada buffet, which includes an equally amazing all-you-can-eat dessert buffet, will set you back about US$35 per person and does not disappoint. Cauldrons of thinly sliced pork bubble beside heaping piles of rice, and black beans (feijão is Portuguese for bean, hence the name); and literally no part of the pig is left unrepresented on the steaming display: pig ear, snout, offal, feet and tail are all available. Fittingly so, given that feijoada was introduced to Brazil by its slaves, who used the least expensive parts of the pig to bulk up the dish.Now the various cuts and organ meats bob and boil in separate pots to appeal to the sensibilities of visiting gringos, no doubt. Side dishes are plentiful too- collard greens and farofa, a dish of toasted and sautéed manioc flour were two of my personal favorites. I somehow managed to taste a tiny bit of everything, minus the ear and snout, and went back for seconds and thirds of the tastiest selections. Now that I've done it, I know that there is no better way to spend an afternoon with good friends than by lingering over a good feijoada. There are places in New York that serve the dish (Circus on the Upper East Side and SOB's on Varick Street are ones I’ve heard of), but neither Nosher nor I have heard of a place that serves up an authentic Brazilian feijoada buffet on a regular basis. Until we find one, I will have to just relive my fond memories of São Paulo, and of course, of the other Brooklin.

WD-50: This Is What a New Star Looks Like

***CONTENT
 Only very rarely does a restaurant emerge like Athena from Zeus's head, fully-realized and deserving of a Michelin star (or two or three). Much more often, it takes time for an establishment to mature and develop its own culinary identity. Sometimes all the elements never quite come together in the perfect storm necessary, but once in a while, they do. This is precisely what has happened with Wylie Dufresne's WD-50 over the past three years. We have been listening to the buzz around this restaurant for longer than we've lived in New York- the chatter has been all about the quirkiness, the creativity, and the superb quality of the food. But one aspect has, until recently, overshadowed the cooking: the mad science of the place. Much like an American Heston Blumenthal, Dufresne has worked to create dishes that challenge the senses in their unusual shape, color, texture, and presentation- all the while offering nothing but pleasure for the nose and palate. Reviews have been positive, but the word on the street was that quirkiness overwhelmed much of the experience, very much like eating an episode of Ally McBeal. Apparently, in the restaurant's early days, most dishes on the menu featured a variety of 'soils,' which were just crumbled and crushed ingredients that formed the carpet upon which the rest of the food was served. While most diners seemed to concur that the concept worked, it also drew considerable criticism for being a little contrived and gimmicky. Today the soils are still present in a few dishes, but in the past several months, things have settled down conceptually in the WD-50 kitchen, allowing the bubbling cauldrons and Erlenmeyer flasks to take their proper places as accent pieces alongside saucepans and butcher blocks. As a result, the restaurant was awarded its first Michelin Guide star this week on the very day we had coincidentally booked our first visit. We were joined (and treated) by our Corresponding Cousin, who had also been eager to eat at WD-50 for quite some time, and were welcomed into the restaurant's celebration by the waitstaff, who immediately poured all three of us (and everyone else in the place that night) a glass of their Avinyo Brut cava. We toasted and downed our drinks while mulling over the menu, which though relatively simple, demands a bit of imagination. Descriptions of dishes tend to emphasize ingredients and not method of preparation, so the foie gras appetizer is listed simply as 'Foie gras, candied olives, green peas, beet juice', which does not give any hint at all that what you will receive is a bullet of foie gras filled with sweet beet juice, resting on a fluffy bed of green pea mash that is made from cryo-vacced peas. It's almost magical to see a simple list of mundane ingredients incarnated on a plate in such fantastical form. I opted for the octopus appetizer served with celery pesto, pineapple, marcona almonds, and something called 'mojama' that turned out to be dried, roasted tuna belly. It was mixed in with the almonds in a streusel-like concoction that lay on the opposite side of the plate from the octopus. In prior days, would that have counted as a soil? Perhaps, but isolating it at a distance from the rest of the ingredients was important to the dish's success- combining all of the tastes on the plate offered one very complex result that set off the taste of the celery pesto like a firecracker, while sampling from either side of the plate provided another, more subtle result that allowed the sweet pineapple rolls a star turn of their own. HungryMan's hangar tartare, accompanied by a bearnaise ice cream, pickled asian pears, and a healthy streak of sauce made from amaro-an Italian bitter orange and herb liqueur-had the broadest taste spectrum of anything we've eaten in ages: not only was there sweet, salty, bitter, and sour here, but there was the mouth-coating unctuous appeal of the ice cream, the sharp tang of the pickled apple-pears, and the toothsome flesh of the slow-cooked hangar steak. This is the sort of dish you'd want to put in a time capsule and send into outer space to give the extra-terrestrials a glimpse of what tasting is. Our mains were just as good. HungryMan sat with me on the sofa tonight, a full 24 hours later, talking wistfully about the pork belly he ordered, explaining to me how it was 'luscious and soft,' even softer than the spaetzle that accompanied it. The very dark dried sauerkraut is what I found most enticing, though- it looked just like hijiki seaweed, but instead of the ocean, tasted cruciferous and earthy. Corresponding Cousin's flat iron beef entree provided another pleasant surprise in the form of a lily bulb. Yes, a lily bulb. Even knowing that onions and garlic are close relatives of the lily, seeing a gently sautéed flower bulb on a plate evokes a little excitement. What was even more of a revelation is how perfectly it paired with the radishes and rare meat- because the lily tastes like a cross between a shallot and an endive, it adds piquant high notes to the deep flavor of the beef. Absolutely inspired. The scallop entrée I selected was the least adventurous of the three mains, but rightly so. Good scallops don't need much (and often can't handle much) tarting up, so the scallops themselves were seared very simply and leaned against a bed of very long, thin slices of celery 'pasta' and hazelnut coated potato chunks. All of this was wading in a shallow slick of dashi, which was best when spooned up with the celery strips. I could not taste much of the pine needle oil here, which is a shame, as I imagine that a resinous, aromatic accent would have been perfect in this dish. Despite that, it was excellent, if a little small for a main. The upside to a small portion for dinner is that it leaves you with plenty of appetite for dessert. I chose the caramelized banana with chocolate ice cream and liquorice, not knowing what might arrive on my plate. As it turns out, I never could have predicted the crispy strips of dried banana purée that were sliced and bunched to look like fettucini that rested atop a scoop of milk chocolate ice cream and a golden brown banana half. An unadvertised wedge of banana panna cotta (try saying that ten times quickly) put me in mind of the halo halo I wrote about late this summer. Although there is nothing Flilpino about the WD-50 caramelised banana dessert, it does pay indirect homage to the multiple tastes and crunches of a good halo halo, with the ice cream, fruit, and flan all working in concert. I don't know what Wylie Dufresne and/or Sam Mason, the pastry chef, was thinking when he concocted this, but if he had halo halo on the brain, I wouldn't be a bit shocked. HungryMan's beet cake, pistachio purée, and chocolate sorbet sounded a little bit wild, but was in fact a very traditional combination of flavors, matching a tender pistachio cake with an intensely dark chocolate ice. The beet cake mohawk was a nice visual accent, but it was never the highlight of the dish. All three of us agreed that we thought the beet aromas and flavors were swamped out by the chocolate and rich nuttiness. Even with that in mind, it was delicious and every morsel of this dessert was gone after 3 or 4 minutes. Corresponding Cousin's butternut squash sorbet, on the other hand, had us all marveling. This dessert may have begun life as one of the 'soil' dishes, but it deserves its spot on the menu- the sorbet tasted like a distilled essence of butternut squash. On its own, it would have been too powerfully gourdlike, but the crushed chocolate pastry and pumpkin seed cake harmonized in beautiful counterpoint. This is autumn on a plate. One final element of the meal deserves comment here: the extraordinary service. Our waiter was a French woman who had ready answers to all of our dozens of questions. It became clear in the middle of her description of the beef flat iron entrée that she had gone beyond memorizing crucial details of the dishes- something that most good servers do. Instead, she had actually watched them all being prepared and had paid very careful, scrupulous attention. Such ultracompetent service is a rarity, and it must have helped tremendously when the Michelin inspectors came to call earlier this year. My guess is that they witnessed what we did a few nights ago: a chef with a flair for the unusual who has put his creativity in context, artfully breathing life into a new and enchanting kind of cuisine.

Elementary Korean: Han Bat

***CONTENT
 Great Korean food is one of those hidden gems of New York: everyone has a favorite Chinese place in Chinatown, or a local Thai restaurant in their neighborhood that they think is head and shoulders above the rest, yet few Gothamites seem to seek out good Korean food, which is a shame, given the variety and often exceptional quality of such restaurants in New York. Han Bat, on 35th between 5th and 6th Avenues, is one of these places, nestled into a relatively uncrowded street on the northern edge of Manhattan's miniature Koreatown. Han Bat also carries great personal meaning for Nosher and me, because it was the first restaurant we visited on moving to New York from London- on our approach into JFK, Nosher leaned in to me and said he really wanted Korean food, and so we dropped our luggage off and headed over to the East 30s to scour the area for prospects, only accidentally turning onto 35th Street where we discovered Han Bat. My most recent visit was with good friends Misha and Radiologist Girl, two friends from college that I hadn't seen in a while and with whom I had reconnected at a recent reunion (Yes, I admit it. I go to my college reunions). Radiologist Girl is Indian-American and Misha, as you might have guessed from his name, grew up on borscht and pierogi, so Korean food was a slightly unfamiliar choice to both. Despite this, both went in with a sense of adventure, ordered boldly, and tucked into their food with gusto. I simply sat back and waited for Han Bat to make converts of them both. All meals at Han Bat start with several small traditional dishes of banchan, a kind of Korean mezza that vary from day to day. Often thrown down with little fanfare or explanation by the indifferent waitstaff, our snacks on this night were small bowls of pickled daikon radish, sharp and spicy cabbage kimchee (Korea's well-known pickled accompaniment to practically everything), salted and spiced fish, and some fiery tofu. I am usually a fan of only one or two of these on any given visit, but there is usually something here for most palates. For me, the highlight of any meal at Han Bat is the pajun, described as a grilled green onion and shellfish pancake, but you should probably think of it as more of a succulent and crispy savory pizza with squid. This might not sound delicious, I know, and it certainly does not do the dish justice. The pajun comes to the table artfully sliced in a diamond pattern and is accompanied by a mild soy-based dipping sauce. I've eaten pajuns in a good number of Korean restaurants over the years, and I can honestly say that Han Bat makes a version that is among the best I have had. Theirs is always hot, very slightly crunchy, and astoundingly never greasy- quite a feat for a pan-fried frittata! The only problem with the pajun is that it is so good, I am often distracted from the main dishes that keep coming out of the kitchen as fast as you can eat. At this meal- as with most meals I eat at Han Bat- I ordered the tricky-to-pronounce but extraordinary gobdol bibimbab, a classic Korean dish of marinated ground beef and vegetables (and sometimes seaweed slices), served over rice in a steaming clay pot. At Han Bat, it comes served with a broken egg on top, which you stir into the rest of the dish, allowing it to cook through as it get mixed into the rest of the ingredients. The Bibimbap is made even better by generous squirts of gochu jiang, a sweet red sauce made from chili paste and a variety of spices that sits on every table. Bibimbab is also a good choice for a picky eater- although Han Bat only lists two varieties on its menu, there are as many recipes for Bibimbab as there are spellings (Bi-bim-bop, Bee-bim-bap....could this be the Korean Hanukkah, I mean Chanukah?). As long as your waiter speaks sufficient English and understands you: a situation we have enountered on occasion here, Han Bat will even make your Bibimbab to order, even preparing a version without meat and doubling up on the daikon radish if you are a vegetarian. Unfortunately, Han Bat's attempts at more adventurous dishes can sometimes sound a bit flat in their execution. Radiologist Girl's Yook Hoe, a dish of sauteed beef served over rice, suffered from being fairly one-dimensional. Misha's chicken terayaki was better, but certainly nothing special, and really not even in the same league as the gorgeous pajun that the three of us devoured as an appetizer. The crowd at Han Bat is predominantly Korean, and it's often full at odd times with large groups of Korean tourists or locals, but we have always been welcomed no matter our ethnicity or background. If you go, be prepared to be open to spicy food and unusual presentation- Korean meals are served family-style, with everyone sharing the main dishes. We recommend that you stick to the classics: bibimbap, pajun, bulgoki, and jhim sam gyb sal, and ignore the rest of the menu, unless you have a particular favorite you're after. Oh, and don't bring a lot of money with you -- a night out at Han Bat will run you less than many Asian restaurants in Manhattan -- most dishes cost less than $10. Not a bad deal for a meal as good and as authentic as this one, and one available when you've got a 3:30 am hankering for some kimchee. Han Bat, 53 West 35th St, between 5th & 6th Aves. 212-629-5588

Although I've only had it twice (because I rarely eat Korean, doh), I love pajun! I WANT SOME! NOW! The last time I had it, the restaurant called it \"Korean pizza\", which probably confused my brother who ordered it and didn't really know what it was.

Speaking of this, we saw a restaurant in London that had a sign out front advertising that announced that they 'Specialise in Korean Omelette Pizza,' which as you can imagine probably had the same effect.

Yu kwe or however it is transliterated should be raw beef, like a tartare but usually cut more like a julienne, with sesame oil and Korean pear (also julienne), and a quail egg. I have never seen it presented sauteed as you describe.

That dinner looks excellent. I'll have to remember that one. I've been to quite a few in the neighborhood I can't keep track of which ones I've tried or haven't tried. Swimster and I went to Wonjo the other night (Korean food must have been on both our brains) and it was pretty good. I always get the bibimbap at Kor. restaurants.

Extreme Coffee Makeover: The Coffee Pot

***CONTENT
 Not very long ago, rumors abounded that The Coffee Pot on 9th Avenue and 49th Street had shut its doors forever, that progress in the H.K. had finally driven this stodgy stalwart into bankruptcy. But what actually happened is that they closed for seven weeks to do some massive alterations- desperately needed changes, at that. The old Coffee Pot was all about visual assault: brutal combinations of ugly wall color, mismatched soft furniture, and a schoolbus-sized projection television. It was like drinking coffee inside a cacaphonous Bartok symphony. In other words, exactly what you don't want at 7:30 in the morning. The coffee was also never very good, to be quite honest. HungryMan and I hypothesized that the only reason they stayed open was that there were several pay-as-you-go Internet terminals to draw customers, because heaven knows, that dirty chartreuse paint wasn't the attraction. But now, in a re-invention of Madonna-esque scale, The Coffee Pot has blossomed into a place where people genuinely want to be. Some of it is the new decor, certainly. Walls are now a deep terra cotta and all the old furniture has been swapped out for a look that features white cushions and colorful throw pillows. You have to wonder if white fabric isn't an impractical choice for a place where people sit drinking brown beverages, but it does look good; it's bright and draws attention to the back of the shop, an area that a few months ago was dismal. All the staff are new (save one holdover) as well, according to the woman who took our order this week. From the way the coffee tastes, it seems that the management has found new employees who know how to pull espresso shots properly. The importance of this improvement can't be understated- a coffee shop can never hope to succeed if it doesn't prepare its core product well. Finally, The Coffee Pot can claim to do that. On recent visits, we've tasted the latte drinks (regular and soy), simple espresso, and filtered coffee. All are competent, but the espresso-based drinks are genuinely tasty. The baristas seem to be paying attention to what they are doing, and there also seems to be a real division of labor in place between cashier duties and pulling coffee shots- a separation of activity that can only benefit the quality of the coffee drinks. Pastry also appears to have improved dramatically. Our only quibble is that the muffins, while several thousand times better than the old muffins, could use a taste boost. The cappucino muffin is on the right track but is a little gummy, and the lemon poppyseed variety simply doesn't taste much like a muffin at all; it's not very sweet, not very soft, and not at all citrusy. The muffins are also on the expensive side at $2.00 a pop and don't really merit the extra cost. Making a switch to a better supplier would help complete the shop's transformation from ugly duckling into swan. I even think that showcasing a boutique bakery's products might even help bring in new customers who once avoided the place. But it's also clear that those people are becoming rarer and rarer these days- every time we've visited since the Coffee Pot's re-opening, the place has been jumping. On our most recent visit, we even had a difficult time finding a flat surface to allow us to take some photos. And while the Internet terminals are still here (why shouldn't they be?), we can attest to the fact that they're not the only thing snaring the java-seekers anymore. These days, there's a crisp flat screen television mounted unobtrusively against the rear wall, plenty of free newspapers to read, and most critically, something very decent to nosh. The Coffee Pot, 350 W. 49th Street (at 9th Avenue), 212-265-3566

Let's Party Crabs- Who's Your Plus One?

 Figuring out how to eat a salty treat is usually pretty trivial. Open mouth. Insert food. Chew. But it's not always so simple, as HungryMan and I discovered when we first saw the Let's Party! Roasted Crabs at the JAS Mart on St. Marks last December. We knew that eventually, such a puzzling snack would have to find its way into our apartment. It took such a long time for us to get around to buying them because, quite honestly, we couldn't stop arguing about how precisely we were supposed to consume them. Were they like their larger cousins from the Chesapeake Bay and meant to be cracked, de-shelled, and picked apart before being eaten? Or were they more like gauzy soft-shell crabs and intended to be eaten whole? We couldn't decide. The only way to solve this riddle was, of course, to buy some. So it was that a week ago, we came home with a $1.99 package of what we have come to call Party Crabs. Finding them is never simple, as every Japanese supermarket we have visited in this city seems to stock them in a different area of the store- some keep them in the snack section, others in the fish section, and still others in the prepared foods section. Prices also vary dramatically from about $2 to $5 for the very same product, and because we have only ever seen one brand of these, we're comparing crabs to, well... crabs. A little online investigation revealed that these soy and sesame glazed crabs are supposed to be eaten whole and are often served as a bar nibble or just as a snack. The 'Party Time' caption at the bottom is, I think, intended to remind you that these little crustaceans would make a great alternative to punch, potato chips, and crudité- at least at a party where there are several dozen cats and seagulls on the guest list. I am not certain that Party Crabs will find their way into a bowl at our next shindig, but I do have to admit that they are fascinating to look at through their packaging. It is only upon opening the plastic that you are reminded that crabs are ocean creatures- even though they have been roasted, glazed, and coated in seeds, they do still possess a marine odor, but not an unpleasant one. Strangely, this same smell is not detectable when the crabs are eaten; they taste much sweeter than I expected, and with the nuttiness of the sesame seeds, I was reminded more of caramel corn than anything from the sea. As for the shells, they are paper-thin and crumble in the mouth with no danger of sharp edges. Yes, they are still very crunchy, but they taste quite a bit like the hard morsels of Cracker Jack that hide away in the bottom corners of the bag. They would go well with a very bitter lager or even perhaps with an aromatic drink like tequila or sake. Even better, Party Crabs would make a great garnish to an eggy donburi or even to a creamy soup. No, the crabs alone don't make the party, but they do add enough visual interest and crunch to merit at least an invitation.

I love these little crabs, and remember the absolute fascination the first time I opened a bag of them. Somehow or other, up until the last moment, you're tempted to think they're simply crab-shaped snacks rather than actual crustaceans. The thought of popping them in your mouth in their entirety is unsettling, but not in a bad way! A suggestion: the highly sweet-salty flavour makes these taste pretty good pounded into coarse granules and dusted over seafood salads or steamed rice. (Although it always seems a waste aesthetically-speaking haha.)

 Street food is part of the urban landscape here in New York, just as it is in most other big cities: kebabs, pita sandwiches, empanadas, muffins, dosas, and hot dogs all add an olfactory zing to a walk through practically any neighborhood. The real difference seems to be that here, not only do people buy a lot of the stuff, they celebrate it as well. Enter The First Annual Vendy Awards. There are now four nominees in the running for the honor of being chosen as the pasha of the pushcart, all of whom will face one another in a cook-off (in the cart garage!) on November 10. Tickets are $35, but count as charitable contributions, so you can take a tax deduction with your taco. Perfect!

Vynl Redux: Bigger & Shinier

***CONTENT
 One restaurant on 9th Avenue that most people tend to know is Vynl- it's not a landmark because of the size of the storefront, but rather because it is pretty unusual as diners go. As far as I can tell, it's the only Thai-inspired, glitzy and kitchy diner that features menus sandwiched between the cardboard covers from 33 1/3 LPs from the 1970s and 80s. Until recently, the bar was backgrounded with row upon row of boxed celebrity dolls from that same era: Sonny and Cher, Donny and Marie, New Kids on the Block, etc.. Vynl is such a unicorn of a restaurant that anyone who's been to the 9th Avenue strip more than a couple of times knows all about it. And then it moved. Well, in truth it was much slower than that. The signs appeared a few months ago on a vacant shop about 2 blocks south of its former 54th Street corner, announcing the new location. Progress seemed to be glacial, but it was clear early that the new site would be a few orders of magnitude larger and glammer. Just this week, the new Vynl opened its doors- impressively never missing a beat though, its former location stayed operational until the very end. We dropped by on Thursday's re-opening night and gave a few new dishes and a few of our old standby favorites a try as we admired the diorama boxes that now house such plastic luminaries as N*SYNC and Destiny's Child. HungryMan decided to focus on the Asian dishes and started with the fried tofu appetizer, served with peanuts and a dipping sauce made with vinegar, shallots, and cucumber strips. Anything that involves deep frying tofu is a risk, as it's only good for a very short period of time, after which the blocks transform into leathery chunks. Vynl passed the fried tofu test, but not by much; while the sauce was fantastic, the tofu itself was well on its way to room temperature by the time it got to our table. This is a very easy thing to fix, so we weren't too concerned. And it was still warm enough to be enjoyed, so no harm done. Continuing with the Asian dishes, HungryMan ordered the Sesame Chicken entrée, which was a very large portion of battered and fried chicken pieces, covered in a sweet sesame sauce. This could have benefited from a little chili, but it was a solidly good dish nonetheless. I only wish that Vynl would be a little more adventurous with the garnish of bland broccoli, as this really added nothing to the entrée. Even mixing it in with the chicken would be better than leaving it to the side next to the scoop of white rice. Without the chicken, this plate would have looked more like hospital food than restaurant food, and given the care taken with the surroundings, we expected a little more from the chef. My dinner featured choices from the diner-ish portion of the menu. I started with the butternut squash soup, which as you can see, is served completely unadorned. Somehow, it's fitting though, as the fireworks happen within the dish. The soup revolves around creamy, puréed squash, but the reason why I order this almost every time I come to Vynl (and I suspect, why the dish has been promoted from 'Special' status to regular menu item) is the very subtle spice, the heat that cuts through the sweetness of the squash, and the perfect saltiness of the broth. This is the dish I'd be most likely to try to replicate in my own kitchen. As my main dish, I elected to give the caesar salad with salmon and harissa sauce a try. I've had this before and have really enjoyed it. But last week, something was really awry in the kitchen at Vynl- I had to send back the salmon (which I really dislike doing) because it was so undercooked that parts of it were raw. Not just slightly underdone, but actually raw. When it was returned to me, the same piece of salmon had been removed, slapped back on the grill, and replaced on the bed of lettuce, still underdone. The romaine wasn't much better- the dressing was far too salty (too much cheese), and it tasted as if the entire plate had been re-salted afterwards. It was like eating a salt lick. Four large glasses of water later, we were able to leave, not entirely sure of what will become of the newly relocated Vynl. Perhaps the problems we witnessed were just kinks that will be worked out in short order, but they were still surprising to see in a restaurant that has become a local favorite through its consistency and affordability. My hope is that once things settle down, the cooking will return to its former quality, allowing the food to match the delightful new and very sparkly interior. Vynl, now on 9th Avenue at 51st Street, 212-956-9277

Hacking the Frosting: Chocolate Mint Ganache
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Very few things make me happier than baking. It's soothing and methodical in a way that very few other culinary practices are; and at the same time, it is also much more likely to evolve into a disaster. Walking the fine line between improvising too much and just following a recipe is a tricky business- ratios of flour to leavening, sugar to fat, and liquid to solid have to be either respected or tweaked with mathematical precision. This is why I try not to deviate from the recipe too much when I bake something new, and especially when there are hungry guests on the other side of the cooking equation. That said, one thing I've discovered in the past few years is that uncooked cake frostings tend to be about as indestructable as the cakes themselves are fragile- which works out perfectly for someone like me who loves nothing more than to tweak and futz with a recipe. So when I make a cake, as I did yesterday (for no good reason), I like to find new frostings that I might be able to tinker with a bit. This time, I decided to test out a new icing recipe from the Baking Illustrated cookbook that I had been wanting to try. This particular recipe for 'Simple Chocolate Frosting' is incredibly simple- it uses two ingredients, chocolate and cream- and was designed with cupcakes in mind. If you've ever seen an America's Test Kitchen recipe, you know that they are more than generalized schematics: they are battleplans written with pinpoint accuracy, and then tested, retested, and tested again a few times. So if the recipe is meant to cover 12 cupcakes, it probably won't stretch to much more than that. Alas, I wasn't making cupcakes... . My solution was to see this as a chance to do some kitchen hacking, an opportunity to play around with the one aspect of the dish that I could adjust with some good chance of success. I added powdered sugar to the mixture both to firm up the frosting a bit and to increase its volume. I also decided to use our recent taste-obsession with mint chocolate chip gelato as a motivator and try to infuse a little peppermint into the cake topping. The result is one of the best cakes I've made in years- it's also surprisingly light for a chocolate dessert. This new recipe makes more than enough to frost a two-layer cake, with a bit left over for children (or HungryMan) to eat out of the bowl; if you've ever run out of frosting while covering a cake, you'll understand how important this is. I recommend using good-quality chocolate as well, and if you can get it in chocolate chip form, all the better, as it will make melting it even easier. One last tip: don't skimp on the cooling period- if the ganache doesn't set up, it won't whip, and you'll end up with a pourable, flat coating rather than a spreadable frosting. If you melt the chocolate just as the cake layers come out of the oven, the ganache will be adequately chilled when the cake is cool enough to frost. Just don't rush it. Chocolate Mint Ganache Frosting 8 ounces chopped semisweet chocolate 8 fl. oz. heavy cream 1 cup powdered sugar 2 Tbs. milk 1-2 t. peppermint extract (no other mint extracts should be used) Heat the cream to a simmer (not a rolling boil!) in the microwave or a small saucepan. Pour the heated cream over the chocolate and stir until all the chocolate is melted and the mixture is homogeneous. Cover and refrigerate for at least an hour. Seriously. Whip this chilled ganache mixture with an electric mixer (preferably with balloon whisk beaters) or standing mixer for at least two minutes. As the mixture is being whipped, add the powdered sugar gradually. Then add the milk and then the peppermint extract. The frosting should be extremely light and very easy to spread. Covers and fills one 9\" two-layer cake. 2005 nycnosh.com

Sounds delish - chocolate mint = yum One misconception is that chocolate chips melt easier - actually they are formulated to not melt and keep their shape while baking. Cutting up good quality chocolate bars - eg trader joes sells 17 ounce belgium chocolate - melts quite easily. Just zap in microwave in 30-45 second increments stirring inbetween.

Good point about the shape- the very high surface area:volume ratio does what you say (it retains the shape just as a droplet holds water in a semi-sphere) when chips are baked inside dough, but when they are outside dough, they melt very easily because all of their surface is in contact with heat. You're right that some of the cheaper brands contain wax to help them stay firm, but the good stuff never does!

Astoria's Aptly Named Euromarket

***CONTENT
 My expectations for European specialty grocery shops in New York are generally pretty low. Often, the best you can hope for is a little fresh feta cheese, some unusual dried pastas, and shelves loaded with dusty, superannuated packages of ladyfingers. This is why I get a little excited when I discover a new store with a decent selection of Continental goods. Euromarket, in Astoria, is one of these rare places. Better still, it's about a block from the 30th Avenue N, W subway station. From the outside, it looks like nothing special- perhaps just a somewhat cleaner version of the local supermarkets that dot the neighborhood, but once you're inside, you discover row upon row of pan-European foods. In this part of Queens, you'd be right to expect to find a few Italian and a few Greek items in just about any shop, but Euromarket goes far beyond this, filling six or seven aisles with Polish, Hungarian, Russian, English, Italian, and Greek foods. They seem to carry just about everything from Croatian grape, pumpkin, and eggplant preserves (!) to British Yorkie bars- and all of it at very good prices. When I stopped in, I stocked up on Eastern European candy, rose hip preserves, and Russian Kvass (which they sell by the 2-liter bottle). Unfortunately, I had some further errands, so I could not take advantage of the extensive deli selections (including more than a dozen varieties of feta and at least that many sausages), but I will next time. On the next visit, I will also definitely begin collecting sweet treats for Christmas- nobody makes better Yuletide goodies than the Europeans. But for now, I'll just sit here eating my Bananko candy bar and planning my next excursion to Astoria. Euromarket, 30-42 31st Street (near 30th Avenue), Astoria, Queens, 718-545-5879

Song and the Mile High 'Bistro'

***CONTENT
 Nosher and I flew to visit relatives in Tampa last week and had our first occasion to fly Song Airlines, a low-cost subsidiary of financially ailing Delta Airlines. Outside of a harrowingly bumpy landing back into La Guardia (the winds this Sunday were gusting to 30 miles per hour), we had as good a time as one can have on an airline these days: Song offers a choice of 24 channels of live TV on the tiny seatback screen, which allowed us to toggle between episodes of the hilarious 'Little Britain' on BBC America, a BBQ contest on the Food Network, and the latest on the Miers nomination on CNN. While satellite television at your fingertips is a plus, the gimmicky pre-flight safety instructions and 'just folks' crew commentary detracted from the experience- and then there was the food. Airplane meals lose more than a little bit in taste and presentation by being stuffed with preservatives, sitting around for hours in variable temperatures before being loaded onto the plane and slotted into those murderous rolling carts, and being served in little plastic containers wrapped in yet more plastic. Yet Song somehow actually manages to make things worse, first by misleading you-cognitive dissonance-style- into believing that the food will somehow taste better if you have to pay for your in-flight meal ('cash or credit card - no charge is too small!'), and then again by handing out menus proudly triumphing the menu's guiding force: recent Food Network phenom Dave Lieberman. The logic here is dubious, because in reality, shelling out eight dollars for a bad sandwich only makes you more aware of how awful the food on that tray table really is. My sliced chicken salad with Asian noodles ($8) may have had the right inspiration, but it tasted as shelf stable as it was. It simply could not have turned out well, even disregarding that it sat in a plastic bag for some time before it reached me. Nosher's tofu salad (also $8) was not much better: tasting as it did of burnt toast, although you do have to give Song credit for promoting such a visibly vegetarian-friendly salad among the options on the 'Bistro' menu. On our return flight, Nosher judiciously chose to sleep through the meal service while I, glutton for punishment as always, paid another eight dollars for a 'Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sandwich,' which had a bit more gristle than I normally like in my chicken salad. The sandwich filling was also pushed into the center of two slices of dried-out raisin bread that looked delicious from a distance, slowly approaching down the aisle... . How embarrassing for Dave Lieberman whom, until my flight on Song, I have always enjoyed watching on his Food Network program 'Good Deal.' On his show, Dave affably strolls around Whole Foods in Union Square, buying less-expensive ingredients for dinner parties he devises for his oddly homogenous group of twentysomething friends (as an aside: if you are looking for an even more self-selected circle of friends on a television food program, look no further than my beloved Ina Garten's 'The Barefoot Contessa'; I have yet to see an adult visit her East Hampton home who is not white and over 40). I found myself wondering what kind of hip dinner party would be right for these singed tofu cakes? No, it's probably not really Dave's fault- after all, airplane food is bad for a reason: it has to withstand harsh conditions and long, unattended waits. I guess next time I'll have to be less gullible and bring my own lunch, no matter who designed the menu. Well, unless it's Ina.

Pas de Corkage: Tartine
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-10-15 21:27:00
***CONTENT
 Corkage fees are designed to either encourage patrons to leave their bottles at home and choose one on offer at the restaurant, or in cases where the establishment doesn't serve its own wine, to skip the alcohol completely. Finding a no-corkage restaurant is a rarity, and finding one that actually advertises its policy is nearly impossible, which is why Tartine deserves a little attention. Actually, I'm wary of giving it too much attention, as the interior holds fewer than a dozen small tables, plus a couple of two-tops outside on the patio. West Village locals seem to know about this place and fill it to bursting just about every night. I can't recall a time when I've seen Tartine empty, and at most, I've only ever seen two or three vacant tables inside. So if you do decide to go, be prepared for a bit of a wait when you do. The no-corkage policy is clearly part of the charm of the place; almost every party we saw on a visit last week had a bottle or two in hand, and the sole waiter for the evening carried a corkscrew around on his belt. Yes, a restaurant that doesn't even serve wine has a waiter that totes a well-used corkscrew on his person at all times. That's proof that you shouldn't be shy about bringing your own. Everyone does at Tartine. We certainly did, and planned our meal around a 1998 Graves that we'd been saving for a French meal. Neither of us felt much like cooking, so we met up on West 11th Street and took the only available table- outside. I think at this point in the year, we are both in real denial about how much longer the weather is going to hold, so we're trying to eat al fresco as much as we can. Figs seemed a good choice for a last-hurrah of an outdoor meal, so I ordered the salad of goat cheese, mixed greens, and roasted figs ($8.75). I wish there had been more figs on the plate- only 4 small ones sat around the perimeter of the dish. Perhaps that's enough to allow this dish to be called a 'fig salad,' but it did seem a little stingy. The fruits were also a little overcooked- even crispy- and when figs are overcooked, their skins transform into wrinkly rounds of leather. Overall, the salad was still a success, but it played dangerously close to the edge of disaster. The Salad Basquaise ($9.25) that HungryMan chose was quite a bit better, featuring rolls of roasted eggplant, red pepper, and goat cheese. I loved that this appetizer was served on and around leaves of basil and drizzled with olive oil and balsamic vinegar- it gave the dish a very Italian flavor, even though it was supposed to be from the Southwest of France. There was perhaps a bit too much food on the plate for an appetizer. The portion could be halved (and the price as well) without losing anything. HungryMan's entree was also a success- his Bouchée a La Reine was a puff-pastry treasure chest that housed slices of chicken, mushrooms, and a very subtle sage-infused white béarnaise sauce. Imagine a chicken pot pie stretched vertically and made with fresh, flaky pastry, and you've got the essence of the Bouchée. Although it was well-prepared, this is a heavy dish, and really should be eaten alone- with no appetizer beforehand. I like to think of this as the kind of thing a person's ancient French grandmother would serve after watching her charges frolic in Alpine snow drifts. Given that, maybe this was not the best thing for a warm October evening in Manhattan, but it was pretty tasty nonetheless. I opted for the Pissaladiere ($10.25), a Provencal tomato tart that bears no small resemblance to a pizza. It's a tomato and cheese tart, sprinkled with herbes de Provence and draped with several long slices of anchovy. For some reason, this is listed alongside the appetizers, but the pissaladiere is absolutely no appetizer- it is a hefty portion of food that comes with a salad. It was also my favorite dish of the night, very deftly matching sweet roasted tomatoes with the saltiness of the preserved anchovies and goat cheese. I had no trouble eating all of my entrée, mainly because my fig salad was neither large nor filling, but be aware that this is not a tiny serving. Tartine is known for its homemade, on-premises baking, so HungryMan and I both felt as if we had to sample the desserts. We chose the Dacquoise ($4.25), a rich chocolate and meringue cake covered in a toasted crunchy crumble of butter and nuts. The slice we were given was plenty for us to share, especially after the rest of the meal and the bottle of wine we brought along with us. My impression of the dacquoise was that, while it was undoubtedly pretty great, I would have enjoyed it more on its own as a snack or as a sweet breakfast, and not as much as a capstone to a meal. The bill was small in comparison to what we would have spent at many other French restaurants in the city, and certainly at French restaurants in the West Village. Tartine is still not cheap, but it is close, and it gives diners a chance to eat a meal while drinking a bottle of wine that they really and truly want to be drinking- not something a wine buyer or sommelier thinks they might enjoy. Of course, in a perfect world, we'd cook up something at home that matches our taste in food as precisely as our taste in wine, but when that isn't possible, Tartine offers the next best thing. Tartine, 253 W. 11th Street (at W. 4th Street), 212-229-2611

Square One: The Opening of Cookshop
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-10-12 04:13:00
***CONTENT
 Tonight, the butcher paper is gone from the windows of Cookshop on 10th Avenue and the grill is working overtime to satisfy the curious. And there are a lot of them- Cookshop redefined the concept of 'long-awaited' this past year as it sat senescent in West Chelsea, promising either to open 'this summer,' 'in September,' or more agonizingly, 'soon.' The newest member of the Five Points family, Cookshop's menu reflects chef Marc Meyer's overriding dogma: ingredients should be local (where possible), fresh, wild or organic, and as much akin to what you'd get if you hunted and gathered them yourself. Not a bad place to start- a similar idea has brought widespread and well-deserved attention to the food at both River Cafés. Yet, ingredients are always a starting point and not much more. Good ones ease the transition into fully-realized dishes, but they remain only building blocks. So with the best locally-sourced ingredients and a chic modern glass and wood interior, how could Cookshop possibly go wrong? That's what we keep asking ourselves after our visit last night- the restaurant's opening night. We got our first hint that something might be amiss when we received the wine list- a generous, two-sided array. Most wines seem to hover around $35-45, but there are a few options in the low-mid $20s, as well as many more costly bottles. The problem last night was that nearly half of the wines were marked with an 'X', indicating that they were not yet available. Both of our first choices were so marked, and we ended up selecting a Querciabella that we had drunk in the UK- a safe choice, but not what we actually wanted. Clearly, a lot can be forgiven on a first night, but frankly, I would rather have seen a markedly pared-down list of wines that were on hand than be taunted by the bottles I could not select. With our wine, we also opted for one of the 'Snacks' listed on the menu- the fried spiced hominy, which we hoped would achieve the same success as the pozole hominy at Zarela's. Unfortunately, what we were served was tough and very oily (despite the wicking paper underneath) and tasted more of wet BBQ Corn Nuts than anything else. These were also very difficult to eat, as they were too greasy to eat with our fingers and too leathery to eat with a fork, so we left nearly half the small portion uneaten. Our appetizers were both significantly better. My Montauk squid with lima beans and salsa verde was excellent: it was the best dish of the night, although I didn't suspect that would be the case at the time. HungryMan and I both cooed over the inventive pairing of the limas with the squid, commenting also that the very subtle use of mint in the salsa verde put this dish over the top into the realm of the truly great. The Autumn Greens Salad that HungryMan ordered was a patchwork of lettuces, coated generously (but not over-dressed) with a vinaigrette, parmesan cheese, and anchovies. Lots and lots of anchovies. They weren't visible- my guess is that they were pounded into the dressing- but like a very loud toddler, they demanded complete attention. So much attention that HungryMan insisted that we swap plates. I really adore anchovies and was happy enough to do so, but after a few bites of the salad, I could see why anyone without a real passion for little salted fishes might have a difficult time with this salad: it really ought to have been named 'Anchovies with Autumn Greens,' because the focal point was, by default, the fish. HungryMan was happier with his braised lamb with rosemary, chard, and cippolini onions, but still not ecstatic. The meat was moist and well-cooked, but the seasonings fell flat and distracted more from the meat than they enhanced it. There was also a disc of something unusual in the center of the plate, something that tasted like an errant organ meat, and which we suspect might have been a chicken liver that got lost in the kitchen and found its way onto our plate. Oops. Better than the lamb, but still not extraordinary was the cod with matchstick-cut apples, butternut squash ribbons, and celery. While the fish itself was juicy and very flaky, the creamy sauce that topped the fillet added nothing to the experience. It was unctuous and not very flavorful. It seemed to be there to add lubrication more than anything else. There was also far too much sweetness to this dish and not enough savory counterbalance to make the whole thing work. Generally, restaurants don't tend to under-salt their food, but there seems to be a timidity with the salt shaker in the kitchen at Cookshop. Dessert waited for us back in Hell's Kitchen, so we skipped the sweets and went right for the coffee, which in truth, was probably one of the evening's bigger mistakes. After ordering two cappucinos (Amanda Hesser's injunctions be damned), HungryMan sat watching the staff struggle with the espresso machine for a good 10 minutes, after which we were brought two tarry coffees that were profoundly bitter, burned, and nearly black. They appeared to have only been waved in the general direction of steamed milk and not actually mixed with any. If there is one quick fix that Cookshop can put into action immediately it is to get the coffee situation under control, because as it stands now, it is more than disappointing; it is embarrassing. Putting that aside, no other part of the meal was actually bad. But at the same time, only one part of the meal- the squid- was very good. Everything else was just adequate, which is fine for a restaurant that charges $10 for a main dish, but Cookshop charges $20-$30 for its entrees. The service was competent and (except for the coffee) seemed more like what you might expect of a restaurant that had been open weeks instead of hours. I only wish that the food had possessed the same maturity, the same sense of potential realized. Perhaps with time Cookshop will blossom and will do right by its fine local ingredients, but on this, its debut evening, it is still more awkward than polished. Cookshop, 156 10th Avenue (at 20th Street), 212-924-4440

Great review guys, it seems you have been quite busy on the dining front! I've been pretty low on the funds lately and haven't gone to a fun new restaurant in quite some time...bummer about this place, I know what you mean about the entrees being so pricey but not delivering...

Saravanaas Peps Up Curry Hill

 Just as the Indian food scene in Manhattan seemed to be going precisely nowhere, bogged down by phoned-in curries and soggy naan, a newcomer arrived and reminded us once again how good this cuisine can be when it's prepared with care. What is surprising is that Saravanaas has managed to do this not by reinventing South Indian cooking with displays of radical, fusion-inspired flair, but rather by concentrating its energies on making very traditional dishes to a very high standard. This ethos is one that comes directly from the Hotel Saravan Bhavan, the parent restaurant (and now company) that gave birth to this and a dozen other similar restaurants around the world. The philosophy that quality trumps all is one that works very well when applied to any cuisine, but is one that pays massive dividends here. Our visit to Saravanaas also marks our first meal with fellow food-blogger Salli Vates, whose work brings her to this neighborhood quite a bit. After plans to eat a huge vegan meal with our mutual friend Pisces collapsed, Salli offered Saravanaas as an alternate choice, telling us that she had been there several times in the past few weeks. Now, we're not stupid. We know that if Salli Vates tells you that she's eaten at a restaurant even more than once recently, you should cancel that evening's plans and head directly to the place. And so we did. Our group started with a few vada-which are lentil fritters that look and taste quite a bit like cumin, curry, and onion hush puppies- and idli-fluffy white discs of rice and lentils that absorb the taste of everything covering them. In this case, the topping options were a coconut chutney, a mint and cilantro chutney, and a very mild sambar. Idli also made another appearance in the mini tiffin thali I ordered. This time, they arrived in miniature, floating lazily in a little lake of sambar. I preferred them in their larger form, to be honest, but the tiny discs were still very good and reminded me of flattened little matzoh balls. The rest of the mini tiffin was similarly excellent, especially the bright orange 'sweetmeat' dessert that tasted of cardamom, honey, and a little rose water. HungryMan was disappointed that his onion rava masala dosa was not of the species that arrives at the table in a form about the size and shape of a fully-grown man's shirt sleeve. Instead, his was of the folded, triangular variety, and despite his disappointment at its lack of pageantry, he adored it. So, too, did Salli love her mini meal, another combination platter that featured a crispy papadum, three kinds of rice, and spicy Indian pickles. I tasted two of the three rice dishes and think that I might have to switch my thali choices on our next visit. The rice dishes gave me conclusive proof of something that I had begun to suspect: Saravanaas excels at its use of more subtle spices such as fenugreek, which appears in several dishes; in fact, it is actually discernable as a flavor- something I have only ever experienced at one other South Indian restaurant (more on that in a bit). Our other dinner companion was a recent law school graduate, out enjoying his last few nights of freedom before joining Mr. Scrooge in his drafty counting-house. Perhaps sensing that this was his last chance for a little excitement, he ordered the onion and chili utthappam, which was a gorgeous, 9-inch patty, studded with red onions and crisped bits of lentil. It was really divine stuff- easily the best dish of the evening, and maybe also a fitting send-off for the soon-to-be shackled lawyer; memories of that utthappam should tide him over with memories of the outside world for a few months, at least. Heck, even I still think about it. We finished our meal with a trio of desserts: the payasam of the day, the gulab jamun, and the badam halwa. My favorite was the daily special payasam, which on our visit was a very loose pudding of fine vermicelli, cashews, currants, cardamom, rose water, orange zest, and milk. It's the sort of dessert that relies heavily on the chef's sense of flavor balance, as too much of any of the ingredients could produce disaster. But not at Saravanaas, where attention to that kind of detail seems to be integrated into everything they prepare. And it should also be said that we're not easy to please when it comes to South Indian food, having cut our teeth on the mysore and pullavs at Udupi Palace, another group of vegetarian restaurants. Actually, in quite a few ways, Saravanaas and Udupi Palace seem to be twins, or at least kindred spirits. We have been searching for an Udupi-replacement since coming to New York, and I'm very pleased to say that I am certain we've found it at Saravanaas. The décor of the restaurant might be more Ikea than India, but the cooking is pretty extraordinary. I do hold out some hope that the local branch will expand its range of offerings to include some of the 'Tongue Ticklers' (hot and spicy appetizers) featured on the menus of some of the foreign locations, but this is a very minor complaint. There is plenty on the menu at Saravanaas to keep my tongue tickled in the meantime. Saravanaas, 81 Lexington Avenue (on the corner of 26th Street), 212-679-0204

Seafood by the Bay: Lunch at South Fin Grill
***AUTHOR
Nosher

***CONTENT
 Last weekend, Nosher accompanied me to a colleague's digs out on Staten Island. This had been a long-planned trip to see our friend's house and to check out a new seafood restaurant on the far end of the Island, on the boardwalk of South Beach. I'm always surprised at how easy it is to get to Staten Island; somehow the psychological barrier of crossing Upper New York Bay makes considering the trip a bigger deal than it actually is. The ferries run frequently, even on the weekend, and the ride is beautiful whatever the weather. After meeting up with our friend, he took us on an expertly-led quick tour of St. George and its weekend farmer's market. We then hopped into his car and took a ten minute drive to our beachfront destination. South Fin Grill opened back in July and appears to have introduced elements of Manhattan-style dining (and Manhattan-style prices) to the forgotten borough. I say 'Manhattan-style' because the place is conspiciously glitzy for what was, until recently, a somewhat down at the heels section of Staten Island. The place is all dark wood walls and art deco inspired chairs, white linen napkins and china, and modern geometric chandeliers- together signalling that this is supposed to be upmarket dining. Yet on the other hand, the sign and stylized fish logo at the front door of the place say 'suburban strip mall' much more than 'urban chic'. And about those Manhattan-style prices: when we were talking about our destination at the greenmarket, a local woman overheard us and quickly advised us to try a nearby Italian place instead, averring that 'that new place is much too fancy and expensive.' Despite (or perhaps because of) the warning, we arrived and decided to bypass the fancy interior altogether, as the weather was still beautiful. South Fin has a lovely back deck overlooking the South Beach boardwalk with sweeping views of the Verazzano-Narrows Bridge and, in the distance, the southern reaches of Brooklyn, Coney Island, and Brighton Beach. The menu hit all the right notes for an alfresco late summer lunch: lobster rolls, light salads, burgers, and simply-grilled swordfish, mahi mahi, yellow fin tuna, and salmon steaks. The three of us decided to skip these options in favor of one of the raw bar platters. In this case, what we ordered was called the Mansion Sampler ($65), a three-tiered wedding cake of lobster, shrimp, oysters, little neck clams, and crab claws. Unlike a wedding cake however, the ensemble is crowned not with plastic bride and groom, but with a small bowl of bright green fluke ceviche. The platter arrived quickly, and we wasted no time tucking into the salty, icy oysters, the fresh shrimp, and the glistening clams, which I found deliciously cold and chewy. The lobster (the platter we chose came with a one-pound lobster, cooked, chilled, and divided into halves) was a bit skimpy and, while still fresh, seemed a bit rubbery to me in parts. The ceviche, on the other hand, was addictive, especially with the rolls and crusty raisin-walnut bread our waitress kept supplying. The amount of food was slightly less than adequate for three people; there is an even larger raw bar platter on the menu- the Palace Sampler ($100) that comes with two one-pound lobsters and 16 (not eight) oysters- but if ordering the Mansion seemed slightly decadent, the Palace platter would have been positively plutocratic. Moreover, Nosher and I have mixed experiences with such extravaganzas of crustacea. Once, in Paris, we ordered a plat de fruits de mer of such proportions that adjoining diners offered us words of encouragement for us to finish it. Ever since, I think we've both been cautious about ordering more than we can handle. In this case, even the addition of an extra eater to our team didn't give us enough confidence to attempt the Palace Sampler's high bar. At the end of the day however, South Fin Grill was just okay, but clearly not an evening out in the 6e arrondisement. (Not to mention the fact that our Paris feast was substantially cheaper.) Firstly, at South Fin, the amount of seafood was far from overwhelming for the money. Secondly, there is the entertainment issue. We arrived just as the season-ending boardwalk fair, with its DJ playing bad Europop, Top 40, and hip hop, was winding down a frenzied set. Then, as we were leaving, we noticed a two-man calypso band setting up speakers and instruments on the restaurant's deck. Seeing this, we commented that we were lucky to have (mostly) escaped both of the afternoon's aural assaults. Our suggestion is that if you go and do not want to be lite-jazzed into a stupor, request a table far from the door. While it's clearly a (mostly mental) hike for some Manhattanites, South Fin Grill could be a great day's outing, especially if you've got good weather on your side. Sitting out on the restaurant's deck with the sun going down over the Verrazano Bridge, a nice glass of wine in your hand and the breeze coming in over the bay, you could almost forget you're still in New York City. Almost. South Fin Grill, 300 Father Capodanno Blvd., Staten Island

I had taken my children to the boardwalk entertainment that day/evening & had wondered exactly what you felt. I haven't tried the restaurant, yet, but imagined the patrons would have liked less beachy festivities blasting by them while they feasted on a $300 dinner. Glad you made it over ther Narrows!

This is one of those times when we just made a bad choice about when to go- I think the issue was more that we couldn't escape the noise no matter where we went that was the problem. But it does seem like there's a lot of good stuff going on in Staten Island these days. You're absolutely right!

My second vist was NOT as good as my first. Service was a nightmare, and dinner took almost 3 hours. Seseme Tuna entree lacked flavor of any kind, and my cut was no high quality. Waiters seem to have little knowledge of seafood. When a restaurant offers 6 different kinds of oysters, they need to be able to explain the difference to the customer.

My meal there was not as good as I would expect. The beef satay appetizer was full of hard pieces (chewy ligaments, perhaps). The filet mignon had many pieces of tasteless fat and also some hard pieces. My wife did not enjoy her Mahi Mahi and said it tasted unfresh. The drinks were creative but the wine was overpriced. A $30 bottle sold there for $57. The cheesecake dessert was tasty but not cakelike at all. Overall, I would not go back.

Schmaltz That's Worth The Schlep: Dinner at The 2nd Avenue Deli

Nosher
***DATE
2005-10-07 06:49:00
***CONTENT
 During this all-too-brief week between the major Jewish holidays of Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur, it only seems appropriate to introduce the subject of a significant institution in New York food culture: the Jewish deli. Impossible as it is for me to believe, we haven't yet discussed in these pages the timeless New York Jewish delicatessen experience: the no-nonsense staff, the alarmingly unhealthy food, the geriatric clientele. There is no shortage of candidates for the original, echt kosher (or more likely, 'kosher style') deli in the city; Katz's on Houston is surely authentic, and the old Ratner's on Delancey may have set the standard until it closed in 2000. But for pure comfort food, and for the knowledge that your waitress is surely someone's bubbe in her off-hours, the 2nd Avenue Deli takes the kugel. And for Nosher and me one night last week, a craving for grandma's cooking was driving us meshuga, so we got our tochises in a cab and within minutes we could smell the brisket. Like entering a synagogue for the first time, The Deli is a world unto itself, with its own rules and customs. We were immediately ushered in, past the old Automat display from the 1950s, by the kindly woman at the door and hurried to an empty table. Menus quickly appeared, and quickly, heaping bowls of crisp sour and half-sour pickles, pickled tomatoes, and sweet cabbage sauerkraut followed. If you go, take it slow, because it's all too easy to fill up on these goodies while you pore over the extensive menu of delicacies like cholent, kasha varnishkas (essentially, buckwheat and bowtie pasta), knishes, and triple-decker tongue sandwiches ('Tongue Temptation' is my winner for most suggestive menu item). The Deli also makes its own chopped liver, and although this doesn't exactly sound as exotic as something involving a tongue, it is an item so good you may forget what you're eating and how it's made (I'll save recipes that call for schmaltz, or rendered chicken fat, for another post). Nosher and I have now been to the Deli three times, and are impressed by its consistency. Every time we go, at least one person in our party orders the Matzoh Ball Soup and someone else orders potato latkes, and each time, they are exceptional. Last week was no exception; the soup came out in a large metal measuring cup, and the waitress theatrically inverted the container into the bowl, flecks of dill and carrot swirling around an impossibly light and perfectly formed matzoh ball. It was so good I finished it before Nosher could ask for a taste. The latkes were equally good, although you have to work quickly, as they arrive hotter than flames and then cool off fast. Really, their chewy centers and crisp crusts are much better warm, so eating quickly pays dividends. The 2nd Avenue Deli's latkes are nothing like the latkes your family might have made for Hanukkah (no thin, sickly green latkes here)- instead, they are reminders of the miracles that can be achieved with simple potatoes and oil. Better still, they are big enough that one of them and a bowl of soup are together enough of a meal for most people. Most people... . That night, however, Nosher and I were no ordinary mortals, and we somehow made room for more. My craving for liver, in fact, was one of the catalysts for the trip in the first place. The Deli's broiled chicken livers did not disappoint; smooth and slightly gamey, they come slathered in onions and paired with a bowl of passable, but almost certainly not homemade apple sauce to cut the richness of the meat. My only problem was that there was far too much of it, and the wonderfully soft rye bread that they brought out (sandwiches, anyone?) only filled me up faster. Nosher ordered the whitefish salad platter, and judging both by the speed at which he polished it off and his entreaties to 'try some!', I feel safe in saying that he enjoyed it as much as I did the livers. Nosher's dish was generously-sized as well: so big that the salad came with its own salad- a scoop of potato salad, its flavors perfectly balanced between sweet and salty, making me forgive the watery mayonnaise it was swimming in. All of this good food and the palpable family-style atmosphere of the 2nd Avenue Deli makes the recent history of the Deli that much more bittersweet. The Deli's original owner, Abe Lebewohl, was shot in the neighborhood back in 1996, in a murder that remains unsolved to this day. While Abe's daughter Sharon has ably taken over, there's no getting over the large poster on the door offering a reward for information on the killing- Abe has taken up residence alongside the old photographs and Lower East Side memorabilia that line the walls. Indeed, apart from the poster, it's clear that the décor, the dining room layout, and many of the sharp-tongued waiters haven't changed in years. Yes, some of the tables are so close together you can share in the conversations of your neighbors, and the bill at the end of the meal is close to 40 percent higher than it should be, but these faults somehow become lost in the larger experience of the place. You don't complain, because that's just the way The Deli is, has been, and probably always will be. Some things probably should never change, despite their flaws. I think this is a sentiment even bubbe would endorse. 2nd Avenue Deli, 156 Second Avenue at 10th Street, 212-677-0606

Not Much of a Melon, Not Much of a Gherkin

***CONTENT
 Nobody will blame you if you haven't heard of the melon gherkin. We hadn't either, until this past Sunday's visit to the Staten Island Greenmarket, that is. And to be quite honest, we almost missed them, because melon gherkins were named with a bit of ironic hyperbole. That is, calling them 'melons' is pretty generous, as each one is about the size of a green olive. A very small green olive. Olives are, in fact, what I thought these were, when I spotted them in a pint-basket on at the Rabbits Run booth. When I asked the seller- who it emerged is also the grower- to give me a little background on the mysterious little ovoids, all he could tell me is that they are a cousin to the cucumber and that they should be eaten green. They were only $0.10 apiece, and I figured they would be a cheap experiment in unusual produce, so I purchased 20 of them. That sounds like a lot, but all 20 are shown, lounging on a saucer in the picture you see here. When I sliced them open, I could see the cucumber link. It was a truly Snopes-ish moment, but I realized that the melon gherkin is simply a very tiny cucumber with almost no flesh. Inside, it's mostly just pulpy seeds, divided into three compartments, exactly as they are in your common cuke. But when it comes to the taste, they provided another surprise: they are more similar to a green tomato than to a cucumber. I found them just a little tart, with almost none of the sweetness of a cucumber. But they also did not taste unripe. Perhaps the closest taste-analogue is the tomatillo, and I imagine that melon gherkins might make a delicious salsa verde (albeit an expensive one). Taking our cues from the melon gherkin's resemblance to the green tomato, we decided to combine ours with sliced yellow and red heirloom tomatoes (also from the Rabbits Run farm), some fresh oregano, and a savory dressing of mirin, olive oil, sea salt, and capers. The melon gherkins lent a slight crunchiness and tang to the salad, and to our surprise, once they were mixed in with the dressing, began to take on more of a cucumber-like coolness. We both agreed that we'd buy more of these and try some new recipes with them (freezer pickles, the aforementioned salsa verde, and maybe even something with mascarpone and anchovies), but I have never seen them anywhere but in Staten Island. Even Google only shows about a dozen actual positive matches for this unusual little vegetable, so finding our next supply might be tricky. In the meantime, keep your eyes peeled and let us know if you find melon gherkins, even if you're not in NYC. But be forewarned, they're tiny!

Brunch with a Theme: Fairway Café

***CONTENT
 Legendary Fairway Market is known for its cheese, its coffee, its massive cold room (at the 125th Street location), and most importantly, its value. The prices are so good, in fact, that the Fairway at 74th/75th and Broadway has become the site of a weekly pilgrimage for HungryMan and me since we moved to New York- we stock up on good cheese, produce, and fish, and leave the store laden like two mountain burros. But very happy burros. A few months ago, we realized that the stairwell near the cashiers actually led to another part of the supermarket, one that houses a massive (and cheap) array of organic foods and green-goods. What's more- there's a restaurant up there. Now, in truth, we'd heard about the restaurant once or twice but had just never managed to piece together that it must be upstairs. The restaurant somehow, despite the fact that its entrance is really hidden away inside the bustle of the market, manages to attract a very large crowd. Each time we've gone, it has been filled to capacity. Actually, filled to bursting is a better description- at least, that's the scene we discovered yesterday, when we joined our friend Chilena for brunch. I admit that we arrived with an agenda. Another foodie friend waxes lyrical about the pancakes at Fairway, so we figured that this brunch would be the perfect chance to taste them for ourselves. With that in mind, I ordered the pancakes alone ($6.95), and HungryMan ordered the Big Boy Special Plate ($10.95), which includes not only pancakes, but two eggs and bacon. So what about the pancakes? We have come to expect very wide, head-sized pancakes from New York restaurants- but instead, we were served smallish cakes about three inches in diameter. Even more unusually, Fairway pancakes are not as tall as you might predict. We think this is because they use less leavening in the recipe, and perhaps even a bit less buttermilk. But they do not suffer for the reduction. In fact, I think that these pancakes are improved by both their size and their squat profile; sometimes when cooks try to create a pancake of architectural proportions, they end up serving a rubbery mess that, yes, supports its own weight, but that tastes like something that can support its own weight. The attention in the Fairway pancake seems to be much more on showcasing flavors: especially butter and a very pleasant toastiness. Served simply with a little fruit, or as more of an ensemble player alongside very fresh eggs and papery slices of bacon, these might be the most perfect brunch food we've had in a long time. Chilena must have sensed that this was a patty-themed meal, so she opted for the crab cakes ($14.00) as her brunch selection. Unwittingly, she acted as the perfect counterpoint to our own choices, opting for something from the more savory side of the brunch menu. Normally, that's HungryMan's job, but today, he had his face buried in a stack of pancakes, so we had to outsource the task. Chilena stepped up and was also able to add a new level of expertise to her assessment of her dish- in a previous life, she worked in Alaska at a seafood cannery, so the woman really knows her shellfish. With that in mind, it means even more that she was so pleased with her food. Almost all of the crab meat in her cakes was lump crab- a good sign- and was not over-cooked. There were flecks of chives, pepper, and dill mixed into the meat, giving a little color to the mayonnaise and egg base, but never overpowering the sweetness of the crab. The mesclun salad that came with the cakes was dressed with a basic vinaigrette- nothing extraordinary- but it was a good way of balancing the heft of two very solid, very chunky patties. I don't often think that a $14.00 plate for lunch is a good value, but I would absolutely order these crab cakes on a future visit, given what I saw and tasted at this meal. Now the real problem becomes which to choose: the pancakes or the crab cakes? Fairway Café, 2127 Broadway (between 74th and 75th Streets), 212-595-1888 Ext. 145

The All-Pastry Diet: Financier Patisserie

Nosher
***DATE
2005-10-01 01:34:00
***CONTENT
 The other day, I took a colleague who was visiting from San Francisco out for coffee and ended up at one of my favorite haunts - so favored, in fact, that I have been reluctant to reveal it on this site, for fear the place will become even more overrun than it already is. The place is Financier, a beautifully conceived French patisserie tucked away around the corner from Wall Street, in the heart of the financial district. It's imaginatively named: Financier is the French name for the almond flavored, miniature loaf-shaped cakes -- a cousin to the madeleine -- that accompany every coffee they make and, I suppose, it's an evocation of those gilded-age titans of industry who worked nearby. It's also wonderfully atmospheric, with light yellow and lime green walls dotted with framed French stock certificates from the 20s and 30s. Even better, unlike real Parisian patisseries which offer a Hobson's choice of (a) coffee with seating but no pastry, or (b) pastry with coffee but no seating, Financier has plenty of everything. The result may still feel more New York than Left Bank, but there are times when, with a croissant in one hand, you might not be so sure. Financier is owned by the younger son of the Poulakakos family, who also happen to own practically half of the rest of Stone Street; the parents founded the venerable (and recently closed) Harry’s Bar, and they also own the faux-Irish bar Ulysses and the upscale Bayard’s in India House on the same block. And speaking of Bayard’s, the reason the sweets are so good at Financier is that they are prepared every morning by Eric Bedouch, Bayard’s own pastry chef, on the fifth floor of an adjoining building. In fact, if you arrive at Financier early enough in the morning (between 8 and 8:30), you might see teams of assistant pastry chefs carting trays of viennoiserie from one building to the next. Getting there is also the key to a successful visit, as most of the good pastries disappear by the end of the day. There’s a reason for the speed at which these treats vanish: they are amazing; I’ve never had a bad experience here, even after so many visits that the staff know me by name and even where I go on vacation. Financier makes consistently good babas au rum, macarons (and not your Manischewitz variety, but the rounder, flatter discs of light-as-a-feather meringue crust sandwiching chocolate or (better) pistachio cream filling), éclairs, apricot and other fruit brioches, and assorted tarts, tartlettes, mousses, crèmes, and caramels. The croissants are so buttery and soft, and with so many layers of dough, they stand up on their own without jam or butter. Coffee here is also the best I’ve had downtown (espresso drinks range from $2-3, no more than Starbucks), although consistency depends on who is working the machine that day. Financier even does a number of sandwiches and small salads for lunch (I’ve had practically all of these, too – most of them quite good), but if you’re there later in the day, the thing to order is the quiche – the tomato and goat cheese version is heaven on a plate – and it’s served alongside a small mesclun salad with a simple vinaigrette. My only gripe about Financier is that it can attract a sometimes snobby crowd and is often furiously busy at lunchtimes with traffic from many of the European bank branches nearby, making it difficult to snag a table. On the other hand, all these people make Financier one of the most lively and vibrant downtown spots for a weekday meet-up with a colleague or friend, bar none.

Despite my bakery obsession and that I live less than 10 minutes from this bakery (maybe 5 minutes if I walk really fast!), I've NEVER BEEN THERE...when it was open. The first time I walked by, it was around midnight (just wanted to see where and how far it was). The last time I tried to go during the day it had closed early, but I think it usually closes before I can get to it anyway. Do you know the opening hours? ...man, I really want to go now after looking at your photos. Aah! AHHHH!!! *sob*

Not Just for Purim Anymore: Poppy Hamentashen
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
 Long ago, in a graduate school far away, I attended the annual Hamentashen (also Hamentaschen) Festival and discovered true love. I had eaten hamentashen before on many visits to New York, and even once or twice in remote places like North Carolina and Maine. But what I had never done, until that point, was sample a poppy seed hamentashen. When I did, I began to understand that I would never again be satisfied with other flavors. It was, and still remains today, poppy or nothing. As luck would have it, poppy seed also seems to be the least popular of the flavors of hamentashen- it's criminally simple to go into almost any New York City bakery and find apricot- or prune-filled versions. Even the little corner shop 20 feet away from the door of our building sells apricot hamentashen! But to me, these aren't worth the effort it takes to chew them. We lived here for a few months- months of what seemed like endless and fruitless stops into just about every place in Midtown with a baked goods counter- before I finally found a local source for the poppy seed variety. D'Aiuto's Pastry Corp at 52nd Street and 8th Avenue is that place. The shop claims to be the home of the true New York cheesecake, and I don't doubt the claim. The store's founder apparently invented something called the Baby Watson Cheesecake, a treat that we have yet to try. What is important here, however, is that this is one place in Midtown that not only makes poppy seed hamentashen, but makes seriously good ones that rely as much on the strength of the crust as on the filling. That's not always the case, as some hamentashen are just delivery systems for a dollop of apricot jam, and will occasionally be as dense as a small star. D'Aiuto's does them right, though, and as an extra bonus, they cost only $1.50 each. Be warned, if you go late in the day, they may be sold out. I like to imagine that there are throngs of us, the devoted poppy-seeders, who flock to D'Aiuto's every day for a fix. Actually, I don't go every day- I told HungryMan that if we lived closer, I most likely would go every day, and subsequently would have to buy substantially larger belts. I call it the Hamentashen Fifteen. I do also think that, with my morning coffee in one hand and the poppy seeds tumbling down my shirtfront, it would be one of the most delicious ways to go up a few pant sizes.

I went to D'Aiuto's once but made a big no-no byu getting the chocolate mousse cheesecake. It wasn't bad, but I had no idea it had alcohol in it, making it nearly inedible for me. I'm sure anyone else would've liked it. : But poppyseed hamentashen (I don't like the other flavors nearly as much) is one of my favorite foods in the world, so I guess I'll have to try that out. Have you ever had one from Moishe's bakery on 2nd Ave? They make my favorite ones, although I'll admit I haven't tried many other places (because I'm perfectly happy with the one from Moishe's, hehe).

A Tale of Two Hemispheres: Bagels and Vegemite

Nosher
***DATE
2005-09-26 22:39:00
***CONTENT
 Certain that this combination of foods violates some international edict against cultural cross-contamination, I waited for about a week before I made this post. I figured that with enough time and distance, I might eventually get tired of my current favorite lunch and might be able to just pretend it all never happened. But I've hit upon something that is too good to ignore, something that takes a little bit of the Antipodes and a little bit of the Ashkenazi and creates a new creature, one with its own chimera of a personality. Come to think of it, isn't that what New York food is all about- the odd and unexpected? I'm thinking of the Cuban Chinese restaurants on the Upper West Side, or the Indian-Armenian restaurants in Murray Hill- it's all about synthesis. This experimentation was prompted by the jars of Marmite and Vegemite I brought back in my carry-on luggage last week. Both are yeast-based pastes that are designed to be spread on foods or added to stocks and sauces. On their own, they have a very heady, tangy, and intense flavor- one that demands a little acclimation. Vegemite is actually Marmite's Aussie/Kiwi cousin and is thicker and less liquidy than Marmite. I think its taste is a little more mild, as well, so it's perfect for a newbie. Not that I'm a newbie- I went through a period in 2001 where I'd eat Marmite spread thickly on crackers instead of doing what most people do, which is to spread it in the thinnest of films over their buttered toast. To be honest, the butter & Vegemite method does yield some excellent results, especially when the bread is still warm and has been toasted enough to allow the knife to scrape satisfyingly across the buttery surface. An Aussie friend showed us how to do this properly, and for that, I'm still in her great debt to this day. But somehow, I don't think she, or anyone in the Commonwealth ever really imagined Vegemite spread over the cut surface of a hot H&H bagel. Not that it matters even a little bit, because the bagel that is produced is divine enough to trump any looks of shock or cries of, \"That's immoral!\" All you'll need to make this delicious treat of questionable culinary morality is a fresh bagel- easy enough to find in NYC- and good salted butter (we like the Horizon Organic butter). Toast the bagel to your desired darkness and then spread it with the butter. You can be as liberal with the stuff as you like, but I'd recommend that you make sure that all of the bagel's surface gets covered with a little butter- it'll pay off later. Then, take a very small amount of Vegemite- I used a blob about the size of a small marble and spread it thinly, in a gossamer layer across the surface of the buttered bagel. OK, I'll be truthful: I used more Vegemite than that, but if this is your first time, you'll want to lose your Vegemite virginity with less, rather than more of the spread. Trust me. Vegemite and Marmite are both available pretty widely throughout the city. They do cost a little more than they do in the UK, but they're still not expensive, and a jar will last weeks or months, so consider the price a long-ish term investment. Fairway has a 4 oz. jar of Vegemite for $3.89, and Amish Market has both Vegemite and Marmite for a little bit more (around $5.00 a jar). I am also a little tempted to tout the fact that Vegemite is kosher, but if you're the kind of person who mixes bagels and Marmite, you probably don't take too kindly to religious restrictions on food-pairing. Still, I wonder if there's a bracha for Vegemite... .

Marmite is pretty easy to find-Fairway sells it, as do Garden of Eden and Amish Markets. Vegemite, on the other hand, has just been restricted in the US because of added B-vitamins in the spread. Let us know if you see Vegemite!

 The idea behind the 23/5 project is that you go to your 23rd post, locate your 5th sentence, and then post it and discuss. Well, here's ours: Yes, it's a mouthful just saying the name. The context here is that the post in question described the sandwiches at a restaurant called Viet Nam Banh Mi So 1, and the long name prompted the mouthful comment. Now that I read that little snippet, so rudely removed from its normal context, it makes me think that it would make a great tagline for a product. Perhaps a big sandwich or a lollipop, but something with a very long name to be sure.

French Doors onto 10th Avenue: Studio Coffee

***CONTENT
 Coffee shops that are not named Starbucks do not open up very often in this city. When they do, you can almost hear the faraway scribbling in Seattle coming from the desks of the people who pay attention to demographics and urban micro-markets. They're asking: do we belong on that block? And more importantly: can we steal away the customers from that shop? The moral of the modern java story seems to be that if you are brave enough to open up a coffee shop in a city like this (or London, or Washington), you had better do an excellent job of it if you want to be in business for long. That's the basis for the question I ask myself when I go into a New York coffee shop: is this place good enough to keep The Mermaid (Starbucks, of course) at bay? When I first walked up 10th Avenue and saw Studio Coffee House, with its multiple wide french doors opening out onto the sidewalk, I thought I might have found a contender. The space inside is airy, and when the doors are open, the place feels expansive and fresh. But as I discovered yesterday on a trial-run with Lady Film Critic, the decor and design are the best parts. The rest is lackluster and disappointing. You'll probably notice that I use the iced latte as a benchmark for coffee houses; it's a standard drink that pretty much every place serves, but it requires enough skill that in inexpert hands, it is often done poorly. This was one of those times. The coffee tasted scorched- so acrid, in fact, that no amount of sweetening seemed to help. The muffin wasn't much better. The owner informed us (after making us wait for several minutes while he yapped on the phone) that he had just changed muffin suppliers. But that only makes me wonder how dire the muffins must have been before, since the banana streusel specimen we were served was oily and too salty. Just when Lady Film Critic and I were settled in and comfortable at the front of the shop where peaceful inside meets gritty outside, we were hit by a bracingly loud dose of Bob Seger. It was enough to drive away a young couple who sat nearby, and eventually, us too. As much as I want to like a coffee house that embraces this neighborhood and brings it literally inside its french doors, I also recognize that Studio Coffee House needs to try much harder and get better at the basics before it can hold out any hope of surviving once the inevitable Starbucks appears down the street. The clock is ticking, and the Bob Seger isn't helping. Studio Coffee House, 812 10th Avenue (at 54th Street), 212-246-6067

I work right across the street from this place, and agree with your review. Furthermore, in the year and a half since, the place has acquired the distinct air of imminent failure. The once-ambitious pastry counter now has a paltry selection of tired-looking muffins, I find the coffees and lattes uniformly awful, and the management bounces between indifferent and rude. This guy has no business being in a service industry. The Dunkin' Donuts across the street kicks its ass in everything save for decor. If it's before 4 pm, you can get excellent coffee, sandwiches and salads at the tiny but friendly Cafe Ole, just around the corner at 453 W 54.

The Liberdade Cocktail

***CONTENT
 Inspired by a friend of ours who claims that Portugal should be famous for nothing more than explorers and beverages, we decided to taste several of the local specialty drinks and happened to grab a bottle of something that looked suspiciously like amaretto. Amendoa Amarga, it turns out, is made from bitter almonds- not the sweet ones you can purchase in the supermarket. You may already know that bitter almonds have to be treated before they can be turned into food items because they are cyanogenic; essentially, they produce cyanide gas when they are eaten, if they're not prepared correctly. While bitter almonds aren't the sort of food I'd want to experiment with in my own kitchen, the Portugese are famous for this liqueur, so HungryMan and I were both willing to suspend suspicion and buy a bottle. The first thing we noticed is that this brand is very low in alcohol, coming in at a scant 17%. That puts amendoa amarga on par with fortified wine, and substantially much weaker than amaretto. We tasted a bit of it unmixed and found it to be syrupy sweet with a very intense almond flavor and a little bit of a surprisingly tangy undertone- it was very much like an almond-flavored dessert wine. It wasn't really good enough to drink on its own, so we set about finding something appropriate to mix with it. This was not an easy task- the mixer needed to be something slightly acidic, but with enough of a flavor of its own to stand up to and complement the amendoa amarga. We decided on something we had seen in every supermarket and corner food shop we'd visited in Portugal: strawberry juice. As strange as it sounds, once you taste it, you'll wonder why the big juice manufacturers in North America and the UK haven't started selling this stuff- it makes perfect sense and, unlike something like Clamato, tastes pretty wonderful by itself. Mixed with a satisfying portion of amendoa amarga, vodka, and poured over ice, it's even better. We sat drinking this concoction while watching the US Open Men's Final in our hotel room very late one evening and decided that replicating the experience would be worth some effort, once we arrived back in New York. So after several tweaks, we think we've done it. Of course, it's almost impossible to find amendoa amarga here, so we've used its cousin amaretto. We also had a little bit of a panic about the strawberry juice, thinking it might be hard to find in New York, but were we wrong. Almost all Mexican groceries carry it, and the one just a few doors down from our apartment even sells it chilled. I'm not convinced that 'Boing!' should really be a brand name for anything that is not made of rubber, but the juice is precisely the same as what we bought in Portugal. We were even able to reverse engineer the original drink's sourness with some lime juice. The final result tastes a bit like a margarita, but with a very distinct nuttiness. Normally, we'd offer alternate suggestions for the vodka, but in this drink, anything with a more identifiable taste will just compete with (and probably swamp out) the taste of the amaretto. So use good-quality vodka if you can. And if you're wondering about the name, it comes from the Avenida da Liberdade, the wide boulevard that pitches its way north through the hilly city- something like Lisbon's own Champs Elysées, but with more trees and fewer Gap stores. Liberdade, indeed. The Liberdade 1 full measure (1.5 Tbsp.) amaretto 1 full measure (1.5 Tbsp.) vodka juice of 1/2 lime 5-6 oz. strawberry juice Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Squeeze out the lime juice over the ice, and add the amaretto, vodka, and strawberry juice. Shake and strain and serve over ice in tumblers or low-ball glasses.

Secret Dim Sum Hideout: 88 Palace

2005-09-19 23:19:00
***CONTENT
 Very few restaurants in New York City have the distinction of being so easy to find that they don't even need a street address. These are the restaurants that you can locate just by wandering towards them, following the skyline. But all of that being said, you have to know what you're looking for when you do this- not every big building or monument in this city contains a restaurant, and not all that do contain one that's worth visiting. But deep in the heavy concrete anchoring structure of the Manhattan Bridge sits one that is. 88 Palace (formerly 888 Palace, supposedly to make the name match the superfluous address) is on the top floor of the East Broadway Mall, nestled into an urban space that looks from one entrance like a train station, and on the other like a service entrance to an office building. You'd really never know there was dim sum inside if you didn't go in and wander up the escalator, past the barrels of ginseng, past the phone card vendors, and past the kiosks selling 'Hello Kittly' bootleg knapsacks. As unlikely a location for a secret restaurant as this is, it somehow all seems contextually appropriate, as if the faux crystal chandelier and gold-mirrored paneling belong here, surrounded by the pilings of one of the city's busiest bridges. The ladies pushing the steam-trollies at the top of the stairwell were a welcome sight- far too many Chinese restaurants have moved away from the traditional dim sum cart to the a la carte. It's so much less fun to order dim sum off of a menu than to point and gesture to get what you want (or in the case of the surprise order of chicken feet that almost always finds its way to the table- what you didn't want). Once we sat down, the barrage began with no grace period for us to get our bearings; this was dim sum for the initiated, and fortunately, both HungryMan and our guest TVGal were well-schooled and ready to go. So go we did, first choosing the shrimp and scallop shumai, the shrimp chow fun, and a healthy-looking plate of sauteed spinach with garlic and ginger. We slurped down the very soft chow fun noodles almost the instant they hit the table, and then went to work on the spinach, which was probably my favorite thing in this, the first act of the meal. TVGal liked the shumai the best, commenting that the sauce seemed mellower than the normal hot chili dipping sauce. I think it had been cut with sesame oil, but whatever it was, it was very good. Act two began with the unexpected appearance of the chicken feet, but once we clarified that we hadn't ordered them, we quickly managed to procure my very favorite dim sum dish: turnip cake. 88 Palace does a very straightforward version of this, and in my book, that's an excellent thing. I've had versions of this dish that try too hard, but this turnip cake was exactly as it should have been- flecked with pork (which is easy for vegetarians to pick out, if they like), dense with the turnip purée, and crispy in places on the outside from being pan-fried briefly. We also grabbed some spinach and chicken gyoza-style dumplings, which TVGal proclaimed to be her favorite of the meal, and then snagged another green plate- this time of watercress and garlic, which was peppery and dotted with chili flakes. Outstanding and unusual. It was at this point, during the intermission of the meal, when TVGal came out of the closet as a fried rice fanatic, followed quickly by HungryMan's admission of a similar preference. So we did the only thing we could, and picked up a plate of the stuff. We also decided that we couldn't take much more food, so we chose one more item- the red bean bao zi steamed buns- to finish the meal. These were cooled to room temperature and were just a little bit chewy on the outside- precisely the way I like them. All in all, this was one of our better dim sum experiences in New York. Perhaps it was made even a little more special by being hidden inside a fallout shelter's worth of concrete, but no matter. What we do know is that we'll be back, and that even more importantly, we'll never have to do a Google search for the restaurant's address, just as long as we point ourselves in the direction of the bridge and start walking. 88 Palace, 88 East Broadway (under the Manhattan Bridge in the East Broadway Mall), 212-941-8886

oh, I love your blog, but I have to say -- as a vegetarian, I would never in a thousand years eat something that had previously held pork!

Josie, thank you! I hear what you're saying about the pork-it's a personal choice, and I respect that. We tell strict vegetarian friends of ours to beware when they go out for dim sum because just about everything contains \"implied pork.\" It's tough. But there are a few good vegetarian dim sum places in the city.

Ruthie, It's about 3 blocks from the F stop on East Broadway. Just leave the station and walk southwest down E. Broadway (towards the nearby bridge structure).

 Into every traveler's life, a little good cheese should fall. And so it was with us on our recently-finished visit to Lisbon, Portugal. Actually, if I'm being completely honest, I should admit that a lot of good cheese fell into our lives- probably much more than our share for the year. Portugese restaurants serve bread and cheese (and occasionally olives, ham, sardine spread, etc.) at the beginning of every meal, without anyone ever really asking for it. Diners still pay for it, of course (and sometimes more than they should), but this tradition of including 'coperto' (the cover) in the bill automatically isn't a bad one. You can always opt not to eat the bread and cheese, if you prefer; and in that event, it will not appear on the bill. But knowing our love of dairy products, I think you might suspect correctly that we didn't neglect the coperto. But there was a purpose behind all of this pre-dinner noshing: we wanted to see if, as we had heard rumored, the Portugese cheese scene is indeed the next big thing in the world of curds. So we tasted our way through the 'queijo seco', a cheese that looks like a little round of muenster, but which is actually a sheep's milk cheese that tastes like a cousin to Italy's Canestrano cheese. We also sampled a few softer cheeses, including one that looked promisingly like a very creamy and fresh ricotta, but which had absolutely no taste at all. We called this one 'queijo falso'. Avoid any water-packed cheese in Portugal. Then of course, came our favorite- a regional specialty called 'queijo de azeitao'. This is a palm-sized, chubby wheel of sheep's milk cheese, coagulated with crushed cardoons instead of the more common rennet, and covered with a waxy natural rind that can get a little moldy. Inside is a semi-firm, very white center that hits you with the double blow of tanginess and very fresh cream. It's unlike anything we've ever tasted. We stocked up at the supermarket and ate slices of it on thick slabs of bread from a bakery in the Baixa, often topping it with a nice disc of kiwi. One night, we even stayed indoors with the balcony doors open and ate this in the hotel instead of going in search of a restaurant. We had both assumed that once we left Portugal, we wouldn't be able to get our hands on more of the queijo de azeitao, mostly because it is such a local product- it even has its own D.O.C. designation, much as some Italian wines do. It turns out that we were wrong. There is an online source for this gorgeous little cheese at iGourmet (scroll to the bottom of the page for the quiejo de azeitao). We suspect that Fairway's Steve Jenkins might also be clued into the merits of this cheese, so we promise to update if we find it at the cheese counter there, or for that matter, anywhere else in NYC. In the meantime, we'll be waiting for our UPS deliveries and clearing some room in the fridge.

Friends brought us some from Portugal on a visit and we fell in love with it and they are sending us more but we simply cannot find it here in the US, DRAT. I tried Murray's in New York and they don't carry it. There is no one in Pittsburgh (where I live) that carries it BUT BUT BUT, I have been in contact with the largest food market chain here (GIANT EAGLE) my description has tickled their interest and now that I have read them your comments, they are doubly anxious to find the stuff. But they can't find it either.I told them about iGOurmet and they are pursuing that. BUt, can you help us find a locl (U.S.) distributor of importer

Brooklyn's Best-Kept Secret: Rosewater

 Ethan Kostbar isn't someone you may have heard much about yet, but if there is any justice in the universe, you will soon. Considering the deftness and creativity of his tasting menu, he is someone who deserves some serious attention, regardless of the fact that his restaurant isn't in Manhattan. In fact, the fact that it sits on a sleepy stretch of Union Street in Park Slope adds a considerable charm to a visit there. Not that it needed much more charm, that is- this is a place that, without the usual media plaudits (yet), seems not only secure in its excellence, but is willing to take risks with its menu, risks that command respect through their success. HungryMan and I aren't the type of eaters who always order the tasting menu- we do on occasion, but we also like the freedom of ordering a la carte, and our philosophy is that if a chef is worth his/her salt, all the dishes on the menu should be at least competently done. However, when we stopped in to Rosewater recently, we were feeling in a mood to let someone else make the decisions, so we gave the very reasonably-priced tasting menu ($48) a shot. Easily, this is one of the best dining decisions we've made since coming to New York, as Kostbar did not disappoint. He accommodated a few special requests and made certain that we had a chance to try an item we were both itching to taste. The tasting menu included five courses and was very expertly explained to us by the wait staff, all of whom seem to be passionate about the food and eager to share their enthusiasm. The first two images you see are our first course. Yes, you read that right: we were served slightly different items, even though we both ordered the tasting menu. Again, this is pretty unusual, but we were grateful for it and the chance to sample a few extra items. Kostbar also seems to relish the opportunity to cook on the fly with the ingredients he has on hand, as very few of the dishes we were served appeared on the a la carte menu. We were told that he would, \"just make something really gorgeous for you both tonight.\" That he did. The nectarine and goat cheese salad with celery greens, dill, and tomatoes made me want to rush home and try to replicate it. If I manage to do so, I'll serve this at every dinner party I hold- it was that fantastic. Light and complex, it just felt like a perfect thing to eat while sitting on the patio after a rainstorm, as we were. HungryMan was served a tiny cool tomato soup with hen-of-the-woods mushrooms and hyssop, which offered light anise overtones and a very subtle earthiness that gave the soup a nice balance for a dinner prelude. We then had another split course, where I received a small salad made from sunflower sprouts, currants, balsamic vinegar, shallots, and a creamy dressing surrounding the pile of greens. It was just outstanding: a hint of sweetness and a very vague taste-connection to something grainy, seed-like, and hearty. HungryMan's fettucine looked like it might have been a standard version of that dish, but with one taste, we realized it was nothing of the sort. The pasta was topped with bok choi, fresh tomatoes, strips of zucchini, and underneath the melting cheese, strawberry beans. I believe that the freshness of the ingredients alone is what made this course work so well. I also imagine that in less assured hands, a dish like this might have relied on the garlic to keep it aloft, but here, it played only a supporting role to the sharp, slight bitterness of the bok choi and the crunch of the beans. Both of us were served the river trout filet over cous cous, topped with a very subtly sweet sauce that tasted of soy and balsamic vinegar, pepper and wine. It was very simple and so good that we both ate ours too quickly to take good notes- this photo is the only evidence that it even existed. This was the first course that really showed the Middle Eastern influences at Rosewater. It would be too much of a stretch to call it a Middle Eastern restaurant; it is not. But it does take inspiration from the region, and on occasion, it seems apparent. Other times, there is just a very quiet Levantine melody playing throughout the meal's flavors. Fish seems to be a real strength at Rosewater, as our next course showed. This is a dish I would love to see featured on the menu, because I have been thinking about it ever since: seared tuna with fried chickpeas. The chickpeas had a bit of kick to them from the cayenne coating, and that little slice of beet you see gave enough sweetness to temper it. All the accompaniments here, the cucumber, zucchini strips, and the herbs altered the tuna, which can sometimes be a rather heavy fish, changing it into something absolutely buoyant. Then came the cheeses. The three artisanal cheeses offered a range of runny to firm, and while the rind-y tasting Spanish cheese (the very gooey suspect in the upper right) was my least favorite part of the meal, the other cheeses more than made up for it, especially the Roaring 40s Blue (hiding at the very top center of the image), which was the perfect complement to the berry conserve and the toasted raisin bread. Remember that dish we said we wanted to try, the one the chef made sure was among our options? That was the shiro plum tart. HungryMan really adored it, especially because he said the crust reminded him of more of cinnamon roll dough than traditional pate brise. The berries and the hint of ginger were also tone perfect in this dessert. My choice was a little less successful, but I have to give Kostbar plenty of credit for trying something new and adventurous. You can see that this chocolate cake with strawberry olive salad and vanilla-black pepper ice cream was a seductively beautiful dessert. I'd put a centerfold of that up in my metal shop any day. And honestly, if I had eaten only the cake and ice cream, I would have waved my little white flag in surrender. But the olive and strawberry salad didn't really live up to the rest of the dish or the meal. Now, you know I'm a huge advocate of strawberry creativity, so I readily acknowledge that the idea for this salad was a good one, but it just tasted flat and a bit too salty for this dish, most especially when combined with the chocolate cake. I ended up eating the cake separately and stole a few of the strawberries here and there. All of that said, I should point out that I ate every crumb of the cake and all of the ice cream (and a little of HungryMan's when he was in the bathroom). Oh, and about the bathroom: there are bottles of rosewater in there to remind you of the restaurant's Mediterranean/Middle Eastern roots. I found myself looking at the bottles and thinking that like rosewater itself, the theme in both the design and the food is subtly done. Perhaps the tiny dining room is part of what allows Rosewater to take such great care with the food and service. This also means that if you want to witness the real skill on display here, you will probably need to plan ahead a bit, as the dozen or so tables fill up fast- and rightfully so. Rosewater, 787 Union Street (at Sixth Avenue), Brooklyn NY, 718-783-3800

No Milk, Please. He's British.

 In honor of our recent trip to the UK, I thought I would recommend another great book that is already gaining significant popularity in the US- one that provides a window into England's food culture. Toast - The Story of a Boy's Hunger is the coming of age story of Nigel Slater, the British food writer and long-time columnist for London's Guardian and Observer. Despite its vaguely sketchy-sounding subtitle, is a fantastic read. Slater grew up in Wolverhampton in the early '60s, a middle-class kid in a middle-class Midlands suburb, and recounts the typical problems boys run into growing up, as well as some that were not-so-typical, like his crushes on the other boys and an unnatural dislike of milk. The first half of this book has a slow, almost melancholy atmosphere, made more likable by the short chapters each titled with a different food: \"milk,\" \"walnut whip,\" \"sherbet fountains.\" In fact, most of the book is a veritable memory lane for anyone who grew up in post-war Britain or who has been exposed to it: its pages are filled with fairy cakes, Jammy Dodgers, ice cream cornets, banana lollies, and arctic rolls- this last being a sort of sponge-covered tube of vanilla ice cream covering a thin ring of red jam. Slater tells some wonderful stories, including a hilarious set-piece about the time his father brought home spaghetti for the first time - no one in his family having tried it before. But most of all, the book is a richly-written love poem about a boy's adoration of food. Here's a sample of what I'm talking about: ...he cut each of us a slice of black-currant pie, sliding the thin slices onto glass Pyrex plates. This is the pie I think about all week. The pie I lie in bed and dream about before I go to sleep. The fruit is sharp and sweet, pastry pale and crumbly, like it's only just about cooked. It has no decorations save a small hole, like a navel, in the middle. Sometimes it isn't even quite in the centre. I don't understand this. Why would you put it off-centre? I eat my pie slowly, pushing my fork down through the sugar crust, into the purple-blue fruit below. Someone thumps the huge knocker on the door twice. I can hear Worrel, my best friend: \"Can Nig come out to play?\" My father pokes his head round the door - \"Well, can he?\" \"Nigel can't come out right now. He isn't feeling well,\" I say, biting my lip. My father smiles and disappears. Play with my best friend or have a second piece of pie? No contest. But Toast is also about food and English society in a broader sense. Here's Slater on his mother's dinner parties: Our place in society seemed not to depend on whether we had a double garage - we had - or which golf club my father belonged to - he didn't. It was more a question of whether you had Huntley & Palmer's cheese footballs or not. For those who know Slater and his prodigious, always excellent food writing, this memoir will be a treat. For those for whom he is new, think of this as just a thorough introduction. Even if you don't read Slater's book, head to the Guardian's website to read some of what's on his mind, and much more importantly, what's on his plate.

Ooh, I loved that book! I think I bought it mainly because of the title (mmm...toast, so appealing, not sketchy!). It was sadder than I thought it would be, but it's nice to read something unexpected apart from other personal food-related books.

Ha! The toast part isn't the sketchy part. I remember listening to \"The Splendid Table\" on my headphones at the gym when I heard the title of his book and I almost fell off the treadmill. It was pretty sad in parts though, wasn't it? I agree with you too about how nice it is to read something surprising in a food-related memoir.

 Wow. After a flood of e-mails and literally a couple dozen questions about the last post, I knew I had to write a quick follow-up. Who knew jam-making could prompt so many questions? I promised to share the important answers here, so without further ado: (1) Yes, this recipe works well with just about any fruit, with the exception of mango, papaya, and pineapple, which all contain high levels of papain, a molecule that breaks down both pectin and gelatin. If you use those fruits, your jam may turn out soupy. That said, you can use just about anything else. We made jam with HungryMan's 7 year-old neice and just let her choose the fruit, which resulted in a tutti-frutti mixture of apple, peach, raspberry, strawberry, and grape, all mixed up and boiled together. Much to everyone's surprise, it not only set, but was fantastic. I've included two pictures of two more versions of the jam here. The first is a wild blackberry and Chambord version, and the second is an apricot, greengage plum, Cointreau, and basil version. Both got eaten within about a week. I think that I might have even licked the inside of the empty blackberry jam container in a very dark moment last September... . (2) Use pretty much any container you like to keep the jam. We have used jars, Ziploc storage containers, vintage Pyrex refrigerator dishes, and a few months back we collected a surfeit of strawberry jam in drinking glasses and sealed them with plastic wrap and rubber bands. It worked just fine. One caveat is that the container must be able to withstand a little bit of heat at the beginning of the process, since the jam is very hot when it is transferred to the container from the pot. (3) What happens if the jam doesn't set? Well, let it cool to room temperature, slowly, and it probably will, but if it doesn't? Eat it anyway. It will still be delicious. Just use denser bread or pour it over pancakes and call it fruit syrup. Nobody will know the difference.

Peaches Are the New Black

***CONTENT
 Summer’s last domestic peaches and apricots are making their final bow before they disappear for another year, only to be replaced by their much less delicious understudies: the South American stone fruits. This isn’t to say that a peach from Venezuela can’t taste good, it’s just that so many of them are picked when they’re only semi-ripe and then shipped and doled out to groceries over the course of several weeks. So get the Georgia ones while you can. We grabbed nearly 10 pounds of them for $1.00 per pound from the Farmer’s Market on 9th Avenue just south of 42nd Street this past week. I’m sure we looked hilarious carrying bags and bags of fruit out of there as if it were going out of style, but it very nearly is. With ten pounds of fruit, you can do a lot, but making jam has to be among your priorities. It’s quick, easy, and if you decide to go the refrigerated jam route, perfectly safe. We prefer not having to boil jars or heat them in the oven and panic over making our friends ill with tainted preserves, so we stick to the refrigerated variety. One thing we’d like to see make its way across the Atlantic from the UK to the US is jam sugar. It’s exactly what you might expect: granulated sugar with pectin pre-measured and added to it so that all that’s required to make a perfect batch of jam is a few pounds of fruit. It’s also perfect for making micro-batches of just a cup or two, since everything is measured and ready to go. It’s a brilliant idea, but I worry that in North America, we don’t tend to make enough jam to allow the sugar companies to turn a profit on such a niche product. Then again, perhaps we’d make more jam if the process were made simpler with jam sugar. Even without jam sugar, making preserves is really simple. It just requires a big pot, pectin, fruit, water, and sugar (and other flavorings, if you want to use them). It’s very important to make sure that jam is boiled for at least 2 or 3 minutes in order to force the pectin to react with the acids in the fruit. Some recipes insist that you get the jam up to a temperature of 220F (104C) or so, and while this probably won’t hurt your jam, it isn’t necessary—that direction is a vestige of the non-pectin days of jam making. Here’s our very favorite recipe for stone fruit jam- it involves a very healthy dose of basil, something we used to borrow from our neighbors next-door when we were living in Oxford. These particular neighbors raised two things: herbs and racing pigeons. Our backyard was always filled with stray feathers, but this was more than compensated by the armfuls of free rosemary, basil, mint, and lovage we received. The basil in this jam brings out all of the aromatic flavors in the peaches and gives the jam a gorgeous complexity. You won't be able to taste the basil, but it makes all the difference. This recipe works equally well with peaches and apricots (or plums) and can be expanded to accommodate as much fruit as you can cram into your pot. Enjoy! Oxford Peach Jam 4 pounds peaches or apricots, pitted 2-3 pounds granulated sugar* 2 T. almond extract 1 t. salt 1 cup unoaked white wine 8-14 medium basil leaves 1 packet pectin* *If you have access to jam sugar, omit the pectin. Chop peaches into rough 1/2 inch cubes and place into a pot with the sugar. Let sit together while you prepare the other ingredients. Cut the basil leaves into chiffonade strips by rolling the leaves into a cigar shape and then cutting into discs. Add basil, salt, and almond extract to the pot. Begin to heat the pot slowly over medium-low heat, slowly increasing heat until the peaches begin to break down and release their juices. Add the wine and continue to heat until the mixture begins to boil. Add pectin and continue to cook, watching to make sure that the mixture achieves a vigorous boil for a couple of minutes. Cooking longer will not hurt the jam, as long as the temperature does not go too high- use a candy thermometer to keep this from happening. When the fruit is soft and the jam has boiled, ladle it out into jars or other containers and cover. You really must cover it, even though it will end up in the fridge, because the pectin won't set properly unless the jam is allowed to cool down slowly, at room temperature. Once the jam is completely cooled (several hours later), move the containers to the fridge and enjoy over the next few weeks or a month, if you're lucky. 2005 nycnosh.com

Bread and Chocolate's Smoked Fish Legacy

***CONTENT
 Years ago, when Nosher and I lived in Washington, DC, there was this local chain of breakfast restaurants that we would sometimes go to called Bread and Chocolate. We went not because it was such a great deal or because it had extraordinary food generally, but on the strength of one salad that they made really well. It was a simple salad of smoked trout, baby spinach, sliced mushrooms, and a very lemony vinaigrette, and it was a dish we could never pass up, even though the menu was loaded with pastries, pancakes and other breakfast goodies. While we can no longer just wander down the road to get it, we've since made the salad ourselves with various other smoked fish: salmon, smoked whitefish, peppered smoked trout, etc. The Amish Market near us sells a wonderful smoked sable that we've also used that works well balanced against the citrusy dressing. And even though this picture shows romaine lettuce, I prefer baby spinach or a more peppery leaf. We use 6 oz. of fish for 2 people. The Borrowed Smoked Fish Salad 1 package of fresh baby spinach, or other greens (about 4 cups) 6-8 oz. cherry tomatoes 1/4 to 1/2 cup pecans or walnuts 1 - 1 1/2 cups mushrooms (roughly chopped or sliced) 1 orange or pomelo (tangerines and grapefruit work well too), cut into slices (membrane and seeds removed) 6 oz. smoked fish Dressing: Juice of one lemon or orange 1 tsp. mustard 2 Tbsp. wine vinegar or mirin 1 tsp. honey or jam several tablespoons of olive oil (use whatever you need to bring the dressing to a consistency you like) Whisk together dressing ingredients in a large bowl. More oil will produce a looser dressing, so just keep tasting as you go. Reserve a tablespoon or so of the dressing, if you like. Put lettuce into the bowl, then add tomatoes and mushrooms. Mix lettuce to dress the greens- even use your hands if you like. Add orange slices and fish, and drizzle a very small amount of dressing over the top of the fish and orange slices. 2005 nycnosh.com

More Virtuous Fast Food?

***CONTENT
 Nosher and I have been to Better Burger several times over the last year, and it's always been a great local place to drop in for a quick bite. Better Burger bills itself as somehow more virtuous that the average burger joint. Much of the meat and poultry is organic and fewer preservatives are used, making a trip here just slightly less guilt-inducing that a trip to McDonalds. Better Burger is also much more veggie-friendly than the average fast-food joint: there is a better-than average tuna burger (pictured), a veggie burger and a soy burger, all in addition to burgers without red meat, like chicken, turkey and even ostrich (\"looks & tastes like beef, yet has 75% less fat than a traditional beef burger...\"). I've enjoyed a hamburger there in the past, and Nosher seemed to like his tuna burger, even if all the condiments it came with (I do tend to like these things with 'the works') overwhelmed the bun. Salads are passable, though I would steer clear of the sides; the potatoes and the cole slaw had far too much fat and sugar for my taste. For all this, you do pay for the improved quality, as evidenced by the average bill for two, which seems to usually top $20 or $25. For some, a price this high for what is, after all, still a couple of burgers, may seem unconscionable. But this is not a multi-thousand outlet chain and the food you're getting does appear to be fresher and more interesting -- the ambitious (if not successful) addition of hijiki seaweed to the Caesar salad dressing proves that. And service - at the counter - is reasonably competent. A server will usually carry out your order to your table on a tray. Best of all, there are now four locations in Manhattan: UES, Murray Hill, Chelsea, and Hell's Kitchen. Overall, a good bet when you're in a rush but don't want a heart attack on a plate.

Hey, good to know. I always see the bright orange signs for better burger but never bit the bullet and tried one. What's your favorite spot in the city for a burger?

A Penguin on a Cracker

 Animal crackers are the perfect synthesis of food and plaything; they're minimally messy, easy to carry, and very simple to dispose of when a game of Zoo or Noah's Ark finishes. I spent hours as a child searching for a tiger cookie in every box and then telling long epic stories about the animals, just as I bit their heads and legs off. It was like Boxing Helena, but with more vanilla. The new trend in beast-themed cookies is the printed cookie. Imagine taking the general shape of the animals from the old Nabisco cookies, blurring them into blobs, and then stamping pictures onto those. It's so much simpler these days to identify what you're eating, but perhaps a little less fun. I bought a box of these Meiji Zoo Land cookies at the huge Samurai shop on 8th Avenue and 38th Street and sat down to see how they compared to the old Nabisco version. In terms of sheer variety, they've won the battle already. The box I opened had 25 different animals represented (8 were missing). In true retro-juvenile fashion, I wanted the Cock cracker most of all. But alas, it's not there. I wonder if they don't dole these out sparingly, mainly in places where they'll be exporting to non-English speaking locales. Nevertheless, there is a substantial array of animals and birds in this box, including vultures, hedgehogs, and pigeons. As for the taste, I should admit that these are not American cookies, so they're nowhere near as sweet. These actually taste a lot like a low-sodium version of the Ritz cracker- they're flaky and crisp, and would probably go really well with cheese. At $1.29 a box, they might have to make an appearance next to a slab of morbiere at a future dinner party. They're fun, cheap, and potentially just a little titillating to the person who looks down to see that there's a snack tattooed with a racy little epithet on his or her plate. Pass the badger, please.

1/1000: Brunch at Shopsin's

***CONTENT
 Love letters come in many forms: some are perfume-scented missives written to a paramour, some are filial expressions of loyalty, and some- just a few- are restaurant reviews. Calvin Trillin's New Yorker article on Shopsin's restaurant is one of these, and is still, to this day, one of my all-time favorite pieces of food journalism. It was a risky article, too. Apparently Kenny Shopsin, the pater familias and big dog of the restaurant got so furious with Trillin that he refused to speak with him for months after the article was published, despite an apparent exponential increase in business and an expedited move for the restaurant from its long-time digs to its new home on Bedford and Carmine Streets. The anger is suprising if you're thinking only of the potential dollar signs produced by a fond write-up in the New Yorker, but not at all a shock if you know anything about Kenny Shopsin. He's known for being a bit of a grump (or a lot of a grump) who does everything his own way; but if that's all you see, you've missed the important stuff. His restaurant is his home, and vice versa. He's the cook, the waiters and busboys are his kids, and he cooks for people because he enjoys doing it- on his terms- and is talented at what he does. I know this because Shopsin's is one of the places I've been visiting on trips to New York since 1987. I found it by accident as a teenager while wandering down Hudson Avenue one Saturday morning, having been abandoned by my two friends who were more interested in buying leather jackets than eating breakfast. I went in because there were toys on all of the tables- tin toys, puzzles, Boggle, Rubik's Cubes- and I thought that was peculiar, but a fantasic idea. Then of course, I saw the menu. People talk about the breadth of the menu at Shopsin's, but you really just need to see it to believe it. There are close to 1,000 items to order, and in the 18 years I've been going, it has grown and grown. It's like a culinary version of Katamari Damacy, absorbing anything it comes into contact with: a new dish requested by a toddler? It's there. Dishes inspired by American history? They're there. Dishes that involve lewd word-play about prostitutes? Yep. You've got it. But the amazing thing about all of this is that they are all- every one of them- made with skill. I have never had a bad meal at Shopsin's. Even when I've gambled on unusual dishes such as African Green Curry Soup, I've been pleasantly surprised. Kenny Shopsin is nothing if not sure of what he does. We took Space Cadet out to Shopsin's recently and, following the simple rules of the house: no cell phone use, everyone must order at least one meal, and no parties of more than four people, we had yet another great brunch. I'm sad to see that there don't seem to be any more dinners served here- the restaurant closes at 4:00 (at the latest) on the weekend and 3:00 on Tuesday-Friday-but it's a lifestyle choice that makes sense for a family that wants to enjoy their evenings. I would probably do the same thing, if I were a Shopsin. Although the ordinance against ordering the same thing as someone else has mostly gone away, you'll do better to order something unique. And honestly, how hard can it be, with several hundred choices? That said, you should feel free to order the same thing on repeat visits- we always do. Case in point: the jalapeno cheese grits. These could win over the most sclerotic grits hater with their gooey golden topping and potent jalapeno slices. They're a perfect blend of heat from the peppers and soothing creaminess from the grits. HungryMan ordered the Brunch Combination M ($18.95), which was a toasted english muffin with tomatoes, ham, green onions, and poached eggs on top. As if that weren't enough, there were also cinnamon currant pancakes on the platter that were served with their ideal mate: pumpkin butter. Imagine a disassembled Denver Omelet and you're getting close to the inspiration for this dish. Poached eggs (cooked just right) really make all the difference here. Cousin Space Cadet ordered the Bruce Name Plate ($8.95), which was a flat (not fluffy) omelet, filled with Jersey bacon and a cheese that we suspect was jack cheese. You can also see from the picture that she's like me and loves her salt. I think I exercise so religiously not to burn up calories, but to keep my body capable of feeding my salt craving. Maybe I'm actually part deer... . At any rate, Space Cadet thought this omelet was superb and even remarked that she loved the brazen use of the Shoney's plate. So do I. I also ordered a Name Plate, the Whitley (also $8.95), on a whim. The combination of chipotle peppers and seared eggs piqued my curiosity, and if I have learned anything at Shopsin's, it's that this is the place to indulge an urge to try new things. The Whitley was served with corn tortillas, which normally I do not like very much, but I needed them to counterbalance the heat from the whole preserved chipotles that were folded into the eggs. Hot? Yes. But it was sweet and smoky at the same time, and the fact that the eggs were loose (from being only seared and not cooked through) also helped to cut the fire of the chipotles. If you do choose a spicy dish, you should know that there are milkshakes here, at the ready, should you need one. HungryMan is working his way through the shake selection and has reached Maple Walnut, which he declared to be a huge success, and even went well with the grits. I never would have thought of that. But that's really what Shopsin's is about, at its heart: eating things you never could have thought of yourself and finding that amazingly, they succeed, even when they sound strange. There are tame items on the menu- lots of them- but go out on a limb at least a little. Maybe try the Slutty Cakes if you want a little thrill when you order, but whatever you do, don't tell Kenny I sent you. Shopsin's, 54 Carmine Street, NY http://www.shopsins.com

Soirée at Market Café

***CONTENT
 It's no secret that we eat in Hell's Kitchen quite a bit. After all, this is our neighborhood, and if you can't find a few good, reliable options on your home turf, it's probably time to think about moving. We couldn't have known, when moving from England, that The HK is the place to be, both for eating and for general urban excitement. To be honest, we really just lucked into it, finding the apartment we loved and then putting the neighborhood second to that. But it worked out beautifully, especially because we have so many excellent restaurants within ten blocks of our building. On one adventure in October of last year, we ventured south on 9th Avenue to the place where Midtown West/Clinton/Hell's Kitchen elides into the northern tip of Chelsea. Out in the gloaming there are some of our favorite local haunts: Casa, Cupcake Cafe, Sandwich Planet, and of course, Market Café. When planning our first meeting and meal with the lovely Mona of Mona's Apple, we talked about going to several places, but settled on Market Café because of its proximity and because Mona hadn't eaten in Hell's Kitchen much- a situation HungryMan and I were determined to change. We walked to the restaurant with Mona and met her other half, The Swimster, whom because of crossed wires, we'd inadvertently left waiting at a table for quite a long time. So we grabbed our menus and ordered STAT! That doesn't mean that we skipped past the wine list- Market Café has one of the best-value wine lists in the city. Seriously. We ordered an Italian white wine from the Zeni vineyard (Baron di Custoza 2003), which is a Bardolino blend of Garganega, Chardonnay, and a few other grapes thrown in for good measure. It was fairly dry with a very spicy nose-very well balanced though, especially given its price: $19. Yes, $19. The markup on the wine here is nowhere near the 300% it is at many other New York restaurants. Often it's more like 100% or even lower. That alone is a reason to visit. There are some serious bargains to be had, so don't skip the wine. You'll thank me later. All four of us had appetizers, and after reading her weblog for a while, I was not surprised to find out that Mona chose best- she ordered the wild mushroom salad with tomatoes, spinach, pancetta, and topped with shaved pecorino romano. By far, this was the best of the appetizers, smoky and earthy, the sort of thing you'd expect would work well as a winter dish (and it would), but with the tomatoes, balsamic vinegar, and the spinach, it seemed well-suited to a late-summer dinner. <div style=\"clear:both\";>

 Yesterday was Blog Day 2005, an event that had hundreds, even thousands of bloggers around the world posting about blogs they like, blogs that are somehow connected either to a culture or area of interest different from their own. We were fortunate enough to get tagged by the very talented Stephen of Stephencooks. Not only does the man make a wicked martini up in the Maine hinterlands, he also manages to find time to create some impressive recipes. You're probably thinking to yourself, \"Wait, that's not a 'different area of interest' from the one on full display here,\" and you'd be right. Stephen argues that there's enough cultural difference between Maine and Manhattan to justify the tag, and given the scareness of moose in Midtown, I tend to agree with him. So thank you to Stephen, and thank you the people who've clicked over here from his site!

Price Gouging & Lobster Rolls at the US Open
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE
2005-08-31 22:46:00
***CONTENT
 Today, Nosher and I went to see what all the fuss was about at the US Open out in Flushing Meadows, Queens. (That's not me in the picture by the way. A man stepped right in the middle of the frame as I snapped this, and I didn't take another because Nosher was intent on getting to see Ana Ivanovic in action). The first day of the second round has become our preferred day to attend major tournaments (Wednesday of the first week was our traditional Wimbledon day-off from work when we were living in England). The timing is often perfect, as the weaker players and the ones you've never heard of have not made it past the first round, whereas there are still enough quality players left for a full day of great tennis. Being two very comparative sorts, we discovered that one advantage the US Open holds over Wimbledon is that you can get a lot closer to the players without a massive struggle to find a seat and defend it against the waiting mob-the All-England Club sells 15,000 grounds tickets each day to those who line up early which, while admirably democratic, results in vastly larger crowds and a mad rush for favored courts at 11:00. We got to see Dominik Hrbaty and Nicole Vaidisova beat their opponents, and watched Agassi and Davenport on the practice courts. Here's a picture of Davenport, Nosher's favorite on the Women's tour. All of this tennis certainly works up an appetite. Okay, admittedly we weren't actually playing tennis - just sittting, then walking around, doing lots of head-turning to the left and right- but it still made us hungry. The problem is, the Open not only offers mostly bad and overpriced food, but adds insult to injury by not allowing you to bring in any outside food of your own. There are a number of options, from the tony 'Aces' restaurant and the members-only 'US Open Club,' to the 'Mojito Restaurant and Bar' (could this be a reference to Andy Roddick's vaunted but disappeared 'mojo?') to the 'Food Village,' this last comprising equal parts Walt Disney World and your local mall's food court. There are hamburgers and hot dogs, of course, and pastas, salads, and pizzas. And everything is perhaps two to three times the price you would reasonably expect to pay, even in New York City, and even at a major sporting event. Perhaps I shouldn't have been surprised, but the guy who sold me my $4.00 20-oz. bottle of Diet Pepsi handed it over with a straight face. I think it was in the New York Times that I read about the US Open's lobster rolls. Perhaps I had read that these were the best deal at the tournament, factoring in the amount of food served. Or maybe these were declared the worst deal - my memory can be that bad sometimes. In any event, this was one of the last few days of summer and to me, lobster rolls are the quintessential summer treat, so we had to try them. In all honesty, I had been talking about eating one at the Open for a few weeks now. As it happened, when we were ready to eat a little lunch, we found the lines weren't bad at the seafood stand (which was billed, by the way, as 'Fulton Seafood,' as if there were some unlikely connection to the erstwhile fish market downtown) and we quickly ordered and received our two rolls for the princely sum of $16.95 each. If you've eaten lobster rolls in Manhattan, you'll realize that $16.95 isn't a terrible price for a lobster roll, so perhaps these are really the best bargain, after all. The verdict? They weren't bad, but we both suspect the lobster meat of being brined before it gets mixed with the mayonnaise and other ingredients. This might be in order to keep it fresh, since these lobsters are very definitely not cracked and cleaned on a per-sandwich basis- there's some serious pre-prep work going on here. Besides being salty as a result of the brine, the meat was also a little wet, and this overwhelmed the bun, which I found a little too much like an over-buttered and toasted grilled cheese sandwich (though the roll was a proper top-loading hot dog bun). I would have been much happier with a lobster roll from The Lobster Place in Chelsea Market, which sells theirs for a more reasonable $10.99. But in Chelsea, you have to eat standing up or on a stool outside the store, and here we were in the middle of the US Open, watching a match going on inside Arthur Ashe Stadium on a giant screen. Is all this worth $40 (including 2 Snapples)? Probably not, but we were so dazzled by the optic yellow fuzz that were willing to pay it-and of course this is something those running the US Open know all too well.

Speaking of Lobster Roll, do you guys get out to the Hamptons at all? I only get to because my uncles has a place in Sag Harbor..Anyway, we all ate at this no frills seafood joint called \"the Lobster Roll.\" You should definitely check it out for beach grub!

The New Yorker Does Food

***CONTENT
 This week the New Yorker has a special issue dedicated to food and cooking. I got my copy yesterday and it looks like there are some interesting pieces, including one by Calvin Trillin on fanesca, an Ecuadoran soup and another by their excellent financial writer, James Surowiecki, on the economics of tipping. But the article I just finished reading may be the pick of the crop: The Bakeoff, an entertaining set piece by Malcolm Gladwell that bridges the worlds of food science, innovation, and organizational theory. Gladwell is the celebrated author of The Tipping Point, and more recently, Blink, the book about 'thinking without thinking.' In this piece, he takes us into the frightening world of mass-produced baked goods, and an experiment where food industry professionals are divided into three competing teams, each using radically different methods to come up with a creative idea for a more healthful cookie (a two-person team, a hierarchical team, and an 'open-source' style dream team of 15 food stars). I won't give away which team won and with what cookie, but the article includes fantastic views into today's McCorporate world and its Newspeak-like language, and to the equally bizarre exchanges among food researchers. Including this one, from the leader of the second team: We're not getting enough strawberry impact from the fruit alone,\" Stuckey said. \"We have to find some way to boost the strawberry. or this, from an outside advisor: The mouth feel is a combination of chewy and crunchy. With the flavors, you have the caramelized sugar, the brown-sugar notes. You have a little bit of chew from the oats. You have a flavor from the strawberry, and it helps to have a combination of the sugar alcohol and the brown sugar. I'm not sure whether all this is a necessary condition to getting something that's both popular and the lowest common denominator, or whether this is so different to the trial-taste-error that home cooks go through to arrive at a family favorite. Either way, it's recommended reading.

Foraging Further Afield:  Matt's in Seattle

***CONTENT
 [Editor's note: Today's post comes to us from our friend the Noshingtonienne, who along with her husband, Captain Nosh, provided us with some fantastic meals when we were neighbors in the UK. Now they've decamped for the left coast of the US, where they're among our local bureau chiefs. I bet if you ask nicely, Captain Nosh might also share his famous tapenade recipe. -- Nosher] This guest blogger wishes to thank Nosher and HungryMan, our dear culinary connoisseurs, for taking excellent care of our gastronomic needs throughout New York City when we come to town. But what is a Gothamite to do upon her or his travels beyond the foodie mecca that is our fair city? Well, our boys are very well-traveled and will surely be sharing their recommendations for eating away from the reaches of the MTA, but in light of my frequent travel to Seattle of late, I felt I ought to get the ball rolling, especially since Seattle is a nosher's paradise. One place that has eluded me on my many previous visits is the well-kept Seattle secret, Matt’s in the Market. It’s not that the food is at all a secret, as it seems everyone knows of Matt’s masterful ways with goodies plucked directly from nearby Pike Place Market. Rather, it seems many have been foiled by the hunt to find Matt’s. It's easy to see why this restaurant had been eluding me, as locating Matt’s is hardly easy, and when one is hungry in Belltown, it is easy enough to give up the hunt and pop into any of a number of other wonderful eateries, rather than persevering to find the mysterious Matt’s. Captain Nosh, my trusty land navigation expert and partner was unfortunately not with me, so I was left to wander the colorful stalls and historic cobblestone alleys alone on this mission to finally find Matt's. Truth be told, I thought the adventure only added to the dining experience! Short of drawing a treasure map, I think the easiest way to pinpoint this find would be to begin at the corner of 1st and Pike Street. The Corner Market Building is at the northwest corner of this intersection. Turn to look directly at the red, neon Pike Place Market clock sign, and then begin your walk down the hill. Keep your eyes peeled for a set of stairs located about halfway down the building on your right. (If you get to Pike Place, you’ve gone too far.) Take these stairs to the top floor, and look for Matt’s in the Market on the left-hand side of the atrium. After a long day and in spite of my arriving without a reservation, the small staff at Matt’s in the Market could not have been more welcoming. A handful of parties waited anxiously to be seated at the small tables near the back of the restaurant, but instead of join the crowd, I took the staff up on their offer of my choice of seats at the long tiled counter, lined with dozens of bottles of hot sauce. While I do love my spice, this concerned me greatly. Were these hints for how I might need to attempt improvements on Matt’s own creations, or simply an appreciation of individual diners’ Scoville sensitivities? Fortunately I learned it was the latter. The ingredients used at Matt’s does could not have been fresher, given Matt’s easy access to beautiful seasonal produce, as well as seafood plucked straight from the day’s catch. My gigantic poblano chile was stuffed with goat cheese and pinto beans, and then roasted to perfection. It was served atop annatto rice, something I don’t come across nearly as often as I’d like. After all, who can’t appreciate annatto (also known as “achiote”), a Latin American tree whose seeds not only do wonders for basic rice but can also be used to make lipstick? Noshingtonienne approves! Tying the flavors together was a smoky tomato-ancho chile sauce that demonstrated to me Matt’s skills. The pureed sauce could have easily overpowered the plate, but instead, brought balance and cohesion to the dish. It all worked well with my Bitburger pils, a refreshing accompaniment to my spicy- but not too spicy- meal. Already I was beginning to plan for how I might recreate it at home! The only change I’d make would be to use smaller, more flavorful beans, such as frijoles negros (black beans) or habichuelas rosadas (pink beans). I particularly liked the spare use of goat cheese, just enough to bring out the tangy flavor but not too much as to make the dish too gooey or salty. Because it was such an unseasonably muggy summer evening for Seattle, the key lime sorbet called out to me immediately. My dessert was just tart enough to create the anticipated and appreciated pucker but sweet enough to soften the tang just right. Three scoops of sorbet were a bit too much for me after the aforementioned giant chile, but I think it would have been the perfect amount to share with Captain Nosh. I was, however, delighted not to have to share the pseudo-pizzelle served with my sorbet- it was wonderfully light and buttery, flakier than I usually think of pizzelles but just right for the role it played as a simple complement to the sorbet. Matt’s prices are entirely reasonable, and for me, perhaps a bargain, given the mini-cooking show I enjoyed while seated at the counter. Served up at the pass directly to my left while I enjoyed my dinner were countless Manila clams piri piri, steamed in beer, herbs, and chiles, and Penn Cove mussels, steamed in butter and tarragon. I was particularly impressed when the staff were not only willing, but genuinely excited about, whipping up a grilled cheese for a young patron. Not only did they make a beautifully golden sandwich on rustic bread, but they cut it just as the young diner had asked, and served it with the anchovies (!) she requested. The chef seemed not only excited to whip up a little something different, but as I heard him comment to another server, genuinely impressed by the girl’s quirky palate. The only drawback to my experience was the temperature at the counter, given its proximity to the kitchen on a sultry summer night. Nonetheless, I imagine Matt’s could be just the place to be in the midst of some chilly Seattle drizzle. I’ll be back all right. But given how hopping Matt's was as early as 6:30, next time I'll be sure to call ahead for a reservation. 94 Pike Street #32, Seattle, WA, www.mattsinthemarket.com

The fact that fully thirty percent of my recent posts have been either about coffee houses or coffee roasters should not count as evidence that good coffee is all I think about. Perhaps it's just that there are just so many good places around the city where I am tempted to drop in and pick up a pound of roasted beans. To me, there's nothing better than setting up the coffeemaker the night before with some amazing-smelling beans, setting the timer for when I plan to wake up, and closing the top with its satisfying 'snap!'. The next morning, at the crack of dawn, I am awakened by the sharp jolt of the grinder whizzing away and then within minutes, I smell the soft wafts of the bubbling brew as it makes its way through the apartment, hear the tell-tale gurgling of the last of the water, and maybe catch the ocassional hiss of hot water steaming off the hot plate below. Even if I can't drag myself out of bed in the morning, this ritual helps me manage it. My growing dependence on these sensual morning rituals (not the coffee- I promise!) makes Port Rico Importing Co. such a find. You've probably passed its inconspicuous storefront a million times, given its prime location on a busy stretch of Bleecker in the West Village. But if you've never gone in, you're missing a treat. For some people, the aroma of coffee is so arresting that upon entering the store they catch a coffee buzz just by being there. The walls are lined with big, black tea canisters on one side, and brewing accoutrements on the other, but those items are clearly of minor importance-the real show is going on in the middle of the store. Here, perhaps 50 or 60 large burlap bags filled with fresh beans lie jammed into the shop's center, each planted with helpful flags, color-coded according to whether the coffee is decaf, regular, or flavored (blue, yellow and red, respectively). The selection is immense, and is perhaps a good 3-4 times as large as that of Fairway in the UWS, our other favorite place for beans. As a bonus, at Porto Rico, there's a small counter in the back left corner with a barista serving up espressos and lattes to the thirsty, and there is almost always a line. Today, Nosher and I were in the neighborhood with Cousin Space Cadet, with whom we were walking, out celebrating her first job out of college. Cousin SC doesn't like coffee much (it gives her stomach-aches), so she sweetly indulged us and helped us choose two pounds of beans. Now, we're not really coffee purists; as heretical as it might be to say, we actually do like some flavored coffees, when they're made well. Porto Rico is one of the few places that qualifies, so we picked up a pound of Chocolate Cherry and a pound of French Vanilla Almond, the latter being one of Porto Rico's most popular judging by the bag it was in: it was only one-quarter full. The only dim spot at Porto Rico is the often protracted wait at the counter. The staff are rarely rude, but they do sometimes take their time filling orders. Today was relatively speedy, in fact, and the woman behind the counter positively beamed when I was able to pay with a bunch of ones; \"we're really low on change today...\". So bring some singles, don't be in a rush, and who knows, this might be the place to find your next favorite pick-me-up.

Almost Luscious in Park Slope

 Luscious Food on 5th Avenue in Park Slope in Brooklyn looks like a perfect takeout spot. Most everything is homemade, and the salads, sides, and hearty comfort food are fresh-looking and attractive. Nosher and I stopped by on our way to Lady Film Critic's thirty-something birthday party nearby and ordered two of their entrée salads: a Santorini Salad ($9) with feta, kalamata olives, red onions and red leaf lettuce and a Country Salad ($8.25) with pecans, beets, goat cheese and dried cranberries, all on baby spinach. A very friendly woman behind the counter prepared the salads at the counter in front of us, which we then took out back to a small and secluded patio- don't believe the hype about Brooklyn's backyard garden dining; it's alive and well on 5th Avenue! They also have some indoor tables in the back of the restaurant here, but it's pretty clear that customers are intended to take their food elsewhere, rather than stay for a long time. Sadly, we weren't overwhelmed by the food, which was decent, if a little on the bland side. Case in point: this cous cous, corn, and artichoke heart side dish. The serving we received for about $4 was gigantic- enough for three or four people to share. But after a few bites, we both had eaten plenty. We saw a few flecks of fresh herbs here and there, but not enough of them to lend much flavor to the cous cous. The texture wasn't very appetizing either, truth be told; it all was a little overly sticky and didn't have that nice dry crumble that makes cous cous a perfect companion for something moist. This particular cous cous couldn't have absorbed any more liquid if it had wanted to- it was saturated already. I've since been told that the thing to order at Luscious is the Mac n' Cheese (which, to be fair, the staff recommended to us) and the dinner specials like roast chicken or meatloaf which rotate throughout the week. While it was really lovely to be able to park ourselves outdoors for a short meal, we both wish the food had been a little more special. Luscious Food, 59 Fifth Ave. at St. Marks Avenue, Brooklyn (718) 398-5800

That's why you needed a 3rd party with you. To try the mac 'n cheese. I don't know if we can still be friends...Mac 'n cheese to me is like calamari. I need to try it EVERYWHERE I go. HA

Sounds a lot like HungryMan- he loves the stuff. I think he (and I both, actually) thought the cous cous would be healthier, so we went with that. Bad move.

I enjoy the beet salad with taragon chicken added. I fell in love with beets for the first time at Luscious. I'm a regular at Luscious. Hope you try again. I suggest, the cookies, coffee, beet salad, BLT w/cheese, Cous Cous with shrimp, carrot cupcake and more.

Good to know. We both really love beets, but didn't adore that salad. It wasn't bad by any stretch, but it wasn't great. I'm always up to try again, especially when there are cookies involved.

Joe's: Serious Coffee on Waverly Place

***CONTENT
 After a good cup o' joe at Gorilla Coffee in Brooklyn last week, I've been in something of a coffee mood. Nosher and I had been meaning to visit Joe in the Village for some time, and we finally got there over the weekend after a trip to Chinatown and a haircut at Astor Place Hair (fans of Felicity will remember that this is the place where she got her controversial short haircut). Joe looks like the quintessential coffeeshop: an adorable storefront, strollers and dogs parked outside next to inviting benches, an interior with a self-referential mural of a Vienna coffeehouse, modern seating for 20-or-so customers, and a counter lined with cupcakes and pastries. And most attractive to a newspaper fiend like me, The Times is laid out for reading- if, that is, you don't get distracted staring out the big windows onto Waverly Place, a fantastic perch for people watching. (There's also another branch of Joe on East 13th Street, but we haven't been there yet...). Coffee at Joe is taken seriously. The owners have a relationship with Barrington Coffee Roasting Co., from Great Barrington, Mass., and the quality of their small-batch roasting production shows. In deference to the balmy weather outside, we ordered iced lattes (though I understand that Joe's baristas are trained to pour the milk into hot lattes in the shape of hearts and other 'latte art'). Unlike a lot of cafés, Joe grinds beans for your drink immediately after you order, rather than grinding every hour or two. In addition to the expertly prepared and satisfying coffee, Joe has doughnuts and cinnamon buns from the Doughnut Plant on the Lower East Side and, reflecting its celebrity-rich West Village location, occasional guest-appearances by Amy Sedaris's handmade cupcakes. We went for the Doughtnut Plant cinammon bun which, with its sticky icing, flaky crust, and fat raisins, did not disappoint. Everyone was friendly and welcoming to two first-timers like us, even though Joe is a relatively small space and looks like it has a lot of regulars from the neighborhood. All in all, for my money, Joe has to be considered as another candidate for best coffee in New York. Joe, 141 Waverly Place (just west of Washington Square Park, at Gay St.)

I've only been to the Joe's on 13th Street and I love it. It's such a needed break from the big, tasteless chains, and everyone there is really warm. It's not the most comfortable coffee shop, but I almost always get my coffee there to go, so, voila. I'll have to try out the Waverly Place location, though.

We were actually pretty lucky to score a table- it was packed when we arrived, but as we stood at the counter, half the customers left. I don't know if I'd really call Joe comfortable, but it's good enough for a short visit. I wonder what counts as a comfy coffee shop in Manhattan... DT-UT?

[...] - Amy Sedaris fans might head over to Joe, where on a lucky day you might sample one of the comedienne's famous cupcakes as you gaze out over Waverly (or 13th street, either branch is great).  They get their beans from Barrington Coffee Roasting Co., a Massachussates small-batch roasting operation, and the out-of-this-world doughnuts are straight from the Lower East Side's famous Doughnut Plant.  They grind the beans for each individual order, unlike most places where they're ground in bulk when the line dies down. (141 Waverly Place or 9 East 13th Street) [...]

Minado: It's Not Us, It's You

Nosher

***CONTENT
 Oh Minado, how we wish things were different between us. We think back so fondly to a time, not so very long ago, when we would sometimes take out-of-town guests to your impressive buffet for a solidly good (but never excellent) sushi and Japanese feast. You were our one-stop solution to the picky-eater problem, and hell-your block-long steam table was pretty sexy. Rwarrr! But now, it's over. Really and truly over... . That's how I imagine the 'Dear John' letter I'm composing in my mind would start. It's not a letter I ever wanted to write, but here I am, thinking of ways to replace Minado, because I'll be shocked if I ever go back again. And it's such a shame, because the whole idea of Minado is so fantastic-it's a Japanese all-you-can-eat buffet that serves lunch and dinner for a reasonable price (dinner for $23.95, lunch for $13.95 & add $2 for weekend meals). There's a hot and cold bar with lots of options for vegetarians, and a sushi section that regularly offers 30 or 40 different kinds of rolls and nigiri at once. Oh, and there's a dessert bar and a fruit bar too, just in case you didn't manage to stuff yourself on the sushi. Normally, I can barely even look at the dessert bar by the end of a visit. In previous experience, Minado inspired confidence, despite its size. The sushi chefs were always busy preparing fresh rolls for the buffet line, crafting made-to-order hand rolls for customers who wanted them, and disposing of pieces of sushi the instant they started to lose their healthy glow. The hot and cold bars, not to mention the soup and udon stations, always seemed to have similarly competent servers staffing them. But not last night. I should have seen the problems mounting from the instant we walked in, but I was too busy calculating how long we had left before the restaurant stopped cooking new food. The host or hostess who greets you at the door always, to Minado's credit, makes it clear that the kitchen stops cooking 30 minutes before closing. The restaurant will, in fact, not seat you if you arrive after they have stopped. The logic behind this is clear, and it's hard to argue with this policy when it makes good sense. The problem is that 30 minutes actually means 1 hour. We arrived at 8:55 p.m. and were told about the policy, but knowing that we had 35 minutes before no new food would emerge from the kitchen, we went ahead and sat down. Had I been watching the kitchen staff at that point, I might have seen that they had stopped cooking already, so eager were they to leave work. Not two minutes later, plates in hand, HungryMan and I witnessed one of the most unsanitary things we've seen in a restaurant: two men behind the hot bar washing the tiled wall with a garden hose and a long mop, not three feet from the food. Soapy suds splashed everywhere, including into the food (we had luckily just past that point in the line, so we didn't get any of the scrubbing bubbles in our soba). When I pointed the power-washing out to one of the wait-staff, she ran over and screamed at the men responsible, kicking off an argument that lasted the next several minutes. It was at this point also that I noticed that nothing fresh seemed to be appearing from the kitchen- another bad sign. So of course, I asked someone and was told by a hostess that yes indeed, the cooks had stopped work already (at 9:07 p.m.), and that generally, they ceased production of all new food much closer to a full hour before closing, not a half-hour before, as the restaurant promises. I plead hunger here as my only excuse for not suggesting to HungryMan that we leave- I hadn't eaten anything much all day, and generally, that's a perfect segue into a Minado dinner. So we stayed and gave it another chance. There were a few new dishes on the line that looked tempting, including a spicy scallop and seaweed salad (squarely in the middle of that picture, on top of the shrimp shumai), which was good, if a little underseasoned for a putatively 'spicy' salad. There were also my old favorites, including a sweet shiitake and bok choi salad, and a whitefish and tofu dish that was, as it always is, flaky and moist. The black hijiki and edamame salad, on the other hand, was bland and oily. HungryMan was not happy with his selections, noting that the tempura tasted stale. I thought about sampling some of the crab soup, but decided against it when I saw the thick skin that had formed over its surface, despite the presence of a kitchen staffer stationed directly behind it for most of our meal. We moved on to sushi at this stage, figuring that Minado could always redeem itself here, in the Japanese restaurant equivalent of the swimsuit competition. On a normal night, this is where Minado earns most of its points, providing a breadth of choice that is hard to match elsewhere. But tonight was a catastrophe. The sushi selection was terrible- at least a dozen of the options were redundant items- and the chefs were removing plates at a rate of about one per minute. By the time I left the sushi station, there were only about ten options available. On top of this was the undercooked sushi rice. It was dreadful and nearing risotto-like crunchiness, which made most of our rolls inedible. Much, much worse than this was the horseplay happening behind the buffet line. Three of the sushi staff (who wear blue robes) were engaged in a game where they gleefully and forcefully pushed a bucket filled with dirty water (used to clean the stainless steel prep tables behind the sushi bar) with their feet, down half the length of the buffet. The bucket got pushed back and forth, slopping all the way, at least three times that I witnessed. The kitchen staff (sushi and steam table workers alike) also were frequently on their cell-phones, playfully slapping one another, or just casually leaning against that recently hosed-down wall, rubbing their faces. I have never seen such an unhygenic display anywhere, even in a public high school cafeteria. Come to think of it, quite a bit of this meal was of the quality that you might expect from a public high school cafeteria. Much of it was worse. The dessert bar didn't help matters much, either. Many items were missing even at 9:00 p.m. (when this picture was taken), and the ice cream scoop-the only means of getting at the frozen desserts- sat completely immersed in a turbid pool of warm, green water. Only the tiramisu cake was worth eating, quite frankly. We tasted three of the other cakes (banana, cookies and cream, and strawberry) and found that they were all succombing to a pastry progeria that made them stale and tough. We left feeling angry and disappointed that such a dissatisfying meal could cost us $60. There's very little that is worse than a bad meal, but there's nothing worse than one that leaves you feeling flattened, defeated, and appalled. Minado, 6 East 32nd Street (between 5th and Madison Avenue), 212-725-1333

Myths About Terroir and Wine Sex
***AUTHOR
Nosher
***DATE

***CONTENT
 I’ve just finished Lawrence Osborne’s The Accidental Connoisseur, an entertaining romp through the contemporary wine scene. Osborne travels around California, France and Italy visiting some of the best-known wineries and winemakers in pursuit of that most elusive of characteristics that divides the everyday wines from the superstar wines that people will pay hundreds or even thousands of dollars a bottle for: terroir. From the French terre, or land, terroir is that sense of place that certain wines offer: Osborne quotes a famous enologist as saying that terroir equates to the aromas and tastes specific to wines of a given region. Yet the book has a great deal of fun skewering this idea. Osborne, a British-born writer long ago transplanted to New York, claims from the outset that he doesn’t trust his own taste, and that he suspects much of how ‘wine people’ talk about wine is just trumped-up posturing. Osborne wonders: does Robert Parker, the influential critic and de facto arbiter of modern day taste, really have a more subtle palate and taste than the rest of us, or are his Wine Buyer's Guides just a cult of personality? Osborne also seems to have all too easy a time making fun of how far wine criticism has distanced itself from reality-again and again, at a lunch with Robert Mondavi at his oldest Napa vineyard, at a tasting at Chateau Lafite in Bordeaux, and at a farmhouse of a local vintner in the northern Rhone, Osborne finds himself party to some unintentionally hilarious wine talk. Like this exchange from a class in Napa: “Do you feel this is grassy?” the instructor was saying. “I do think it’s grassy,” a weak voice piped up from the back. “How grassy is it?” “Pretty grassy,” a thin woman in glasses whispered doubtfully. “I think there’s some grassiness in it.” The instructor nodded, satisfied. “It’s definitely grassy. I don’t think we can say it isn’t grassy.” (p. 31) Or this, with a Frenchman visiting the Russian River in California: “…I didn’t say that I found it sexy.” “A sexy wine?” “Oh I’ve had a sexy wine or two. The wife and I like a sexy wine on a Saturday night. Especially on vacation. But this is not a sexy wine, is it?” “If wine is sex,” I said, “this is yoga.” “Yoga? You’re saying it’s like yoga?” He swirled, sniffed. “I’m not sure I get you there. You mean athletic?” “Virtuous, unsexy.” “He suddenly laughed viciously. “Ah, you mean American!” (p. 101) All of which is a very entertaining and well-written way of saying that when we take wine too seriously, when we talk about wine as if it were life itself, chances are good that we’re actually talking about something else entirely. Perhaps Bordeaux garagiste Pierre Siri is right in his claims that wine in general tastes of grapes and that is about it. He also says that people should just shut up at tastings and enjoy themselves. That's a little mean-spirited, but when you're struggling to compare a glass of Chianti to the Downward-Facing Dog position, perhaps it really is time to have another sip and reconsider.

Passive-Aggressive Schnäcking

***CONTENT
 Hip, tiny, and popular, Schnack opened just ahead of the new wave of gentrification making its way through the Red Hook/Columbia Waterfront region of Brooklyn. It's one of the stars in the Alan Harding constellation that includes The Zombie Hut, Gowanus Yacht Club, The Red Rail, and perhaps most famously (and featured often in his Discovery Home Channel television program), Patois. We like Alan Harding's show, as self-consciously contrived as it can be, and we also really enjoyed Patois, so we are both a little disappointed that we can't rave about Schnack. Oh, and we should point out here also that we were seated inside the restaurant, directly below the letter N you see in the sign that says, \"OPEN.\" You can also see that it's a red neon letter, so all our photos, despite emergency Photoshop surgery, retain some of their original hue. We don't want to give the impression here that all Schnack's food is red or pink. All their food looks perfectly normally pigmented. We swear. That said, not all of it was very good. Maybe the point of a place that prides itself on simplicity and sausages is to serve the best hot dogs and burgers around. Truth be told, if we're going by the burger alone, Schnack gets high marks. HungryMan ordered a bacon cheeseburger- the Super Combo ($8.50) that he said was juicy, but not too moist, and just a notch or two down from the Shake Shack's equivalent burger. If you're not familiar with Madison Square Park's Shake Shack, it's pretty widely believed to serve the best burger in the city during the four months or so it's open each year. So HungryMan's assessment is promising. We also heard good reports from one of our dinner companions about her Jubilat Kielbasa ($3.00), a hot dog made of smoked meat, in the Polish style. This reminded me of hot dogs and brats that you can get on the street in Chicago during July and August, although I don't think I've seen a street dog that comes on a toasted bun that looked this delicious. The hot dog was cheap, as well. So far, so good. The real problems began to emerge in my own meal. I ordered one of the special dishes, the fish cakes with sautéed garlic greens ($8.25). They came out looking just gorgeous, alongside spinach greens that weren't overcooked and limp, the way they are sometimes served. The first problem was that the fish cakes didn't taste like much of anything- there was very little spice in these and not much salt to liven things up. Like fish sticks, these cakes also had a peculiar sweetness about them, which was, well, disturbing. Not one of the better fish cake experiences I've had. What was worse was the greens. It was here that Schnack committed the cardinal, unforgivable sin of serving gritty spinach. Nothing ruins the experience of eating fresh greens more than biting into sand as you chew. Despite the fact that I really enjoyed the caramelized garlic flavor of this dish, I couldn't eat it. There was just far too much grit. HungryMan also opted for a side order of onion rings instead of the fries that were intended to accompany his Super Combo. I was enthusiastic about this choice because I love onion rings when they're done well. I'm a fan of discrete rings that are easy to remove one-by-one from the basket, but barring that, I also like the 'small and crispy pieces of fried onion approach' that lets you reach into the basket and just pick out little battered and crunchy onion bits that may or may not resemble rings. Schnack follows neither of these methods, opting instead to serve their rings as a mound of very greasy onions interspersed with batter flecks. This was visually unappealing and just plainly too oily, even for someone with the most unctuous palate. We needed a fork to eat these, and picking up any part of this dish with fingers was never an option- it was all too slathered in oil. As a side dish, I chose the special roasted street corn ($1.50), which was, as promised, corn on the cob that had been grill-roasted and then covered in butter, grated cheese, and a very mild red pepper. This was the best thing I ate at Schnack. The corn was cooked perfectly, tender and slightly smoky. It was covered in far too much stuff, however. Corn needs butter to hold the cheese and pepper, but this cob looked like my grandfather on the beach: absolutely spackled with gunk. Eating the corn was also an ordeal, as most of the butter ended up on my face or my hands. I do think that if it had been a little less generously greased, this would have been a standout dish. My interpretation of the situation at Schnack connects back to the restaurant's own description of their food as cheap, simple, and blue collar; I think that somewhere along the line, somebody confused the concept of fattiness with folksiness, and the result is about half of Schnack's menu. There's nothing wrong with a burger or a hot dog- in fact, a great one can be almost life-changing. Schnack does these things pretty well, in fact. At the same time, there seems to be a real ambivalence about serving non-patty, non-sausage items- are these too precious for a place that fetishises the Pabst Blue Ribbon-drinking set? If they are, that's fine with me, but it's also common sense to expect that Specials should be precisely that: special. Schnack needs to be self-aware enough to recognize that it is not paying enough attention to detail in these dishes. Is that passive-aggressive of them? Could be. I say they should just forget making inadequate Specials and focus on what they do best: grilling meat. Schnäck, 122 Union Street (near Columbia Street), Brooklyn NY, 718-855-2879

I live in the neighborhood, and I am the target audience of schnack - an undertall (newspeak for overweight) junk food junkie who lives on delivery food. That said, it seems that the schnakkers can't get it together to a) have a cohesive delivery policy (5 days in a week they might deliver for lunch 3), or to b) know what's on the menu (the order taker never heard of a patty melt despite it's presence on the schnack website menu. I am done with this place- I think the sausages are cooked past dry, (why split them? i think that's wrong), and they are served on stale bread. The fries arrive cold every time (has anyone figured this out?) , they deliver soft drinks in styrofoam cups (are you kidding?), and the fish and chips, while original, seem to take on the flavor of other things in the oil or something, and they have a kind of disgusting over-greasiness that is reminiscent of over fried taro dim sum... Extremely gross. I too have experienced the gritty greens, and I don't know why I keep trying with this place. Cobble Grill has gone way south, and Waterfront alehouse doesn't deliver. So I'm stuck. You are so right- stick with the burgers, although I think they could do better on the buns.

Very interesting comment, titicaca. Our friends used to have meals delivered from Schnack, and the only thing they seemed to say that was consistently good about it was the price. Love your 'undertall' comment too- I'll have to borrow that, if you don't mind.

Been there twice, won't go a third. The last time we went, a Saturday in spring 2006, about 4pm (wait for it....) they were out of hamburger. We were 3 adults and 2 children- the fries were good, the milk shake thin, the waiter probably high (and didn't offer to share), and the kielbasa pictured above? Well, that was sliced in half and only ONE half was placed on the bun... no pickle. We like Patois, we give schkankies a miss....

 Our first Brooklyn post! You know, we're not really jaded Manhattanites who never leave our borough or who think that the whole world exists within the confines of 1st through 12th Avenues. These days, you're missing out on some of the best food in this city if you never make it to Brooklyn or Queens. Last night was the perfect example: we had one of the most satisfying meals in a long time in Park Slope, but I think we'll save that for another post. Today, I had to write about the coffee place we visited on the way to this restaurant. Gorilla Coffee, on 5th Avenue and Park Place in Park Slope, is the antidote to your Starbucks fatigue: it's quirky and full of personality as you would expect from an independent coffee shop, but without being too cute or taking their coffee any less seriously. Perfect for our purposes: we had planned to meet there so that we could get together with Lady Film Critic, who lives nearby and for whom we were carrying a surprise birthday gift. Gorilla bills itself as a coffeehouse and \"micro roaster,\" roasting small batches of organic, all fair-trade coffee fresh each day at the Park Slope location. So fresh that, if you buy an attractively packaged bag of beans, you will notice a small, round sticker on the side of the pack with a date indicating when the coffee was roasted. Nosher ordered an iced latte and I got a 'special' granita with a shot of espresso, a slushy confection worlds away from your familiar Frappucino ™, in particular, with a much more intense roasted coffee flavor. We also got a small snack or two - lemon poppy-seed slices which were much too dry - but coffee is the star at Gorilla so perhaps this is not too surprising. We also picked up a pound of 'Blendimentosis,' a deep roast mix of various beans that we ground and brewed at home this morning. Poking my nose into that bag was the most delicious way to get me going this morning. The whole apartment smells wonderful. Of course, Gorilla is also a great place to enjoy your coffee and your time with a friend like Lady Film Critic, or whomever you happen to be with. There are about ten small tables in the place, in addition to free Wi-Fi access (it's an indication of what Park Slope has turned into these days that no fewer than four people were there surfing away on their laptops on our most recent visit). Old schoolhouse-style maps of South American hang on the walls and funky music plays from hidden speakers. Outside, there's a comfortable looking bench and, next to it, a water bowl for passing dogs. They've also got a colorful and entertaining website. The only question I've got is why there's only one of these places? I would kill for a place like this to open up in my neighborhood. Until then, we're likely to be looking for more friends in Brookyln with upcoming birthdays. Gorilla Coffee, 97 5th Avenue (at Park Place), Park Slope, Brooklyn NY and www.gorillacoffee.com

You should! The epilogue is that the beans we bought are fantastic tasting as well as smelling. I think iced coffee might be in the cards.

Great place. Great coffee. Its hard to go back to Starbucks after a cup of Gorilla. The music in the store is original and almost as good as the Latte'

First Rumblings of a Tapioca Revolution

 Kuai Ke Li (Quickly) apparently has more than 2,000 outlets around the world. 2,000! That number, just for reference, is about the same as the number of Tesco supermarkets, or the number of Body Shops. It's about 70% of the number of Gap stores worldwide. Why, then, has it taken so long to open a Quickly location in Manhattan? Apparently, there's been one in Flushing (hidden away in a shopping mall) for a year or more, but never one in Chinatown- the most likely place for one. Some of this may have to do with organized crime's stranglehold over Manhattan Chinatown real estate, something we have been told is only getting worse as time goes on. But no matter the reason for its late arrival, the first Quickly has arrived. I'll admit that Ten Ren Tea Time on Mott Street is normally our favorite bubble tea shop- the tapioca is always very fresh and soft there, never chewy and stale, as you might find in other places (notably, Pearl on the Sushi on 9th Avenue in Hell's Kitchen, which has perhaps the nastiest bubble tea I've tasted). I feel a little bit like I'm cheating on a lover when I buy bubble tea anywhere but Ten Ren, but their drinks are a little pricey. Generally worth every penny, but still pricey. Quickly, on the other hand, is not pricey. Most of the slush teas (my personal favorites) are around $2.75 for the 16 oz. size- a real steal. The company keeps prices lower through business volume, and if the lines around the block are any indication, they're doing something right. Most importantly, I'm delighted to report the drinks are both expertly made and very fresh. So far, we've worked our way through several of the flavors: strawberry, passion fruit, kiwi, green apple, sour plum, and shiso plum. Each one tasted precisely of the fruit it contained- no generic, overly-sweet syrups here. Only the green apple flavor was a little off (too vegetal). By far, I enjoyed the sour plum best- it was transcendent: tangy and even a little creamy tasting and just sweet enough to remind me of eating a clafoutis. The milk teas (also usually $2.75 for a 16 oz. drink) I tasted were similarly excellent. My favorite is the bubble green tea, although on a humid day, the almond milk tea might win out. I still think Ten Ren Tea Time is probably the place to go for the drinks that feature tea-leaf flavors, but for anything fruity, Quickly is just as good. Is that heresy? Perhaps, but it's the truth. I'm not so convinced that their shabu shabu business will succeed; the seats in the restaurant part of the shop are only for shabu customers, and I have yet to see more than one table occupied, even while 30 customers wait outside for bubble tea. I wouldn't be surprised if, after a few more months, the restaurant side converts into a snack bar where you can sit and eat their very popular crispy fried chicken dish. I also fully expect that this is the first of many Quickly locations in Manhattan's future. Until then, you'll have to content yourself with ordering from the window on this grotty little stretch of Grand Street and taking your drink on a walk around the neighborhood. Not a bad fate at all, especially when you have something this tasty to keep you company. Quickly, 237B Grand Street (between Chrystie and Bowery), NY, 212-431-0998

You should go back to see how their shabu shabu business is booming. I waited for 30 mins to get a table last Friday. As a shabu shabu lover, I could say their shabu shabu is top notch. They are not as pricey as some of the Japanese Restaurant, but provide the same freshness and more verities. And the service is very good too. If you bring your article back, they might give you discount or even better... a free meal. By the way, the number of the store is 212-431-0998...

 Peanut butter and pretzels belong together. If you've tasted Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby ice cream, you'll know exactly what I mean. Sweet and savory together, wheat and legumes together (with the added benefit of producing a nutritionally complete protein)- it's destiny, right? Well, not always. I think we can be forgiven for being suckered by the promise of these Good Health Peanut Butter Filled Pretzels ($1.89 at Amish Market). They do look good there, flirtatiously piled up on the package next to a glass of milk, but the reality of these nuggets is not quite as nice as the picture might make you think. The problem is, primarily, that they are incredibly salty. So salty, in fact, that eating them is a lot like I'd imagine eating peanut butter infused kosher salt would be. That glass of milk in the picture isn't just there for show- apparently, the tacit message is that if you eat these pretzels, you'll be needing a very big drink soon afterwards. Even the peanut butter doesn't cut the saltiness much; it's not sweet enough to balance anything, and its texture is like a crumbly little marble, trapped in a pretzel cage. I'd compost these, but I worry that all that salt would kill everything it touches. It certainly did my appetite.

Ohmygod...I love anything peanut butter and anything pretzel. Have you had the chocolate covered peanut pretzels? Out of control, I actually went downtown to Ground Zero for the first time since I moved here a year ago and found the Amish Market on my way there...what a great place, am wishing I had one in my UWS digs.

No, actually. We saw some chocolate pretzels, but nothing by the same manufacturer that was coated. Maybe, just maybe, that's the key to making these things taste right. You have such good food shopping in the UWS though! Fairway X2 & Zabars? Mmmm.

Cerasuolo: A Darker Shade of Rosé

***CONTENT
 Anyone who still has a vendetta against rosé wines is either hopelessly stuck in the 1980s, or just hasn't really ever tried a good one. I'm not a crusader for the good-quality pink stuff, but I readily admit that it not only exists, but that when it's done well, it can be sublime. Some French rosés or vins gris are good enough to make a convert of just about anyone- Bandol rosé being the top of the heap there. But there are some delicious, flinty Spanish rosés too. All of the best ones are substantial wines with hefty alcohol content (14% is about average for a solid rosé) and a savage frutiness. When I saw this rosé Montepulciano D'Abruzzo sitting in the cooler at Discovery Wines, I knew I'd found something special. Normally, Montepulciano D'Abruzzo is a red wine, and a very crowd-friendly, berry-ish one at that. It's grown on the Adriatic coast (it's not a Tuscan from the Montepulciano area, confusingly, but instead is a little sub-region of the Abruzzi province. Who knew?) and is pretty much always a good, less expensive bet at an Italian restaurant. Most people tend to like Montepulciano D'Abruzzo- it's like an Italian merlot, but often less oaked and sometimes much more reminiscent of black currants. So with that in mind, you'd imagine that it would make a fantastic rosé. And it does... just not the rosé you'd expect. When it's made into a rosé, Montepulciano D'Abruzzo is called Cerasuolo. It's nothing like the Provencal rosés- less harsh acid- and nothing again like the Spanish rosés--much less tannin. All that it bears in common with its cousins to the West is its color. Cataldi Madonna, the producers of the wine we drank the other night, specialize in Cerasuolo. They make the red stuff and some white stuff too, but it's the rosé that is their primary focus. At 13.5% alcohol, this still isn't a drink that you can knock back with abandon, but it's surprisingly light. We like it with figs, mild cheeses, and even pizza, which is normally the bailiwick of the heavier reds. I wish there were a little more going on in the nose here, but I have to admit that if I saw this in a picnic basket, I'd start to get a little excited. It's $15.99 at Discovery Wines at 10 Avenue A (just up from Houston Street) or online.

The 21st Century New York Deli Sandwich: Banh Mi

***CONTENT
 Rain almost stopped us from taking our friend the Lady Film Critic out for her first Vietnamese-style lunch experience this weekend. But sunshowers and flash floods be damned, because we found our way (and even managed to remain mostly dry) to Broome Street and grabbed three of our favorite sandwiches in town. Full disclosure here: we haven't yet been to the new Nicky's location on 2nd Street, despite the raves it's gotten. That'll be a future post, we're sure, given our dependence on banh mi to get us through the week. In the meantime, we can only wax lyrical about the fantastic food at Viet-Nam Banh Mi So 1. Yes, it's a mouthful just saying the name. We've seen it referred to as just 'So 1,' and 'VNBMS1,' which looks more like a French wine descriptor than the name of a deli, but we just prefer 'Banh Mi So 1.' We think the 'So' isn't short for 'South,' given the accents on it, so we just say it the way it appears. Really, it doesn't matter if you even know the name of the place. Just know where it is (369 Broome Street between Bowery and Elizabeth) and bring your appetite. The sandwiches, in traditional banh mi style, are made from a long roll of French-style bread. It's like a short baguette. The bread is a holdover from the colonial occupation of Viet Nam by France, but it's a good legacy, as imperialist vestiges go. On the sandwich is, depending on your selection, a choice of meats or vegetarian items, topped with cilantro, carrot, cucumber, shredded daikon radish, and a little or a lot of Vietnamese nuoc cham, a chili sauce. You can ask the owners to make the sandwich spicy or mild, and if you really want a fully fiery experience, you need to stress that you want the sandwich hot. On its default heat setting, the typical banh mi here is spicy but not overpowering- the bread helps blunt the heat. I tend to opt for the vegetarian items when I go. I've had a No. 12, loaded up with tofu, mushrooms, and cellophane rice noodles, and often choose the No. 13, which is filled with mock chicken in a lemongrass sauce- I love this because the sauce is a little bit zingier than the regular nuoc cham, and the floral lemongrass seems like a good summertime choice. I have also had the No. 14, which is a more traditional banh mi, but made with ca moi fish (very meaty sardines) in a tomato sauce. Not for the faint of heart, but delicious and reminiscent of a cilantro-tinged fish stew. HungryMan almost always has the No. 1- the House Special (it's also the one in the picture), which is loaded up to bursting with Vietnamese salami, grilled pork, and a sliced pork roll called cha. The sandwich is peppery and smoky and big enough to tide you over for several hours without another snack, which is a little bit of a shame, given all the other treats that Banh Mi So 1 sells. As you can see, they're big on Pocky sticks, but on recent visits we've also seen fresh sweet rice and banana rolls, pandan cake slices, and some intensely yellow fried rice snacks. There are also some really fine looking drinks here, including a cane sugar drink, a basil seed drink, and even cans of pennywort juice. For the less adventurous, they also have regular American sodas and plenty of bottled waters and teas. I like the fact that they sell an unsweetened green tea in the drinks cooler. That's a real rarity, even in Chinatown. While there are certainly more entertaining places for banh mi in this city, including a jewelry store/video rental store with a deli case at the front on Grand Street, Banh Mi So 1's 15 sandwich varieties and real flair for fresh flavors make it tough competition, especially when you've got a vegetarian friend or two in tow, like our friend Lady Film Critic, who tucked into her No. 12 with real gusto while we sat in a nearby park and watched a pick-up soccer game. The whole experience showcases what is most impressive about Banh Mi So 1- it's orthodox enough so that when we visit, we're always outnumbered by Vietnamese customers, but the proprietors are savvy enough to have figured out that there's a market for veggie-friendly banh mi. It's a quiet synthesis of tradition and business smarts, but it's one that works.

I have yet to find the banh mi I grew up on in L.A. The bread in NY is never right. Probably b/c there is not enough demand for the existence of a local VN bakery to make proper VN style baguettes. They add rice flour which makes it lighter and crisper. And despite what others have said, regular baquettes are not the same! The fillings are never quite to my taste. The bread should be smeared w/ pate and toasted first before adding the other ingredients. The pickles are never quite right. It should be carrot and daikon sticks (not shreds) that is tangy, crunchy and not overly sweet. They're usually missing items like a sprig of cilantro, dash of white pepper, a spritz of maggi soy sauce, unpickled cucumber spears, in-house made pate, in-house made mayonnaise, etc. Everyone makes their banh mi a bit different but this is what I usually expect when I order a dac biet/special. Sigh. Well I can't get the same sandwich in LA either now b/c the old mom and pop stores have been edged out by the chains who have switched to regular baquette bread and probably have their ingredients mass produced. Nowadays, the more die hard of my relatives have taken to buying ingredients and putting it together themselves just to aproximate what we use to be able to get so easily in the '80s and '90s. The closest I got was from a little VN place in Sunset Park Brooklyn. They toast their bread!!! I think they're around 8th ave and 42 or 43rd st. There's a small grouping of them. Maybe I should stop by there this week. GK

Alias Serves Comfort Food to the Lower East Side

 Nosher first noticed Alias while on his way to a gallery opening nearby on the Lower East Side. It’s a sister restaurant to the better-known 71 Clinton Fresh Food, which appears to have pioneered the emerging foodie scene in the LES. And it’s part of the larger Wylie Dufresne empire along Clinton Street, which now includes not only Alias and 71 Clinton, but WD-50 and, until July, aKa (aKa has since closed, although a goodly number of its clientele’s favorites have, like good friends that have lost their apartment and ended up on your couch, squeezed themselves onto Alias’ menu as “aKa Hand-Me-Downs\"). Alias sports one of those menus that manages to offer comfort food and adventure all at the same time and so, having managed to squeeze in to the last remaining table in the middle of a busy weekend-night service, we had high expectations. What’s most noticeable about Alias is the consistency of the cooking and the flavors – most restaurants you go to do a decent job of with the starters/appetizers and leave you wanting with the main course or, if it’s the mains that are good, there’s something wrong with the appetizers. Not so at Alias. There was little to criticize from the cross section of the menu that we ordered. My mixed berry salad ($8) was the perfect cool down on an August evening so sultry it felt more Bombay than Bronx or Brooklyn. Fresh blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries mingled with a sprinkling of watercress, fried capers, black olives, honey, and soft super-fresh ricotta from Di Palo’s down the road in Little Italy (if you haven’t been to Di Palo’s for the best Italian cheese, prosciutto, speck, and other necessities, go now. But that’s a whole other post). Nosher ordered the beet and citrus salad ($7), which came with yellow and red beets, chives, currants, a little bit of olive oil, lemon and orange wedges and notably, a good measure of pine nuts, which really made the dish. I like beet salad generally but, to my mind, it was a bit unexceptional – a little undersalted, and strangely, Alias does not provide salt on each table. On the other hand, they do bring out good bread with a white bean and chive spread that, while tasty, would have been more appropriate for cooler weather. (There's a picture of the bread and the spread in the last paragraph.) Our main courses came out of the partially exposed kitchen soon after. I ordered the special roasted duck breast ($19) with fresh green beans, scallions, cherries, and the most delicious fried corn fritters (described as “grits” by our waitress) – a mattress to the slices of warm duck above. Nosher had the Ancho chili encrusted yellowfin tuna ($20), which came with bok choy, chunks of soft avocado, and grilled peaches, all in a Tabasco aioli. Nosher has been raving about this dish since we left the restaurant, especially the pairing with the avocado and the peaches, whose dusting with black pepper seems to have stood out as well. As our waitress instructed us, the tuna itself is served rare, but really it comes seared which, given the near sushi grade quality of the fish, was fine with us. The Ancho crust was pleasantly smoky and tingly, not bitingly hot. Noise levels at Alias are the only disappointment, but perhaps this is not surprising given our weekend night visit and the happening LES scene. On the other hand, the table to our left, a party of five boisterious men celebrating a 45th birthday with ear-splitting intemperance, came close to ruining the entire meal and, by the time they had left, we had no energy left to see whether Alias’ desserts are as good as their extraordinary reputation. Despite our rowdy neighbors, I feel sure we will be back to find out. Alias, 76 Clinton Street, between Stanton and Rivington 212-505-5011 www.aliasrestaurant.com

All Halo Halo Eve: Dessert at Dusk in the East Village
***AUTHOR

2005-08-13 04:10:00
***CONTENT
 My first halo halo wasn't in Manila or somewhere on the West Coast of the US, but in a tiny Filipino grocery store in Mount Rainier, MD that had little room for anything apart from an ice shaver and a few shelves of Nagaraya nuts. They advertised halo halo with an enormous fluorescent pink sign out front with a typeface that must have stood nearly a foot high. One thing was true- you really couldn't miss that this place sold halo halo. But I'd never even heard of such a thing. So I went in, asked the woman behind the counter what it was, and she tipped back her head and chuckled, \"Everybody come in and ask! Halo halo is pinoy dessert yeah? You want one?\" How could I resist? She assembled the treat in a tall, clear plastic cup and presented it to me proudly, insisting that I taste it before I leave. \"First one today, \" she proclaimed. Given that I'd never seen another soul in or near this shop, that wasn't surprising. But the halo halo was good enough for me to want to try it again sometime. Maybe just not from a shop that probably was lucky to make three in a week. I've had dozens more halo halo in the past 10 years or so, and they've all been different. That's part of the magic- sometimes restaurants or grocery stores will improvise on their recipes, depending on what they have available to them. I've even had one in Los Angeles with the very un-Filipino addition of chocolate chips. Not my favorite. This week's New York Times 'Dining In, Dining Out' article about shaved ice in Asian cooking inspired me to go back for more. When I read that Elvie's Turo-Turo on First Avenue at 13th Street got the NYT imprimatur, I got inspired and had to at least check it out. The gorgeous picture they featured with the article didn't hurt either. I'll be honest that I went, at least in part, for the ube ice cream that the article's photo showed perched atop the parfait glass. Ube is a purple yam. It's sweet already, but in just about any formulation you find it, it's made even sweeter by the addition of coconut or palm sugar (or both). It has a very mellow, fruity taste that is like what I imagine peanut butter would taste like if you made it from berries instead of peanuts. It is also intensely purple. Barney the Dinosaur purple. And as you can see from the pictures, I didn't get ube ice cream on my halo halo ($4.50). I'm OK with that, since I know I'll be back to Elvie's at least once this summer. A few things are worth noting about this halo halo. First, the chef makes a lot of it. That's a good thing- just like laser eye surgery, you want your halo halo done by someone who does a lot of them. It means the ingredients are fresher and that they put some thought into what they're doing and won't substitute chocolate chips onto your dessert. Second, despite the fact that it was made with mango ice cream, the top of the halo halo- the entrance point to the dessert- was excellent. The leche flan slice next to the ice cream was supple and not over-sweetenened, and the ice cream scoop was just warm enough to start melting the instant the glass hit the table. Third, I didn't have to wait forever to be served after ordering because Elvie's pre-assembles the bottom section (everything up to the large white layer) and keeps a few dozen parfait glasses in the deli case, at the ready. Smart. It is August, after all. In case you've never had halo halo before, the layers you see are as follows (from the top down): mango ice cream and leche flan->shaved ice and sweetened evaporated milk with pinipig, a toasted rice powder mixed in->red kaong, which are candied red palm nuts->white soybeans in sugar syrup->mung beans in syrup. My favorite of all the layers was the big red layer in the middle, the kaong: they tasted like the juiciest gummi bears and were deliciously cold from the ice that sat over them. I've had more adventurous halo halo with durian fruit and candied garbanzo beans, but this one was just right for 7:30 p.m., after a very long walk through the sultry Manhattan weather. Plus, I know that there's a good chance that my halo halo might be different if I went back tomorrow. If I do, I think I'll call ahead, just to make sure that they save me a scoop of that ube ice cream. Elvie's Turo-Turo, 214 First Avenue, NY 212-473-7785

I see that one of the layers in the halo halo is candied garbanzo beans. I have been looking for them forever. My grandmother used to have them for us kids and I haven't had them since I got married and moved away. Where can I buy them? As I recall they were candied with a pink or white thin candy shell. Thank you for your help.

 Guss's Pickles at 85/87 Orchard Street is an institution, there are no two ways about it. It's a ramshackle storefront that looks like it belongs in inner-city New Orleans, not Manhattan. But when you see the phalanx of brick red barrels out front, suddenly it all makes sense. This is a place that cares about its products and about being part of its neighborhood- and if that means doing business from the sidewalk, so be it. If you've seen 'Crossing Delancey,' you're already familar with Guss's, as that's where the adorable Sam (Peter Riegert) worked. Every time we've walked by Guss's, I've stopped and stared at the pickled tomatoes. I understand pickled cucumbers, pickled peppers, and even pickled okra, but pickled tomatoes have always perplexed me. I've seen a few recipes that call for them, but for the most part, I understood them as a peculiar niche audience appetizer for a crowd I'd never met. So finally, on a walk up Orchard Street with a few guests from Arizona, I decided that the time had come to confront my confusion. I picked up a pint of pickled tomatoes for $3.00 (about 8 tomatoes, also sold by the piece for $0.50) and watched in awe as the clerk managed to jam tomato after tomato into a tiny tub and then somehow, defying all laws of physics, squeeze the top on. \"Just don't bump the bag, or else it might explode,\" he warned. Gingerly, I took the bag, smiled, and returned home, holding the thing at arm's length for the rest of the day. Of course it didn't explode. When I arrived at home, I opened up the container and sat down with my haul and a fork. The pickles are intensely garlicky, but spiced very subtly- I tasted hints of cloves and allspice. But more than anything else, I tasted the mild tartness of the tomato and the bite of the garlic pieces. What surprised me is how firm these pickles are- they are not crunchy in the same way a gherkin is, but they approach that \"snapping point\" without ever crossing it. This means that these tomatoes are easy to slice and retain their shape beautifully. So the little mental gears started turning, powered by my chewing. I imagined little sandwiches, imagined cream cheese, imagined lox, all of which seemed like perfect mates for these pickles, given their Jewish heritage. But as salty as pickles can be, I thought it would be nice to try pairing them with less savory ingredients. What came of this is the LES Bruschetta, a fusion starter or appetizer that crossbreeds Italian, French, and Jewish ingredients, but to such a delicious effect that you won't mind that it's a mongrel. You don't even really need a recipe to make these. All I did was begin with a loaf of good Italian bread- I used ciabatta, but a stirato or other regular peasant loaf will work just fine. I sliced it into 1/2 inch slices, grilled the bread in a grill pan, and then brushed the tops of the pieces with some good olive oil. Then I layered a slice of aged goat cheese (although young chevre will work too), a leaf or two of fresh mint from the garden (but of course any fresh mint is perfect here), and two slices of the pickled tomato on each bruschetta. The aromatic compounds in the mint really give these a lift that I think helps to underscore all of the tastes: the brine from the tomato, the cream from the cheese, the fruitiness of the oil, and yes, the garlic. HungryMan and I polished off an unseemly number of these when I made the first batch. Stuffed and satisfied, we made plans to serve these the next time we have a party, not only because they're so tasty, but because they quick to assemble, and best of all, are very inexpensive. Two pickled tomatoes make about 8 bruschette, so adding in the cost of the cheese, mint, and Italian bread, you won't go broke serving these, even to a large number of guests. If you're not in New York, you can purchase pickled tomatoes in the deli section of lots of grocery stores in the US, and you can also buy them through Amazon.com where they're $3.49 per quart. I don't know that Sam, the apron-clad picklemeister from 'Crossing Delancey' would approve of any of this, but when the results are this good, who cares?

Tibetan near Murray Hill

***CONTENT
 Last week, my friend Pisces and I had arranged to attend an Intro to Meditation course at Tibet House, and decided, in the spirit of the thing, that we really should try to have Tibetan food as well and make it an all-Tibet evening. No surprise, it turned out we had a number of choices in New York, but fairly quickly settled on Tibetan Kitchen, a cheap and cheerful place not far from the Indian restaurants of Murray (some would say Curry) Hill. Inside, it's all dark wood, mirrors and colorful Tibetan flags on the walls and even the ceiling. It's small inside - just a few tables - what some restaurants will call 'cozy' or 'intimate,' when what they really mean is you will be seated so close to your neighbors at other tables that you will be distracted by their conversation during your entire meal (aside: Nosher and I were eating at another as-just-described place last week when we found ourselves engrossed by our neighbors' salacious chatter -- quote: \"okay, so some of the teachers were massaging the students - but we were all massaging the students....\"- we looked, and to our left saw the speaker addressing literary gadfly and flaneur Edmund White). Anyhow, at Tibetan Kitchen, if you sit in the back, you are separated from the stove by mere feet and a flapping curtain. Perhaps this is why it is called Tibetan Kitchen - more kitchen than Tibet. There is quite a lot of Tibet at Tibet Kitchen however, as we soon found out. The food is surprisingly good given the decor and the very reasonable prices (the most expensive thing on the menu is $13 and most main dishes are $10 or under). Pisces is vegetarian and moving closer to vegan by the day, so I was triumphant when I was able to persuade her to try the Thara with me - a \"yoghurt and cheese shake\" that resembles an Indian lassi but not as sweet and, to my mind, less refreshing (but don't get me started on mango lassis - that's a whole other post). We ordered veggie momo to start (\"Tibet's favorite dish,\" according to the menu), which were satisfying, if not a little too reminiscent of your run-of-the-mill fried-from-frozen Chinese dumplings. We followed these with two complementary main dishes: the Tsel Gyathook Ngopa, pan-friend noodles smothered in sauteed vegetables and the Tsel Tofu, more sauteed vegetables but this time, served over tofu. We dispatched both dishes as quickly as they came out of the kitchen: while I have had fresher tofu in New York -- En Japanese Brasserie on Hudson Street and Kasadela in the East Village are just two examples of places making their own tofu these days -- it certainly was serviceable and hit the spot with a bit of the soy sauce provided on every table. And there certainly was a lot of food - portions are large and will please those with big appetites. I just don't know whether it was the spot to go right before a meditation course. Yes, the atmosphere was just right, and yes, the music playing and servers all seemed authentic. Just probably not the place to fill up before sitting still, impossibly still, for an hour. Tibetan Kitchen, 444 3rd Avenue, (at 31st Street)

Bagel Trekking in Midtown

***CONTENT
 HungryMan's father used to have a tradition of waking up before everyone else and disappearing for a few hours right around dawn whenever he'd come to visit. He would always return with a huge bag filled with bagels and cream cheese, no matter where we lived- even in London, a city not famous for its Jewish bakery items. You really have got to admire a man with a sixth sense for finding the best bagels- all the more so when he can do it at 6:00 in the morning, in a city normally bereft of anything more ethnic than a loaf of white Hovis. So in this household, there's a genetic comfort in walking at least a few blocks in search of a decent bagel. We didn't know it when we moved to New York, but we discovered soon afterwards that we're almost in the epicenter, the hole, if you will, of the Manhattan bagel scene. At 46th Street, right near the corner of 12th Avenue, and within schmearing distance of the Intrepid battleship sits H & H Bagels. It's both a factory and a storefront, which is something that a lot of people don't know. More than a few times I've mentioned living close to this shop and have been extended some sympathy that they don't actually sell their bagels there. Oh, but they do. They don't seem to have any air conditioning, but they do have bagels for sale. These are not cheap bagels, even when you buy them here, fresh from the ovens that sit in the back of a building that looks more like an armory than a bakery. But even at $0.95, they're worth the price, especially when they sit in their little labled hoppers, steaming up the plexiglass with residual heat. What's even better is that they freeze well- something that can't be said of many bagels. So while there are only two of us, we almost always buy 6 bagels and freeze 4 of them, which comes in handy on snowy or rainy days when making our bagel pilgrimage seems too difficult, even for those of us who inherited the bagel foraging gene. H & H Bagels, 639 W. 46th Street, NY 212-765-7391 (emphatically not affiliated with the sub-par H & H Midtown East Bagels shop on 2nd Avenue)

One Impossible Thing Before Breakfast: A Great Pizza in Midtown

***CONTENT
 Say what you will about pizza in New York, it's hard to find a consistently good pie in Midtown. We put off our first NYC pizza experience for months after letting the natives harangue us about the low calibre of Manhattan slices and pies. Go, they insisted, to Coney Island and walk 30 blocks to Di Fara, or take the 7 train out to Queens and search for a little place in an alley behind a CVS that has no sign or name. But whatever you do, they squawked, don't eat pizza in Midtown. So we didn't. Until December, that is, when we decided that we might never eat another pie again if we didn't take a risk on a Hell's Kitchen pizza. And we love pizza- in the UK, one of our favorite places to take people was a Neopolitan restaurant called L'Artista that sits underneath an elevated train bridge in Golders Green and serves among the finest pizzas we've had anywhere (inside or outside of The Boot). It's hard not to love a place that interrupts your dinner four times in a single night when the entire staff emerges from the kitchen, banging on pots and pans and singing a tuneless celebratory song for a patron's birthday, especially when they do it so lovingly, as they do. So I admit that our standards were high for pizza restaurants. But this is New York City, a place that really ought to have a pepperoni as its icon, not an apple. Surely almost any pizza is going to excel here, no? As it turns out, we need a Nehemiah here who can perform the impossible feat of putting high-quality slices into every borough and neighborhood. That doesn't mean that there aren't some standout pies to be noshed on here and there. One is the beauty you see here: Don Giovanni's Special White Clam Pizza ($22.95 for a large). It's a deceptively simple pie, consisting only of crust, olive oil, parmesan, crushed garlic, minced clams, salt and pepper. No cheese and no tomatoes. If you want a shot of acidity, squirt the accompanying lemon over the top. But you don't even need that, because this briny pie is perfect without it. The clams are cooked just enough to acquire a little pleasant chewiness (but they're never rubbery), and the crust is so thin that it crunches on the bottom with every bite. I wish the rest of the menu at Don Giovanni were as special as this pizza, but it isn't. There are a few solidly good dishes, including the chicken ziti and the eggplant parmigiana, but really, the reason to go is the pie and nothing but the pie. Or, if you prefer, you can have it delivered, which is what we do. It's not the pizza we expected to be eating and loving in New York, but it's a nice little slice of serendipity.

A Strawberry Vidalia Salsa to Counteract the Heat Outside

***CONTENT
 Right now, we're at the tail end of the summer strawberry season. California berries ship out from March to September, and then after a short hiatus filled with gap-season berries from places like Georgia and Texas, we get back into another cycle of berries, this time supplied by Florida and Mexico. Personally, I tend to prefer the California berries- they're pungent and a little floral. These characteristics are precisely what made me think of them when I was hit by a salsa jones tonight at the gym. The problem, as I saw it, was that we had no good tomatoes in the apartment, and more than that, I hadn't seen really good tomatoes for a few weeks. But I had seen lots and lots of strawberries at Mazzella's fruit market on 9th Avenue. So I wondered: could I use them to make a good salsa? I love peach salsa (although I've never made one), so I figured I'd give a berry version a try tonight. What I ended up with was pretty fantastic stuff- it's got a lovely tartness from lemon juice and balsamic vinegar, but it's all held together by the sweetness of the berries. Oregano and cayenne pepper give the salsa complexity, although if it weren't for HungryMan's dislike of cilantro/coriander, I would probably have used some of that in lieu of the oregano. Then again, I was able to take the oregano from our garden, so maybe it all worked out for the best, after all! Strawberry Vidalia Salsa 1/2 vidalia or other sweet onion, chopped finely into 1/4 inch cubes zest from 1 lemon 1 Tbsp. fresh oregano leaves (about 5 stalks) 1 tsp. kosher salt pinch of cayenne pepper juice from 1 lemon or lime 2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar 1 clove garlic 1 dry pint strawberries (=1 punnet or about 15 medium strawberries) Mix together onion, oregano, zest, salt, cayenne pepper, and lemon juice in a bowl. Remove the green tops from the berries, then chop them roughly into a dice that is larger than that of the onion. Add this to the bowl. Press or grate 1 clove of garlic into the bowl. Then add the balsamic vinegar and stir the mixture well. Cover and let sit in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the onions to macerate in the vinegar and fruit juices. Stir to reincorporate liquid before serving. If serving over fish or meat, add a little salt after spooning salsa onto the dish. Makes about 3 cups. 2005 nycnosh.com Just to give you an idea of how you might use this salsa in cooking, we ladled it over fresh bocconcini (little fresh mozzarella balls) and sprinkled it with a little extra balsamic vinegar and a little fresh kosher salt. It was like a fruity version of a caprese salad and was perfect with a glass of Saint Amour beaujolais on such a muggy August evening. I can't wait to eat more of this with tortilla chips tomorrow for lunch!

Goat Cheese & Watermelon

 It's a combination that shouldn't work, but somehow does. Goat cheese with watermelon seems the perfect pairing for these few humid weeks of August before September arrives and cools things down a bit. If you associate watermelon with childhood, sitting on the back porch spitting out the seeds onto the lawn, or with Fourth of July celebrations, the good news is that's still all true, but there's a grown-up way to enjoy summer melon as well. The creamy texture of aged goat cheese against the cool cruch of ripe watermelon works for dessert or even as a starter, and looks beautiful to boot. We used Fairway's \"Old Goat,\" but any mature goat cheese will work. This is even better with a little jam or honey and a nice slice of homemade rye bread.

Don't Be Distracted, It's the Coffee that Matters at Casa

 Truth be told, I never liked coffee until I was 28. Now, when I think back on my 20s (the bulk of them), I consider the coffee opportunities lost, dreaming about the macchiatos that could have been... . You can see that things have changed for me since then. Both HungryMan and I are big coffee lovers- we don't drink gallons of the stuff, Lorelai Gilmore-style, throughout the day, but we really adore a perfectly pulled shot of espresso. When we visit Italy or France, we resign ourselves to being so wired that you can see the sparks from our fingertips because we're unable to resist the lure of the excellent coffee that seems to be available from just about every shop we encounter. In New York, you have to work a little bit to find a good coffee house. Maybe, in the end, this is a better situation, because it makes you appreciate it when you find one you like (and yes, it keeps you from overdosing on the bewitching bean). So after putting considerable effort into the local cafe search, we felt a wave of relief when we sat down at Casa on 9th Avenue between 40th and 41st Streets. Casa has an interesting history- if you look it up on the Internet, you'll see it referred to as 'Casa Cupcake' just as often as 'Casa'. This is because it began life (and still exists in many people's minds) as a satellite moon to the famous Cupcake Cafe that sits diagonally across the block on the corner of 39th Street. But to think of Casa as an annex to Cupcake Cafe is to do it an immense disservice. Casa is really Cupcake Cafe's inverse- it is like a Bizarro World version of Cupcake Cafe. Where Cupcake Cafe is tiny, Casa is spacious: an enormous table made from a solid piece of thick white marble rests in the front window and is surrounded by several other tables and benches in the front room. The image you see here only shows the front room of Casa- there's an entire back area that is as big again as what you see here. No territorial battles for a tiny table here; leave that for the crowd across the street. Did I also mention they have free WiFi access and ample table space to perch a laptop? Where Cupcake Cafe concentrates its energies on baking, Casa focuses on the coffee. The coffee at Cupcake Cafe has always been servicable, but nothing special. It's not the main attraction, after all. At Casa, on the other hand, they use La Colombe Torrefaction beans for all their coffee drinks- you can see huge bags of the stuff on a 19th Century oven they use as a sideboard. The premium-quality beans are an indicator of Casa's commitment to its java. You really can't do much better than La Colombe Torrefaction, a Philadelphia roaster that has become the (deserved) darling of coffee critics across North America. On one recent visit, we ordered two iced lattes and were cooing from the first sip. The barista asked an important question after we'd placed our order, \"Do you mind what kind of milk I use?\" We didn't. What we got were two iced lattes made with whole milk (maybe a little half-and-half too) and topped with two shots of espresso. Then, another clue from the barista: \"Try the brown sugar syrup in them- it's awesome.\" He was right. It was pretty awesome. Not that the coffee needed much sweetening to start- really well-made espresso doesn't have a lot of the bitter compounds that many people (me included) cover up with sugar. I think I probably used about a teaspoon of the syrup in my latte, and it was divine. There was a nutty taste to this coffee that worked so well with the full-fat milk. On a scorching summer day, can you imagine anything better? Well, the blueberry crumb cake helped a bit, I'll admit. It was very buttery and probably deserved more of my attention, but I was busy swooning over the coffee. Mea maxima culpa! But you know what would really go well with one of those delicious coffee drinks? A cupcake. Until very recently, as part of the ongoing project of staking out a unique identity for Casa, you couldn't purchase Cupcake Cafe snacks here. That's right. No cupcakes. Fortunately, at some point the proprietors realized the folly of this move and capitulated, so today there's a tiered tray of cupcakes in the back of the serving area, just waiting for you. But whatever you do, don't confuse this place with the place across the street. One taste of the coffee in both places will show you just how different they are. Casa, 545 9th Avenue, NY 212-465-1530

I remember growing up making coffee for my parents. They loved how I made it but whenever I tried it myself I hated it! It wasn't until my 20's as well when I tried my first real cup of coffee. I've loved the stuff ever since. Here in the city, yet haven't tried Casa yet. Will definitely give it a try.

Is this the Most Sophisticated Candy Bar in the World?

 Back in 1994, I made my first trip to Denmark, and thanks to 1980s upstart airline Iceland Air, was lucky enough to be given the gift of a stopover in Keflavik Airport (Reykjavik's international airport). I think a lot of people would have seen this as an opportunity to tick another place off the 'Been there, Seen it' list, but I was much, much more excited about tasting some new things. Now, Iceland isn't legendary for its food. Come to think of it, there are a very few things Iceland is legendary for: its tiny and very purebred population of about 270,000 people, its fish, and its sole Nobel-prize winning author Halldor Laxness (whose <a href=\"Independent People is brilliant and worth buying right this very second if you've never read it). You'll hear people talk a little about the yoghurt/cheese hybrid they call \"skyr,\" but if you've ever had quark, you will have approximated the skyr experience. It's like thick, unflavored yogurt. That, in a nutshell, is Iceland's culinary legacy. Well, almost. Enter Þristur. No, that's not a hair on your screen, nor is your 'p' malfunctioning- that's a thorn at the beginning of that word. It's a little easier to read and write it as Thristur, so I'll do that. The Icelandics, being worldly and Nordic (and Scandinavian by heritage), of course speak English beautifully, so they've picked up on the fact that this word sounds a lot like our number 3. Hence the logo for the candy: a little international, and a little clever (yes, and also maybe a little precious). But the best thing about Thristur isn't the name, or the logo, or the little behatted penguin that appears on every package; it's the candy. There's no other way to describe it than to tell you what's in it. There's a layer of caramel that tastes a little like nougat, and underneath it- you can see it in black- is a layer of very mild salmiak licorice. Don't be stunned or disgusted until you've tasted it. The combination works beautifully, especially when the whole thing is bathed in a coating of good milk chocolate. The saltiness and the spice of the liquorice balance out the sweetness of the caramel and chocolate. In fact, if you've ever had Ben & Jerry's Chubby Hubby ice cream, you've had a similar taste experience, with the saltiness of the peanut butter and pretzels offsetting the sugars in the ice cream and caramel. It's a pretty amazing combination in a candy bar, too. We've only ever found one source for Thristur online, but every time we hear of friends or acquaintances passing through Iceland, we have them load up on these. I have yet to meet anyone- even chronic salty-liquorice phobes- who didn't enjoy a Thristur, so if you get a chance, have a bite. You'll see why I love them so much, and why we have an entire cupboard full of them, much to HungryMan's dismay.

Thanks for the link, Bjöggi. It looks as if Nammi also does international shipping, which is great.

The Swedish Chef Comes to New York

***CONTENT
 This Friday, after months of deferral (who goes for Swedish food for lunch?), a colleague from work and I finally decided to try Smorgas Chef, the casual Swedish cafe on Stone Street, downtown. I had heard good things about Smorgas Chef and had passed the place practically daily on my way to and from work nearby. Moreover, Friday happened to be a propitious day for eating alfresco: it was sunny and warm, but not at all hot, and work was light that day- the office would hardly miss us during a leisurely lunch. We arrive to the bustle of Stone Street: weekdays the street is closed to traffic between Hanover Square and the Goldman Sachs building. Scores of shirtsleeved Wall Streeters filled the tables of neighboring restaurants: Gerrardi's, Waterstones, Ulysses, the newly-opened Adrienne's Pizzabar, yet there are tables for Smorgas Chef for the taking- reflecting, no doubt, the unease locals must have for the relative unfamiliarity of Scandinavian cuisine. Wall Street business lunches do not much call for an adventurous palate. In fact, if you're entertaining a client, negotiating a raise, or working on a deal, one wants not just predictability, but safety: my first rule of thumb for successful business lunches, for example, is to never order the soup (a lesson learned the hard way, after a particularly embarrassing episode with a client in London). Fortunately, Friday was lunch with a friend, and we were looking for something different. We both order iced tea- Smorgas Chef brews over ten of their own \"steep teas\" in addition to regular teas; our waitress however could not explain the difference. The Monk's Blend tea we ordered was smokier and darker than regular iced tea, but was otherwise unexceptional. The rest of the menu seemed representative of classical Swedish cooking: lots of seafood, herring in particular; open faced sandwiches; and Swedish meatballs. I ordered the coldwater shrimp sandwich and my colleague had the herring sampler with Lefse, a traditional Swedish flatbread. I think it's fair to say we were both somewhat disappointed, particularly given all the good press Smorgas Chef has received. My shrimp sandwich was tasty as was the small amound of roe served with it, but the bread it was served on was slightly stale, and the shrimp not as flavorful as I had expected. The accompanying green and potato salads were better, though they were at the same time far from extraordinary. It's terrible to say, but I have had a more satisfying shrimp sandwich while waiting for Ivar and Angby to be ordered at the IKEA cafeteria in Elizabeth, NJ. Meanwhile, across the table, my colleague who, having grown up in the UK, told me he could \"eat rollmops all day\" he liked them so much, nonetheless found his herring sampler just OK and the rolled-up Lefse a bit dry, resembling more a tarted-up tortilla than anything Swedish. Worse, the portions were small given their prices ($11.95 and $12.95, respectively), especially the herring, and I suggested we either order something else off the menu or go for dessert. Dessert it was, and here is where the meal improved immensely. Smorgas Chef makes its own sorbet, and the flavors change daily (our waitress made no mention of the waffles I had heard about). We ordered the pear and the blackberry sorbets, which arrived after the coffee, which was served in silver-metal cups - imported, we were told, direct from Sweden. The sorbet was just the thing for a warm day, and each plate with three perfect spheres of sorbet was encircled with an intense, complementary confit. The pear was pleasantly creamy and clearly infused with fresh fruit. Not as intense as the flavors found at Il Laboratorio del Gelato, but distinctly better than average. Our bill came to around $53.00, a lot considering the small portions and the fact that it was, after all, lunch for two. But it was the financial district, and most of the other folks on Stone Street were likely on expense accounts (despite the umbrella, the shadow of the Goldman building crept its way across our table from left to right during the meal). Would I go back? Perhaps, but next time, it will have to be either with a smaller appetite or a larger credit card. Smorgas Chef, 53 Stone St., NY 212-422 3500

Summer Radishes Reconceived

***CONTENT
 HungryMan insisted that we take a picture of this dish as it came out of the oven tonight- it's a longtime favorite in this house, one that requires little work and always surprises guests who claim not to like radishes. The secret (if you can call it that) is that radishes lose much or all of their harshness when they're cooked. If you bake them long enough, they transform into sweet, soft rounds that absorb flavors and caramelize beautifully. We tend to like this best when it's done with a simple soy and sesame combination, but I've used green curry paste and nasi goreng mix, both of which also work well as long as the radishes are kept moist throughout the baking. Enjoy! Sesame Soy Baked Radishes 18 oz. fresh radishes (about 500 g.) 3 T. soy sauce (darker works better) 1 t. chili garlic sauce 1-2 T. sesame oil 2-3 T. sesame seeds (raw or toasted- they'll toast during cooking) 2 T. chopped chives (optional) Preheat oven to 425 degrees F. Remove bottoms and tops of radishes and cut large ones in half. Pieces should all be about the width of an adult's thumb. Place in one layer in the bottom of a baking dish- ceramic works best here. Add all other ingredients (except chives) to the dish and combine thoroughly with a spoon or your hands. Cover dish in foil and bake for about 40 minutes, turning and basting radishes at least once during that time. In the last five minutes, remove foil (and watch to keep the dish from burning!) to brown the radishes a bit more. Add chives in the last five minutes, if you are using them. Serves 3 or 4. 2005 nycnosh.com

The Case of the Mystery Melon

***CONTENT
 As a child, my father would buy huge cantaloupes and leave them in the refrigerator for days- long enough so that the scent suffused everything inside. Long enough, also, so that the kitchen rarely smelled of anything else. Somehow, despite all of that training and conditioning, I grew up disliking the taste but loving the smell of melon. So it's no surprise that a box of these beauties stopped me in my tracks last week. I was compelled to stop and sniff, but wasn't won over enough to actually purchase one. Then, every day that passed afterwards, I thought about the melon I'd left behind outside that shop on Grand Street, sitting there in its box with its siblings, and knew that I had to go back. And that's precisely what I did this week. No, the melon isn't glowing- that's the bright lighting in the kitchen. I asked the woman at the fruit stand to tell me the English name for it, and after much effort, she produced, \"melon.\" So no luck there. I asked several more people, and between my rudimentary Chinese language skills and their lack of advanced English fruit vocabulary, the best I got was a Chinese name for it (Mandarin= \"huang\" melon and Cantonese=\"shiang\" melon) and a rough translation that the name means something like \"smells good melon.\" Google (and AllTheWeb) haven't helped much either- we're in a new fruit frontier here. HungryMan and I are calling it the \"fragrant melon, \" but \"smells good melon\" is just as accurate- it gave off a gorgeous odor. When we sliced it open, we found that it was mostly seeds, and that the flesh was firm and white, a little lighter than honeydew, but approximately the same consistency. It tasted much less floral than honeydew, however, and not at all musky- the way some cantaloupe can. I even have to admit that I enjoyed eating it, especially when a little slice of it sat atop a piece of this Gaspe Nova Lox that we'd bought at Fairway earlier that day. If you head to Chinatown, you should see these in lots of places. We paid $0.80 per pound, but I've seen them sold as cheaply as $0.70 per pound. The melon in the top picture cost us $1.50- a real bargain. My suspicion is that these are pretty seasonal, as I didn't see them for sale in September of last year, so get one now. Just follow the scent.

I don't know what the official name is, and you may have figured it out by now, but my mom calls them Korean melons. Not much help, but I just started reading your blog, and I enjoyed it very much. Thanks!

 Lessons learned for next year's gardening adventures: (1) be sure to give the nasturtiums something to climb as they grow, and (2) plant plenty of extra sorrel for the cat. Mr. Packets (shown here in extra-speedy chewing mode that made his jaw blurry in the picture) is solely responsible for the routine destruction of our small crop. He won't touch the sage that grows right next to it, but he'll eat the sorrel down to the dirt, if you let him. We only let him out while supervised, but when he does get into the back garden, all he wants to do is either eat said sorrel, or, as shown here, guard it from marauding birds, squirrels, or I think, us. In 3 months of growing time, we did manage to eat it on a salad once. Yes, once. It turns out to be a perfect green to serve with large chunks of avocado, raspberries, and a citrusy vinaigrette. But we really can't confirm that. Wait until next year... .

Filet of Sole and Formica: Chez Brigitte
***AUTHOR

2005-07-27 23:23:00
***CONTENT
 You'd be forgiven for never noticing Chez Brigitte. It is perhaps the most unassuming little storefront in Greenwich Village- the entire restaurant spans at most ten feet of real estate. Just look at the picture and you'll see that the bicycle parked out front is almost as long as the restaurant is wide, so if you're moving down Greenwich Avenue at a good clip, you'll miss it. Hell, if you sneeze at the wrong point, you'll miss it. But doing so would prevent you from experiencing a slice of 1950s Manhattan, not to mention some seriously tasty French-inspired food. This is what you get when you walk in the door: eleven seats, two countertops, one large oven, and two (at most) people working behind the counters. One of these is usually the proprietor, and the other is the chef. That's it. If you're not in the mood for intimate, go somewhere larger. And if you haven't yet figured it out, that means pretty much any other restaurant in the city. Don't really wait to be seated, as your choices will be obvious when you walk in the door- if the place is empty, as it was when we were there early on a Sunday evening, we recommend sitting at the oven-facing counter (where HungryMan is in the picture to the left). Otherwise, you'll sit where there's room. Choices are listed in the menu, which is surprisingly large. There's also this old sign on the wall, last updated during some bygone era when plastic letters were cheap and perhaps more widely available. But those are the highlights right there, despite the missing letters. HungryMan ordered the Chicken Fricassee ($8.25), and I opted for the Filet of Sole Meuniere ($9.00)- one of my favorite French dishes. Both of us got a little nervous when, before we'd even finished telling the proprietor what we wanted, he placed two side salads in front of us and then wedged in a little basket of sliced baguette pieces in between our plates. Our experience with restaurants that plop down pre-made salads at your table when you order has been pretty dismal. But we really shouldn't have worried here, we were in more competent hands. The salad didn't- as we both suspected it would- contain a scrap of iceberg lettuce. This was perky green leaf lettuce, with fresh carrot strips, cucumber, and a tomato slice. Nothing exotic or unusual, but it was all fresh. The dressing we were offered was \"French\" (and from a bottle), but you'd be much better off asking for the homemade dressing that is kept out of reach, next to the oven. While this obviously wasn't the most exciting salad we've eaten, it was a good starter (and was included in the cost of our main dishes, so we're not complaining). My sole was some of the best I’ve had in years. Possibly even the best I’ve had since a visit to Paris in 2003. I watched the chef prep the dish and cook it from beginning to end, too. One of the advantages to being so close to the cooking area is that you attain perfect transparency in food preparation. Who needs Sunshine Laws when your oven sits inches from customers? The filet was cooked exactly right: it was still flaky, juicy, and delicately crusty on the outside. The mushrooms that topped it were prepared in a nutty brown butter and acted as a perfect savory counterpoint to the fish. I was well and truly impressed. The rest of the plate gives you some idea of how all the main dishes at Chez Brigitte are served: with peas, saffron rice, and potatoes. Ignore the peas– they’re a distraction. What really matters here is the tag-team complex carb combo of the rice and the potatoes. The rice reflects the restaurant's recent Spanish influence; it’s simply seasoned and never interferes with other flavors on the plate. Those potatoes, on the other hand, are pretty great on their own. They taste as if they’ve been slow-cooked in butter, salt, and broth or bacon fat. If you like your starches rich, order an extra side of the potatoes. HungryMan's chicken fricassee looked like a good-sized helping, but he managed to finish almost all of it. Par-cooked chicken pieces simmered in a flour and chicken-broth gravy for the first ten or twelve minutes of our visit, and then were flipped out onto his plate and delivered to us just inches away from where they were cooked. If you do it right and take some notes, you can treat a visit to Chez Brigitte as a French cooking lesson. The chef is a genial guy and was willing to talk with us, so if you're nice to him, he might give you a few pointers or describe to you what he's doing as he makes your dinner. All the side dishes seem to be the same across menu choices, so as you can see, HungryMan's plate looks a lot like mine. No matter- he needed his own potatoes, because I wasn't about to share. Had we not seen the chef prepping a small dessert plate of creme caramel for the proprietor when we walked in the door, we never would have ordered it. But by the end of the meal, HungryMan and I were both feeling confident enough in Chez Brigitte to take a page from John Lennon's book and give dessert a chance. We split one of the creme caramels ($3.00), which both of the staff called \"flan,\" again reinforcing the French-Spanish connection here- most likely a product of the alchemy that took place when the Marseilleise Brigitte (natch.) Catapano met the restaurant's current owner, a woman named Rosa Santos. No matter what you decide to call it, the flan/creme caramel here is worth a try- it's sweet and cool, with a mellowness that only ever seems to appear when sugar is browned in those little terra cotta pots. One was enough for the both of us, but if you're still hungry, don't be shy about ordering two. There are daily lunch specials (all $5.95) here and a delivery service for people who are lucky enough to work or live nearby. One other thing you should know is that Chez Brigitte doesn't have a liquor license, which is a shame, because I found myself dreaming about having a glass of Sancerre with my dinner. Luckily, you can can bring your own wine, which, taking into account wine markups, may make Chez Brigitte the best-value French restaurant on the continent. Chez Brigitte, 77 Greenwich Avenue (at 7th Ave. South), NY 212-929-6736

Paying Less for Your Lip Service

 Every time I've held a wine tasting- no matter the client, I've been sure to showcase wines from several different price ranges, from $8 (or £5) and under per bottle to in excess of $100 (or £60) per bottle. One thing that inevitably comes of this is that some people are surprised to learn that expensive wine isn't necessarily better wine. Sometimes it is, and sometimes it's not. This is why the 'Two-Buck Chuck' (which is apparently now 'Three-Buck Chuck') baffled wine critics and managed to trump a few thousand other wines in a double-blind tasting last year. If there's one recurring theme- one leitmotif of wine- it's that judging wine is, more than anything else, an exercise in aesthetics. Maybe this is why Eric Asimov disappointed me so badly today. He really ought to know better. I respect him and enjoy both his wine writing and '$25 and Under' column in the New York Times; Asimov is usually so careful with description and adventurous with his palate- a great combination in a food and wine writer. But after today's column about wines for under $10 a bottle, I'm a little stunned. Asimov's point appears to be that there are some fantastic wines to be had on the cheap- wines that you'll love and may often favor over more expensive bottles. No argument here. But it all goes wrong when you pay attention to some of the language in the article, a lot of which seems to hew pretty closely to privileged wine-tasting dogma. For example, this quote: Mr. Grieco agreed, saying that wines from the New World, primarily from California and Australia, are often tailored to appeal to specific markets. \"I will surmise that the New World wines are the most correct wines: balanced, acidity adjusted, with something from a tree,\" he said. 'Correct'?! Wine can be correct? I realize that's not Asimov speaking, but it is a featured quote. Then there's his later implication that his first-choice cheap red succeeds because it seems like something that wouldn't be popular, but that 'discerning wine lovers' would like, and he's surprised to find such a wine in this batch. Apparently, less expensive wine is fine for the masses, but not for the cognoscenti. Asimov is entitled to this opinion, of course, but it goes against the very thesis of this column! Is he subtly letting us know that he really doesn't believe what he's writing? Later, he refers to more expensive wine as 'cerebral' and 'soulful,' which by exclusion, means that the wines he's reviewing here aren't. Even as he praises, he damns. He closes with a refutation of the argument that price bears no relation to quality, saying that it's based on a misguided egalitarian sentiment. Does this still seem like a column touting the merits of $10 wine? Now, there probably are some people who want desperately to believe that all wine is, at its core, the same. But more than this, I think that when people reject the price-as-proxy-for-quality perspective, they're paying attention to the facts: there is a lot of good and bad wine at almost any price point. Cost tells you very little. That is emphatically not the same thing as saying that people should reject expensive wines; a $300 bottle of Chateau Pichon Lalande 1983 is an incredible bottle of wine and should be appreciated as such. Does that mean that Ridge Vineyards can't possibly produce some equally complex and gorgeous wines for $25 a bottle? Of course not. I think that the heart of the matter here is that Asimov doesn't want readers to misinterpret what he's saying, jumping to the mistaken conclusion that he thinks costly wines should be avoided. If there's one thing that is clear here, it's that Asimov is a little conflicted about high-quality inexpensive wine; he can't avoid talking about it, but don't be fooled into thinking he's happy about doing it.

New Green Bo Brings Shanghai Close

2005-07-20 15:43:00
***CONTENT
 So much of what I love about New York City food is connected in some way to Chinatown. Mott Street both above and below Canal Street must be my favorite place to wander in all five boroughs- it's a kaleidoscope of experience, different every time I visit. It's a real sensory assault, but one that never fails to remind me of how much there is to see, taste, and smell in this world. My favorite bubble tea shops are on this stretch, and so is my hole-in-the-wall Chinese cafeteria of choice. Bayard Street bisects Mott Street just south of Canal in a messy, crowded intersection that features a Haagen Dazs that looks as out of place here as would a spaceship, but heading East on Bayard is the key to some of this area's best Shanghai cooking. We visited the renowned New Green Bo after reading about it for months on Chowhound.com and on several other websites. The consensus seems to be that it's possibly the best place in the city for Shanghai cuisine, and that as long as you stick to the menu's strengths, you won't be disappointed. I can attest to the wisdom of this advice. I'll also say this about the portions at New Green Bo: they are huge. After reading about all of the dishes we wanted to try, both HungryMan and I thought it would be wisest to order two appetizers and two main dishes, thinking that we'd be able to go back for soup if we were still hungry. Ha! This scallion pancake you see to your left is one of the reasons why that never happened- $1.50 gets you full in this place. Not only was the scallion pancake cheap, it was pretty outstanding: flaky on the outside, with just the right amount of moistness on the inside. It was light, pungent, and ever so slightly chewy: exactly what a good scallion pancake should be. The dipping sauce was simple- mostly soy, but it was perfect, even though these pancakes needed no accompaniment. We also ordered the Crispy Eel as an appetizer ($6.95) and am glad we did this instead of opting for the main dish portion, because as you can see, there's a lot of food there. I should preface any discussion of this dish by admitting my passion for eel: I'll order unagi at a Japanese restaurant every time I go, and I've been known to head right for the paling in Belgian delicatessens. But this dish was eel in a different incarnation- it was very narrow strips of eel meat fried into crunchy curlicues and then coated in a tangy, sweet brown sauce that was a little like barbecue sauce and a little like a balsamic reduction. This was then piled into a neat mound and covered with shaved lemongrass and cilantro leaves. The aromatic garnishes worked beautifully with the sweetness and saltiness of the eel. In short, it was heaven. Even HungryMan, who looks at eel with not a little squeamishness, declared, \"I can't believe I'm saying this, but it's really tasty eel.\" For HungryMan's main dish, he chose the Stewed Pork with Dried Preserved Cabbage ($8.95), primarily on the recommendation of the Chowhounders who raved about it. They were right, too. For anyone who has never had rice cakes (and not the dried, puffed rice disks), they're a lot like noodles in their texture, but compressed into poker-chip sized rounds that add bite (and starch) to a dish. The rice cakes in this dish were saturated with the pork gravy and were just toothsome enough to make this feel like a full meal. The preserved cabbage was briny and tart, and reminded us both of vinegary collard greens, which makes sense, given its pairing with the pork. HungryMan really loved this dish. Again, there was a lot of food here- more than one person could eat, so be ready to take some food home with you. My own main dish was the Yellowfish with Dry Seaweed- at $12.95, it was the most expensive thing we ordered (and one of the more expensive dishes on the menu), but after all that I'd read about this place, I had been waiting to try this for weeks. I was not disappointed, either. I think the best way to think about this dish is as an Asian gloss on traditional British fish and chips. They might look like fish sticks (aka fish fingers), but that's where the similarity ends. First off, these are whole pieces of fish, not chopped, minced, and pressed fish. Second, these are crunchy and delightful and bear just the faintest touch of umami from the dried seaweed that flecks both the surface and the interior of the pieces. A small bowl of black vinegar and grated ginger is served alongside, and if you look carefully, you'll spot the tiny mound of Chinese seasoned salt on the edge of the plate. The spicy condiments really enhance the flavors of this dish, and you'd be foolish not to use them liberally. If I could eat this every week, I would. Service at New Green Bo is fine- it's a very busy place, so be prepared to wait at the door, to be seated with people you don't know, and at the end of the meal, be ready to flag down a waiter when you're ready to pay. It's all part of the success of the business, so embrace the bustle and try something new. Maybe even some eel. New Green Bo, 66 Bayard St., NY 212-625-2359

I'm so happy to see you did a review on NewGreenBo since its one of my favs for years - BUT also that you went into some dishes I've never tried (eel looks great). I usually stick to what they are known for - the pancakes and the soup dumplings (their other bao is also fun and a quick filler). Forawhile i did takeout from them and they would argue with me about the amount of food i was ordering (i'd get 3 days worth) - but then i told them it was for a party (they truly thought i was nuts for ordering 6 differnet items) and they got all happy.

 We're back from a week in the Catskills with our friends Caroline and John. Lots and lots of hiking, driving in the rain, and a little tubing down the Esopus thrown in too. All week, we listened to non-English music in the car, getting in several Wir Sind Helden (probably the best band you're not listening to yet) songs, as well as the vacation's theme- \"Sommartidar,\" which is, in my opinion, Per Gessle (of Roxette fame) and his former band's greatest accomplishment. It's a study in mid-80s catchiness, so much so that every time there was a break in conversation or a quiet stretch in the woods, one of the four of us would burst out in, \"Sommartidar Hey Hey Sommartidar!\" Here's a short clip of the song, just so you can get an idea of what I mean when I say that it's catchy... If that weren't enough, we decided to name a drink after this trip and its theme music. Yes, it's called the Sommartidar (even though that's actually already a plural word...). It's 1 measure orange-infused vodka (we used Absolut Mandarin, but you can use plain vodka or even rum), 1 measure Chambord, and about 6 oz. passion fruit juice. Shake it in a cocktail shaker, strain it into martini glasses and garnish it with a lime twist, and there you have it: liquid summer (or sommar, if you prefer).

Thanks Stephen! Quite a high compliment, considering its esteemable source. We'll have to try some of those martinis you talk about on your site next.

De Robertis Bakery and the Breast Cake

 After attending the WYSIWYG reading at P.S. 122, HungryMan and I decided to stop for coffee and dessert (and a rehashing of the heights and valleys of the performances). We'd done the trek up 1st Avenue from the East Village once before and had absolutely no luck finding anything more unusual than a Starbucks. But this time, we made a real effort to keep our eyes open for something original and fun. We really lucked out when we found De Robertis Bakery- it's a narrow shop lined at the front with deli cases on both sides. The cases are packed to overflowing with traditional Italian pastries and cookies, as you might expect. But in the back is a little cafe that's tiled from the floor to the ceiling (and even has tin-roof tiles). It looks a little like a NYC subway vestibule from the 1940s, but it's charming. Better still, there was nobody there- this was 10 p.m., after all. I ordered what is easily the best dessert I've eaten in a restaurant since coming to New York, the Cassatine Siciliano, which looked, well... like a breast. It's even topped with a suspiciously areolar cherry and then covered in a layer of marzipan, completing its resemblance to something out of a Rubens painting. But it was incredible, not to mention filled with sweetened ricotta and a layer of green cream filling. HungryMan's strawberry cake looked good, but after sampling my, uh, cake, I think he wished he'd ordered one too. I can't wait to go back again, and next time, I'm taking home a box of their pignoli cookies, as well.

In \"Amadeus,\" Salleri referred to a concoction he called the \"Nipples of Venus.\" Is this it?

What? A New York City Food Site?

 If this is your first visit, you probably want to know a little bit about the site and about us. Let's hope this answers some of your questions. First off, what is \"nosh?\" Nosh is food- a snack, in particular. It's also a verb that means to snack or to eat. People in this city tend to use it in a way that attaches a real enthusiasm to what they're eating. So you'd nosh on something really delicious, but you'd never just \"nosh\" to get through the day. It's an old Yiddish word that, like lots of old Yiddish words, has leaked into the lexicon of many New Yorkers, regardless of their heritage. You can nosh anywhere, but there's no better place to do it than in NYC. On this site, we write about food, drinks, restaurants, cooking, and ingredients. Because we're both New Yorkers now (both back to living in the U.S. after being in the U.K. for several years), you'll find there's a local flavor to this site. Don't worry if you're not in New York though- we'll discuss things that you'll find useful or relevant to your life, no matter where you live. We promise. We also do get out of the city and pledge to take a little bit of NYCNosh.com with us wherever we go. So no literalist interpretations of NYC, or of \"nosh\" for that matter. So after all of that, who are we? Well, there are two of us: Nosher and HungryMan. More people may or may not join our ranks as time goes on, but for now, NYCNosh.com is a duo: Nosher loves ethnic food, he loves to cook using wild ingredients, and he also never passes up an opportunity to buy something unusual-looking on the street and turn it into dinner or dessert. He also always has both eyes open for the best food bargains in the city- this probably comes from having been a student for much of his adult life. Oh, and he never met a bubble tea he didn't like. HungryMan loves rich food. His motto is, \"The more cream and butter, the better.\" He also loves to cook, especially breads and hearty stews (his sage focaccia was our original background image, by the way). One other thing you should know about him: he'll never turn down a piece of prosciutto. Our goal here is simple: to discuss life, as observed through the lens of the food-lover. Everything we write here is, of course, our opinion. You may not agree with what we say all of the time, but we hope that you'll find the site useful and entertaining in equal measure. If we make your mouth water at least once, we're doing something right.

Excellent site! It is well designed and easy to navigate through. The writing is enertaining and fun as well. I was curious if you planned to do any reviews of Caribbean/Jamaican restaurants in New York? There is such a wide array of flavors in Caribbean cooking. I'd love to hear about it through your words.

You know, there is an excellent Caribbean restaurant very close to where we live, and it's been on the agenda for a long time now. Great coconut rice, especially!

I was searching for the address of Jack the Horse Tavern and stumbled on to your review of the same. My wife and I, with another couple, were in New York 10-13 of Nov 06 staying with the owners of Jack the Horse. We noshed (I read who we are) at Jacks 3 of the 4 nights and really injoyed the whole experience, so I wanted to send a thank you card to some of the staff. Which brings me here by chance. I enjoyed your review, the pictures are fantastic. Your website will be added to my favorites and used for our next visit in Nov 07. By the way, you are doing an excellent presentation of what I love, NYC and food. Ciao, Buster

Love this site, and will visit your recommendations when in said Big City. I must invite you to my neck of the woods to share in such tasty vittles as spoon bread, cracklin's, and the ever-so-popular barbecue sandwich (Virginia or North Carolina for you?). Wishing you both the best and an open invitation...Tanner
