NYC FOODIE DISH OF THE WEEK: CHICKEN FRIED CHICKEN FROM MOMOFUKU SSAM

***CONTENT
The NYC FOODIE dish of the week hails from my favorite NYC restaurant, Momofuku Ssam. I stopped in at around Midnight, Saturday night, and noticed a few new dishes on the menu that tickled my fancy. And as a lover of fried chicken, I could not pass up the opportunity to try Momofuku's Bell & Evan's Fried Chicken ($24) with ramps, morels, and egg. The chicken was tender, juicy, and moist. The batter was was light, and gave the meat just the right amount of crunchiness. The sweetness of the morels balanced out the pickled flavor of the ramps. I probably would have liked some sort of kick to the dish, maybe just the addition of some hot sauce would have been nice, for the dish did not blow my mind. But, it still was a great dish, and is the dish of the week! Thank you Mr. Chang and friends for satisfying my late-night cravings for amazing culinary adventures!Momofuku Ssam207 2nd Ave (at 13th St.)New York, NY 10003www.momofuku.com

TABLE FOR ONE: FATTY CRAB (UPPER WEST SIDE)

One of my favorite NYC restaurants is Zak Pelaccio's West Village Malaysian restaurant, Fatty Crab. I love it for its powerful, flavorful, and tasty dishes. So when I found myself on Saturday early evening on the Upper West Side near the latest outpost of Fatty Crab, I decided to check it out.This Fatty Crab is much, much larger than the original. It still has that Malaysian feel, with its brick and wooden decor. I started with the oyster and pig trotter banh mi sandwich ($12). The Banh Mi sandwich is one of the latest NYC restaurant crazes, and Fatty Crab's take on it was unbelievable and mind-blowing! I loved the flavors and textures of this sandwich. For my entree I got the short rib rendang ($25) with kaffir lime, coconut, and chili. I enjoyed this dish a lot too. There was a great balance of sweetness and spiciness, and I could not put my fork down to take a break of consuming this dish!Fatty Crab on the Upper West side is just as good as its downtown brother. I am happy for all the Upper West Siders who do not have to travel that far now for amazing, flavorful, and powerful Malaysian cuisine.

NYC FOODIE QUICK BITE: RED EGG

***CONTENT
Last Sunday for Mother’s Day the NYC FOODIE and his family did what most families across America do on Mother’s Day; we went to Chinatown for a dim sum brunch. I love dim sum, and go to Chinatown on a regular basis to consume a hodgepodge of these Chinese delights. There are a bunch of dim sum spots in Chinatown that I like, including Ping’s Seafood and Jing Fong. On this day (created by Hallmark for capital gains--every day should be Mother’s Day!—duhhhh) we went to Red Egg, a spot I had never been to, but had read about.Upon arriving at the restaurant, I realized I had no idea how to get in; it was tricky (I think the handle on the door had broken and was missing, but there was no signage). It took me a few minutes of walking to other addresses on the block to find a door, and peeking inside the window, til a hostess opened the door for me. But once inside, I found the sleekest and most modern of all dim sum houses in Chinatown, with some tasty bites too!I love dim sum because you get to try a little bit of everything, and the NYC FOODIE’s family shares EVERY dish we order when we dine out. (PS. NYC FOODIE PET PEEVE #1- People who order the same dish as their dining companions, when dining out- come on people! Learn to share and expand your culinary horizons!)We ordered a plethora of tasty dim sum, and all were pretty good. Red Egg is different than many of the other more authentic dim sum spots in Chinatown, for instead of ladies wheeling around carts, and you point to what you want, here, you check off on the menu what you want to order, which is nice.One stand-out was the addictive garlic spare ribs. The only dish I could have done without was the shrimp salad with Huacatay salsa. This taste of Mexico in Chinatown was bland and not good.A real keeper was the braised noodle dish, which was great.Red Egg is definitely a dim sum dining destination in Chinatown. For the sleekest dim sum experience in this part of town, bring your mom, or bring a friend, but bring an appetite and get \"sum\"!Red Egg202 Centre St. (at Howard St.)New York, NY 10013212-966-1123www.redeggnyc.com

***CONTENT
Last week I went with my fam to Kuma Inn, a Lower East Side Asian tapas spot I had been to before, and loved. I was excited to go again. Kuma Inn is definitely a foodie destination for those in the know, for it's not too easy too find, situated on the second floor of an old building, above the Bulgarian bar Mehanata. Definitely a hidden treasure!Once you find the place you will be in for a real treat of some great Asian tapas that are really well priced, with nothing above $12.50, making this a true great bang for your buck!It's definitely better to go with more people so you can try more dishes, and another aspect to note it that it's BYOB which is not only awesome, but keeps your check low by the end of the meal! (Of course, when your mom pays for your meals, the check is always low--thanks mom!!)My family likes to share (perfect for a tapas restaurant) and we got a bunch of great dishes.A special of shrimp shumai was probably the best shumai I've ever had! I loved the chewy texture, the freshness of the shrimp, and the sauce.Pan roasted ocean scallops with bacon, kalamansi and sake ($11) was absolutely delicious, and sat in very soothing sauce.A special of calamari with a sesame sauce was really tasty and addictive.Yellowfin tuna tartare with a rice noodle crisp ($10.50) was simple and refreshing.Steamed P.E.I. mussels in kaffir lime coconut curry ($11) was also a very addictive dish. (I had the most empty shells on my plate!)The Washington state, Willapa Bay oyster omelet ($9.50) I loved. It was unique and delicious!We also got two sides of rice; the garlic rice ($2.50) and the coconut rice ($2.50), which were great, and I would recommend getting to complement the tapas.Kuma Inn is one of the great hidden treasures in NYC. Not only is the food great, but the low prices will keep you wanting more. In this economy, sometimes it pays to search low and high for the perfect spot.Kuma Inn113 Ludlow St., 2nd Fl, (bet.

TABLE FOR ONE: L'ARTUSI

***CONTENT
Friday night I grabbed a bite at the West Village hot spot L'Artusi. L'Artusi comes to us from the team behind dell'Anima (Chef Gabe Thompson and partner Joe Campanale). I had a nice meal at dell'Anima and have been wanting to check out their new spot. I walked in at 10pm to a packed house. If there is a recession, there was no sign of it here. I was able to grab a seat at the bar overlooking an open kitchen where two chefs were making the crudo. I love dining at open kitchens because it's like dinner and a show!I started with a dish from the \"Crudo\" section of the menu of Turbot with peas and yuzu ($14). The dish was light, simple, refreshing, and I loved it! It was basically \"Spring in a bowl\". There were some fried peas thrown in, which added a great little crunch too.I also had a pasta dish of cavatelli with sausage, onion, radicchio, and pecorino. I thought the dish was very bland at first, so I asked for some Parmesan cheese. After adding the fresh Parmesan, the dish got better in flavor, but I still felt it was a boring, underseasoned dish.I would still recommend L'Artusi as a good place to go in the West Village for a glass of wine, a bite, and to forget about the economy for a while. I definitely plan on going back to try some of their other dishes.L'Artusi228 W. 10th St. (bet. Hudson and Bleeker)New York, NY 10014212-255-5757www.lartusinyc.com

***CONTENT
Last week I grabbed dinner with my fam at the Hell's Kitchen Korean restaurant Bann. Bann is the sister restauarant to the more popular Soho Korean hot spot Woo Lae Oak.I've been to Bann a bunch of times and have always enjoyed my meals here. It's a large space with a great Asian decor and vibe. Surprisingly, I've never seen Bann crowded, maybe because I've gone before the rush, but, it is definitely worth a trip if you are looking for satisfying gourmet Korean cuisine.Our first appetizer was Dungeness crab and leek rolled in spinach crepes with a light mustard sauce ($14). This dish was representative of most of the dishes at Bann; beautiful to look at and delicious! The presentation really adds to the dishes at Bann, each dish is almost like a work of art.We also got an appetizer of Jap Chae ($12), stir fried glass noodles with assorted vegetables. This is a popular Korean dish and Bann's did not disappoint. It was great.Our third appetizer was minced sea scallops and Korean pine mushrooms baked in a shrimp mousse ($13). Again, the presentation was beautiful and I enjoyed the combination of the scallops and the shrimp mousse.A special scallop entree with three plump and juicy scallops, in a orange sauce, was unique, beautiful, and very enjoyable.A fish dish of red snapper in rice paper braised in a spicy black bean sauce with soy beans, Ginkgo, and bamboo shoots, was again, unique, and quite wonderful.We also tried a made to order tofu dish with black sesames and a chili sauce, which was different, but you really need to be a lover of tofu to enjoy the dish. Our Pear Crumble ($8) for dessert was the perfect finale for a satisfying and beautiful meal. It came with spiced asian pear topped with buttery crumble and vanilla ice cream. It was simple, yet great.So for a unique and beautiful Korean inspired experience, Bann is a great spot!Bann350 W. 50th St. (bet. 8th and 9th Ave)New York, NY 10019212-582-4446www.bannrestaurant.com

Last week I grabbed a quick lunch at the Dutch fast food spot Danku. For a nice change of pace from your typical American fast food joints there are some unique dishes worth trying. Start with one of Danku's signature Krokets, a fried potato roll with different fillings. I enjoyed my breakfast Kroket ($2.45) filled with ham and egg.For a little Indosian fix (a common cuisine in The Netherlands) try the Indonesian Spicy Beef with Basmati rice ($7.50). The beef is tender and the sauce has a nice spiciness and sweetness to it. My side of shrimp chips were a tasty complement to the beef as well. If you have a little room for dessert, do not pass up the Acai flavored frozen yogurt ($3.50), an addictive ending to a unique lunch.Danku gives the Midtown lunch crowd a different lunch option with some tasty treats. Hey, especially in this economy, sometimes it's nice to go Dutch!Danku47 W. 57th St. (bet. 5th and 6th Ave)New York, NY 10019212-888-3777www.danku.com

NYC FOODIE QUICK LUNCH: BRICK LANE CURRY HOUSE TOO

***CONTENT
Two weeks ago I grabbed a quick lunch with a friend of mine at a new Indian spot in Midtown called Brick Lane Curry House Too. The original Brick Lane Curry House is in 'Little India' on 6th St. between 1st and 2nd, and was most recently featured on the Travel Channel show Man Vs. Food.Brick Lane Curry House Too is a sliver of a restaurant with one communal table and a few seats by a window up front. For starters we tried the Vegetable Samosas ($7) and the Lassuni Gobi ($7).The Samosas were excellent. Crispy, tasty, and delicious!The Lassuni Gobi, which is crispy cauliflower florets tossed in a tomato and garlic sauce were very tasty as well. I thought there was a tad too much sauce on them, and the cauliflower flavor did not come out as much as I would have preferred, but they were still addictive enough that we finished them all!For our entrees we had the Tandoori Prawns ($14) and the Chicken Tikka Masala ($17).The Tandoori Prawns were marinated in an almond cream with a hint of saffron. They were perfectly cooked and very good.The Chicken Tikka Masala (one of my favorite Indian dishes) cooked in a tomato cream sauce flavored with dried fenugreek leaves, was excellent. It had the perfect balance of spiciness to sweetness.We also had some garlic and sesame Naan ($4 a basket), which I loved. They were crispy, chewy, and the perfect complement to the entrees.I'm so glad that Brick Lane decided to open up an outpost in Midtown. This is a great spot to get your Indian fix during lunch time, for they have an amazing $10 lunch special, to dine in or take out. So, for great Indian food Downtown or Midtown, Brick Lane Curry House is the perfect choice.Brick Lane Curry House Too235 E. 53rd St. (bet 2nd and 3rd ave)New York, NY 10022212-339-8353www.bricklanetoo.comBrick Lane Curry House306 E. 6th St. (bet 1st and 2nd ave)New York, NY 10003212-979-2900www.bricklanecurryhouse.com

TABLE FOR ONE: HARBOUR

***CONTENT
Last night I went to the opening night party of a new seafood restaurant in Soho called Harbour, brought to us by Richard Schaeffer and Michelin starred chef Joe Isidori. I had no expectations and only intended to grab drinks. Well, I was lucky enough to end up having a full meal, and I feel compelled to tell you that I was blown away.First off, the restaurant looks great. It reminds me of my other favorite Soho seafood restaurant, Lure Fishbar, in that it looks like you are in a yacht. Seriously though, it is basically a yacht on land. I really like the layout of the restaurant because the bar area is totally separated from the dining room.I sat at the bar and had a few cocktails created by cocktail consultant Deborah Harris. They were nice drinks, and after three, I was definitely ‘loopy’, shall we say.I started with the House Chowder ($8), which came with herbs and vegetables. After one spoonful I was in total shock. It was amazing. My mind had been blown. I’m not a huge eater of chowders, besides the typical New England Clam, but this chowder is special. There was an amazing smokiness to it, for it is cooked with Chinese bacon, and there is also a really nice kick to the dish. It was probably the best chowder I’ve ever had!For my entrée I was served the Arctic Char ($23), which came with miso, grapefruit, and yuzu. It was a pretty dish, and again, after one bite, my mind was blown. It, too, was absolutely amazing. The fish was so perfectly cooked, it practically melted in my mouth -- it was like buttuh! The grapefruit, yuzu, and vegetables, perfectly complemented each other. What took this dish to another level, though, was the addition of salmon roe, which gave the dish a little saltiness to cut away from the citrus, and in my opinion is truly ingenious. It was an outstanding dish, and I’m going to be honest and say it was actually one of the best fish dishes I have ever had! For dessert I had Harbour’s version of a Black Forest Cake ($8), which was fine, but not as mind-blowing as my previous courses.I love how life works and how it’s all meant to be. I love how when attending opening night parties for cocktails, you end up with unexpected amazing dining experiences. Harbour is not only a great addition to its west Soho neighborhood; it is a great addition to all of NYC. Do yourself a favor and hop on this yacht soon and sail away into culinary bliss.Harbour290 Hudson St. (bet. Spring and Dominick)New York, NY 10013212-989-6410www.harbournyc.com

NYC FOODIE BIRTHDAY DINNER WITH THE FAM: 10 DOWNING

The NYC FOODIE had quite the culinary weekend. I celebrated my 29th birthday on Sunday, March 1st, and had some fantastic culinary adventures! Saturday night I went with my family to 10 Downing in the West Village. We were also celebrating my older sister's 30th birthday which was on Friday, February 27th (you do the math).10 Downing comes to us from part of the team behind the restaurant 5 Ninth, and from consulting chef Katy Sparks, and Executive chef Jason Neroni. The space is really nice, there is ample room between tables allowing for a pleasurable dining experience.For starters we had the Oceant Trout Tartar, Roasted Brussels Sprouts, Baked Sheep's Cheese, and Roasted Baby Beets. The Ocean Trout Tartar ($13) came with pine nuts, pickled mustard seeds, chorizo oil and a quail egg. There was a light sweetness to the flavor that I really loved. It was a great starter. Brussels Sprouts have made a huge comeback in recent times and are popping up on many NYC menus. The ones at 10 Downing ($9) do not disappoint. Here they are roasted and served with anchovy vinaigrette, soft boiled egg and parmesan. They were some good Sprouts!The Baked Sheep's Cheese ($10) came on a piquillo pepper jam and was absolutely delicious!The Roasted Baby Beets ($12) came with ruby red grapefruit, picon blue cheese and beet green vinaigrette and was also very good.For our entrees we got a special of Suckling Pig, Squid Ink Agnolotti, and the Striped Bass.The Suckling Pig ($28) was a standout dish. I rarely order pig, so when I saw it as a special I knew I had to have it. It came with a blood orange and apple mustarda, wild baby arugula, and pork jus. It was so perfectly cooked and so tender, the meat practically melted in my mouth. I loved this pig!The Squid Ink Agnolotti ($27) was a really nice dish too. It came with peekytoe crab, dill, tomato confit and lemon butter. The pasta was well cooked and a had a great texture. I loved the abundant amount of crab in the dish which was a great complement to the cauliflower cream-filled pasta.The Striped Bass ($25) came with seckel pears, sauteed trumpet mushrooms, and celery root puree. It was perfectly cooked and just fine, but I was bored with it.Being it was a birthday celebration we decided to order all four desserts on the menu, and I'm glad we did, for they were all amazing! 10 Downing combines all the aspects of what a great restaurant should be. Great food, great wine, and great service in a great space! So what I'm basically trying to say is that 10 Downing is pretty much great.10 Downing10 Downing St. (at 6th Ave.)New York, NY 10014212-255-0300www.10downingnyc.com

When I heard that Defonte's, a sandwich shop from Brooklyn, was opening up across the river in the Big Apple I got excited, for they are known for their 'great' sandwiches, and I love great sandwiches!I stopped in on Monday (their first day open) to check it out. I ordered the \"Nicky Special\", which was a cold hero with ham, capicollo, salami, fried eggplant, provolone, hot salad, marinated mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, oil and vinegar ($9.95). I noticed that a lot of their sandwiches had this addition of fried eggplant which is unique, but I have to be honest, it did nothing to my sandwich. In fact, instead of being blown away by what I expected to be a fabulous sandwich, I was instead let down by a very bland, flavorless mess. There was no hot salad on it as it said either. This was their first day open so I'm sure they need to get out the kinks, but I was just not impressed. Also, they use shredded lettuce which I hate! I'd go back in a few months to give it another try, but the NYC FOODIE needs to be wowed!The best sandwich I have had so far in NYC is at Alidoro in Soho. If you are a fan of a great Italian sandwich Alidoro is a must!Defonte's of Brooklyn261 Third Avenue (at 21st St.)New York, NY 10010212-614-1500www.defontesofbrooklyn.comAlidoro105 Sullivan St. (bet.

Last week I stopped by the 3 week old Friedmans Lunch (formerly Friedmans Deli)in the Chelsea Market for a quick lunch. The Chelsea Market is a great place to grab a quick bite to eat for there are many dining options in the cool market environment. Friedmans Lunch offers a nice rustic atmosphere to enjoy your lunch.The menu has a nice array of salads and sandwiches, most of which can be made gluten free. I went with the Roast Beef with Melted Provolone which came with carmelized onions and horseradish mayo on an onion roll ($9.75). The sandwich was fine and I enjoyed the kick the horsradish mayo gave to it.I also enjoyed a side of Sweet Potato Fries with blue cheese aioli ($3.75). The fries could have been crispier, but they were really well seasoned.So, for a nice new addition to the Chelsea Market stop by Friedmans Lunch for a quick bite.Friedmans LunchChelsea Market75 Ninth AvenueNew York, NY 10001212-929-7100www.friedmanslunch.com

Models like Gemma Stooke, Gwen Lu and Damaris Lewis ran downtown in between shows to feast on chef Josh Capon's menu of Grilled shrimp cob salad and Steamed branzino with ginger, ponzu and oyster mushrooms. They celebrated the holiday with customized conversation hearts courtesy of new website Modelinia.com with names like \"Elite Rox\" and \"Model Love\". After all they say the way to a girls heart is through her stomach...\"Lure Fishbar is one of my favorite NYC restaurants, I eat here even when there are no models present..(Make sure you try the rock shrimp tempura and the spicy scallop roll..superb!)Lure Fishbar142 Mercer St. (at Prince St.)New York, NY 10012212-431-7676www.lurefishbar.com

NYC FOODIE CHEAP EATS OF THE WEEK: VANESSA'S DUMPLING HOUSE

Since we are in a bit of a recession I'm starting the \"NYC FOODIE Cheap Eats of the Week\", where I let everyone in on my favorite 'cheap eats' destinations. I love to use the phrase \"a good bang for your buck\", and these restaurants will be just that!To start it off, this week's \"Cheap Eats of the Week\" is Vanessa's Dumpling House which could very well be the best bang for your buck in all of NYC. After I stumbled upon this find last month, I could not stop coming back on a weekly basis. Why? Because not only is the food the cheapest I've ever encountered, it tastes really good too! We are talking prices of $1 (4 fried dumplings)-$2 (8 boiled dumplings). If you are a fan of dumplings then this place cannot be missed; it has some of the best! They have other cheap dishes too, such as a wonderful sesame pancake with peking duck for $1.75. That's right- that decimal is in the right spot! So for my top choice for NYC's best bang for your buck, check this place out and thank me later. Your wallet will NOT be any lighter.Vanessa's Dumpling House118A Eldridge St. (bet.

Friday late afternoon I had a spontanteous meal with my good friend and fellow food enthusiast Allison Hagendorf at Fusia Asian Cuisine. I probably would never have gone there, but it is one of Allison's \"go-to\" spots and I was game. It was around 4:30, that time in between lunch and dinner, (I guess you could call it Linner or Lupper), and the place was nearly empty. We just ordered two dishes, and well, check it out--The food wasn't bad, I just won't be rushing to head back.Fusia Asian Cuisine677 Lexington Ave (at 56th St.)New York, NY 10022212-308-2111www.fusia56.com

Last night I went to Irving Mill, a restaurant in Gramercy with Chef Ryan Skeen (Resto) at the helm. The reason I went was because I have heard great things about their burger and have had the desire to try it for a while now. Last night my craving was satisfied.The burger ($15), made with beef cheek, bivette steak, and a little bit of pork fat, was perfectly cooked medium, and very good. It did not blow my mind, but it was a definitely a good burger. The meat tasted different from your average burger. The fries were in a need of salt and crispiness, and were not great. After the burger, I contemplated ordering something else from Skeen’s ‘porkcentric’ menu, and after Aaron the bartender stated that the salt and pepper pork ribs ($8) were “mind-blowing”, I had to order them. I am not known to pass up “mind-blowing” food (What diet??). The ribs were mind-blowing! The marinate was delicious and the flavor was perfect. The meat fell right off the bone and I loved them! In fact, I enjoyed the ribs, more then the burger!I’ll def. be coming back to Irving Mill to try the rest of the menu, and for those ribs!Irving Mill116 East 16th St. (bet. Union Sq.

NYC FOODIE LUNCH & A SHOW: SOUTHERN HOSPITALITY

***CONTENT
Last week I had lunch at Southern Hospitality, the popular Upper East Side BBQ joint owned by Justin Timberlake, Trace Ayala, and Eytan Sugarman. This was not an ordinary lunch, for I had the honor of dining with the man who helped create the menu, Ray Lampe, better known as Dr. BBQ (www.drbbq.com)!We started with the appetizer combo ($29.99) which came with BBQ nachos, deep fried ribs, fried pickles, Smokin’ hot wings, and pulled pork sliders. I love platters like this because the NYC FOODIE loves trying a little bit of everything! The two stand-outs were the deep fried ribs and the wings (And yes, I was taking a break from my diet).I’ve never had deep fried ribs, and they were quite unique and interesting. Deep frying the ribs gave them a different type of texture, and they were fun to eat and tasty.I will say that the Smokin’ hot wings blew my mind. They were juicy, tender, and had great flavor. Could have been the best hot wings I’ve ever had, and those wings alone will make me come back in a heartbeat!We also got the wet rib and dry rib sampler ($27.95) which came with their Memphis-style dry rubbed ribs and baby back ribs. Both styles of ribs were really tasty and had a lot of flavor. I had to have a side of the Macaroni and Cheese ($5.95) and a side of Dr. BBQ’s Famous Creamed Corn ($3.95). I love Mac and Cheese and this one was great! It had a crispy top, which I loved, and it was very creamy, cheesey, and delicious! The creamed corn had a touch of sweetness that was really nice, and I enjoyed it a lot too (I was still on break from my diet).Of course, after the meal, the NYC FOODIE put on a little magic show for Dr. BBQ and friends, and it was a true blast!Southern Hospitality is more than just a celebrity owned restaurant. It is a fun spot that is not only “bringing sexy back”, but also bringing great Memphis-style cooking back to NYC. Go for the fun, stay for those wings!The RestaurantThe FoodThe ShowSouthern Hospitality1460 2nd Ave (at 76th St.)New York, NY 10075212-249-1001www.southernhospitalitybbq.com

NYC FOODIE QUICK BITE: PAM REAL THAI

***CONTENT
Last night I had dinner at Pam Real Thai, my favorite Thai restaurant in NYC. I’ve been dining at and taking out from Pam Real for years, and I believe it’s one of the best and most authentic Thai restaurants in NYC. Ninth avenue between 42nd and 57th (Hells Kitchen) is lined with an abundant amount of Thai spots, and Pam Real stands out from the others. The flavors of all the dishes are great and it is a great bang for your buck!I’ve had almost everything on the menu, and last night (accompanied with my friend Allison Du Val, the owner of the event space the Foundry in Long Island city) I ordered for us the steamed chicken dumplings ($4.95), fried tofu (3.95) , seafood green curry ($9.95), and a special noodle dish ($8.95).The steamed chicken dumplings are stuffed with ground chicken and shitake mushrooms, and served with a dumpling sauce. They are also topped with some crispy garlic, which give them a nice little crunch, and the sauce is the perfect balance between sweetness, tanginess, and spiciness. It’s a great appetizer and they are the best Thai dumplings I’ve ever had!The fried tofu, served with crushed peanuts and a sweet chili sauce, is really good too. The batter on the tofu is not too heavy, and it's the perfect appetizer for all you vegetarians out there!The seafood green curry comes with shrimp, squid, mussels, bamboo shoots, chili, basil, and lime leaves. It is truly a soothing dish with the perfect balance of sweetness and spiciness. They don’t skimp on the seafood either; there are plenty of those “goodies” from the sea floating around!The special noodle dish I ordered was one dish I had never tried before. It was rice noodles sautéed with scallions, bean sprouts, egg, a special spicy sauce, and I added shrimp to the dish too. And I have to tell you, it was quite phenomenal! The dish blew my mind. It was basically a take on pad thai, but with a little more heat. I really loved the dish and will be ordering it on a consistent basis!So for one of NYC’s best Thai restaurants, Pam Real Thai is the place to be. I should mention that the décor is pretty much non-existent, but they do have a sister restaurant, Pam Real Encore, two blocks away on 47th and 9th with a sleeker look. But when you are eating food this flavorful, for these prices, you most likely aren’t going to be paying much attention to your surroundings.

I have many ”go to” lunch spots in my Midtown 'hood. One of my favorites is FreeFoods on 45th between 5th and 6th. They just opened a new location on 52nd between Lex and 3rd with the same menu, and I went to check it out last week.When I get lunch at FreeFoods I always eat from the buffet, which I believe is the freshest, healthiest, and of the highest quality of any lunch buffet in NYC. After each meal I always feel better about myself. The price is a tad higher ($7.00 for 1/2lb), but you get what you pay for, and in this case it is “full-flavored, nutritious, creative foods for a busy lifestyle” created by chef Matthew Kenney.Another reason I love the buffet option is that I am a fan of trying a little bit of everything. For last week's lunch I had the spicy tuna inside out roll (with toasted sesame cucumber, and avocado), faro grain (with wild mushrooms, truffle oil, and fresh parsely), lime and honey glazed free range chicken (with bok choy, avocado, tomato, and cilantro), Scottish salmon (with shiitake, pomegranate glaze, and rosemary), Portobello “Piccata” (with an almond crust, arugula, pomegranate, and parmesan), and roasted beets (with walnut oil, fourme d’ambert, and orange zest).Everything was truly excellent, fresh, and delicious! This is definitely not your normal lunch spot. The quality of the food is on a higher level. With everyone talking about living a healthier lifestyle these days, FreeFoods is the perfect place to grab a bite.FREEFOODS18 W.45th St. (bet. 5th and 6th)New York, NY 10036212-302-7195www.freefoodsnyc.com150 E. 52nd St. (bet.

NYC FOODIE QUICK BITE: MOMOFUKU SSAM BAR

***CONTENT
On January 1st I decided to start the year off right and went to my favorite NYC restaurant Momofuku Ssam Bar. I brought along my good friend, the “Lifestyle Artist” (and the voice of the Oxygen network) Allison Hagendorf. She had never been to Momofuku Ssam, and I was excited to show her why I love this place so much!We started off with the steamed pork buns, which is probably the most popular dish at Momofuku Ssam (as well as Momofuku Noodle Bar), and I believe the dish that put chef/owner David Chang on the map. They come with pork belly, hoisin, cucumber, and scallions, and they are quite orgasmic. The pork is always perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, and succulent. We also had a half-dozen of the Beau Soleil oysters with kimchi consommé, as well as the cured hamachi with edamame, horseradish, and pea leaves. The oysters were refreshing and delicious. The hamachi was also wonderful. I loved the play on texture with the crunchiness of the edamame and pea leaves and the softness of the hamachi. The horseradish gave the dish the perfect little kick. It was a fantastic way to start a meal.Next we had the poached chatham cod with matsutake dashi, pinenut, and black garlic. It was a really nice dish. Again, the textures were beautifully paired; the crispiness of the pinenuts to the tenderness of the cod. I enjoyed the flavor combination that the black garlic and dashi added as well. Then came dessert. And if you want to end dinner with a bang, this is the place to do it. We had the pb &j and the pear sorbet. And I must say, these are two of the best desserts I’ve ever had, if not the absolute best! The pb & j came with Heritage Station Concord grapes, and saltine panna cotta. The saltiness and sweetness complemented each other so perfectly; after the first bite I thought I was in heaven! The pear sorbet came with pumpkin ganache and gorgonzola dolce. The sweetness of the pumpkin combined with the gorgonzola dolce was such a harmonious balance with the tartness of the pear sorbet, it brought a tear to my eye!Momofuku Ssam Bar is my favorite restaurant in NYC. All the dishes have amazing flavors and textures. The dishes are unique, different, refreshing, and I must say quite orgasmic! In fact, I used the word “orgasm” quite a few times during the meal, it was that good (Oh, and I also had 7 OB beers that loosened me up a bit)! So for one of NYC’s best restaurants, Momofuku Ssam Bar is a place you must go to. Don’t be surprised if you have an orgasm, or multiple ones.Momofuku Ssam Bar207 2nd Ave (at 13th St.)New York, NY 10003www.momofuku.com

The NYC FOODIE dish of the week is the tiramisu from Caffe Emilia, a little cafe in the East Village with some delicious small Italian bites and great coffee. I was actually there December 26th when I had the pleasure of having the best tiramisu of my life! It was light, airy, not too sweet, and just about perfect! It was so good that my family and I had to order a second one! The recipe, from the owner's mom, is kept secret, but I can definitely feel and taste at least one ingredient, and that ingredient is LOVE. So, for the best tiramisu in NYC, check out Caffe Emilia, and feel the LOVE!Caffe Emilia139 1st Ave (bet. 8th and 9th)New York, NY 10003212-388-1234

***CONTENT
Wow! What an amazing culinary year it has been for the NYC FOODIE! I have had some amazing meals, some amazing dishes, and just a few disappointments. The NYC restaurant scene has had some unbelievable new openings, plenty of closings, and some old favorites still kicking strong.I would have to say that 2008 has been the year of the \"Bar\". Wine bars, ramen noodle bars, gastropubs, and cocktail dens, have been popping up all over NYC. As someone who loves great drinks as well as great food, this has thus been a very good year for the NYC FOODIE!Thanks to everyone who has stopped by my site. Looking ahead to 2009 be prepared to see videos and most likely the NYC FOODIE on TV!I wish everyone a HAPPY NEW YEAR! And with that, let's take a look at my favorites of 2008.BON APPETIT!Top 5 Best Meals of 20081. Every meal I had at Momofuku Ssam Bar. This is my favorite restaurant in NYC, and my mind is blown every time I eat here! The flavors and textures of each dish are phenomenal! (I'm still dying to go to Momofuku Ko!)2. Omakase at Sushi of Gari. I've had the Omakase (10 pieces of sushi-chef's choice for $55) at Sushi of Gari (there are 3 in NYC) a few times this year and every time the sushi is sublime and outstanding!3. The Little Owl. I revisited The Little Owl this year after a 2-year hiatus and it has not missed a beat! It is one of the best all round restaurants in NYC.4. Tasting Menu at Le Cirque. There are many old school restaurants I have not been to, but luckily I was able to have a tasting menu (along with my younger sister) at Le Cirque this year, and it was great!5. Tasting Menu at San Domenico. San Domenico is another old school top restaurant I got to dine at this year, (again, with my younger sister-what a lucky gal!) and had the honor of having their tasting menu. It was a fantastic meal. They are relocating to Madison Square Park and I look forward to dining in their new space next year!Top 5 Dishes of 20081. Spicy Pork Sausage and Rice Cakes with chinese brocoli and crispy shallots from Momofuku Ssam Bar. The epitome of the dishes here, with amazing flavors and textures!2. Scrambled Eggs topped with caviar from Le Cirque. The best scrambled eggs I've ever had!3. Roasted Free Range Chicken with swiss chard, dumplings, white pearls, wild mushrooms and bacon from Dressler (in Brooklyn). This is the best chicken dish I've ever had. I'm not one who orders chicken at restaurants usually, but this dish still lingers in my mind!4. Gravy Meatball Sliders with beef, pork, veal, and pecorino from The Little Owl. Orgasmic is all I need to say!5. Fried Chicken \"Blue Ribbon Style\" with wasabi and honey from Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill. This was some great fried chicken with a kick!HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!

TABLE FOR ONE: MOMOFUKU NOODLE BAR

***CONTENT
First off, let me just say for the record that my all round favorite restaurant in NYC is Momofuku Ssam. It used to be Momofuku Noodle Bar, until Ssam opened up. I have never written about the Momofuku empire, for it has gotten much press (all well deserved), and I did not want to add to all the hype, but the Momofuku empire is amazing!I decided to finally write about my most recent Momofuku experience (there have been many- all phenomenal) because I think it is about time, and I just downright love them. I think both Momofuku Noodle bar and Ssam are ideal for solo dining, and are definitely two of the best restaurants in NYC to dine alone at. With their long wooden communal bars for dining, they’re just perfect! I have eaten Momofuku Noodle Bar’s Momofuku Ramen many, many times, and I think it is the best ramen noodle dish in NYC. Ramen noodle restaurants have been popping up all over recently, many in the East village, and some are very good. But I still think Noodle Bar’s is the best, for their tasty and well seasoned broth, ingredients, and great Berkshire pork.On this most recent visit I noticed the menu had changed a bit. The menu is now written on two chalkboards, the dishes are different, and unfortunately, the prices are higher. I started with two snacks; the Soy Sauce Egg ($2) and the Seven Spiced Potato Chips.The potato chips were crispy, tasty, well seasoned, and a nice snack. I thought it was a somewhat odd dish to have on the menu, but it was just a snack, and when I look back on it, they were probably some of the best chips I have ever had. They did not blow my mind, but as far as potato chips go, they were pretty darn good!The Soy Sauce egg did blow my mind! Never did I think a hard boiled egg could blow my mind, but leave it to Mr. David Chang and the chefs at Momofuku , and they did just that. This little egg was phenomenal! Marinated in a red wine vinaigrette, ginger, and soy sauce, and topped with crispy shallots and chives, the dish is the epitome of all the dishes I have had at both Momofuku restaurants. The flavor was amazing and the texture, with the crispiness and softness, was perfect. For my main dish I got the Ginger Scallion dressed noodles ($11) with seasonal vegetables and Berkshire pork ($3 extra). I really enjoyed this dish, for the amazing flavor and play on texture. Both Momofuku Noodle Bar and Momofuku Ssam are phenomenal restaurants. If you enjoy food with amazing, unique flavors and a play on texture, you must go. Just be prepared to get your mind blown! And please, buckle-up, it’ll be quite the culinary ride.Momofuku Noodle Bar171 1st Ave (bet. 10th and 11th)New York, NY 10003www.momofuku.comMomofuku Ssam Bar207 2nd Ave (at 13th St.)New York, NY 10003www.momofuku.com

Last night I went to grab a drink at the restaurant/lounge Haven in Midtown. It is an extremely sexy two floored spot, with colors of red all around, including elegant red chandeliers. The word 'bordello' is the first word that comes to mind.Not only does Haven have a great cocktail list, but they have an international menu of small plates as well. So of course, in NYC FOODIE fashion, I just had to try the food!I actually really liked the menu because each dish came from a different part of the world or part of the US; it was a culinary trip around the world. I went with the Duck and Fois Gras Meatballs ($17) and the Lobster Risotto ($23).The Duck and Fois Gras Meatballs came with winter vegetables and a duck reduction. They were very delicate and delicious. I absolutely loved the duck reduction, which was both soothing and seductive!The Lobster Risotto came with chanterelles, white truffle oil, and parmesan reggiano. This was also a great dish. The risotto was perfectly cooked and the chunks of lobster were perfect, which made for an addictive dish. It also had a nice little kick to it that was nice. I love eating great food all over NYC. I love getting drinks all over NYC too. When you can match great drinks and great food in one spot, then I am in NYC FOODIE heaven! Haven is that heaven; an extremely sexy heaven!Haven244 E. 51st St. (bet. 2nd and 3rd)New York, NY 10022212-906-9066www.havennewyork.com

Wednesday night I went to the wine bar Terroir in the East Village. Terroir comes to us from chef Marco Canora and sommelier Paul Grieco (Hearth, Insieme). The place is small, with just one long communal table and the bar. It has a very laid back and comfortable feel, typical of most places in the East Village.I luckily walked in with Mr. Grieco, (who I recognized outside, because I have the ability to recognize most personalities in the NYC restaurant industry) and I had him recommend what I should order.I took his recommendations and went with the Hearts of Bibb Lettuce salad ($7) and the fried Sage Leaves with lamb sausage ($7). He paired these dishes with a unique Hungarian wine, which was wonderful.The Hearts of Bibb Lettuce came with creamy garlic vinaigrette and bread crumbs. It was tasty, refreshing, and crunchy. I'm not a huge salad eater, but it was a nice start.The fried Sage Leaves with lamb sausages were great! The lamb was juicy and succulent, and the wrapped fried sage leaves around them gave it the perfect crisp.After these two little bites I decided to grab another bite and went with the fried Beet Risotto Balls with gorgonzola cheese ($7). (Too be honest, I initially thought it said \"Beef\" instead of \"Beet\" so my first thought was \"Wow this beef tastes like beets!\") The gorgonzola was the perfect complement for the beets, and both flavors were equally strong. Terroir is the perfect wine bar. It has an amazing selection of unique and great wine, as well as a great menu of small bites to pair with the wine. The prices are not expensive too. It is definitely one of my favorite wine bars in all of NYC!Terroir413 E. 12th St. (at 1st Ave)New York, NY 10009646-602-1300www.wineisterroir.com

The NYC FOODIE dish of the week is the Lobster Thermidor from Supermac ($8.95). I love lobster, and I love macaroni and cheese. Put them together and I'm in foodie heaven. Try Supermac's take on it with chunks of fresh Maine lobster, brie, and mascarpone. This creamy bowl of yumminess (topped with bread crumbs to give it a nice crunch) will satisfy your culinary cravings. It's also a great bang for your buck! PS If you are at Supermac, make sure you try their Mac and Cheese Nuggets ($5.95 for six); they are addictive.Supermac348 7th Avenue (bet. 29th and 30th)New York, NY 10001212-760-1900www.supermacnyc.com

NYC FOODIE QUICK BITE: KOBE CLUB

Wednesday night I went to Kobe Club in Midtown for drinks. In typical NYC FOODIE style I ended up getting a little tasting of the food too, which was great because I had never been to Kobe Club before.It's an interesting space with an automatic door that lets you into the narrow bar area up front with the dining room in back. From the ceiling hangs an abundant amount of samurai swords, and the booths are black leather. It feels like you are in the underground lair/lounge of a Japanese warrior (a warrior that enjoys steak).I had the Diver Scallop and Braised American \"Kobe\" Short Rib ($26), the American \"Kobe\" Beef Cheek Ravioli ($24), and the Kobe Beef Sliders ($27).The short rib dish, which came with roasted chanterelle mushrooms, was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy, well-seasoned, decadent, and delicious. I didn't even need the diver scallop on top, which was an added bonus.The beef cheek ravioli came in a truffle broth and had a black truffle on top of each ravioli. It was a very rich and decadent dish. I had never tasted a dish where the flavor of truffles was so strong. It was new and enjoyable.The kobe beef sliders were juicy and perfect. They came with onion, tomato, gruyere cheese, shitake mushroom, and a miso mayo. Delicious!There was also a basket of cheesy bread that was really tasty and addictive.Kobe Club is a great place to go to indulge in decadence. With delicious and addictive food, I say screw the economy, go for it! If you are on a budget though, they are running a winter $35 prix fixe menu, where you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert (a $125 value).Kobe Club68 W. 58th St. (between 5th and 6th)New York, NY 10019212-644-5623http://www.chinagrillmgt.com/kobeClub/

Monday night I went to dell'anima, a small Italian spot in the West Village. I've had various foodie friends rave about the place so I wanted to see what they were talking about.The place is on the medium to small size, with only 45 seats, a few seats at the bar, and six seats in the back at the chefs counter, overlooking the open kitchen. I was immediately drawn to those seats, which I love for solo dining, but unfortunately they were all taken, so I took a seat at the bar.I started with an order of three bruschette ($10). They give you a basket of the bruschette and you choose what you want to put on it. I went with the soft-scrambled egg with bottarga, the tonnato with fennel and lemon, and the ricotta with sea salt. I really enjoyed this starter. It all tasted great and I think it is a really fun way to start a meal!For my entree I went with the Pizzoccheri ($17), one of their pastas made in-house. It came with speck, savoy cabbage, potatoes, and smoked ricotta. The pasta was really well cooked and I enjoyed the saltiness the speck and smoked ricotta lent to the dish. I never had savoy cabbage in a pasta dish, and I actually was not a fan of it in the dish, for it was soggy, and could have done without it. Everything else worked well and it was a soothing dish.I think dell'anima is a great place for good wine and good Italian fare. The prices are pretty good too. I will say that the place is extremely loud, so if you are looking for intimate conversation I would not go here. But for fun Italian eats in the West Village, it is a great spot!dell'anima38 8th Avenue (at Jane st.)New York, NY 10014212-366-6633www.dellanima.com

Last week the NYC FOODETTE (my younger sister) and I went to Pure Food and Wine, the popular raw/vegan restaurant in Gramercy. Now, I’m a huge fan of my meat, but sometimes I get inspired to eat healthy, and this was one of those times. The term “raw” refers to keeping all of the ingredients under 118 degrees. This was the perfect spot for my sister, who you can call a “Seagan” (she eats mainly vegetables and some seafood). The place is really sexy, with walls and chairs of red. They also have the most amazing patio in NYC, great for dining alfresco in spring and summer.We decided to get the five-course tasting menu ($69) so we could truly explore this different way of eating. All the dishes were beautiful and looked like works of art.One standout included the Winter Salad of Mache, Frisee and Wild Arugula in Walnut Birch Vinaigrette which came with Long Island apples, candied walnuts, and tea smoked cashew cheese. This was a great salad because not only did everything complement each other perfectly, but that tea smoked cashew cheese was absolutely mind-blowing. There is no use of dairy in vegan cooking, and this cashew cheese really tasted like cheese, yet it was made of cashews. Also, I’m normally not a fan of walnuts, but the candied walnuts tasted great and gave the salad a delicious crunch.The appetizer of Asparagus Sushi Rolls with Mirin Soaked Forest Mushrooms with avocado, red pepper, sweet basil, and pepper gastrique was excellent. I have had this dish before and it is always great. After finishing the rolls you completely forget that there was no fish in them.The White Corn Tamales with Raw Cacao Mole came with marinated mushrooms, salsa verde and avocado. I’m not a huge tamale eater, but it is safe to say this was the best I’ve ever had. All the flavors were delicious and it was an addictive dish.One dish that blew my mind was the Winter Vegatable Tagine with Ceylon Cinnamon Date Cous-Cous with preserved cucumbers, olive flatbreads, and cheese stuffed picholine olives. This was probably the least attractive of the dishes, but the flavor combinations were superb. It was very unique and tasty.Probably the most popular dish at Pure Food and Wine, and one I had enjoyed in the past, is the Zucchini and Local Hothouse Tomato Lasagna with basil pistachio pesto, sun-dried tomato sauce, and pinoli ricotta. Thinly cut pieces of zucchini take the place of pasta, a unique vegetarian take on this Italian staple. This dish is refreshing, a work of art, and ingenious.You don’t want to miss out on dessert at Pure Food and Wine either. The Trio of Dark Chocolate Coated Indian Spiced Ice Cream Treats, which came with a chocolate cardamom coconut ice cream cone, pistachio gelato ice cream sandwich, and a chai tea creamsicle, was amazing! Like most of the food here, it was addictive and mind-blowing! (They don’t use dairy- the ice cream is made of coconut- I still cannot believe it!)Pure Food and Wine is just like the Zucchini Lasagna dish: ingenious and refreshing. After every meal I eat here I feel rejuvenated, energized, refreshed, and healthy. The food here is superb and it is obvious much time and care goes into preparing each dish. The front of the menu states “Organic ingredients and handcrafted flavors that rejuvenate the body, mind and planet” and I couldn’t agree more. Dining at Pure Food and Wine can be a life-changing experience, and what better time for a change than now?Pure Food and Wine54 Irving Place (at 17th St.)New York, NY 10003212-477-1010www.purefoodandwine.com

Wednesday night I went to Socarrat Paella Bar in Chelsea, a restaurant that specializes in--(drum roll please) paella! I like paella a lot, but don't really eat it often, and never had any memorable paella in my life. So I was hoping this restaurant would do this Spanish dish justice. I actually first went by myself to Socarrat last Saturday, but the host said that the paella is meant for two people, so I decided to come back with a friend. It is a narrow space with one long black communal bar for dining. We decided to order one of the tapas they had, for we were told the paella takes 35 minutes to make. We went with the fried artichokes ($9). I really enjoyed the flaky texture and the lightness to them, although I wished the flavor of the artichokes came out more.We decided to get the seafood paella ($23 a person), which came with chunks of fish, shrimp, cuttlefish, mussels, clams, squid, and scallops. I thought the seafood and the rice were well cooked and had a nice juiciness. Unfortunately the entire dish was extremely bland. Both my dining companion and myself thought the dish needed a lot of salt and some sort of kick to it. We were disappointed. Will I give this place another chance? Maybe. I would consider trying another one of their paellas, maybe one with chorizo, that would give the dish the needed kick. But for $23 a person, it had better not be bland. I want a good bang for my buck!Socarrat Paella Bar259 W. 19th St. (bet. 7th and 8th)New York, NY 10011212-462-1000

Tonight I went to the just opened Macao Trading Co. in Tribeca. This brand new restaurant comes to us from the team behind Employees Only, and celebrated chef David Waltuck, of Tribeca's Chanterelle. It is a two story space, with dining on the first floor. The second floor looks like an open storage space, but I was told by the hostess, it is decoration. The place actually resembles Employees Only a lot, except it's bigger and has a more Asian feel.I took a seat at the crowded bar and perused one of the most unique menus I have ever seen. Most of the dishes were offered in either a Chinese or Portugese style, which are the flavors of Macao, an area and cuisine I am not familiar with at all. I was very excited for this new culinary adventure.The guy sitting next to me had a bowl of ribs that looked great, so I ordered that. The dish was Berkshire Pork Ribs, Portuguese style, braised with olives and prunes ($17). The dish was interesting. The sauce had a sweet and olive flavor to it, (there were in fact olives in the sauce,) and was unlike anything I had ever tasted before. I personally would have preferred some sort of spicy kick to it, but that is just my preference. The meat was tender, and fell off the bones nicely. The dish did not blow my mind, but it was fine.I also ordered the Chinese style meatballs, which they call Pearl Balls ($8). These were three huge rice balls filled with pork. Again, this was a unique dish for me, and I thought the balls were great! They were actually the perfect complement to my Tsingtao beer.Luckily for me the gals next to me were full and let me try two of their dishes too! I tried a little bit of their Portugese style meatball, which was a lamb ball filled with cheese ($8), and also one Chinese style shrimp in a crispy wrapper ($9). The meatball was fine, came in a tomato sauce, and the addition of cheese was a nice touch. The shrimp had a great salty flavor to it, which also went well with my beer.In fact, I think the Macao Trading Co. is the perfect place to come for great drinks, and unique and tasty food. I do not know any other restaurant in NYC serving this type of fare. This is not only a wonderful addition to the Tribeca neighborhood, but to all of New York City.Macao Trading Co.311 Church St.New York, NY 10013212-431-8750www.macaonyc.com

Oh Wow! Sorry to hear that. I sat at the bar, so did not have to deal with any management. Although my main concern is the food, service is obviously a huge part of the dining experience. I would not tolerate any rudeness either! Here's to some more great meals with better service!!-NYC FOODIE:)

We had good food but at a price: lousy attitude. The manager was one of the rudest people I've come across in the food service industry in years. In this economy, kindness goes pretty far. Without it, neither I nor my guest will ever return.

I hadn't been to The Little Owl since 2006 (see my review on this site) and the two or three times I had been, I dined alone. I went last night, this time with the perfect dining companion. I have to tell you that The Little Owl has not missed a beat. It is still cozy, quaint, homey, romantic, and the perfect restaurant! We started with the gravy meatball sliders ($10) and the goat's cheese gnocchi ($14). The sliders, made with beef, pork, veal and pecorino, were honestly orgasmic! I loved the addition of pecorino, which gave the meat an extra little zing. These sliders are one of my top favorite dishes in all of NYC! The gnocchi was quite excellent as well. It came with ratatouille, rosemary braised lamb, and natural jus. The gnocchi was cooked perfectly and it was like popping little pillows of deliciousness into your mouth!For entrees we had the roasted halibut ($23) and the potato wrapped scallops ($28). The roasted halibut came with chive mashed potatoes and lemon creme fraiche. It was cooked perfectly with crispy skin on top, and tender meat underneath. The chive mashed potatoes were the perfect complement to the fish. I wouldn't say it was mindblowing, but it was a really nice dish. What was mindblowing was the potato wrapped scallops, which came with spinach, capers and lemon-leek brown butter. This may be the best scallop dish I have ever had! The scallops were fresh, clean, sleek and absolutely perfect. The potato wrap gave the scallops the perfect touch of crispiness and the bed of spinach was the perfect complement. The lemon-leek brown butter was soothing and delicious!For dessert we had the chocolate cake with pecans and espresso gelato ($7) and the raspberry beignets with nutella ($7). The chocolate cake was cliched but fine. The beignets were great. Doughy, chewy, addictive, and the perfect ending to a fantastic meal.So for one of NYC's best all around restaurants, The Little Owl is still the place to be.The Little Owl90 Bedford St. (at Grove)New York, NY 10014212-741-4695www.thelittleowlnyc.com

***CONTENT
Tonight I decided it was too long since I had been to a steak house so I decided to hit up Benjamin Steakhouse in Midtown. The chef, Arturo Mcleod, spent 20 years at Peter Luger's, so he knows his steak. The restaurant, adjacent to the Dylan Hotel and formerly Britney Spears' flop NYLA, is a magnificent space. It is elegant and regal, with soaring ceilings two stories high. The centerpiece of the main dining room is a huge working fireplace, which is turned on during the Winter. That is exactly where I sat, like a king on his throne.I started off with three appetizers; Lump Crab Cake ($19.95), Canadian Bacon, Extra Thick ($3 a slice), and the Caesar Salad ($11.95).The Canadian Bacon was truly extra thick, had a wonderful glaze on it, and was quite delicious.The Caesar Salad was perfect. The lettuce was fresh and crisp, and the dressing had a slight flavor of anchovies, which I loved. It was definitely one of the best Caesar salads I have encountered.The Lump Crab Cakes were great as well. I hate crab cakes that are made with mostly breading, and the breading on these crab cakes was almost non-existent, just the way I like it!For my main course I wanted to get a Porterhouse, and they only had a Porterhouse for 2 ($82.95), so I went with it! (Please note I planned on taking home leftovers, for I knew there was no way I could consume all this food in one sitting!) The Porterhouse came out on a sizzling platter and it was a great presentation. The meat was perfectly cooked medium as I requested and had a great char to it. I will tell you this was by far the best steak experience of my life. It was a great and wonderful steak. Benjamin Steakhouse also makes its own steak sauce, which I added at times to give the meat an extra little sweet tang.Of course to really get the true steak house experience I ordered a side of Creamed Spinach ($8.95) and the German Potatoes ($11.95). Both were great. I loved the kick of garlic to the spinach and the slightly burnt top to the potatoes.Benjamin Steakhouse is the quintessential steak house. If I were to picture what a steak house is and should be, Benjamin Steakhouse would be it. The staff was very attentive too, placing more steak and creamed spinach on my plate for me at times! (Of course, I was one of the few diners there, for it was an early dinner, but they were still great.) In fact, I entertained many of them with my magic throughout the meal! So if you need to fill that steak craving and want to feel like a King, Benjamin Steakhouse will satisfy all your desires.Benjamin Steakhouse52 East 41st (bet.

The NYC FOODIE dish of the week is the Fried Chicken \"Blue Ribbon Style\" ($24.50) hailing from Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill located in the 6 Columbus Hotel.I finally had this dish after having heard about it several times since the place opened and is definitely worth all the hype. It is coated with matzo meal and flour and accompanied with a side of wasabi honey sauce giving the meat the perfect sweet kick it deserves. The $24.50 price tag is a tad steep for any fried chicken dish, but the crispiness, tenderness, and flavors of the chicken made me forget the price.So for a great unique take on fried chicken, stop by Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill and thank me later.Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill308 W. 58th St. (bet. 8th and 9th)New York, NY 10019212-397-0404www.blueribbonrestaurants.com

A friend of mine took me out to Bar Bao, the new restaurant on the Upper West Side, formerly Rain. The redesigned space looks great; it's very large and very comfortable. The Vietnamese menu helmed by Michael Huynh (Bao 111, Bao Noodles) looks great... on paper. We ordered Daikon Duck Hash ($12), Chili Garlic Tiger Shrimp ($12), Berkshire Pork Belly ($22), Crispy Whole Red Snapper ($27) and Vermicelli Noodles ($14). Also, two desserts, not even worth mentioning.None of the dishes impressed me. The whole time during our dinner I could not help but think about all those Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown with better, more flavorful food, for half the price! This is not a good bang for your buck. My recommendation is you can come for a drink or two if you live in the neighborhood, but then head to Chinatown to fill your Vietnamese food cravings.Bar Bao100 W. 82nd St. (at Columbus Ave)New York, NY 10024

NYC Foodette: Candle 79

***CONTENT
Dear NYC Foodie lovers,I am NYC Foodette, NYC Foodie's younger sister. Last night I went to Candle 79 with our other sister (no relation to the film The Other Sister). Believe it or not, I had wanted to check it out even before Frank Bruni's one-star review since I have recently (a little over 6 months ago) become a \"pescatarian\" with vegan tendencies. This means I do not eat any meat that comes from land animals and I try to avoid all dairy products as much as possible, but I do eat a fair amout of seafood, especially sushi. Judgement expected and accepted...Ok, onto the meal. We shared everything, as usual - even the drink, not as usual (both the sharing of it and the fact that it was non-alcoholic). Our sweet, vegan waiter Christopher had the bartender conveniently split into two glasses the Antioxidant Potion: concord grape, pomegranate, cranberry, lemon, sparkling water ($7). This drink was right up my alley - bold flavors, refreshing, and just the right amount of tartness. This was one of about 10 juicy mixtures, and there are also around 8 delicious-seeming cocktails that I would like to try when it's not a school night (no, I'm not a student, but old sayings die hard). We were then served our starter and our salad simultaneously. We had the Wild Mushroom and Spinach Pate served with crostini, roasted garlic bulb and balsamic reduction ($14) and the Beet Salad with mache, arugula, apples, baby carrots, haricots verts, toasted pecans and a vanilla-fig dressing. The salad was also supposed to come with fennel, but we asked them not to add it as neither my sister nor I is a fan of the anise-flavored plant. The fennel-less salad was very tasty; it was sweet and light, and the perfect complement to our other dish. The pate was much more filling than I would have expected, and the balance of spinach and mushroom was perfect. I must admit, however, that what attracted me most on the plate was the roasted garlic bulb. I probably shouldn't admit this in a public forum, but when we had finished the rest of the dish, I picked up the near-empty garlic clove and ate every last drop I could extract without looking like a complete neanderthal (no offense, Geico dudes).By the time our entree arrived (right after we finished our previous course) I was pretty full, but was still excited to try our next dish: Porcini Crusted Tofu with garlic mashed potatoes, sauteed spinach and cabernet-wild mushroom sauce ($22). In case you couldn't tell, my sister and I are really into spinach and mushrooms, and they were both great in this dish. The most prevalent flavor was the mushrooms, and those found in the sauce were some of the best I've had. The sauce was generously poured over the tofu, which was sliced for easy sharing and eating and cooked perfectly. It was a great dish, and something I definitely can't cook at home.At this point the level of fullness was ridiculous, but who can resist vegan dessert? We went for the Live Key Lime Tart with nut granola crust, key-lime cashew cream and huckleberry ice cream ($13). A few of the items on the menu say \"live\" and this just means it's a completely raw dish. I think I would have enjoyed the tart a bit more had I had a bit more room in my stomach, but it was a pleasant way to end the meal. I would have preferred the \"custard\" to be a bit more tart, but the huckleberry ice cream (magically dairy-free) made up for it.You know how sometimes you feel like you're dreaming even though it's the middle of the day and you are clearly awake? Well by the end of the meal that's how I felt, but more intensely than I ever have. Perhaps it was something in the wild mushrooms... I left feeling totally satisfied, slightly stoned, and very excited for my next adventure at this diner- and planet-friendly haven.Candle 79154 E 79th StreetNew York, NY 10075(212) 537-7179

TABLE FOR ONE: FERGUSSTOCK AT THE SPOTTED PIG

***CONTENT
Last night I attended \"FergusStock\" at The Spotted Pig. Fergus Henderson is one of London's most acclaimed chefs (St. John restaurant), and when I heard he would be a guest chef at The Spotted Pig last night, I knew I needed to take advantage of this culinary opportunity. Mr. Henderson is known for his use of offal (the internal organs of a butchered animal) and what has been called \"nose to tail\" eating, which not everyone is a fan of, but as someone who likes to experiment, I was game!There was a two and a half hour wait for a table for one, but luckily after grabbing a beer at the upstairs bar (and running into chef/Food Network star Anne Burrell), I found a lone seat at the downstairs bar. Even more luckily for me, that seat was next to another lone diner who ordered the Pot-Roast Half Pig's Head (for 2). The Pig's Head looked amazing and obviously too large for one, and this chap (Alex from London) who ordered it for himself was super kind and offered to share the dish with me!The Pig's Head was actually amazing! The meat was juicy and tender and melted in my mouth. The flavors were salty and sweet, but so perfectly balanced and executed, that it was truly divine. After my first bite, I honestly got a tear in my eye - it was that good. A culinary dream come true! The skin was crisp to perfection, and Alex let me have the best part: the crispy pig's ear - phenomenal!My new dining partner, who hailed from London and is a regular at Mr. Henderson's restaurant St. John, recommended I order the Ox Tongue And Bread with Green Sauce as well as the Deviled Kidney on Toast. And I ordered just that.The Ox Tongue dish was simple and refreshing. It was basically a salad of greens with ox tongue and bread (which looked and tasted like soft croutons.) I didn't really see any green sauce, but whatever sauce was on the dish was tangy and nice.The Deviled Kidney on Toast was mindblowing! Now, I'm not a huge kidney eater (who is?), but this dish which consisted of around 5 lamb kidneys on toast, was phenomenal. I'm not exactly sure how they were cooked or what was in the sauce, but it was truly delicious. It must have been some sort of red wine or marsala sauce in combination with some cayenne pepper to give the kidneys the perfect kick and sweetness they deserved. Again, I think I had another tear in my eye after my first bite.As I expected, the place was filled with other note-worthy chefs wanting to feast on this unique and great food. Momofuku empire king David Chang walked in (Mr. Henderson will be cooking at Momofuku Noodle Bar tonight), as well as Barbuto's Jonathan Waxman, to name a few.Unfortunately, Fergus Henderson only stops by The Spotted Pig to cook once a year. So, for \"nose to tail\" eating at its finest, purchase a ticket to London, or mark your calendar now for his next visit.The Spotted Pig314 W. 11th St. (at Greenwich St.)New York, NY 10014212-620-0393www.thespottedpig.com

The NYC FOODIE dish of the week is Socca and eggs ($12.50) hailing from the really good Hells Kitchen restaurant Nizza.Socca is a crispy chickpea flour pancake. At Nizza they bake it in a brick oven and add swiss chard, fontina, onions, and top it with two eggs.I had this two nights ago and it was phenomenal! Words can hardly describe the feeling I had when I put in my mouth this crispy and gooey pancake of deliciousness!Just go and try it for yourself. Trust me, it'll make your night.Nizza630 9th Ave (bet. 44th and 45th)New York, NY 10036212-956-1800www.nizzanyc.com

Thursday night my family and I went out for my sister's birthday to the Spanish tapas restaurant Mercat. I had been wanting to go to Mercat since it opened and was excited for this culinary adventure. I love tapas (of all cuisines) because it gives you the opportunity to try a little bit of everything.The restaurant is rustic and sexy, perfect for a date, or dinner with the fam! There is a bar up front, an open wine cellar on the second floor, an open kitchen in the back, and more tables in a downstairs room with another bar.We ordered a lot of the dishes including Patates Bravas ($8), Croquetas De Gamba ($8), Mojama Amb Ametlles ($8), Boquerons ($9), Fideus Negres Amb Alioli ($17), Pop ($13), Bacalla ($15), Col de Brusseles ($9), and Remolatxa ($9).The Patates Bravas, which are potatoes with garlic and spicy sauce found on many tapas menus around NYC, were up there with the best I've had and were super tasty!The Croquetas De Gamba, filled with shrimp and spinach, as well as the Mojama Amb Ametelles (cured tuna loin with almonds), and the Boquerons (anchovies with Guinadilla peppers and Arbequina olives) were all great little nibbles to have with some nice wine.One of my favorite dishes of the night was the Fideus Negres Amb Alioli, which is short noodles with Sepia (cuttlefish) in its ink. The Sepia ink made the noodles black and I thought the texture was slightly chewy, but in a unique and good way! I hadn't experienced a dish like it before.I also enjoyed the Bacalla a lot. It was line caught cod with artichokes, bacon, and hazelnut mayonnaise. The bacon was delicious and the hazelnut mayonnaise was a great complement to the juicy and tender fish with crisp skin.Brussel Sprouts have been making a comeback in the last few years in NYC, and the ones at Mercat do not disappoint. Here they are served with chestnuts and romesco and they are great.The Pop (cold octopus salad with arugula, fingerling potatoes, and salsa verde) as well as the Remolatxa (market beets, roasted red onion, and La Peral -a blue cheese) were both enjoyable dishes too. I appreciated the thickly cut pieces of octopus from the Pop, and thought the addition of the La Peral to the beets was the perfect complement.For dessert we had the churros with chocolate sauce, which were fine, but didn't blow my mind. We also had vanilla ice cream with apple compote, which was delicious. I'm usually not a fan of anything apple, but the compote went really well with the vanilla ice cream and was a great ending to a great meal.So if you are a fan of Spanish tapas and wine, and like to try a little bit of everything, bring a date, or bring your fam, and bring them to Mercat.Mercat45 Bond St.New York, NY 10012212-529-8600www.mercatnyc.com

I'm not a huge fan of hot dogs, but when I saw that this new spot in the West Village had hot dogs topped with Korean food, such as bulgogi, (Korean marinated bbq beef), I was intrigued. I love Korean food.So last night I had one of their all beef dogs topped with the bulgogi. And I have to tell you, it was really, really, really good. The hot dog was juicy, the bulgogi was sweet and tasty, and since I requested it spicy, there was a great kick to it. At first glance of the price of $4.99, I thought that was a tad pricey for a hot dog, but in retrospect it is a pretty good bang for your buck. You can also get a hot dog with another Korean specialty called Dak-Kalbi, which is a grilled chicken sausage with spicy marinated chicken on top. I think I'll stop by and try that next time. They also have waffles, frozen yogurt, and of course, coffee.So, for a unique hot dog experience New York Hot Dog & Coffee hits the spot!New York Hot Dog & Coffee245 Bleecker St. (at Leroy St.)New York, NY 10014

***CONTENT
Saturday afternoon I walked down to the East Village to check out Porchetta, a new spot opened by Sara Jenkins that specializes in one thing- porchetta. Porchetta is \"roasted pork with crispy skin, highly seasoned with aromatic herbs and spices, garlic, sage, rosemary and wild fennel pollen\" (from Porchetta's website).When I arrived, there was a line out the door. I had no idea that many people were interested in a pork sandwich! The place is a small storefront, mainly for take-out, with a couple of seats, but the place was so crowded with people waiting for their orders, it would have been uncomfortable to eat in.Besides the porchetta, the menu offers some sides of beans and greens and roasted potatoes with \"burnt ends\", as well as a mozzarella sandwich. You can order the porchetta in a sandwich or on a plate that comes with the beans and the greens. I went with the sandwich, which comes on a crispy Sullivan St. Bakery ciabatta roll ($9). I also got a side of the roasted potatoes with \"burnt ends\" ($5).I took my sandwich to Tompkins Square Park and when I opened it, my first reaction was that it looked small for $9. But, when I finished it, it was just the right size for that pork is filling. The pork was moist and juicy, and the ciabatta roll was great. I can say that it was the best pork sandwich I've ever had, but then again, I probably have only eaten three pork sandwiches in my life. I also loved the side of the roasted potatoes mixed with \"burnt ends\", the \"ends\" being the crispy fattiness from the porchetta.So if you are craving a pork sandwich in NYC definitely head down to Porchetta in the East Village.Porchetta110 East 7th St. (bet. 1st ave and Ave A)New York, NY 10009

Table For One: Perbacco

***CONTENT
Last night I went to a great Italian spot in the East Village called Perbacco. I have walked by Perbacco many times and thought nothing of it. I recently read a glowing 2-star review of it by Frank Bruni in the NY Times, so I wanted to check it out.It's a small, rustic looking spot, with brick walls, typical of the many other small Italian restaurants that line the blocks of the East Village.I started my meal with their Parmigiano cheese creme brulee served with a reduction of balsamic vinegar ($9.95). Now, I've had plenty of creme brulees in my life, but this was the most unique. I thought the carmelized brown sugar and the balsamic vinegar perfectly balanced the sharpness of the cheese, and it was the perfect little starter.For my entree I had a special ravioli filled with porcini mushrooms, shrimp and ricotta ($14.95). The plate came out with six pinkish-colored ravioli uniformly positioned, with crushed tomatoes on the side drizzled with extra virgin olive oil. My waiter then sprinkled on top, not parmesan cheese, but what the chef (Simone Bonelli) calls tomato bottarga, which is oven-roasted tomato skin (which looked like red parmesan cheese.) The ravioli were very delicate and perfectly cooked al dente. The shrimp and mushroom flavors were very subtle, yet I thought the combination worked well and tasted great. It seems the chef is deconstructing tomato sauce, with the crushed tomatoes on the side, and with the sprinkling of the tomato bottarga. Not only does this make the dish playful, but it allows the eater to control how much \"tomatoness\" he or she wants with the pasta. I think this is ingenius and I loved the dish!For dessert I had the Cioccolato Variabile ($12.95) which was four different interpretations and tastes of chocolate. For me it consisted of Bon Bon Frizzante which is a sparkling dark chocolate bon bon filled with ginger white chocolate mouse and raspberry. Mediterraneo which is a white chocolate cylinder filled with white chocolate mousse, caper, coffee, oregano over an olive oil orange and pistachio biscuit. Cappuccino Alla Canella which is dark chocolate cream brulee topped with soft picked whipped cinnamon cream. And finally Tartufo-Truffle, two dark chocolate truffles woth scorzone truffle.All four came out on a plate. The Mediterraneo blew my mind the most for I've never had those flavor combinations before, which all worked together harmoniously and it was fantastic!I should also mention that the service was great too. My Italian waiter Sasha was jolly and positive which always makes for a better meal. He chose some great wines for me too.Perbacco is a great Italian spot. One of the best things about Perbacco is that the most expensive dish is $22.95, so it truly is a great bang for your buck. The menu is extensive, and I was actually upset that I was alone, for I wanted to try many more of their dishes. In fact, I plan on going back tonight with my family to do just that! So for a great and unique Italian meal, Perbacco is the perfect little spot. Perbacco234 East 4th Street (bet. Ave A and Ave B)New York, NY 10009

***CONTENT
I don't normally write about bars or lounges I go to in NYC, but Wednesday night I went to a lounge that blew my mind; Apotheke.Apotheke is a new lounge that opened up on Doyers Street in Chinatown, which I think is the coolest street in NYC. The theme of Apotheke is 17th Century Austrian apothecary, and it's a sexy spot. There are very unique details to the design and you can tell a lot of hard work and thought went into the space.It's a large L-shaped space with a huge marble bar lit up in the back, but with no stools. There are some really nice couches along the walls, and the place is designed so that all seats are able to have a view of the bar and \"magic\" being created behind it.Head mixologist and co-owner Albert Trummer leads a savvy team of mixologists who are more like bar chefs who have a wide-array of cocktail recipes up their sleeves.I had a bunch of cocktails created by one of the mixologists, who I told what kind of alcohol I like or what type of drink I was in the mood for, and he created some wonderful results.Apotheke is a hidden gem (there is no sign for it, it hides behind a sign that says \"Golden Flower Restaurant\" )on a oool street, with a hip crowd. So for great cocktails in NYC's coolest lounge Apotheke is the place for you.Apotheke9 Doyers St.New York, NY 10013

***CONTENT
Tonight I decided to go to a new South African restaurant in NYC called Braai. I have never had South African cuisine before so I was excited for this culinary experience.Braai is a very nice looking restaurant with dark lighting and bamboo ceilings; reminiscent of a sexy hut.I ordered an Ostrich dish ($12) from a section of the menu called \"Mini-Sosaties\" which are \"traditional skewered meats marinated overnight in Cape Malay spices complimented by a selection of sambals (signature condiment sides)\". The ostrich was succulent, juicy, and great. The sambals consisted of a cucumber-yogurt dill, banana-coconut, mango-coriander salsa, mango chutney and apricot chutney. They were very authnentic and each had a distinct flavor which were perfect compliments to the meat as well as the accompanying bread basket. The bread basket came with a side of olive olive oil and a mix of cayenne and crushed peanuts which I really enjoyed.I also ordered a side called Chakalaka ($5) which is a stewed bean salad. It had a lot of heat to it and I actually started sweating. It was powerful, flavorful, and fantastic.Braai is definitely a welcome restaurant not only to the Theater district and Hells Kitchen, but to all of New York City. I do not know any other restaurant doing this type of cuisine. So, for a great culinary experience in a sexy environment, Braai is the perfect spot. Not only before a Broadway show, but for any time in your life.(Note-the owners of Braai also own Xai Xai on the same block, a sexy South African wine bar)Braai329 West 51st St. (bet. 8th and 9th)New York, NY 10018

Friday night I met my sister and her friends at Landmarc in the Time Warner Center. I have been to Landmarc in Tribeca which I like a lot and wrote about it for this site. I had heard mixed reviews of Landmarc at the Time Warner Center, but was eager to check it out.After my sister left, I went to the bar and ordered the Landmarc hamburger and fries ($15). I wanted to add cheese ($2) to the burger and took the bartender's suggestion and went with smoked mozzarella.Ladies and gentleman the hamburger at Landmarc at the Time Warner Center is NYC's best hamburger! It is the best hamburger I have ever had, and in fact cannot stop thinking about it! It was perfectly cooked medium (as I asked,) thick and juicy. But, what stood out about this burger is that there was some sort of seasoning in it, maybe it was just salt and pepper, I'm not sure, but I could taste it and it tasted great! The addition of the smoked mozzarella was perfect too. I added onions, lettuce, and pickle to it and it all tasted amazing! I will say that the fries were nice and crispy but underseasoned and definitely needed the addition of salt and pepper.So, for the best hamburger in NYC definitely stop by Landmarc at the Time Warner Center!Landmarc (At The Time Warner Center)10 Columbus Circle (3rd Floor)New York, NY 10019

Table For One: Satsko

***CONTENT
Last Thursday I had the honor of being invited to a sake tasting at Satsko in the Lower East Side, a small Japanese Sake Bar/Restaurant. The restaurant was quite empty except for two tables of girls who looked like they were regular watchers of \"Sex and the City\". The fact that Satsko was empty on a Thursday night was surprising to me, especially after my tasting and meal there, for Satsko is a wonderful hidden treasure.I was brought 6 shots of different sake by Satsko, (who is the gracious owner,) and she educated me on all of them. I've had sake many times before, but it was great to learn about and taste the differences in each type.I was then brought out a tasting plate of food which was great! There was beef wrapped around scallions, basically a take on beef negimaki, which sat on wasabi mashed potatoes. The wasabi mashed potatoes were the perfect compliment to the beef and tasted great.There were a few pieces of yellowtail sushi wrapped with radish, and had kelp and cilantro inside as well. This was so unique, and the textures and flavors were wonderful!There was a nice little salad on the side with yuzu, which gave it the perfect acidity.There was one piece of pressed sushi which consisted of three layers; salmon and eel on top, and spicy tuna in the middle. I've never had this type of sushi before, but all the layers worked well with each other.I also enjoyed some thinly sliced pieces of avocado that came on the plate.After having this unique, colorful, and wonderful tasting plate I was still a little hungry (and slightly buzzed) so Satsko recommended I try one of their signature dishes; Asian Chicken. I'm so glad she recommended this dish for it was amazing. Def. the perfect dish for when you are a little buzzed or drunk, and great when you are sober as well! The dish is marinated deep fried wings and drumsticks (twice-fried) and accompanied by a delicious chipotle sauce. I think double-frying the chicken is ingenius and I fell in love with the dish!Satsko is a great laid-back spot perfect for grabbing small Japanese bites and a wide-array of sakes. They actually have different events each day of the week, including a sake tasting, just like the one I had, every Wednesday for $35 a person. I would recommend going to Satsko though any day of the week for a great time and great food.Satsko245 Eldridge Street (off of Houston)New York, 10002(Note: There is another Satsko located in the East Village at 202 East 7th St.)

Table For One: Babbo

***CONTENT
Last night I finally made it to Babbo, one of New York City's top Italian restaurants. Babbo is one of the toughest reservations to get in town, which was made clear to me when I arrived at 11pm to a fully packed restaurant-on a Monday! I was finally seated at a table at 11:15, in between two couples that kept staring at me. (Either they were curious who this chap was dining alone, or recognized me as the Superstar I am- they did not ask for an autograph or picture) I would have preferred to be seated at the bar, but that was packed as well. Before the meal started I was brought a plate of marinated chickpeas on a small piece of toast. I enjoyed this pre-meal nibble for it was something I never had, and I thought it was a nice touch. I was also brought one piece of bread with no butter, which was fine. I was surprised for I expected a much better bread selection at a restaurant of this caliber. It's not that it was bad, but it was nothing special at all.For my first course I had the Warm Lamb’s Tongue Vinaigrette with Chanterelles and a 3-Minute Egg ($13). I was instructed by the runner to crack the egg which lay on top of the dish and use the yolk as the dressing. The dish was great. After just my first bite I said \"Wow\" out loud. There was something very eloquent yet simple about all the flavors.For my entree I went with the Beef Cheek Ravioli with Crushed Squab Liver and Black Truffles ($23). The runner shaved some fresh Pecorino Romano on top as well. I had heard about this dish before so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you-it's worth the hype. Just might have been the best ravioli of my life. I would describe this dish, as well as my starter, as \"delicately delicious\". Each ravioli, triangle in shape, was perfectly cooked. The meat inside was delicious and the addition of the black truffles was the perfect compliment. I was in awe of how such a rich dish seemed so light, and it was all wonderful.For dessert I had the Chocolate Hazelnut Cake with Orange Sauce and Hazelnut Gelato ($12). I love hazelnut and chocolate so I could not resist this dish. It was a really nice dessert. It wasn't overly sweet and was the perfect ending to a great meal.I can now tell you from experience that Babbo is one of New York City's top Italian restaurants. I cannot wait to go back! So for amazing Italian food, definitely start calling now for a reservation at Babbo.Babbo 110 Waverly Place (bet. 6th Ave and Macdougal)New York, NY 10011

Last week I went to Cabrito, a Mexican spot that replaced the ill-conceived Barfry on Carmine St. in the West Village. I sat at the bar and ordered the shrimp and tamarind ceviche starter and the Cabrito entree.The shrimp and tamarind ceviche ($11) came with tamarind water, red onion, avocado,serrano chiles, and pepitas. The pepitas added the perfect crunch to the dish as well. I loved this starter. I thought the dish was refreshing and was perfectly balanced with heat and sweetness. It was a great way to start the meal.My Cabrito entree ($23) was very good as well. I figured I should try the dish the restaurant was named after which would give me good insight in seeing what this spot was all about. The Cabrito is sour orange and chili rubbed goat which is slow roasted and served chopped with salsa borracha and warm flour tortillas. You make the tortilla yourself putting as much goat and salsa as you want in each tortilla. A side of crema (a lighter version of sour cream) accompanies the dish as well. I thought the flavor of the goat was wonderful and unique. I was not a fan of the taste of the salsa and the crema though. The flavor of the goat needed no additions.Cabrito brings unique authentic Mexican flavors to the West Village and is definitely a welcome addition.Cabrito50 Carmine St.(between Bedford and Bleeker)New York, NY 10012

Last weekend I went to a Spanish tapas restaurant I have been wanting to go to for a while; Casa Mono. It was conceived by chef Andy Nusser and is one of Mario Batali's restaurants as well, so I expected a high quality experience. The restaurant is not huge. It's a small box of a restaurant with a bar counter overlooking an open kitchen as well as a real bar in the back. I took a seat by the bar at the open kitchen and was excited to have this dinner and a show.I ordered a special Langoustine entree ($18), a Duck Egg entree ($16), as well as a Cuarto of a nice Spanish wine called Vinos Pinol ($16).The Langoustine entree came over a bed of some greens and fava beans, and drizzled with a nice helping of olive oil. It basically was a really lovely salad which I enjoyed immensely for it was simple and clean, yet tasted good. I will say that it wasn't easy getting all the meat out of the two langoustines, but the meat I did get out was tender and juicy.My Duck Egg entree came with Mojama and potatoes. The plate came out with the duck egg resting neatly on a bed of the potatoes, with the mojama (thin slices of tuna) balanced on the side. It was a very pretty plate that I was about to destruct. I cracked the yolk and let it run all over the plate and devoured everything. I truly loved this dish for everything complimented each other perfectly and was extremely delicious! I would say that this duck egg entree is one my favorite and most memorable dishes I have ever encountered.In fact after my dinner at Casa Mono, it has become one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I love the open kitchen, it really adds to the dining experience, and the atmosphere is very comfortable. Casa Mono has all the qualities of a great restaurant and I highly recommend it. Also note, since the place is not that large, they have wine bar right next door called Bar Jamon, which is also a great place to grab a glass of wine and a plate of ham. (My first time at Bar Jamon I had a great bottle of wine and Jimmy Fallon bought me a plate of ham!) Casa Mono52 Irving Place (at 17th Street)New York, NY 1003

Last week I decided to try a new \"burger\" spot that opened up in Hells Kitchen called Five Napkin Burger. This spot comes to us from Restaurateur Simon Oren who has a nice pedigree of restaurants (Nice Matin, Marseille, Nizza, etc.), so I looked forward to trying his new \"burger\" spot and to see if it competes with the best burgers in NYC.The place is large and open and there is plenty of room. I liked the design of the space (it used to be the restaurant Jezebel). I ordered the Bacon-Cheddar Burger ($14.95). The burger was very big (10oz), thick, and juicy and came with lettuce and tomato. Overall I thought it was a good burger.Unfortunately, it came with fries that were cold. Now, the restaurant had only been open for around a week, so I guess the kitchen still has some kinks, but if you are going to highlight your burger in the name of your restaurant, you better get the fries right too! Had the fries been warm I probably would have thought they were good, but to serve cold fries is a huge error, and I do hope they fix that mistake.Also, there is sushi on the menu! Some people might think of this as a nice option, I personally think the restaurant might have an identity issue. I didn't try the sushi, so it might be good. But I'm not going back until they heat up their fries.Five Napkin Burger630 Ninth Avenue (at 45th Street)New York, NY 10036

My younger sister and I had dinner at Bobby Flay's Bar Americain tonight. It was unimpressive.I started with the appetizer of Gulf Shrimp and Grits, Bacon and Green Onion ($15). It had an interesting flavor and tasted like nothing I have had before, but it didn't blow me away. I would never order the dish again.My sister had the appetizer of Grilled Oysters, Black Pepper-Tarragon Butter, Hot Chile Barbeque Sauce ($17). I tried two of the oysters and thought none of the flavors complimented each other. It was definitely one of the most weirdly flavored dishes I have had, and could quite possibly be up there as one of the worst dishes I have encountered at a restaurant.For my entree I had the \"plate of the day\" which today was Buttermilk Fried Chicken, Black Pepper Biscuits, Brookdale Farm's Honey Sauce ($29). This was an interesting fried chicken dish for the crispy skin had a kick and spiciness to it, which was nice, but the honey sauce also had a kick and spiciness to it, which gave the chicken a \"double-kick\". I thought this was redundant and unnecessary and for $29 way overpriced. The two accompanying biscuits were huge and tasted fine.My sister had the Fulton Fish Market Cioppino, Sour Dough Toast ($34). I tried some of the seafood in the tomato broth and it was fine.Bar Americain is a big and nice looking restaurant. But don't judge a book by it's cover. With uncomplimentary flavors on many of the dishes I had, I don't think I will be coming back.Bar Americain152 W. 52nd Street (between 6th and 7th Ave)New York, NY 10019

Blue Ribbon on Sullivan Street is my favorite late night dining destination in NYC. I've been there quite a few times and have always been impressed with the food. I was there last Friday night at 3:30AM and had the pleasure of having their Fried Chicken entree ($21) with mashed potatoes and collard greens for the second time. This is the best Fried Chicken dish I've had in my life. The skin is perfectly crispy and the meat is juicy, tender, and moist. The mashed potatoes come with a great gravy and the collard greens taste delicious. There is also an addition of a side of Mexican honey which is amazing and the perfect dipping sauce for the chicken.My previous time at Blue Ribbon I had their chicken wings appetizer ($9.50) which I loved as well. It actually came with a mini grill where you could grill the wings more if you wished, to get them a little more burnt. I loved this playful addition that I have never encountered before, and it makes dining fun, especially if you are drunk late at night!The prices at Blue Ribbon are not cheap, but the menu has a wide array of choices. From a raw bar to steak, they really have something for everyone.So, for a great meal at a late hour in NYC, Blue Ribbon is my top choice.Blue Ribbon97 Sullivan Street (bet.

On a warm April day my sister and I decided to go for a walk and spontaneously ended up walking over the Williamsburg Bridge to Brooklyn. We decided to check out a restaurant I have heard a lot about; Dressler.Dressler has a cool vibe to it. It is a mix of formal and hip, casual and chic. You would feel comfortable wearing a suit there or wearing a t-shirt and jeans, as I was in. This is Brooklyn Chic.We started with half a dozen fresh oysters that were really good. My sister had a tasty special duck appetizer. I started with a braised Berkshire pork belly appetizer that was out of this world! It was amazingly seasoned, crispy and tender. It reminded me of the great pork belly dish at the restaurant Tailor, and could easily give it a run for it's money. We shared the Roasted Free Range Chicken entree which came with Swiss chard, potato dumplings, white pearls, baby artichokes, and asparagus. Now, I normally never order chicken at a restaurant, but the waitress recommended it, so we pressed our luck. Let me tell you- it was the best chicken dish I have ever encountered. The skin was crispy, the meat was juicy and moist, and the vegetables were fresh and went well with the chicken. I had fantasies about that chicken dish for weeks after, and actually I still think about it.For dessert we shared the Bittersweet Chocolate Cream with English toffee, chocolate shortbread, and salted caramel ice cream. I loved the balance between sweet and salt in this dish. It was a fantastic dessert!I rarely head to Brooklyn, not because there aren't any good restaurants there, because there are, but because there are so many in Manhattan that I still need to try. I must tell say that I am so glad we made that spontaneous journey across the bridge, for we not only found a great Brooklyn restaurant, we found a great New York restaurant. It's worth the trip.Dressler149 BroadwayBrooklyn, NY 11211

Last night I went to Anita Lo's (Annisa) new (3 days old) restaurant Bar Q in the West Village. I walked in with no reservation at 10:30pm and the hostess asked if I had a reservation, I said, \"No.\" and she said, \"I can seat you.\" Of course she could seat me, the place was nearly empty, and anyways I'm Josh Beckerman, superstar Foodie/Magician.The place is very white and modern, separated into two rooms. The first room is the bar area/lounge with a few tables where you can grab a drink and a bite. The second room is the dining room with tables and circular booths where you can have a more formal or leisurely dinner. I like the layout of this restaurant a lot for if you need to wait for a table and want to grab a drink, or if you just want to grab a drink, there is plenty of room and lots of space, unlike many new restaurants where it can get cramped while waiting for a table. Also, there is an outdoor patio reminiscent of a greenhouse which will soon be open which I can forsee being very popular come Spring and Summer.The cuisine is Asian/BBQ which I am a fan of, and after perusing the menu I was more excited because all the dishes were right up my alley. After questioning my waiter Paul on his favorite dishes (he likes them all) I went with a starter of Spit Roasted Pork Belly and and entree of Stuffed Spareribs. Also had a nice Victory Pilsner with the meal.The Spit Roasted Pork Belly ($13) came with kimchee, takuan, and steamed buns, with a side of scallion tofu. The plate came with all the ingredients separated and basically it was a \"do-it-yourself\" sandwich. At first I thought it was lazy, like why are you making me do this myself, but after I put all the ingredients together, my mind changed. First off, this dish 100% reminded me of David Chang's famous Pork Buns he serves at Momofuku (they put it together for you there) but with different side ingredients. So, I put one of the two pieces of pork belly in one bun, added some takuan (pickled daikon) and some kimchee, then added the scallion tofu and had my first bite. This was an outstanding appetizer. I loved the crispiness of the skin of the pork belly, the crunch of the takuan, the spiciness of the kimchee, and the uniqueness of the scallion tofu. It all worked well together. I could not stop eating this bun, it was totally addictive. David Chang finally has some competition in the Pork Bun world. I never had scallion tofu before, but I thought it was a nice addition and worked well with everything in the bun. This is definitely one of my favorite appetizers of the year and I can't wait to come back for more!My entree of Stuffed Spareribs ($23) came with lemongrass bbq, peanuts and thai basil. The dish came out and looked more like a piece of meatloaf then a sparerib. I'm not sure why they have it pluralized either, for it seemed just like one rib to me, but there was a lot of meat, so I could be wrong. I did enjoy the dish though. The sauce was sweet with just a little hit of spiciness. I'm pretty much a fan of any dish that utilizes peanuts with sauces, but I would say that I think there was too much sauce on the dish and the peanut sauce was way too heavy. I think they should definitely lighten up on the sauce so the flavor of the meat can come through more, for the dish seemed to be overwelmed by the sauce.I definitely plan on coming back to Bar Q to try all the other dishes. So for unique Asian BBQ cuisine in a great space, Bar Q is the perfect West Village spot.Bar Q308 Bleeker St. (bet. Grove and 7th ave.)New York, NY 10014

Tuesday night I was in the Lower East Side and stumbled upon a new Vietnamese restaurant called Slurp. I thought the name was cool so I stopped in for a bite. I ordered the Grilled Pork Bun ($15) which came with grilled pork, rice vermicelli, celery, cilantro, cucumber, crushed peanuts and a side of fish sauce. I thought the dish was ok. It definitely needed some more flavor, in fact I had to ask for another sauce (sweet and spicy) after I finished the sweet fish sauce. I have had this dish at other Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown which tasted similar, but for half the price. I think this restaurant could be a welcome to the neighborhood, but the whole time I was there perusing the menu, I kept on being reminded about all those great authentic chinatown Vietnamese spots, with better food for a cheaper price. So, I guess if you are in the neighborhood and craving Vietnamese this could give you a decent fix, but for a better bang for your buck, I'd head downtown a little further to Chinatown.Slurp84 Stanton St. (at Orchard St.)New York, NY 10002

agreed 110%.I paid 17 bucks for the Ban Hoi dish - sirloin pieces on top of vermicelli, carrots, crushed peanuts, cilantro. Several of my friends ordered the same dish too. When the food came, we finished the dish in about 3 to 4 bites. We could not wait to get out of there and get a slice of pizza next door, so that we could fill ourselves up!Good food, but too pricey for what they offer. I can't see a business model such as this one that would be sustainable - customers aren't stupid. Customers will be reluctant to go back for a 2nd visit. - Tim

Last Friday night I had the pleasure and honor of being invited for a tasting at a new Midtown Japanese restaurant called Omido. Next door to the Ed Sullivan Theater where they film The Late Show with David Letterman isn't a location I'd consider a dining destination, but Friday night I uncovered a rare gem near Times Square. Brought to us by chef Eiji Takase (he was referred to me as Chef Taka) from the popular Sushi Samba restaurants, and a design by the hip AvroKO team, this is one of the top Japanese restaurants in NYC I have encountered.I walked in to a nearly empty restaurant at 6pm, which by the end of my meal I thought should have been more full due the high quality of the experience. The restaurant is an all dark wood square room, with a semi-hidden dining area in the back, and with a square sushi bar in the center. I actually like the layout of this restaurant a lot, for from any seat you can view the action going on at the sushi bar, so it truly is dinner and a show. The lighting is dark, and is highlighted by the typical AvroKO use of Edison light bulbs. This sleek environment set the mood as an escape from the busy and touristy outside Times Square area. Before my tasting menu began I tried the Shiso leaf Mojito, recommended to me by my knowledgable waitress Karen. Now, I am not a huge fan of the shiso leaf for it's flavor is just peculiar to me, but its addition actually worked really well in the mojito and it was a great start to the meal that was about to come.The first dish that came out was the Organic Mushroom Salad ($9.50). It came with citrus soy and butter, and was topped with some green seaweed to give it some color. I really enjoyed this appetizer. The mushrooms were fresh and the citrus soy and butter broth was very soothing. The use of citrus soy gave it just the touch of acidity it needed. This dish was a great way to open up my palate.(I should mention with this dish and with all the others, Omido's gracious host Christina paired for me sakes and wines that I actually did not write down, but all were perfectly paired with each dish and added to the overall amazing experience.)My next course was the \"Madai\" and Pink Grapefruit Sunomono ($14) which came with Japanese snapper and ume grapefruit vinaigrette. I loved the freshness of the snapper, and I thought the use of grapefruit was ingenious, for like the previous dish, the balance of acidity was perfect. Not only was this dish deliciously refreshing but there was so much color on the plate that it was truly a work of art.My next course was the Yellowtail with Shishito Pepper and yuzu garlic soy ($14.50). This was another winning appetizer. The yuzu garlic soy was simple and delicate, and a great compliment to the freshness of the pink yellowtail. Once again, Chef Taka not only plays with the flavors, but the balance of colors on the plate were extremely artistic.Next came the Temari roll ($19.50), one of Omido's \"Signature Rolls\" which consisted of a piece of tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sushi topped with fois gras on a plate with a red mirin soy. These three beautiful pieces of sushi took decadence to the next level. It was some of the richest and meatiest pieces of sushi I have had.An entree of Kakuni ($14) was served next which is braised short ribs with karashi mustard. Short ribs are common in many NYC restaurants and I have had my fair share of them, but I would have to say that these were the best I have ever encountered. They were extremely tender, juicy, and delicious, and they sat on a sweet sauce that was really tasty. The dish was topped with a little green cabbage that gave a nice crunch to it. On the side of the plate was a little of that karashi mustard for dipping which gave the ribs the perfect kick to it. This dish blew my mind.Next was the overly popular Japanese dish of Black Cod Miso ($15) served with a pink pickled ginger stick. The fish was fresh and the dish was simple. This was probably my least favorite dish of the night, for I thought it was pretty boring, although I thought the addition of that pickled ginger was a unique touch.And the food kept on coming. I was given a sample plate of Omido's assorted pieces of sushi and rolls. All was very fresh and some of the best sushi I have ever had. If I was just craving sushi I would not hesitate to come here for sushi alone.Finally came my last course which was the Mango Parfait dessert ($10), which came with a sake marscapone, fresh mango, cashews, and peanut candy. This was an amazing dessert. It was refreshing, had the perfect amount of sweetness, all sorts of plays with texture, and there was such a unique combination of flavors that I have never encountered. This dish blew my mind. It was the perfect ending to this transporting experience.Many tourists ask me where to dine when they visit the Times Square area, or before they see a show, and I would of course recommend Omido for some exhilerating Japanese food. But, I would also recommend Omido for anyone who lives in any part of NYC, for I believe Omido is not only a great Times Square restaurant, but it is a great NYC destination, warranting a trip to Midtown from wherever you are. So, for colorful, unique Japanese cuisine, Omido is one gem that sparkles.Omido1695 Broadway (bet. 53rd and 54th St.)New York, NY 10019

Having gone to The Smith last Friday night, and not being too impressed, I was inspired on Monday night to check out a restaurant with a similar name; Smith's.Smith's comes to us from two veterans of the NYC restaurant industry, Danny Abrams (The Red Cat, The Harrison, The Mermaid Inn) and Cindy Smith (Raouls), along with chef Pablo Romero (Bouley).I walked into the not too crowded restaurant around 7pm. There are a few tables up front near the window with a view of a quiet Macdougal Street. Then there is a narrow, white dining area reminiscent of a train car, with a mirrored ceiling. It is modern, but quaint. Past this dining area is the bar, with black and grey walls. It had a sexy vibe that made me think of the restaurant Allen & Delancey, but with a tad calmer feel.The bar was not crowded at all, so I picked a seat and the bartender Kylie was there to cater to all my culinary needs. After perusing the New American menu I decided on an appetizer of the Steamed Egg, a side of Sauteed Brussels Sprouts, and an entree of Roast Lamb Saddle. I also went with a half bottle of a Stephen Ross Pinot Noir 2006 ($32).The Steamed Egg ($8) came with creamy Anson Mills polenta and gorgonzola. This was a very unique dish. I'm not sure I have tasted anything like it. Kylie recommended I mix up the egg into it. I really enjoyed the saltiness and the creamy texture of the dish. It was simple, yet tasty.Kylie had recommended the Brussels Sprouts which were brought out at the same time as my Roast Lamb Saddle. The Sauteed Brussels Sprouts ($8) came with toasted almonds,and were some of the best Sprouts I haver ever encountered. I think Brussels Sprouts are making a comeback in the restaurant industry. We grew up hating them, but today chefs are coming out with some really tasty ways of serving them. Here at Smith's they serve a bowl of the leafs of the sprouts, with the addition of toasted almonds, giving it that perfect balance of texture.The Roast Lamb Saddle ($27) came with a tomato red pepper ragout, parmigiano puree, and pesto. The lamb was perfectly cooked and great. The parmigiano puree was a great compliment to the juicy lamb and I truly loved the dish. It was the perfect way to serve lamb.I decided to take a look at the dessert menu even though I was not too hungry and had started doing magic to people in the bar (what a surprise). The one dessert that caught my eye was the Warm Chocolate Brownie with peanut butter mousse and candied sauteed peanuts ($8). Once Kylie mentioned she had to have it once a day, I knew I was meant to order it. The dish came out while I was entertaining some cute girls at the bar, so I had to take bites in between each magic trick. But each bite was fantastic. The brownie was warm and not too sweet. Dipping a piece of brownie into the delicious and creamy peanut butter mousse was heavenly. And the addition of the candied sauteed peanuts gave the dish a sweet added crunch I enjoyed immensely. This was a great dessert.I had a great time at Smith's. The food is great and the people are nice. I will definitely be coming back to this Smith- it's the perfect West Village spot.

Friday night my sisters and I decided to eat dinner at The Smith in the East Village. The Smith comes to us from the team behind the restaurant Jane on Houston street. It should not be confused with Nevada Smith's, Smiths's or B. Smith's.I got to the restaurant early and decided to entertain the two hostesses and some waiters for 15 minutes with some amazing magic and comedy. After a good 15 minutes of high-energy entertainment my two sisters finally arrived and we were seated in a booth by the bar. The restaurant is a big large space (it used to be a Pizzeria Uno) with white tiled walls adorned with pictures of women that seem to be from the 1920's.The cuisine is American Brasserie and reminded me of a gourmet diner. I had been craving mac and cheese for a while so I ordered that appetizer along with an appetizer of Braised Bacon with red onion marmalade. My older sister ordered the Lamb Schnitzel and my younger sister got the Skate. We ordered the Fried Calamari for the table.The Fried Calamari ($9) came Brooklyn Style, meaning it was topped with marinara sauce. It was fine, but nothing special. My Mac + Cheese ($10) was cheesy with a nice crisp to it. I enjoy a little meat in my mac and cheese, that is why I ordered the Braised Bacon with red onion marmalade ($9). I thought there was way too much red onion marmalade with the bacon, and it pretty much drowned the bacon with it's sweetness and killed all the bacon flavor which was upsetting. I decided to dump the bacon into my mac and cheese, hoping this \"create my own dish\" epiphany would somehow turn out an amazing flavorful dish, but alas, it was just a bacon drowned in red onion marmalade, mixed with mac and cheese flavor.My older sister did not have much luck with her Lamb Shnitzel ($17) which came with a parmesan crust, smashed potatoes and lemon. Grant it, I only took one bite of it, and that bite consisted of a tough, dry, and flavorless piece of meat. My sister who ate more of the dish stated she was not too happy with it either.My younger sister really enjoyed her Skate ($16) which came with cauliflower and caper brown butter. I tried one piece of it and although it was nice, simple, and juicy, it bored me.The dessert menu at The Smith consists of different types of Sundaes. We went with the Birthday Cake and Chocolate Peanut Butter Sundaes. They were fun and fine.I think The Smith is an ok place if you are in college and looking for a decent bite to eat. NYU dorms are right around the corner. But, you must order wisely. When I think of The Smith, the first word that comes to mind is \"Fun\"-not \"Food\". It could be a fun place to grab some drinks if you are in the neighborhood.The Smith55 3rd Avenue (between 10th and 11th St)New York, NY 10003

Last night my roommate and I decided to grab a burger at JG Melon on the Upper East Side. I have heard from different people that the burger at JG Melon was one of the best in NYC and I was excited to try it out.When you think of great burgers in NYC, such destinations that come to mind are Corner Bistro, Burger Joint, and PG Clarkes, to name a few that are always in many people's \"Top Burgers List\". The burger that has stood out to me so far as being the best I've had, has come from Blue Smoke, Danny Meyer's barbecue joint on 27th street, off Park Avenue South. After a thirty minute wait we were seated at one of the front tables by the bar. I first ordered a cup of chili with cheese and onions ($5.75) I would never had ordered chili, but my good friend recommended it, saying that it would be good to dip their cottage fries in. Now, I'm no chili connoisseur, but I will say that it was one of the best cups of chili I have ever had. There was a big sweetness to it that I really enjoyed. Then came what we were all waiting for: the Bacon Cheeseburger ($9) It was nice and thick, but not overly big. The bacon was crisp and the bun was lightly toasted, just the way I like it. On the side of the plate came onions and pickles and I added a bit to give it some crunch. After adding some ketchup I took one bite and was pleased. Very pleased. This was a great burger. It was nice and juicy and perfectly cooked medium. Our cottage fries ($3.75) came out at the same time, but I couldn't really bother with them, for I was enjoying the burger too much. I downed the burger pretty quickly and moved to the fries. They were a tad dry and definitely needed some seasoning, so I added some pepper. I took my friend's recommendation and dipped them into the chili which was fine. But the real star of this meal was of course that burger.Does JG Melon have the best burger in NYC? That is hard to say. Obviously it is all subjective and there is no one answer. From what I can remember, I think Blue Smoke's burger was a tad juicier, but I haven't had it in a while. Will I be coming back to have another one of JG Melon's burgers soon? Yes. So for one of New York City's top burgers, JG Melon's is a great destination.JG Melon1291 3rd Ave (at 74th St.)New York, NY 10021

First Impressions: Chop Suey

Tonight I went to the grand opening party for a new restaurant on the second floor of the Renaissance Hotel in Times Square called Chop Suey. The consulting chef for this new venture is Zak Palaccio who brought us the Fatty Crab, one of my favorite NYC restaurants.I heard about the party, but actually wasn't personally invited. I knew it wouldn't be a problem getting in for I have met Zak many times, and could always rely on my magic to get me in. When I walked in the front door of the ground level of the hotel a gal immediately asked if I was going to Chop Suey- I guess I dressed the part. I took the elevator up to the Lobby level to find a typical hotel lounge area with a bar. Pass this bar/lounge area was the restaurant.The restaurant is a big square place with large windows overlooking Times Square. The view is great and I can forsee this as another big tourist spot, like everything else in Times Square. One cool aspect of the decor was the lights on the ceiling were shaped like shells. There were also leather orange chairs that I found unique. The decor resembles the food- playful and fun. Since this was the opening party I was able to have the opportunity to taste many of the dishes that will be offered on the menu. The tasting menu of the night consisted of Scallion Pancake with Asian Pear Moustarda, Short Rib with Sakura Cress Salad, Tofu Hot Pot, Rice Cakes, Char Siew, Roasted Wild Mushroom, Seared Mackerel, Fish Dumpling Soup, Roasted Shishito Peppers, Popcorn Shrimp with Pork Floss and XO Sauce, and Curry Leaf Chicken Wings.I didn't get to try everything that was listed on the menu, but I did try a fare share (by positioning myself by the kitchen door.) I was able to get a nice sneak peak into what this restaurant is and will become. I thought the addition of the asian pear moustarda to the scallion pancakes was a nice touch that gave the pancakes a nice sweetness to them, although I would have preferred them to be crispier. This was 'party' food, so I assume the quality will be better when it is made to order.The roasted shishito peppers were interesting for they came topped with a little tuna bottarga, giving a great balance of saltiness and spiciness.The short rib with sakura cress salad was fine. I enjoyed the texture contrast with the crunchy salad and the juicy short rib. The flavors of the popcorn shrimp with pork floss and XO sauce were excellent. There was a nice balance of sweetness and hotness.I really enjoyed the Roasted WIld Mushroom Congee which came with pine nuts and pickled garlic. It had a very mushy texture which was unique and interesting.The Curry Leaf Chicken Wings were also excellent. They were juicy and tender, and had a nice touch of saltiness to them. One standout that was not listed on the tasting menu of the night was the Oyster and Bacon lettuce cup. This was a fried oyster topped with bacon and kim chi on a piece of crisp lettuce. I thought the balance of textures and flavors were great. This dish encompassed the essence of this restaurant-fun and flavorful.I asked Zak how he would categorize this cuisine - was it Korean? He said it was \"East Asian\". I asked him what inspired him and he stated that he just got back from Seoul when he was asked to do the concept of the restaurant- he wanted it to be fun. And judging from what I had tonight, I think he is on the right track. All the little tastes I had were definitely playful, flavorful, and fun to eat. I'm not sure I could forsee this as a dining destination, nothing really blew my mind, but if you are in the Times Square area looking for a unique and fun bite, Chop Suey could be a good spot.Chop Suey714 7th Avenue (Second Floor of the Renaissance Hotel-bet. 47th and 48th St.)New York, NY 10036

Last night I had dinner at Market Table in the West Village. Market Table is brought to us by the guys who brought us The Little Owl (Gabrielle Stulman and Joey Campanero), one of my favorite new spots to open up last year. The chef is Mikey Price, who used to cook at the Mermaid Inn.This restaurant is interesting for when you walk in, you first enter a general goods store where you can purchase items, the dining room is past this little store. It is a large corner space with large windows where you can look out onto Carmine and Bedford streets. It's not an overly fancy place, I felt very casual and comfortable. The lighting was just dim enough for romance, but not too dark where I couldn't see my food.I took a seat at the bar and perused the menu. The menu was not too large, about seven appetizers and seven entrees, and some sides, which was fine for me. I decided to get the Crispy Calamari appetizer and the Braised Lamb Shank entree (this was Erin the bartender's recommendation.)The Crispy Calamari ($9) came with white anchovy, lemon, and a chili mayo. I thought the calamari was fine, nothing too special. I did enjoy the white anchovy and lemon a lot though. I never had fried anchovy or lemon before, and they were great. The anchovy gave the dish a great saltiness to it, and the lemon was a great palate cleanser and really opened up my taste buds. I thought it was a great touch.The Brasied Lamb Shank ($20) came with gouda gratin, greens and rosemary jus. First off, I need to point out that this is a great deal. Twenty dollars for lamb is unheard of at fine-dining establishments in NYC, and I was pleasantly surprised with the price. The lamb was tender, and fell right off the bone, which was nice, although it could have used some more flavor and seasoning. I enjoyed the gouda gratin, greens and rosemary jus that came with the lamb though. It wasn't an overly complex dish, the sides were simple but all went well together. Market Table is one of those neighborhood spots, like the Little Owl, which serves very good, straight-forward food, that keeps people coming back. I wasn't blown away, but, I do plan on going back.The casual environment, good food, and good prices are truly appealing.So for a very good, casual meal in the West Village, Market Table would be a great choice.Market Table54 Carmine St. (at Bedford St.)New York, NY 10014

Table For One: Kingswood

***CONTENT
A few weeks ago I went to a semi-new restaurant on a small stretch of West 10th street in the West Village called Kingswood. The reason for going there was to write a review for a website based in London. I was very happy for the opportunity.Kingswood is an Australian restaurant that comes to us from the folks behind Ruby's, an Australain spot in Nolita. I walked in to a bustling restaurant. There were large windows up front by the street, with some tables by them with diners. The centerpiece of the restaurant was a large copper square bar that was pretty busy. Past the bar was a large open space with many tables filled with diners, including one large wooden communal table. I asked if they had a table for one, and the owner knew right away I was from the website and had a table ready for me. (The website is focused on doing things on your own, and the owner of the website had previously met with the owner of Kingswood.)When I dine out alone, sometimes I like to dine at the bar and other times I like to dine at a table. They are two totally different experiences. I was given the table next to the large wooden communal table which was filled with a party of around ten gals. In fact, one of the gals was sitting in the seat across from me at my table, chatting with one of her friends. I of course told her she could stay, but after two minutes she left. (On a side note, one of the gals at the table next to me had met me over a year ago waiting in line (yes, i was doing magic) at Tomoe Sushi, a great and popular sushi spot on Thompson street in the West Village) This was a great beginning to the meal. Nothing like girls and grub for a single twenty-something! I first decided to order one of their Australian beers. As I sat there waiting for my beer, the one striking aspect of the restaurant I noticed was that it was loud. It was extremely loud, and the acoustics were horrible. This is not a place I'd want to take a date for an intimate dinner. I was there to review the place for a website that caters to doing things on your own, and I was not sure if I would want to dine here alone again. If I did, I would definitely choose the bar. These were all thoughts going through my head before I even ordered my food. My main focus when dining out is the food, of course. I ordered the scallop appetizer and the Parmesan crusted Rack of Lamb entree, as well as a side of the truffle fries.The scallop appetizer was a very good dish. It came with a carrot puree and some citrus. I loved how the sweetness of the carrot puree and the citrus contrasted each other. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and had a nice char on the outside, but were tender. The parmesan crusted rack of lamb came with tomato orzo and seasonal greens. This dish blew my mind-but not in a good way. Although the lamb was nicely cooked, and the parmesan crust gave it some nice saltiness, I was completely perplexed about what the tomato orzo was doing there. The tomato orzo did not go well with the lamb at all. (Orzo is pasta that looks like rice) I thought it had no reason being on the plate, I did not understand this dish. Maybe it is common in Australia? I'm not sure. But, it was not a good compliment to the lamb at all.The side of truffle fries were ok. They came with a truffle aioli on them, and they were somewhat crispy, but I can't say I loved them.Would I go back to Kingswood? Maybe. I think it could be a good place for groups. And I would want to try some more of their food, for I have heard some good things, especially about their burger, which seems to be popular. In fact, it could be the ideal place for a burger and some beer, and maybe getting drunk with Australians. But just remember, you might lose your voice talking to them, trying to talk over everyone else in the restaurant.Kingswood121 W. 10th Street (at Greenwich Ave.)New York, NY 10011

Last night I decided to go to the new one-month old restaurant in the Lower East side, where its name is its address: Allen & Delancey.I walked in to find a dark restaurant lit with an abundant amount of candles and walls of exposed brick. It had a modernized gothic feel to it, but in a sexy way. There is a bar up front, with the main dining room in the back separated by a small hallway. I walked past the bar to the Hostess station to see if there were any seats available. I noticed an open table and asked one of the hostesses where she thought I should eat. She recommended the bar where \"Heather would take good care of me.\" I like being taking care of, and also like making conversation with everyone who works at a restaurant (and eats at a restaurant too) so the bar was where I sat. I started out with a Manhattan. I figured a stiff drink would be a good way to get the night going (it was 10:30pm). I was excited to check out the menu, for the chef, Neil Ferguson was plucked from Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in midtown, a reputable dining destination in NYC. After perusing the menu and inquiring with Heather what her favorite dishes were, I eventually made the decision to go with an appetizer of Skin Roasted Spanish Mackerel with bacon gnocchi, and apple cider vinagrette ($15). For my entree I chose the Moulard Duck Magret with turnip confit, buttered radishes and foie gras.The highlight of the meal was actually the bread. The bread is baked in-house, and I was given a plate of one sage and bacon roll, and one regular roll, along with a side of butter. Both rolls were warm, and fluffy, and absolutely delicious. The butter was amazing as well. It was extremely creamy, which I liked. It was one of the best plates of bread I have ever had. The Spanish Mackerel appetizer was a very interesting dish. The combination of flavors were unlike any I have encountered before. Mackerel is a very \"fishy\" fish, so the bacon gnocchi and apple cider vinagrette were used to counteract that fishiness. The fish was well cooked, but the dish to me only works when you combine all three elements on one forkfull. I will admit I am not a fan of apples, so that might have been a turn-off. But the bacon gnocchi were not what I expected either. In fact, I was having trouble locating which was the gnocchi and what was apple. I wish the gnocchi had stood out a little more. I was still pleased with the dish and the use of unusual flavor combinations, I just wasn't blown away.The Moulard Duck Magret was yet another dish with unusual flavor combinations. The duck was presented in the center of the plate cut into many slices. It was perfectly cooked, and nice and juicy. I never had turnip confit or buttered radishes, and both were fine. They were interesting compliments to the duck, and the dish had a very \"Autumny\" feel to it, but I can't say I loved it. It was something different though, and I love trying new things and experimenting. The best part of the dish though was the foie gras. There was a small piece of duck foie gras at one side of the plate, really not the focus of the plate at all. What made the foie gras so great was it was topped with toasted almonds. It gave it some great texture, as well as some added flavor, and I loved it.I was too stuffed for dessert, although they all looked interesting, with again some unique flavor combinations, such as one dessert that came with olive oil ice cream!So, if you are looking for a sexy dining experience, with good food with unique flavors, Allen & Delancey would be a very good choice.Allen & Delancey115 Allen St. (and Delancey!)New York, NY 10002

Saturday night I decided to go to Lupa, one of the Italian restaurants in Mario Batali's empire. I got there at 10:15 and it was around a 45 minute wait til I got seated. I've been wanting to head to Lupa for some time now, for I heard great things. Now, I don't know if I'd recommend waiting 45 minutes for pasta, but Lupa doesn't disappoint.It's a nice medium sized restaurant, with a rustic and casual feel to it. I started with a special of sliced Copa -pork shoulder ($12). They have a guy in a \"meat\" station next to the bar who slices many different types of fresh meat. The Copa came in 10 thinly sliced pieces. It was very fresh and delicate, and went nicely with a red wine I had.I had been craving to try the pasta at Lupa, so I went with a special of Orecchiette with pork sausage and broccoli rabe ($22). This pasta dish was great. It was the most al dente pasta I have ever had. It was dressed with olive oil and had a nice kick to it from crushed red pepper. It was definitely a perfect pasta dish.For dessert I tried the Lupa Tartufo ($8), which came with hazelnuts and hazlenut ice cream. It was a big ball of chocolate surrounding the hazelnut ice cream on top of some chocolate sauce. I love chocolate and hazelnut together, so of course I loved this dish. It was the pefect ending to a great little meal.Lupa is a great place to grab some wine and some non-fussy Italian food. It's worth the wait.Lupa170 Thompson StreetNew York, NY 10012

Last night I decided to go to the one-month old Spanish tapas spot El Quinto Pino. El Quinto Pino comes to us from Mani Dawes and chef Alex Raij, the crew that brought us Tia Pol, one of the best tapas joints in NYC.El Quinto Pino is small. It is sparsely decorated with some mirrors on one wall, with some seats up against the wall, and a semi-circular curved small bar, with the kitchen behind the bar. The food and drink menu are written on two chalkboards behind the bar. The tilings on the wall behind the bar resembled the patterns of your grandmother's couch. You don't come to this spot for the decor. You come for the great authentic Spanish tapas.I took a seat at one end of the bar. There were only a handful of people inside, which surprised me, for I thought it might be packed, because Tia Pol is always packed. I was happy it wasn't packed, for it gave me more time to converse with the bartenders. I asked Veronica, one of two bartenders what her favorite dish was, and she told me it was the shrimp. I asked Matt, the other bartender what his favorite dish was and he said the braised meat sandwich. Not feeling shrimp- at the moment- I went with Matt's suggestion. I also went with the Victory Pilsner beer they had on tap.The sandwich ($7) came out on hot and crispy bread. The meat was braised pork shoulder. It was a really nice sandwich. The flavor was really nice and the meat was well seasoned. After enjoying this tasty little sandwich I was contemplating if I should get the garlicky shrimp too. And like a mindreader, Matt comes over and asks me if I wanted the shrimp too, I of course, obliged. And I am so happy I did.This \"garlicky shrump\" ($9) dish is a great dish. Four shrimp come out in a broth. It's a simple dish, but the broth had such a great flavor I loved the dish. There was a little kick to the broth, which I enjoyed, and found out was from the addition of sirancha (not sure of spelling) peppers. These are hot vietnamese peppers which gave this Spanish dish a touch of Asia. The dish came with two pieces of warm crispy bread which was perfect for dipping in the broth.Of course, I ended up doing magic for everyone in the restaurant, which was awesome. That was a good thing too, because an Australian couple sitting next to me had ordered some crispy cracklings, which thanks to my amazing magic and winning personality, they let me try. The cracklings were delicious. The perfect bar snack.After eating great food, and entertaining and chatting with great people, the restaurant gave me this very homey vibe. Its the kind of restaurant I love. Non-pretentious, cozy, friendly, great food, and with no dish over $15, a great bang for your buck. It is a great neighborhood joint, but I would travel from other neighborhoods for the El Quinto Pino experience. And I will, for I live in Midtown, and it is in Chelsea, an I plan on coming back often. So for great tapas in a friendly environment in NYC, El Quinto Pino is the perfect little spot.El Quinto Pino401 W. 24th St. (at 9th Avenue)New York, NY 10011

Wednesday night I met a friend of mine at Pastis. If you never heard of Pastis, it is a \"sceney\" restaurant in the Meatpacking District, made \"scenier\" by it's appearances on \"Sex and the City\". On any given night you'll find your typical fashionistas, celebs, and \"Sex and the City\" wannabes. I've been to Pastis a few times, and I think it is a great place to grab a drink and a bite. You would think that a restaurant like this would be more focused on its looks and vibe, then the food, but I feel compelled to write about their steak sandwich ($18).I had the steak sandwich Wednesday-for the second time. I tend to like to try new dishes, but fate led me to order it again, after our waitress steered me away from the pork chop I was contemplating.The sandwich comes with onions and gruyere cheese, and a side of fries. The meat was tender and juicy, and the onions and the cheese were not overloaded, so it was a perfectly balanced sandwich. In fact, it was the best steak sandwich I have ever encountered. The fries at Pastis need to be discussed too. Why? Cause they are pefect! Crispy, with the right amount of saltiness. I love these fries. There's nothing like sitting outside, having a drink, enjoying an awesome sandwich while good-looking people walk by.For good eats, people watching, and a taste of cool, Pastis is the perfect spot.Pastis9 9th Avenue (at Little West 12th st.)New York, NY 10014

Pastis is one of my fave dining venues in the city. The menu sticks to well-made bistro standards which look and taste delicious. The service is attentive without being overbearing. And the scene, despite being so \"trendy,\" has a warmth about it that gives a sense of comfort to the dining experience.Great site, Josh!~Claudette, aka he's dead, jim!

I couldn't agree more that the tender steak sandwich of Pastis is a mouth watering delight that leaves its patron full and satisfied. However, the seared organic salmon with shitake mushrooms, almonds and curry oil is a true culinary delight. The dish coupled with an authentic New York City atmosphere allowed for each succulent bite to swim wildly into my heart like the salmons own vicious journey of survival. I am a frequent visitor to this “hot” and “stylish” Meatpacking restaurant and marvel at my fellow diners who surround me. Every visit seems to overwhelm me with a feeling that I am an extra in a Woody Allen movie, and find myself continually head turning in hopes to eye a celebrity like Tia or Tamera. I completely agree with your synopsis, Table For One, and continually look forward to reading your enchanting dining adventures.

Last night I decided to check out the new restaurant Tailor in SOHO. Tailor comes to us from the former pastry chef at WD-50, Sam Mason. WD-50 is the most experimental restaurant in NYC, and was the location of one of my greatest dining experiences in my life, so I was definitely excited to check this place out.Tailor is located on a block away from all the commercial craziness that is SOHO. I knew the address was 525 Broome st., but I did not see any sign or number. What I did see was a large wooden door that I assumed was the place. Luckily for me, I was right!There is a dining room on the first floor and a cool lounge downstairs. I took a table in the dining room, which was simply decorated, with dim brown/beige colors, and one wall of exposed brick. The mood was modernized 1800's. In the back right corner of the restaurant is a service bar with a window, but no glass. I have seen open kitchens before, but rarely do you see an open bar. In other words, yes, most restaurants have bars, but this was a \"Service\" bar, meaning this is where the drinks the diners ordered were \"created\". Not a bar with stools, etc. I found this quite interesting, almost if they wanted to highlight the drinks. And, well, the drinks here should be highlighted. The cocktail list was created by mixologist Eben Freeman, and it's an amazing list. I started with the \"Blood and Sand\" ($14)- scotch, sweet vermouth, red bach. This was a great drink. The balance between alcohol and flavor was perfect. There was just a touch of saltiness to the drink that I enjoyed. The menu at Tailor consists of one side labeled \"Salty\" and the other side labeled \"Sweet\". For my first encounter, I decided to get one dish from each side. From the \"Salty\" side I went with the Pork Belly with miso butterscotch and artichoke ($16). This was an amazing dish. The balance of sweetness and saltiness was perfect. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, tender, juicy and absolutely delicious. The miso butterscotch was interesting. I thought it had a chance to be too sweet, but in fact it was the perfect compliment to the pork belly. The artichoke was perfectly cooked, and gave a nice added texture to the dish. It was also beautifully presented. The colors on the plate were very appealing. This was a memorable dish.After this dish I ordered a cocktail called \"Good Ol Boy\" ($12); bourbon, smoked coke, and preserved lemon. This was a nice drink as well. I look at the cocktails at Tailor as dishes themselves (they cost just as much too!).From the \"Sweet\" side of the menu I had the Soft Chocolate with sesame ice cream ($12). This dish was also beautifully presented and tasted great. The sesame ice cream was a refreshing compliment to the soft chocolate. Another aspect of Tailor that should be highlighted is the service. The service was extremely good. It seemed they had many more servers then needed, but that works to the diner's advantage, because there is someone always there to take care of you. (They also walked around with two types of bread-raisin and olive- I had both, and both were very good.)I definitely plan on coming back to Tailor to try the other dishes on the menu and to try more of their great cocktails. So, for great drinks, and memorable food, Tailor is the perfect spot.Tailor525 Broome St. (between Sullivan and Thompson)New York, NY 10013

Last night my family and I went to Lure in Soho. Lure is a cool seafood restaurant that evokes the inside of a yacht. It's a big space that looks great.The first sign that this was going to be a great experience is when they put a bowl of warm potato chips on the table. These might have been the best chips I've ever had, and I never had potato chips warm. We were informed by our waiter Timmy that they had balsamic vinegar on them, which was very subtle, but a great touch.We ordered some nice white wine for the table and they then brought out some warm biscuits. These bicuits tasted very fresh, like they just came out of the oven, and they were great.For starters, we had the medium sized Seafood Plateau ($49) which came with 6 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams, 4 jonah crab claws, and seafood salad. All the seafood was great and fresh and I really liked the seafood salad which had the perfect amount of acidity as well as crunchy vegetables that gave it the perfect snap. Another nice touch was a condiment of mayo they brought out (along with cocktail sauce and Worcestershire sauce) which had a hint of honey mustard to it.Next was the two sushi rolls we ordered; the spider roll (soft-shell crab) and a spicy scallop roll. That spicy scallop roll was amazing! I didn't expect a restaurant that didn't only focus on sushi to have good sushi, but that roll was one of the best I've ever had; it was warm, fresh, tasty and delicious!I always like to order calamari at restaurants, for comparison, so we had Lure's ($10) which came with a smoked chili glaze. This calamari was again one of the best I've ever had as well. It wasn't overly fried, so it was just lightly coated, and each ring was thick and the squid flavor was able to come through. The chili glaze was awesome too. Usually one would expect to dip calamari into a marinara sauce-this did not need any sauce. It was truly a great bowl of calamari.Timmy also brought out Lure's version of Tempura Shrimp ($14). It was on the house because he thought we should try it-he was right. It came with a black sesame mayo which was great. Just the right amount of sweetness and kick to it, and the black sesames gave the shrimp a little extra crunch. This was a great dish.For entrees we ordered the Seared Yellowfin Tuna ($25), the Roasted Halibut, and the Steamed Lobster tails. And now, this is where the night gets interesting.You see, earlier in our meal I did mention to our waiter Timmy (who is great and very personable) that I was doing this NYCFOODIE website and that I was a magician. So, as the true Entertainer I am, I decided to show Timmy a magic trick. Well, I blew his mind with the first trick, and the next thing you know half of the waitstaff was in our private dining area watching me perform. Everyone was amazed and it was awesome! I ended up doing magic to many of the chefs, managers and waitstaff all night long in fact. I was so focused on entertaining everyone, that I forgot I had some entrees waiting for me. So I returned to try just a little of each.The Steamed Lobster tails came with roasted corn, tomato, and citrus butter. It was excellent and soothing, and I loved how that corn gave an added texture to the dish.The Yellowfin Tuna was nori crusted and came with shiitake mushrooms, edamame, and a dashi glaze. It was a fine dish and I only had a little bit, for I lost my appetite from all that Entertainment, but I was not blown away by the dish.The Halibut came with artichokes, peas, fingerling potatoes in a lobster broth. It was nicely cooked with a crisp top, and tender meat, and the broth was nice too.Pretty much stuffed from the meal and from all the energy I exerted from entertaining everyone at Lure, there was was no way I had room for dessert-or so I thought.Timmy asked if we would like to see the dessert menus. I said, \"let me ask the crew here,\" and before I could ask my fam, he said \"nevermind, I got it.\" I always have room for free food and dessert! And, not only did we get three desserts on the house, the sommelier brought us all a fantastic dessert wine. Now that is real magic!He brought us the Warm chocolate cake ($8) with chocolate chip iced cream and chocolate panna cotta, the Peach-Blackberry Crumble with buttermilk ice cream ($8) and the assorted ice cream sandwiches (8$). All the desserts were great. I truly loved that Crumble though. Now, I would not consider myself a \"crumble guy\" but this dessert was a standout. It was delicious and that buttermilk ice cream was a perfect compliment with the warm fruit inside. I also like those ice cream sandwiches a lot.The cookies were fresh, including one oatmeal cookie that had a burst of cinnamon that exploded in my mouth.So, Lure is a great restaurant. This was truly one of the great dining experiences I have encountered. I guess since I ended up entertaining everyone, and they all surrounded me, it did feel like one big family. It seemed everyone was happy, and that really came through when we were being served. The food is great with some memorable dishes like that Tempura Shrimp, Spicy Scallop Roll, and Peach-Blackberry Crumble. I definitely plan on coming back, and it's not just because the Manager offered me a free high-end meal for two, after I blew his mind with an amazing card trick, it's because Lure is a great restaurant.So, if you are interested in a great dining experience (I cannot promise magic, unless I am there), with great seafood and great service, in a great space, then Lure is a great choice.Lure142 Mercer StreetNew York, NY 10012

Table For One: Wakiya

Tonight I decided to get my first taste of 3-day old Wakiya, the new Chinese restaurant opened in the Gramercy Park hotel. Wakiya comes to us from celebrity chef Yuji Wakiya who is a Japanese chef famous in Tokyo for his gourmet Chinese. The management team comes to us from the Nobu empire.The place is very sexy, dressed in red and black. It is another addition to NYC's wave of gourmet Chinese, think Buddakan, Chinatown Brasserie, and Mr. Chow Tribeca. I walked in and decided to sit at the bar, which was empty. I expected it to be hopping for it is the latest \"hot spot\" in town, so I was surprised, but glad that I would be able to enjoy my meal with plenty of elbow room. I also expected to see some celebs, but the only popular peeps I saw were the co-owner of \"hot spot \" club Tenjune, Mark Birnbaum, celebrity chef of famed NYC restaurant Le Bernadin, Eric Ripert, and some politician whose name I could not recall, with a table full of women.I started out with a Lucky beer. This is a Chinese beer I have never heard of or tasted before, and it came in a cool Buddha shaped bottle. It was light and fine. I just wanted a taste of what Wakiya had to offer. And luckily for me they had a cold appetizer called Nine flavors of Wakiya ($12). This dish came with nine small tastings of parts of dishes that were on the menu. And when I say \"tasting\" I mean just one bite-I like this though, cause it is a nice tease and allows one to explore the menu without ordering too much. The nine flavors were--green fava bean, shitake puree, uba mushi, creamy lemon shrimp, tonsu seabass, shrimp scallop fish cake, bang bang chicken, wagyu beef, and sticky rice w/chinese bacon. The stand out flavors were the bang bang chicken and the wagyu beef. The beef was tender and succulent and pefectly seasoned. And the bang bang chicken was in a sauce that was at first sweet and then became spicy as it lingered in my mouth. I loved this flavor. They have a full cold appetizer of this, and I plan on ordering it on my next visit.I also tried the Shanghai Soup dumplings ($10). They were similar to other soup dumplings I had, although at first I thought the meat inside could have used some more flavor. But when I got to my fourth and last dumpling, the dish grew on me and it was a soothing appetizer. After contemplating for a while I decided to try one more dish; the Sizzling Rice cakes ($16). The waiter brought over a bowl with some crispy rice cakes and then poured a steaming soup filled with vegetables and meat over it. This was totally unexpected. The dish was ok. I had to wait a tad to eat it at first, for it was so hot, and I burned my tongue on my first bite. I liked how there was a lot of stuff in the dish, from chinese string beans, and trumpet mushrooms to shrimp and chicken. They definitely didn't skimp on anything. But, the flavor of the dish was lacking a whole lot. There was no kick, no wow factor whatsoever. And I've had similar dishes at places like Ollies for half the price. Too label the dish Sizzling Rice Cakes is a mistake too, for once the rice cakes are covered with the soup, they soften, and almost were non-existent, and not the main focal point of the dish.The thing is, knowing that Mr. Wakiya is a critically acclaimed chef, I did expect to be wowed. I wasn't. At least this time. I'm sure the kitchen still needs to work out some kinks, for it is still very new. I do intend on going back, and seeing what else Wakiya has too offer. The menu looked great and had some interesting looking dishes that I look foward to having. So, like those soup dumplings, I do hope Wakiya eventually grows on me. I would say, if you are looking for a sexy dining destination to take a date, Wakiya could be a good place. I'll let you know after my next visit if it grows into a great place.Wakiya2 Lexington Ave, at 21st St. (inside the Gramercy Park Hotel)New York, NY 10010

***CONTENT
Last night, I decided to get my introduction to the new West Village restaurant Perilla. Perilla comes to us from the season one winner of \"Top Chef\"- Harold Dieterle. I had actually met Harold, (along with The Little Owl chef Joey Campanaro) at Momofuku Ssam (my favorite NYC restaurant) a few months ago, where during a night of drinks, food, and magic he told me about this new restaurant he was going to open. So, I was very excited to check out a place that went from a mere vision to a completed dream.The space is located on a cool West Village block hidden away from all the commotion on Bleeker street. It is not overly decorated at all, it is simple and looks fine. I can sense this definitely being a new popular neighborhood spot; a bigger version of The Little Owl.I sat at the bar and perused the menu over a nice glass of Beaujolais ($8). The menu is American Nouveau with Asian influences. It all looked great. For my introduction though, I just went with two appetizers: the Thinly Sliced Raw Hamachi with cucumber salad, cilantro, tomato water, and yuzu ($14), and the Spicy Duck Meatballs with okinawa yam dumplings, water spinach, quail egg and natural jus ($11).The Hamachi dish was refreshing and very nice. The cucumbers gave a nice crunch to compliment the fish. Although I did need a knife to cut smaller slices of the fish, I really enjoyed the dish. I could definitely eat something like that for lunch everyday, and feel good and healthy about myself.The Meatballs were really good as well. There were very small, and pretty darn cute I must say. What made this dish was the flavorful natural jus that I would just about soak anything in. This was a delicious and perfect appetizer.I actually did give in and talked myself into trying a dessert. I went with the Smoked Chocolate Cake with kaffir lime ice cream and mango chutney. I really enjoyed this dessert. The cake was not too sweet, although I didn't taste any real smokiness, but then again, I was on my fourth glass of wine (switched to a Pinot Noir ($13) ). But, what made this dish fantastic was that ice cream. It had a great kick to it, and tasted great.I definitely look foward to returning to Perilla in the near future and try everything else on the menu. This \"Top\" chef seems to know what he is doing and definitely deserves that title. Perilla gives me one more reason to move to the West Village asap.

Last Night my family and I went to Dennis Foy, a new restaurant in Tribeca. It's New American cuisine with French influences. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was the colorful arches on the ceiling. Dennis Foy is the chef/owner and is also an artist, his artwork adorns the walls of his restaurant. The paintings were actually really nice. The lighting is somber and dim, with a red haze illuminated by the beautiful reddish glass lamps hanging from the ceiling. The lamps are works of art themselves. So, before the meal even started I was taken back, and felt as if I were in a work of art, which I guess I really was.I started off with a cocktail with passion fruit, tequila and pink peppercorns. It was refreshing and very good. It hit the spot. My sister had a Blackberry Lemonade cocktail which was also very good.After my older sister arrived we ordered a bottle of wine. And then they brought out a bread basket with three different types of bread: a french roll, one with olives, and one with walnuts and cranberries. I would try all three throughout the night, and all were great. I'm a sucker for good bread, because it's a great way to start a meal, and plus, it's free!Before the appetizers came the waiters brought out a complimentary dish of pickled vegetables and oxtail boullon. I loved this dish! The pickled vegetables reminded me of kimchee, but had a touch of sweetness to it. The oxtail boullon tasted great and was very soothing. What I loved the most about this dish (besides being complimentary) was the contrast between the spiciness of the vegatables, (which also had a nice crunch to them) with the saltiness and soothing of the broth-like boullon. It was a well balanced dish.Then the appetizers arrived. And when I say \"then\" I mean a while after. One thing I'd like to note about Dennis Foy is the pacing. This is not a place to go if you have a show to catch or you need to be somewhere in a hurry. This is a place where you go to eat good food and linger. They take their time here, and it's nice. It gives you time to digest and talk with your fellow dining companions over some nice wine.Back to those appetizers. We had the Sauteed Potato Gnocchi with sage and chives, the Warm Crab Tian, Salt Cure Terrine of Fois Gras, Konpachi and Fried Veal Sweetbreads.The Gnocchi was very good. Although the texture of each gnocchi was not as soft as I'd like, the flavors were wonderful.The Crab was excellent. I loved this dish. Think of a crabcake without the bread. It was all crab, and it was perfectly seasoned, and had touch of rosemary on top. I loved this full crab flavor. It was probably my favorite dish of the night.The Fois Gras was also nice, but did not blow me away. I believe there was some sort of apple cider sauce on the side that didn't really go to well with the dish. But the fois gras itself was fine.The Konpachi, which is really a very good type of yellowtail was also very good. It was five pieces of the fish on a plate; think sashimi. It was colorful, refreshing and tasted great.The Fried Sweetbreads were very good as well. I enjoyed the crispiness and the flavors of the dish.Then we moved on to our entrees. Again, there was a nice space in between each course to linger and chat. For entrees we had Lamb two ways, Arctic Char, Veal and Fried Sweetbreads, and Scallops.The Lamb two ways, was a loin with bow-tie noodles and mushrooms, and a shank with wilted lettuce. The lamb was cooked perfectly, very tender and perfectly seasoned. I loved the lamb. The problem with the dish was what the lamb was on top of. I thought the bowtie noodles were not only boring, but did not go well with the loin. The same could be said about the wilted lettuce. It looked like this green sludge and it too, did not go well with the shank. It was very uncomplimentary. I would have preferred a better pairing with the excellent meat.The Arctic Char came with spinach, nutmeg and pommes soufflees. It came served in a bowl with a broth. Basically, it reminded me of an Asian soup. The Char was nicely cooked, crispy on top, tended in the middle, but bland. What you needed to do was put all the ingredients in the broth on your spoon and eat it at the same time. This made the dish very good. All the flavors and textures worked in my mouth and it was very soothing.The Veal and Fried Sweetbreads (yes more sweetbreads) was very good. The veal was tender and came with some sort of potato puree which was nice. As the dishes were being passed around the table, I'm not exactly sure if there was a sweetbread left for me, but it was still a nice dish.The Scallops, (there were three) were each topped with something different. I know one had asparagus, one had some fried vegetable on top, and the other might have had a mushroom, but I can't be too sure. The fact is, it was not a memorable dish at all. I didn't like the dish. The scallops were a bit tough and dry, and the seasoning on the bottom of the plate, which looked like some sort of crushed red pepper did not go well with the scallops at all. Again, it was very uncomplimentary. A disappointment.For dessert we had the Black Plum Financier with Winter Fruit Compote, and Aged Rum Ice Cream. It was ok, but very unmemorable. We also had the Chocolate Royale which was basically a chocolate mouse with hazlenut cookie bottom. It was fine, but also very unmemorable.So, if you are downtown in Tribeca and feel like lingering with some good wine and decent American fare with French influences Dennis Foy is a nice, relaxing spot. Sit back, relax, and sip your wine as you experience dining in a work of art. Dennis Foy313 Church Street (between Lispenard and Walker Sts)New York, NY 10013

Friday night my sisters and I decided to have dinner at The Tasting Room in SOHO/NOLITA. The Tasting Room used to be located in the East Village on 1st Street and has moved to this bigger location. There is a bar area when you walk in with some tables to sit at, and then two more rooms to dine in. It is very open, simple, and homey, yet still modern with some unusual artwork adorning the walls.The menu, helmed my Colin Alevras, is very market driven and all the ingredients are supplied by local farmers \"who take pride in raising their animals and vegetables carefully and responsibly.\" That is what is quoted on the bottom of the menu. You can also choose what type of portion you want for all dishes: a smaller portion being \"Taste\" or a larger portion being \"Share\". This is nice cause it gives the diner the opportunity to try a little bit of everything.For starters we tried the Hen-of-the Woods Mushroom Salad, Duck & Pork Terrine, and Fresh Wild Abalone.The Mushroom Salad came with carrots, dandelion, potatoes, and rye toast. It was excellent. The mushrooms and everything else on the plate tasted so fresh and delicious. I could eat this salad all the time!The Duck & Pork terrine came with pickles, Colby Clothbound Cheddar, and pear mustard. This was also very good, and the mustard was the perfect compliment for the terrine. It gave it a nice little tang to the flavor.The Abalone came with X.O. sauce, bacon, burdock, and cress. I have no idea what burdock or cress is (wait-Google says they are both leafy vegetables), but again the dish was very fresh and very tasty.For entrees we had the Red Bream, Porcini Mushrooms, and Violet Hill Farm Mutton Loin.The Red Bream came with leeks, jerusalem artichokes, chanterelles, and bush okra. It was an excellent fish dish. It had a crispy top and tender meat. It was just so clean, and fresh. I loved it!The Porcini Mushrooms came with Rose Finn apple potatoes, carmelized onions and a coddled egg. Now, I would never think that you can have just a mushroom dish as an entree- but let me tell you, it can be done. This was a great dish. Chef Alevras does wonders with mushrooms. The flavors were amazing. Everything was perfectly seasoned, and this is another fresh dish I'd love to have all the time!The Violet Hill Fam Muttoin Loin came with spinach, parsnip puree, and red onions. It was perfectly cooked and delicious. I loved how the mutton flavor and the parsnip puree went so well together.For dessert we had the Butterscotch Pot de Creme with marcona almond biscotti and Hazlenut Semifreddo with cinnamon caramel sauce and a hazlenut cookie.The Butterscotch Pot de Creme was fine. I didn't really taste too much butterscotch flavor, but I still enjoyed the dish. The Hazelnut Semifreddo was also very nice and enjoyable. I liked both desserts because neither were heavy, and they were a nice satisfying end to a great meal.So, if you are looking for a restaurant where you can really taste how fresh all the ingredients are in each dish, and where the chef takes pride in all the ingredients used, The Tasting Room is the perfect spot. You will never look at mushrooms the same way again! The Tasting Room264 Elizabeth Street (at Houston St.)New York, NY 10012

Monday night I ended up going to dinner at new celebrity \"hot spot\" The Waverly Inn. I was there a week before for a glass of wine, when 5 minutes after I ordered, P. Diddy and his girlfriend and bodyguard walked in, 5 minutes after that Ivanka Trump left, and 5 minutes after that Amy Poehler from SNL and her husband Will Arnett from Arrested Development had left. I knew this was the spot I belonged at. In fact I stayed after the place had closed and entertained the chef and hosts with some amazing magic.It is a very cozy and quaint place. There is a nice bar area when you first walk in, with the dining area in the next room. I'm sure on any given day if you take a peak inside this room you will see various celebrities and \"power\" players dining on some good, satisfying food.In fact, I was seated right next to the entryway, but the only celebrity I noticed was me. Well, actually later on in my meal I had a nice conversation with actress Erika Christensen, although I was wasted, so I don't exactly remember what I said.Instead of bread to begin the meal my waiter brought me a basket of two biscuits and some creamy butter. These biscuits were excellent; soft, warm, and perfect. In fact they were the best biscuits I have ever had!For my appetizer I tried the Tuna Tartare with avocado and dijon emulsion. It was excellent. Fresh with perfect flavor, and I even detected a slight hint of egg, which I thought was great.For my entree I had the Braised Short Ribs with celery root puree. Now, short ribs are getting very popular on many menus around NYC, these were very good. Nice and tender and my celery root puree was the perfect compliment to the meat.The only downside of the Waverly Inn was the end of the meal. For dessert I had the chocolate cake. It was boring and really not that good.So, for some great celebrity sightings and very good satisfying food the Waverly Inn is a perfect little spot. Like I always tell people, biscuits and Diddy always make for a great meal.The Waverly Inn16 Bank St. (at Waverly Pl)New York, NY 10014

Saturday night my sister and I went to an American restaurant in Tribeca called Devin Tavern. My first experience at Devin was a week before, when I had drinks with three pretty gals, and tried the chicken meatballs with mushroom & sweet pea ragout, and garlic toast. That appetizer was very good (the model I was sitting next to might have added to the experience as well) and the menu intrigued me, thus I knew I would return to try some other dishes.The restaurant is a modernized tavern. It is rustic, yet new. It is very big with many different rooms separated by some walls with exposed brick. The dishes are very heavy and hearty, and I would not recommend coming here if you are a vegetarian or a light eater. It is very \"wintery\", and in fact I would never eat here during the summer.There are many tables in the bar area and that is where my sister and I were seated. I suppose my celebrity status did not warrant us a seat in the formal dining room, away from the wine guzzlers, or it could have been cause I had made the reservation only 15 minutes in advance. In any case, we started with two cocktails ($12 each) from the very nice cocktail menu. I had their version of an Old-Fashioned and she had their Caipirinha. Both were good and hit the spot.For starters, she had the Mushroom and Bone Marrow soup ($12). It was very good. The mushroom and marrow flavor was well balanced and complimented each other nicely. It was a great start for a cold night.I had the Oysters Gratin ($12) with wellfleets, hollandaise, spinach and lardons. The oysters came on a bed of salt which I never had before, and it was fine. I was not sure if the oysters were supposed to be cold, warm, or hot. They were lukewarm. I saw no spinach and had no idea what a wellfleet was until I just googled it, and believe it is a type of oyster from Wellfleet, MA.My sister had the Lobster Wellington ($39!) with fois gras,chanterelles, sweet peas, pearl onions, and lobster cream. She seemed to have enjoyed it. I tried a little of it, and thought it could use some more flavor and seasoning, but I did enjoy the lobster flavor.I went with the Grilled Veal Sirloin ($38!) with sautéed chanterelles, crispy fingerlings, foie gras & ruby port reduction. It was a huge chunk of meat that had a nicely seasoned crispy top, and was well cooked. The reduction was nice, but I found the entire dish boring. The sad part is I saw no fois gras, which I would have said something to the waitress about, but out of hunger, I had ate most of the dish, before realizing what I thought was fois gras, was the chanterelles. Oops!For dessert we tried the Chocolate Covered Potato Chips ($10). I heard about this dessert from my readings and really wanted to try them. They came with salted chips, candied nuts, dried fruit, and chocolate pistoles. I enjoyed this dessert because I thought the combination of saltiness and sweetness was perfect.If you are looking for a very hearty meal it is a fine choice. But I do think it is somewhat overpriced and you can get more bang for your buck elsewhere.In fact, if I were to ever come back to Devin Tavern, I would probably just get those chicken meatballs and the chocolate potato chips. Oh, and I'd make sure there is a model sitting next to me.Devin Tavern363 Greenwich Street (between Franklin and Harrison)New York, NY 10013

Friday night I went to a Modern Greek restaurant called Parea in the Flatiron district. It's a big, sleek space, with a long communal table in the middle. This is where my dining companions and I sat.I started with a popular Greek drink called Ouzo. It's basically like sambuca, which tastes like licorice. A glass with ice was brought with the ouzo which was about one and a half shots worth ($10). My first sip was smoothe, but it definitely needed some ice. After adding some ice, the drink got cloudy, and it was much better, and very nice.We started with three Mezedes, which are family style appetizers meant to be shared.The Crispy Pork with pistachio, roasted beets, and honey was very tasty although a bit too lukewarm for me.The Crab Spanakopita, which is a Greek spinach pie was very nice too, but I tasted absolutley zero crab, which was very disappointing.The standout of the Mezedes was the Grilled Octopus with black eyed peas and scallions. The octopus was grilled perfectly and had a wonderful flavor to it.For my entree I had the Braised Lamb Shank with potato gnocchi and orange zest. The lamb was perfectly cooked, the meat fell right off the bone. The Orange zest broth was very good and soothing as well. Unfortunately the gnocchi was overcooked and rubbery, and was a disappointment.My dining companions ordered the Hanger steak with greek fries and one of the fish dishes. I tried a little of both. They were both presented very clean and cooked well. The steak was tender and the greek fries were crispy. I enjoyed the addition of rosemary to them as well. The fish dish was fine, but quite boring. In fact none of the dishes truly blew me away, (which is fine.)Well, until we got to dessert.For dessert we ordered the Greek donut holes with honey and sage tea. The donut holes were warm and sweet and came with a sweet dipping sauce we dipped them into. What truly blew my mind was the sage tea though. It perfectly complimented the donut holes and I thought it was ingenious. It was the perfect ending to a clean-cut, satisfying meal, with few surprises.So, if you are in the Flatiron district of Manhattan and in the mood for some modern Greek cuisine, Parea would be a satisfying choice.

Sunday night I went with a gal to Falai. Falai is an Italian restaurant in the Lower East side I had heard great things about and have been wanting to go for a while. The chef/owner Iacopo Falai used to be the pastry chef at Le Cirque.Falai is very white inside, in a charming manner, and not fancy at all. It felt very pleasant. The wine list has all Italian bottles, nothing less than $48. My dining companion and I shared a $60 bottle of wine from some part of Italy that was superb.They gave us a salted square foccacia to start with, which seemed pretzel-like. It wasn't warm but it was nice. During the dinner there was also a guy walking around with various types of bread. We tried a few and all were very nice.Our meal started with a fantastic amuse bouche of a curried ricotta ball with a squash soup poured over it. It was small, simple, and simply splendid. The perfect way to start the meal.For an appetizer we shared Falai's take on a mushroom salad. It was three different types of mushrooms, all flavored differently and all delicately plated with different sauces underneath. It was such a unique dish. I was astonished how each mushroom not only tasted different, but their textures were all different as well. I truly loved this dish.For entrees we shared the gnudi and venison loin. One great aspect I'd like to point out about Falai is that they split the entrees for two. So, instead of giving one bowl of the gnudi to me and a plate of venison to my companion, making us reach over and try each other's dishes; we both got a bowl of gnudi and we both got a plate of venison. I loved it.Now, back to that gnudi. They were two green balls made of baby spinach and ricotta served in a butter and sage sauce. The gnudi were soft, fluffy, and purely delicate. The butter and sage at the bottom of the bowl was soothing. This was an amazing dish.The venison loin came with a root vegetable called Salsify and a beet jam. It was perfectly cooked medium rare, tender and juicy. I liked it a lot.For dessert we shared the passion fruit souffle. It had a crusty top with some powdered sugar, and our waiter pierced a hole in the middle with a spoon and poured the passion fruit sauce inside. The souffle was airy, and wasn't too heavy at all, which I truly enjoyed. The passion fruit wasn't too sweet and tasted great. The dish was orgasmic and unbelievable!Too be honest, this was one of the great dining experiences of my life. It was all very delicate and precise, and I enjoyed every part of the meal. The service was nice as well. I think the superb wine helped a bit too, I cannot lie. I definitely plan on going back to Falai to indulge in another amazing experience. Or at least have another go with that souffle. You should too.Falai68 Clinton St. (at Rivington St.)New York, NY 10002

Last Wednesday I had a meal at Izakaya Ten, a new Japanese small plates restaurant that recently opened on 23rd Street and 10th Ave. It inhabits what was previously the Korean-French restaurant D'or Ahn, which happened to have been one of my favorite restaurants in NYC. I was sad to see it had closed, but intrigued to see what filled it's space.The interior is almost the same- except it looks much worse. There is a bar up front and tables in the back. But, what was once sleek and modern, now looks worn and thrown together. The lighting was dim, and I was not impressed with the lack of decor or mood the place now had.I decided to order three small plates from the specials menu. The first was raw octopus marinated in wasabi ($5). The dish was slimey but I enjoyed the kick the wasabi gave it. It was definitely a peculiar dish, and I'm always a fan of exploring and experimenting.The next dish I tried was the Japanese sausage ($5). The plate came with three sausages and some mustard on the side. The sausages were juicy and tasty. The skin was just slightly crispy. They reminded me of a mix between a hot dog and kielbase. They definitely made for a nice snack.The last dish I had was the marinated kimchee with pork belly ($8). The dish was very good. The kimchee was perfectly cooked, the pork belly was slightly over cooked, but when I mixed the two, the combination was perfect. Just the right amount of flavor and tenderness.Izakaya Ten is definitely no D'or Ahn. But, it's a nice little neighborhood spot to get some decent Japanese small plates for a not a lot of money. I'd definitely go back and try other dishes. I'm always a fan of getting the most bang for your buck. Izakaya Ten207 10th Avenue (at 23rd Street)New York, NY 10011

Izakaya = Japanese bar. The \"worn and thrown together\" may totally fit the atmosphere for an izakaya - they aren't supposed to be all chic and modern. When I lived in Japan I used to eat at izakayas all the time. I love \"Japanese tapas\" AND in Japan they serve my all-time favorite beverage,nama-lemon sour. If you ever need any other izakaya reccommendations just ask me, the izakaya queen!

Tuesday night I decided to go to a new Japanese restuarant that opened on up on Restaurant Row (46th street bet. 8th and 9th) called Sushi of Gari 46. There is a Gari on the Upper East Side and Upper West Side and I had heard great things, so I was very excited to hear one had opened up down the block from my apartment.The restaurant is modern and a touch sleek. I sat at the sushi bar. The lighting at the sushi bar area is very bright, and unromantic, I'd guess to highlight the art being produced at the bar.The first thing the waitress asked me when she approached me was if I were going to order the Chef's Omakase Special ($75). I felt she was trying to push this on me and it was a total turn-off.I always order sushi deluxes when I eat sushi. It's the best way to taste a restaurant's sushi because it comes with assorted pieces of different sushi. I ordered the deluxe here which came with 9 pieces of sushi and one roll. I also got an appetizer of monkfish liver in ponzu sauce.The monkfish liver, which I had never had before, was good. The ponzu sauce was tangy and was the perfect complement to the interesting textured liver. I even slurped all the sauce after I had eaten the entire liver. It was a unique dish, which I enjoyed.Then my sushi deluxe ($30) arrived. It was sublime. All the fish was fresh, great, and excellent. Some of the best sushi I have ever encountered. I will admit it is a tad pricier then your average sushi spot, but, it's also better. You definitely get what you pay for.I would love to come back to Sushi of Gari 46 and try their other dishes and even their Omakase special- on my own terms.Sushi of Gari 46347 W 46th Street (bet. 8th and 9th ave.)New York, NY 10036

Friday night I decided to go to a new tapas spot that opened up in the Flatiron district called Boqueria. I walked in to a packed house which I expected. There is a nice looking bar up front with various cheeses enclosed by glass. Some small bar tables along the wall, and then a room in back with a long communal table in the middle. This was one of the draws of the restaurant that drew me. I envisioned myself eating at this long table and striking up a conversation with the neighboring diners. Alas, when I told the hostess it was just me she pointed to the bar area, where she said I could eat. All the seats were taken so I took up the only spot available; standing in the corner by the entrance in front of the gal in charge of the cheese. It was very uncomfortable but I didn't mind as long as I could try some food.I started my meal with a $9 glass of Spanish wine. The wine was good, but the bartender, (who by the way needed to smile more-he seemed nice but I wished for a more positive vibe) I feel underpoured the glass. He finished what was left in the bottle, and I thought he might come back to add some more-he didn't. I struck up a conversation with the \"cheese\" gal, and asked her for some recommendations. Her being the \"cheese\" gal she started talking to me with her Spanish accent about the various cheeses they had. I didn't really understand her, so I just nodded and told her to give me three of her recommendations. The cheeses came with three pieces of toasted rasin bread. I honestly have no idea what I type of cheese I was eating, but can tell you all were good. I liked how they were all different from each other, in texture as well as taste. This was definitely a nice start to a meal, and at $4 per cheese, I found it to be a great deal. This is definitely a nice spot for a date.After fifteen minutes some seats opened up for me at the bar next to me, so I got to sit. I decided to order another glass of wine and some tapas. Alas, my wine was poured to the same amount. I'm either not experienced enough in proper pourage or I was being ripped off, either way, the wine still tasted nice. I decided to order the three creamy croquetas and the grilled lamb tapas.The croquetas came with serrano ham, chicken and mushrooms. They were very creamy and tasted nice. Although there was much more cream flavor then chicken or ham, I still enjoyed them.The grilled lamb was marinated in lemon and cumin and came on two skewers on two pieces of small toasted baguettes. The lamb was tender and tasty and the lemon and cumin gave the flavor a nice kick.That is all I ordered. I just wanted to get my first look into this new tapas joint. I think I'll come back with some more people and order some more of their bigger dishes. But I'll make sure, before we go, to drink one or two bottles of wine first.Boqueria53 W. 19th Street (bet. 5th and 6th Ave.)New York, NY 10011

Today for lunch I decided to go to a new burger joint that opened up in the West Village; BLT Burger. BLT Burger is the lastest restaurant from popular NYC restaurateur/chef Laurent Tourondel (BLT stands for Bistro Laurent Tourondel).The place is not fancy or stylish at all like his other restaurants (BLT Steak, BLT Fish,BLT Prime). Its plain and simple with a bar up front, then walls lined with booths and some tabels in the middle. At the end wall there is a huge mirror with a huge stuffed bullhead with huge horns on it. The place reminded me of any bar or burger joint you might find in the suburbs.The menu consists of your typical burger joint classics; regular burgers, turkey burgers, and ups it up a notch with a lamb burger , an \"ahi\" tuna sandwich, and a kobe beef burger. They have have a few salads and appetizers too. There is also a large beer selection and milkshake section, which you can get \"spiked\".I went with the classic burger combo which came with a burger, fries and a fountain soda for $11. The burgers are 100% Beef Burgers and a combination of Sirloin, Short Rib, Chuck & Brisket Cut and are served on a Soft Bun with Tomato, Red Onion, Iceburg Lettuce, Pickles, Ketchup, Mustard & Mayo. I got mine with Monterey Jack Cheese. I was expecting a massive burger, but when it came out it was much smaller and flatter then I expected. This wasn't a bad thing. It tasted fine, but it didn't blow me away.I also got some waffle fries with melted cheddar on them. They were crispy and tasty. My coke was perfect.I ended with the peanut butter milkshake which was sweet but fine.BLT Burger is a nice burger joint and I'll probably come back some time to try another type of burger or some chicken wings with some beer. The prices are fine which is nice cause it gave me an insight into what is turning out to be the BLT Empire.BLT Burger470 6th Avenue (bet. 11th and 12th st.)New York, NY 10011

I agree wholeheartedly - don't walk in believing this is a restaurant akin to the other BLT. It's more a mix between Corner Bistro and the average small burger pub vibes. I think that the burger is underwhelming - particularly for the price, which is only a tad high, making it more of an insult than an extravagance.

Last night my sisters and I decided to go out to dinner for my younger sister's birthday. My older sister works in the East Village, so that was our dining destination. We ended up going to the 2-month old Cuban restaurant on St. Marks called Cafe Fuego. I heard good things about this spot, and was excited to venture into Cuban territory, a cuisine I rarely indulge in.The place looks really nice. It's a casual atmosphere, but still gives you that romantic feel. The first thing that caught my eye when I looked at the menu was the prices. It was all cheap and the highest priced dish was $17.95. We started with a $55 dollar bottle of Champagne from California, which actually is not champagne, but sparkling wine. It was great. A touch sweet, but not too sweet.For appetizers we had the empanada with chicken, the calamari on a corn medley, and choripan- which is bread with melted mozzarella and chorizo.The empanada was excellent. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. It came with a tangy green sauce that complimented it well.The choripan was not that great. It reminded me of a more Italian sandwich. But, a \"not that good\" sandwich you might get at your local \"not that good\" deli.The calamari was not that good either. It was more corn medley than calamari. And the flavor was basically non-existent. I added lime, which did nothing to the overblandness of the dish.For my entree I decided to try the suckling pig with onions, tomatoes and rice and beans. Suckling pig is not something I ever had, so I was excited, and asked the waitress to make sure that pig was suckling! Well, this dish was a huge disappointment. In fact, it might have been the most dry piece of meat I have ever encountered in my life. There was no flavor. I assumed the onions and garlic were supposed to help moisten the pig, but they did nothing. It was truly awful. I didn't send it back, and in fact finished it, but I should definitely have sent it back.My sister ordered a shrimp dish that was bland too. The shrimps had garlic on them, but it didn't taste good at all. It came with an even more bland yellow rice. Do they have salt and pepper in Cuba??My other sister ordered a steak which came with a green garlic and butter sauce. It was ok, and had least gave the steak a bit of flavor. The best part of her dish, and probably of all the dishes were the fries that came with the steak. They were extremely crispy, just the way I like them. They were actually some of the best fries I have encountered. I guess I'm a crispiness fanatic!For dessert the restaurant gave us everything for free- due to it being my sister's birthday. This was very generous of them, and luckily the desserts did not dissappoint. The churros with dulce de leche were amazing. Sweet, tasty, and crispy! Delicious! The bread pudding was not overly sweet and really good too. The flan was sweet but tasted great. The chocolate puta (yes, that is what they call their chocolate cake) was fine.Would I go back to this restaurant? That is a very interesting question. I really wanted to like this place. I hate to say you get what you pay for, but in this case what we got for our money was mostly bland and flavorless. The restaurant is young and I will give it another try to get all their flavor kinks out. Also, they were understaffed, instead of the usual four servers, they only had two. Maybe the kitchen felt the pressure. But, the main reason I'd go back is to have those churros one more time!So if you are in the East Village and looking to get your Cuban on for cheap you might consider Cafe Fuego. Let's just hope by that time you get more bang for your buck. Cafe Fuego9 St. Marks Place (between 2nd and 3rd avenue)New York, NY 10001

Sunday night my family went out to dinner for my younger sister's birthday. I sent my sister a list of 20 options I thought she might like, and she went with Landmarc in Tribeca. Landmarc is known for having a great wine deal. Unlike most restaurants they don't mark up the half or full bottles of wine, so basically you are paying what you would pay if you went to a wine store. I think this is great. More importantly, I think Landmarc is a great restaurant.It's a two story space with exposed brick and is very welcoming. For appetizers we tried the Roasted Marrow Bones with onion marmalade and grilled country bread, the Foie Gras terrine with pickled onions, the grilled Octopus with potatoes and tomatoes, chorizo vinaigratte , and the Mussels with shallots parsley and white wine, and fries.The Roasted Bone Marrows were good, and we were instructed by the waitress to place some onion marmalade on the grilled country bread, then the marrow, then to add a pinch of salt. The result was delicious! The Foie Gras was also excellent; smooth and tasty. The Octopus dish was perfectly flavored and nice. And the mussels were also delicious. The fries were fine and came with some mayo.For my entree I had the Braised Lamb Shank with celery root puree, brussels sprouts and lardons. This was a great dish. The lamb was tender, fall-off the bone. I loved the celery puree and the lardons. It was truly all delicious!My father had the crispy sweetbreads with horseradish and green beans. This was another winner. Everything tasted great. My younger sister went with the steak tartare with grilled country bread and field greens. It was very tasty. My older sister had the grilled pork chop with sauteed spinach, carmelized onions, and apples. I really enjoyed how the apples and onions complimented the tender pork. My mom had the grilled tuna with white bean ragout, sweet garlic, red peppers and parsely. It was good and fine.What I liked most about all these entrees was that they were all perfectly cooked and everything on each plate perfectly complimented the main dish. The sides weren't just thrown on for no reason. It all went well with each other. And thus, everything tasted great!For dessert we tried one of each (creme brulee, blueberry crumble, nutella eclair, lemon tart, chocolate mousse, and tiramisu) and they did not dissappoint. My favorite was the lemon tart. The tanginess and sweetness balanced each other perfectly. We tried three ice-creams; hazlenut, coffee and tangerine sorbet. All came in cones and all were great.Landmarc is the perfect restaurant. It's elegantly casual without being too stuffy. It's almost like dining in a neighbor's house for dinner. The food is great. The wine is great. I definitely recommend it. Also, the good news for people who live uptown and don't feel like trekking all the way to Tribeca; they are opening up a Landmarc in the Time Warner Center.Landmarc179 West BroadwayNew York, NY 10013

As I was wandering around the Lower East Side on Friday night, in search of a culinary destination, I passed by The Orchard. This is a restaurant I have read about, and decided to dine there.I was told it was BYOB, and although I had spent the whole fashion week drinking, and told myself just to order coke, I pursuaded myself to go across the street and buy a bottle of wine (a great $11 red) for myself. I sat at a table of four by myself. The dining room is casual and modern. The lighting is brightly dim, if that makes sense; almost orange. It was a large square room, which made me think of it like a fancied cafeteria. It looked good though.I wasn't too hungry but did want to try some dishes. They have a nice selection of flatbreads, and I went with the Braised Short Rib flatbread with marinated cherry tomatoes and sweet horseradish cream ($12). It was excellent and delicious.I also had an entree of Butternut Squash Agnolotti with brown butter, sage and toasted hazlenuts ($22). The dish was sweet, and was definitely an autumn/winter dish. But, it was still very good.I felt obligated to try a dessert, and went with the Orchard Chocolate cake with dark chocolate outside, warm milk chocolate inside, and mascarpone whipped cream. This was a great dessert, especially for a chocolate lover. I dont know how they did it, but the inside was really warm, and delicious. The marscapone whipped cream was the best whipped cream I have ever had in my life-deliciously perfect!The Orchard is definitely a place I'd like to go back to and try all of their dishes. I definitely recommend this place!The Orchard162 Orchard Street (between Stanton and Rivington)New York, NY 10002

Friday night I decided to head to The Little Owl in the West Village, a restaurant I had read a lot about; all good things. Frank Bruni of the NY Times was raving about it's pork chop, so I figured I may as well head on down to see what he was raving about.Before I left, I called to see if they took reservations, and let them know I would be dining alone. I asked if maybe I could sit at the bar, for I didn't want to take a table away from more people. The guy on the phone, Gabrielle, who happened to be the manager/co-owner said to me not to worry, we'll do whatever we can to accommodate you. This was already a good sign of what was to come.The Little Owl sits on the quiet corner of Bedford and Grove in the West Village. It's a small restaurant, and when I walked in the first phrase that came into my mind was \"Neighborhood spot\". Although small, it is very charming. My favorite aspect of the restaurant is that there are large windows inside where you can look into the kitchen. I love this!There were four barstools at the bar, all taken. Gabrielle got a chair for me and put me at the head of the bar to accommodate me. I ordered a $12 glass of wine from the Shinn Estate on Long Island, called Wild Boar Doe. It was sweet, and great.For my appetizer I started with the Ricotta Cavatelli ($11) with fava beans, tomato broth and pancetta. It was excellent. The pasta was perfectly cooked, fluffy almost. The broth was soothing.And then I had the Pork Chop ($19) with parmesan butter beans and wild dandelion. I must admit, Bruni was right. It was actually the best pork chop I've ever had. Crispy on the outside, tender and juicy on the inside. It was a massive hunk of deliciousness!For dessert I tried the chocolate brownie with espresso ice cream. Well, at least that is what it said on the menu. In fact, I was given chocolate ice cream, and when I brought this to the server's attention she told me that they had run out of espresso. This was minor, the chocolate was fine, but I do wish I was told this before I ordered, for I was really looking foward to some espresso ice cream. The brownie was fine, but nothing too spectacular.But, I left The Little Owl feeling very satisfied, a big smile on my face. I couldn't wait to come back. The Little Owl is the perfect neighborhood restaurant, and in fact, is not even in my neighborhood! Thus, The Little Owl is the perfect restaurant-period.

***CONTENT
When I heard that four sushi chefs from big and popular sushi restaurants in NYC (Megu, Nobu 57) teamed up to open a new, smaller Japanese spot in the East Village I was intrigued.Last night was my first encounter with Le Miu. It is a long restaurant with a bar up front, not overly chic. It was nice and simple which suited me just fine. The restaurant was not crowded at all, it was a Tuesday night, and I decided to dine at the sushi bar. I had sushi on Sunday (from Haru-very good), so opted not to have it again. They had a special tapas menu which looked good, so I decided to try some tapas.The first one I tried was the Rock Shrimp tempura with the chef's sour cream. I've had great rock shrimp tempura appetizers both at NOBU and Bond St. and was eager to compare Le Miu's take on the dish. I sat alone at the bar, staring into the sushi windows waiting for the dish. I'm not sure if it was because I was just tired, lonely and bored, but it seemed to have been taking a long time. I kept looking around the restaurant to confirm with myself that there were probably only around eight other tables full. When it finally arrived I encountered a hot and somewhat tasty dish. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, and the sauce had a nice kick to it, but for some reason it left a weird after-taste, almost like cheddar cheese! So, the dish was fine, but I prefer Nobu and Bond St.'s Rock Shrimp tempura.My next tapas was recommended by one of the cooks there. It was called chicken karage, which tasted almost like a General Tso's chicken dish, with it's sweet sauce. It was hot and fine as well.My final tapas was the best of the night, and was quite intriguing, and more of what I expected in creativity and taste. It was cubed pork infused in soy sauce with Japanese pumpkin tempura. It was excellent. Tender, tasty, perfect.For dessert I decided to have a spicy tuna roll, just to get my sushi fix in, and use it as a comparison to other spicy tuna rolls at other sushi spots. The roll was fine, and the interesting touch they added was cucumber in it, which I never encountered in a spicy tuna roll. It gave it a nice crunch and snap to it, but I felt it was also a bit too cold and wet, and would have preferred just the tuna, no cucumber.Would I go back to Le Miu? Yes. They have a chef's tasting menu for $55 that sparked my interest. They also had interesting dishes from the kitchen I wanted to try as well. But, the entire time I was there, during my Japanese tapas experience, I couldn't stop thinking about Oga Japanese tapas, my pick for one of the best hidden treasures in NYC, and great Japanese tapas.So for a low-key, different Japanese restaurant experience I recommend Le Miu. For the best and most unusual Japanese tapas in NYC, Oga is the spot.Le Miu107 Avenue A, (Btwn 6th & 7th St )New York, NY 10009 Oga Japanese Tapas (this restaurant has closed)143 East 47th Street (bet. 3rd and Lexington)New York, NY 10017

Saturday night my friend who writes reviews for NY Magazine invited me to dinner at Empanada Mama, a small empanada spot in Hells Kitchen I had recommended to him.I was excited for two reasons. The first being I had been there once before and enjoyed the empanadas, thus the reason for the recommendation. The second reason of course was that I was not paying!The the long list of empanadas are made in either wheat flour or corn flour. We ordered a bunch of them. From the wheat side we tried the cheesesteak, spicy chicken, and the spinach and cheese. From the corn side we ordered the chili and beef, and chicken with peas and carrots.Every empanada we tasted was truly excellent. The corn flour ones were a tad crispier, and I liked that. All the meat inside, including the chicken and beef was very tender and juicy-perfectly cooked.We also tried the veal and rice ball tapas. I never tried anything like it and it was also wonderful.For dessert we tried the belgian chocolate and banana empanada, as well as the fig, cheese and belgian chocolate empanada. They were both delicious, and in fact the fig, cheese, and chocolate empanada turned out to be my favorite one of all. I never thought chocolate and cheese would be a great pairing. But the warmth of the chocolate and melted cheese together was superb.The most amazing fact about this restaurant is the pricing. Each empanada ranges from $1.75 to $3.00 each. This is truly one of the best deals in town. I recommend Empanada Mama to anyone interested in a great deal and great food.Empanada Mama763 9th Ave, (at 51st St)New York, NY 10019

Friday night after a comedy show in the East Village I decided to head to a Ma*Ya, a thai restaurant that was recommended on Time Out NY on Demand - channel 1112.Ma*Ya has a few tables on the first floor, and a bunch more downstairs. I sat upstairs, and I felt as if i were in a hut on the outskirts of Bangkok, as I watched the rain pour down.As I perused the menu I was given a complimentary basket of shrimp chips with peanut dipping sauce. I always love free snacks and food. And I loved this snack, with its delicious tasting sauce. What a great start!The menu is made up of tapas, appetizers and entrees. I tried a tapas of stir-fried panang curry peanut with beef ($7.50) (which I believe is actually Malaysian). It was very good, and I enjoyed the vegetables that came with it as well.I asked both waiters what their favorite dish was, and both told me it was the appetizer of crispy ribs in spicy tamarind glaze ($8.95)-so I ordered it. They were really good too. It was very sweet, but also had a nice kick of spiciness to it. It was cooked perfectly, the meat fell off the bone.I really enjoyed the food and atmosphere here. The place is cool and hip, with a real homey feeling though. In fact, I enjoyed my experience so much, I went again with my family on Sunday.I was very excited to try more of Ma*ya's dishes, and they didn't disappoint. We asked Kevin, my waiter from Friday night for recommendations, and we heeded his advice. We started with the Malaysian flat breads with chicken curry dipping sauce, the spicy thai chicken lettuce cup, and the Asian crusted Ahi Tuna.The flatbreads ($4.95) were excellent. Warm, crispy, and the dipping sauce was addictively tasty. The chicken lettuce cups ($7.95), were refreshing, flavorful, light, and also tasty. The tuna ($7.95) was rare and simple, but very nice.For entrees we had Grilled skirt steak with Thai chili dipping sauce, Jumbo Shrimp and Japanese eggplant in red curry coconut sauce, and the Crispy filet whole fish with Thai long bean basil spicy three flavor sauce.The steak ($16.95) was perfectly cook, tender, and didn't even need the sauce, which was too tangy for me. The Jumbo shrimp ($16.00) was excellent. The red curry sauce had the perfect balance of sweetness and spiciness and I loved the dish. The standout of the night was the Crispy whole fish ($18.95). The meat just fell of the bone and the flavors were powerful and amazing; it was truly a great dish.I really love this place and recommend it for anybody in the neighborhood, or if you want to go on a cool date with your signifcant other, family, or by yourself, it's worth the trip to the East Village. The prices are great, and it truly is a great bang for your buck. So for great flavors in a great atomosphere Ma*ya hits the spot.

Last Saturday I decided to head downtown to one of my favorite restaurants in NYC; Fatty Crab. It's a Malaysian restaurant in the West Village helmed by chef/owner Zak Palaccio (who also helms 5 Ninth and is creating a Malaysian menu at a spot on the roof at 230 Fifth Avenue. I actually partied with Zak a few months ago too).Fatty Crab is very casual and makes you feel as if you are dining in a hut in Kuala Lampur. I like the lack of superficiality the restaurant exumes unlike many of it's nearby neighbors, a stones throw away in the Meatpacking District.I've been here on many occasions and each time all the dishes are extremely flavorful. The one big setback I will say about the food here, is that although flavorful, many dishes are extremely spicy too. I am a fan of spicy food, but I prefer a balance between hottness and sweetness, and hate it when spiciness is overpowering, takes over the dish, and lingers in my mouth after each bite. I've had many dishes here where this lingering of spice occurs, and Saturday was no exception. I would assume that this is probably typical of Malaysian cooking, where Mr. Palaccio spent some years studying and cooking. There are also dishes that you can order that aren't as spicy, which is a good thing. So, despite this setback, I am always drawn back to the Fatty Crab for the flavors, the ambiance, and the inexpensive prices.On this occasion, I started with a dish that won the 2006 Eat Out award for \"Most deliciously unhealthy salad\" from Time Out NY, which was the Watermelon pickle and crispy pork salad ($7). Now, I'm not a huge fan of watermelon, but this dish actually works splendidly. The watermelon is such a refreshing balance to the crispy tender pork. It also had some greens to make it more salad-like. It is a delicious and tasty salad.For my entree I tried the Fatty Duck ($9). The duck was very tender, very flavorful, but of course very spicy, and the spice did linger around my mouth for a while. They have a nice selection of Asian beers at the Fatty Crab and I decided to accompany my meal with a large Morimoto Soba Ale. It was excellent.So if you are looking for flavorful food, with a huge kick of spiciness, and for a good price, the Fatty Crab is a perfect place to go. Sit back, grab a large beer, let the spices flow and remember to have a fun time. I always do. Fatty Crab643 Hudson St (Btwn Horatio & Gansevoort St)New York, NY 10014

Thomas Keller's Per Se is said to be one of the best restaurants in NYC, maybe in the entire U.S., and even in the world. So when I heard he was opening up a bakery one floor below his restaurant in the Time Warner Center I got excited. Now common folk who cannot land a reservation at one of his 16 tables, or afford his cooking, would be able to taste some of his culinary delights.I went to Keller's Bouchon Bakery for lunch today. I got a roast pork sandwich with tonnado aioli on a Frech Bread, a GUS's Meyer Lemon Soda, and finished with a homemade Nutter Butter. The sandwich ($8.75) was fine, but I was expecting to be wowed. I was not. It was quite boring and I have had similar sandwiches at other establishments not helmed by top chefs. This was a total disappointment. The lemon soda was very good, not too sweet. The Nutter Butter was also very good, two peanut butter cookies with peanut butter in the middle. The peanut butter was creamy and smooth, and not overpowering. I'd say the best part of my lunch was the soda, which was not made on the premises. In fact, I do not intend to go back to try the other sandwiches or desserts offered.

Dining Out Alone: Buddakan

Last night I went to crash the Taste of NY event, like i did last year. I was inside, and then some security dude asked to see my wristband, which i didnt have. I talked to someone in charge telling them i was there to do magic, but he said the event was ending. So a bit upset, I decided to cheer myself up by checking out two \"hot spots\" I've been meaning to try; Morimoto and Buddakan. I stopped by Morimoto just for a \"wasabatini\" and then made my way to Buddakan, which is on the opposite end of the block.Buddakan is HUGE! I had a 10:45 reservation, and was seated at 10:55. The service was slow though. In fact, it didnt seem too packed at that time, but my waiter was taking a long time. He did apologize which was ok, but, it was annoying. I started with the edamame dumplings, recommended by the hostess and the waiter. They were good. They came in a shark fin broth which was soothing. I devoured them quickly. The waiter talked me into trying a cocktail as well. It was called \"heat\", which had tequila, cointreau and chilied cucumbers. It was excellent. For my entree I went with the charred filet of beef with wanton potatoes and mustard sauce. When a server brought it over, he poured some soy infused butter onto my meat. The potatoes were actually potato chips; crispy, tasty, but disappointing, considering the dish cost me 27 bucks! I felt ripped off. The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare, except it was lukewarm. After eating three slices, I felt it needed something else; the sauce on it was fine, but I was bored. I decided to order the house special rice with scallop congee. It was excellent (at the time). I was too full for dessert. At the end of the meal, I was trying to see which was the best part of the meal; the cocktail or the rice. I was totally unimpressed and disappointed. I had higher expectations. After trying to figure out which was better, I thought about the dishes some more, and realized something. The rice, which 10 minutes ago i thought was excellent, was in fact just like rice with shrimp and lobster sauce that u can get at any take-out joint, only a tad sweeter. The cocktail, with its spicy kick to it, which i thought was excellent 24 minutes ago, was in fact, similar to a cocktail with jalapenos I had at the Stanton Social a while back-not as original as i thought. So, was the environment and \"scene\" playing with my emotions? Was I trying to enjoy the food more because of my high expectations and all the positive reviews i have read? YES! For a good chinese meal, for like 3 times less, I may as well go to Chinatown. Will I go back, and do i want to try the other dishes? YES. I want to give Buddakan another try- but, my first try was a let down. Buddakan75 Ninth Ave., at 16th St.New York, NY 10011 Morimoto88 10th AveNew York, NY 10011

Friday night my two sisters and I went to Victor's cafe, a popular Cuban restaurant in midtown. I knew this as a tourist spot, with decent food. And that is exactly what I encountered on this visit.It was very crowded and very loud, which made for a festive atmosphere, but you did need to talk loudly to your dining companions in order to be heard. We all shared the empanada filled with lobster, served with sweet Cachucha pepper pesto. Although this savory turnover was tasty, it was cold in the middle, and needed to be baked a little longer.For an entree I ordered the Filet Mignon Criollo, which is a prime beef tenderloin marinated with Cuban adobo and served with fire-roasted peppers, onions and sweet plantains. The meat was perfectly cooked and tender, but I found the dish quite boring and would have enjoyed some sort of sauce, or anything to liven it up a bit. The peppers and onions just made the dish more dull, and the sweet plantains were non-existent.My younger sister fared much better with a great red snapper dish, which was cloaked in a crunchy green plantain crust, and served with Cuban sofrito sauce and Afro-Cuban plantain mash. This was a great dish. The snapper was crunchy and flavorful, and everything on the plate worked well and balanced each other beautifully. It was also very colorful to look at. My older sister went with the Paella, brimming with an assortment of lobster, mussels, clams, shrimp, and meats. Although the dish didn't amaze me, it was fine, but I did feel it could have used some more spice, for it was slightly bland.Also, all dishes (except rice dishes) came with white rice and black beans, which I enjoyed. The black beans had the perfect balance of saltiness to them.For dessert we tried the Bonbon Cubano, molten chocolate lava cake served with coconut ice cream. This dessert was fine, although it was hard to love, cause all I could do was fantasize about that chocolate molten cake I had eaten the previous week at Oga Japanese Tapas.So, if you are looking for Cuban fare before a show in a Times Square theater, that sometimes hits, but sometimes misses, Victor's Cafe is a fine choice, considering there is not much competition in the area. .Victor's Cafe236 W 52nd StNew York, NY 10019

Saturday was a gorgeous day. I walked downtown to the West Village to meet up with my sister to grab dinner. We decided to walk around until we found the perfect spot. A spot that called us both with some culinary magnetism. After walking through the West Village, through Soho, and perusing the menus outside many restaurants, our journey took us to Nolita. This is where on the corner of a quiet block a restaurant called both our names (and stomachs).The chosen restaurant was Barmarche. It's a causal setting, a perfect neighborhood spot. I was dressed in shorts and a T-shirt and fit right in.We started with the Maine Diver Scallop entree with a salsa borracha. The scallops were slightly crispy on the top, perfectly tender, and were complimented beautifully with the salsa, with just the right amount of spiciness. This was a great start.My sister ordered a Rainbow Trout entree with herbal harcot vert and an Albarino caper reduction. The fish was very crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and the caper reduction was a calming touch to the dish. It tasted delicious.I too was in the mood for fish and ordered the \"60 second swordfish\", with crushed avocado and jalapeno creme fraiche. For some reason they didn't have the swordfish and replaced it with Mahi Mahi. It was tasty and delicious as well.For dessert we had a chocolate flourless cake with dulce de leche ice cream. The cake almost tasted like a brownie, but was good, and the ice cream was splendid.It was a very satisfying meal and I felt content when I was finished. I was proud of our culinary magnetism. So, if you are ever in the neighborhood of Nolita (North of Little Italy) Barmarche is the perfect casual restaurant for a pefectly cooked meal.Barmarche14 Spring Street (at Elizabeth Street)New York, NY 10012

Oga Japanese Tapas (this restaurant has unfortunately closed)

Last night I had an amazing dining experience. I actually did not dine alone, but with an older gal (38 yr old doctor) who paid for my meal. That alone is pretty amazing, but the food where I ate is really what made this night.The destination was Oga Japanese Tapas, which is on a stretch of 47th street with many other authentic Japanese restaurants. I had been there once before, and had I tried an eel and mozzarella broth and a duck tapas. Both were great, thus I knew I needed to return to try more of the extensive tapas menu.The dining room is in the back, past the bar up front, and past the sushi bar in the middle. It's a small white room, not too decorative besides three plants. It does have a glass ceiling though, so it's like dining in a sunroom (or moonroom), which is somewhat cool. On a clear night it might be nice to look up and look at the stars, although there is an apartment building overshadowing the restaurant.The menu at Oga is made up of warm and cold tapas on one side, and authentic Maki rolls on the other. The most expensive dish is 22 dollars, which isn't bad at all. My dining companion and I started with two specials: the Uzu striped bass and the spanish mackerel sashimi, which came with a seasame dipping sauce. This dish was light and great. The striped bass had this amazing smokiness to it, that reminded me of a gourmet version of sable. What a perfect start to the meal. After devouring all the pieces of sashimi, we tried another special: the octopus salad. It came with fried octopus on top, and octopus sashimi mixed with chopped tomatoes and mozzarella. There was some plum sauce and red pepper flakes on the side of the plate. Again, the dish was light, simple, and perfect. It was delicately prepared, looked like a work of art, and tasted refreshing.Our next dish was the Spicy Tuna Tostado. It was almost like a sushi pizza. It seems Chef Oga enjoys fusing Japan, Italy and Mexico into his cooking, and he does a wonderful job at it. The dish was excellent, and I now think I would rather have this dish than pizza any day.Our final dish was a squid and scallop baked in spicy mayo, presented in a big shell. This dish was fantastic. The baked spicy mayo actually looked like mozzarella cheese, but it was just the mayo. We took our spoons and penetrated the mayo to scoop up the treasures inside (squid and scallops), which swam in a warm, sweet broth. Soothingly delicious!We ended our meal with two great desserts. One was a popular shiso leaf sorbet which was very refreshing. The other was the chocolate cake which the hostess suggested before we were seated. It was a great suggestion. We pierced the cake ever so gently, and warm chocolate oozed out. It wasn's too sweet which was nice, and came with some pretty green tea cream on the plate as well. This chocolate cake, like the rest of the food at Oga Japanese Tapas, was light, simple, and truly one of a kind delicious. I have never encountered food like this before. For a Saturday night the place was pretty empty, which meant no wait for a table. The place is a hidden treasure. If you are seeking a meal that will please all your senses, Oga is a great spot.They have some great sakes and shochus as well, and Sapporo on tap!Oga Japanese Tapas143 E. 47th StreetNew York, NY 10017

On Saturday afternoon I planned to go to a new Thai/Vietnamese spot in the East Village called Tigerland. Unfortunately I got there at around 1pm, and found out it wasn't open until 5:30. I decided to head to a Soba spot I passed along the way on 5th Street between Second and First Ave called Soba Koh.I was the only one there which was ok, although I got a tad nervous that the waiter and waitress would be staring at me as I ate each bite. The decor is very wooden. Wooden chairs, wooden walls, it reminded me of a sleeker version of Tomoe Sushi (172 Thompson Street); very authentic Japanese. It whisked me away out of the East Village, to the outskirts of Tokyo (although random hipsters walking by the window killed this fantasy at times.) Not being a big time consumer of Soba, I told the waitress that this was my first time there, and asked her for a recommendation. She recommended the Lunch Bento Box, which was $17.00. I took her recommendation. This was truly a great lunch. The bento came with homemade buckwheat soba noodles along with a dipping sauce. The noodles are very fresh, for they have a noodle-maker in a room behind a glass pane, where I could view him making the noodles. Also in the box was an egg omelet (tomago) with various japanese vegetables, seaweed, a special rice dish, tempura (shrimp, eel, vegetable). The eel was amazing, I had never had it tempura style, and it was delicious. Also in the box were two pieces of grilled chicken. Mid-meal the waitress came by and added some broth to the dipping sauce, turning it into a nice soup. I ended the meal with some refreshing green tea ice cream.I definitely recommend this place. It's one of the best restaurants under $25 in NYC. It truly is a great find!Soba Koh309 E. 5th StreetNew York, NY 10003
