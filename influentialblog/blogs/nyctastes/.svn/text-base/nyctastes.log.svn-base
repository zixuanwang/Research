My friends were in town last weekend for a special bachelorette weekend. After hitting up the Yankee game Friday night we awoke Saturday morning in need of a solid brunch.I wanted to try something new so we headed over to Kellari Parea, a Greek Bistro near my apartment.We got there right at noon and were the first ones there. Not even the jazz band had set up yet.We sat up front near the nice big windows that let the sunlight stream though.Each breakfast came with a drink so we got a Mimosa, Bloody Mary and glass of Champagne.I was psyched. I was loving the atmosphere, the drinks, everything. This place had the potential to be awesome I thought. And it could have been! If it wasn't for a few big problems. But I'll get to that.After we ordered they brought out some bread and a little plate filled with olives, radishes and hummus.The hummus was pretty good but a little bit too garlicky for a morning start.Then our entrees arrived. My friend and I both ordered the American breakfast, which was a platter of eggs, bacon and greek fries.OMG the eggs were so good! I'm not sure what they did to them but they were some of the best eggs I have ever had. Light, fluffy and buttery mounds of goodness!And the fries! Don't get me started! They had just the right amount of crispiness and were shaken with a perfect blend of spices.So where did the problems begin? Well here is my friend's dish the New Yorker.Hmm..let's see a big scoop of cream cheese, some beautifully presented salmon and what else...something is missing.Where's the bagel? The most integral part of the dish?We figured it had to be coming so we all just kind of sat there waiting to dig into our meals for about 5 minutes.Finally our waiter noticed something was wrong and came running up and explained that the kitchen was out of bagels. And would she like some pita bread instead?Okay now I have a couple issues with this.First- whenever a main component of a dish is missing the customer should be informed before so they would have an opportunity to change their order if needed. That didn't happen.Second- while pita bread was a nice offer they apparently didn't have any of that made either! When she said she would like some our waiter came back almost 20 minutes later with a basket. By that time we had almost completely finished our meals and had no use for it.Third- come on people this is NYC! There are bagels to be had on every corner! Why not just run to the corner deli and grab a couple? No one was in the restaurant, the matre'd had been just walking around aimlessly the entire time we were there. WTF?So service became quite an issue.Our waiter also never offered us another drink. We had waited so long for our entrees to begin with we had finished our cocktails. The waiter never once came to see if we wanted another one which is silly because we would drank another round which we would have paid for.Apparently the waiter was banking on the cash from our water I came to find out.When we sat down he had asked if we wanted still or sparkling. I answered by saying still without really thinking about it but there it was on the bill- $6 for a bottle of water.What a rip-off. I thought those hoodwinking water bottle days were over.So I was really disappointed in Kellari. The food and atmosphere were so wonderful! But those service issues really made it frustrating.It makes me wonder how they would do if they actually had a full house for brunch?Kellari's Parea

Just some things I've been doing lately that I cant write a whole long post about.Inoteca Liquori- love the space. Food was awesome as well. The octopus, prosciutto and affordable bottles of wine will keep me going back. The service could be a little tighter but it is about 10 times better overall than Bar Milano.Bespoke Chocolates- This is quickly becoming one of my favorite chocolate stores in the city. The French Milk Chocolate Bon Bon and Pretzel Carmel Delight are to die for. Plus the woman who owns it is super friendly and truly seems to love what she is doing. I really hope this place makes it.Wildwood BBQ- got the cheeseburger here and can't understand all the fuss about it. It was okay but nothing special in my book. However they continue to have a great selection of beer and nice open windows in front so that makes it a nice place to stop and grab a drink.Gramercy Tavern- went last weekend with Mr. T's wonderful Aunt & Uncle and it continues to wow. The Duck Confit and Sweetbreads were fabulous and the service was absolutely stellar. How can anything ever beat this as my favorite place in the city? Spectacular!

Before we left for Europe we went to the second home Yankee game of the year.I got there early to check out the new stadium and specifically the food.My first stop was Lobel's for some meat.Look at him cutting up those huge pieces of meat!They make every sandwich to order and then pour a nice au jus right on the top.Nice!!! Here's a picture of the $16.00 sandwich. Bite already taken out of course.The sandwich was huge and very fresh but for $16.00 I wasn't blown away.The meat was very tasty but it was almost a little too rare.Mr. T and I both had trouble even biting into the thing because the meat was so chewy.We decided to supplement our sandwich with some fries and a cheeseburger from Johnny Rockets.The fries were surprisingly crispy and fresh as well! Much better than the old Yankee stadium fries.The burger was pretty good as well. It had a lots of toppings so I couldn't really taste the flavor of the meat but after a couple of beers this is a tasty option.And what about the beer!!!I went down to this stand and picked up some old fashioned goodness.I was hoping they would give me the can to keep my beer cold but they made me take a glass :(Look at the sign- calorie counts for beers!!Whoa!! Stay away from the peanuts apparently!So it was a great day overall. The place is absolutely magnificent and we saw the first win in the new stadium. Yay!!My only quibble- they took the big beer bar away across the street!!That place rocked! Now there's another stupid loud sports bar that you can hardly hear yourself think inside. Oh well- I guess I can't have it all.

$16!!!well I guess I can't expect anything less because it's Yankee Stadium. But what do you think foodwise; Citifield or Yankee Stadium?

Citifield is my next stop. I assume it will be better. I have a love for anything Danny Meyer so how can it not be??

Markt used to be one of my favorite places to dine in the city when it was still on 14th street.I loved the wonderful corner space and the sleek long bar where it always felt busy and exciting. Not to mention the food!Markt moved closer to us a few years ago on a busy, somewhat noisy area on 6th avenue.We had only been there once since they moved and sat inside.Yesterday we happened to be at Best Buy right nearby so we deiced to try out our old favorite again.We ordered up a couple of Leffe's (a blond for me..I still haven't been able to look at a Leffe Brun since my illness in Brussels) and grabbed a table outside.We weren't starving so we decided to forgo any appetizers and just went for some mains.I ordered the Rai au beurre noire et capers.In other words some steamed skatefish with lemon, capers and brown butter.Wow there was a LOT of butter in this dish. The fish was incredibly moist and had a nice flavor from the lemon and capers but the butter was a tad much.Don't get me wrong- it was very tasty but I was kind of going for something a little healthier.The haricot verts came bundled up in a cute little package and were cooked just enough to be tender but still maintain a little crunch.Mr T went for the Moules a la Blanche- Mussels steamed in Hoegaarden.Yum! These were great. The mussels were nice and juicy with a gentle flavor of the beer permeating the dish.It came with a side of frites that were simply fantastic!I forget how much I love a good pomme frite. These had just the right amount of crispiness and came with some fantastic mayo on the side for dipping.Our total bill came to just around $55.00 which isn't half bad for a tasty meal with drinks.The outside tables were a little tight and noisy but it was alright.For some reason we never received any bread and it took quite a while to receive our bill but those are minor quibbles. Markt is still serving up some fantastic food and drink just as it was on 14th street years ago.Markt Restaurant

I happened to be in Bayside for work the other day so I called up my friend Lynch (who lives in bayside) to see if he wanted to meet up for drink.We had both just gotten back from vacation and were having a hard time getting back into the swing of things.A little beer always helps that!We started out sitting outside of Press 195 and then decided to move over to Donovan's once it started to get chilly and had a seat at the bar.I have always wanted to try a Donovan's burger since I heard they were fantastic.However I had just had an enormous lunch and didn't think I could do it justice. So instead we decided to get an order of their mini burgers to share.Look how cute they came out with the little olive on top!MMM...These mini burgers were good!The patty itself was thicker than most mini burgers, and although it was cooked a little bit more than my liking, the meat still retained a ton of juice and had a nice overall flavor.Each one came dressed with ketchup on the bottom and a perfectly sized pickle on the top. I love it when the pickle fits the burger to perfection. Each bite deserves some.Overall I thought the burgers were awesome! Most mini burgers come out looking like some hockey pucks and taste like crap. Donovan's definitely delivered. I want to go back and try their regular burger to get a real taste of what they have to offer.Bayside has some cute little bars and restaurants. If only I could get Mr. T out of Manhattan once in a we could have a whole new world open to us.

I'm going to go through Munich pretty quick. To be honest it was probably my favorite place on the vacation but I've been home a couple of days now and recounting every detail is making me tired and a little depressed. We got into Munich right around 7:00 and checked into our hotel without a hitch. Dinner was at the Weinhaus Schneider.They offered us English menus and we set to ordering up two huge plates of grub.First they started us with a huge salad for the table and some bread.Then came our entrees- Mine was the Bacon wrapped Pork with Noodles (spatzle actually).My dish was only so so. I was expecting more flavor from the pork. I had read that the pork here was the best and this really didn't have much taste except for the heavy gravy.Mr. T's dish was much better the Sauerbraten.He had big chunks of beef in a tasty brown sauce with some kind of weird potato balls on the side that had a kind of weird rubbery texture.The highlight of our meal however was suggested to us by the waiter.The asparagus.White asparagus is much more prevalent in Germany than green asparagus and we happened to be right smack dab in the middle of its season.These stalks were so good! They had a milder flavor than green asparagus and a light refreshing flavor.They came with a side of Hollandaise sauce for dipping.I usually turn down Hollandaise sauce but it was really tasty with the asparagus.So we had a nice meal at Weihaus Schneider but it wasn't what I was expecting.First of all, the pork was only okay and second everyone was drinking wine.Isn't that weird? This is supposed to be the land of beer.To make a long story short, we went to the wrong place.The place I had in mind was called Weissebrau Haus not Weinhaus Schneider .Oops!! Turns out the place we were at was a wine and fondue bar! Weissebrau Haus was on the next block!Oh well- at least it made sense now and we vowed to try Weissebrau Haus tomorrow night.I woke up the next morning and had this lovely breakfast from our hotel that came free each morning! Yay!! Free mimosas!!! I'm a happy girl!Then we decided to trek out to the Franziskaner Brewery located a little outside the main city of Munich.Once there we ordered up some excellent beers and a plate of sausage and potato salad.Both sausages were good but the one on the left was excellent!!!Once I cut inside a little bit of cheese oozed out and it was basically the best Cheddarwurst I've ever had in my life!After a couple of brews we decided to head back into the city for dinner and finally made it to the Weissebrau Haus.Unfortunately we came at the same time as about 50 other people and we barely got the last seat in the house way upstairs.We ordered up some Aventinus from the keg and man was it spectacular.It had a much smoother and softer flavor than the bottled Aventinus in the states and hardly any smell at all. I could have had about four of five of these.We decided to split our dishes and the first was their salad platter.This is the best salad platter I have ever had!!! Look at all the stuff!Potato salad, coleslaw, ham, beets, cheese strips, chicken strips, pickled cucumbers, pickled carrots, tomatoes, endive and then a big pile of tossed salad in the middle.This had everything I wanted in a salad and then some. I would order this kind of salad every day if we had it in America.Our other dish was the one I had hear so much about- the Pork Breasts.Hmm...this pork looks a little different than the pork from the night before huh!Actually it kind of looks like the pork from Momofuku! The pork was awesome- so much meat- so much flavor- yum!!!It came with a side of sauerkraut and potato pancakes.Mr. T doesn't eat sauerkraut usually but he scarfed this up in a minute.The potato pancakes might also be the best we've ever had with a crispy crunchy edge and moist thick middle. MMM...I'm so sad I can't be eating this dish right now!!Here's some of the beers that makes this place famous.So we finished up there and ended our night as we had the night before at the Hofbruas Haus.Our last day in Munich we awoke to the most beautiful weather. We truly wanted to just go and enjoy the day.So we went and walked through the enormous Englischer Garten.After finding ourselves outnumbered by more naked German men than I've ever seen we decided to head the one of the many beer gardens in the park.This is the Chinesischer Turm. This place is freakin huge!!!Up in the tower was a big band churning out fun German tunes while everyone below just relaxed and drank big beers and ate some food.Speaking of food we got an order of Spare Ribs and an order of the Currywurst.The Currywurst wasn't very good. I hate Curry so I just ate the end without it and the sausage really had no flavor.The fries were poorly cooked and the dish just tasted like crap honestly.The Spare Ribs I absolutely hated.There was some sort of curry sauce on top that was super spicy and just not very good tasting.I don't know what we were expecting.This is park food after all!However nothing could dampen my spirits and I truly enjoyed sitting in that garden and drinking my beer more than anything else on this trip.I was finally able to completely relax and it was wonderful.That night we headed back to the Hofbrau Haus for one more time.We had met a fun couple there the night before and figured maybe we would have the same luck that night.We grabbed a table outside and ordered up a Crackling Pork Knuckle and some Spatzle.The Pork Knuckle was excellent. Crispy outside skin, salty juicy meat inside. My only wish was that there was more meat! Mr. T and I could have eaten another one easily.It came with a side of cabbage salad and two potato dumplings.Again I had the best version of a dish I have ever had- the Spatzle.Honestly it was macaroni and cheese..really, really, good macaroni and cheese.It came with melted Emmental cheese and some delicious roasted onions.It was gut busting delicious!After dinner we moved inside and had some more beers with some extremely drunk German men and the wonderful couple from the night before.It was the start of Maifest and we decided to try out the Hofbrau Haus Maibock.In hind sight ordering a liter of beer the waiter told us was 12% alcohol at about 11:00 the night before we leave might not have been the next idea ever.The beer was very tasty but we woke up the next morning and Mr. T was draaaging.Luckily we got to the airport and even got a chance to stop for one more beer before we hit the road at the airport brewery.That's right... the Munich airport has it's own brewery called Airhaus and it's huge as well!Here is the outside space.We actually sat inside and when I went to order a beer my skills at the German menu were apparently a little off because this is what I got instead.Yep. That's a shot of some really strong and nasty smelling liquor.Now having a beer at 11:00 am after a night of drinking is one thing. Tossing back a shot is another!I pushed the shot aside and reordered and ended up getting a Radler which is German Beer and Lemonade.I discovered this mix the day before in the park and loved it. Here was no different.It was incredibly fresh and really revitalizing. A good morning beer! Lol! So we jumped on our plane and made it safely back to NYC with little trouble and safely into our small apartment.It was such a wonderful vacation that I am so happy to have experienced. I loved each and every thing we did and hope to return to all of these great countries in the near future.What to do now Mr. T? What's that? Ippudo it is!!!

I'm kind of upset with Brussels because I got horribly sick while we were there.It started with my breakfast while waiting for the Euro star. I had ordered an almond croissant.It came stuffed with some kind of rich custard inside which would have been fine for dessert but really didn't make my stomach feel so great that early in the morning.The heavy cappuccino didn't help things much either and I was feeling a little weighed down on our train ride.However I bounced back once we got to Brussels and went out for some fantastic beers at Mappo Mudo (loved sitting upstairs and staring down at all the people) and big silly Leffe Brun's at La Lunette. Look at this head on the Duvel!I had heard some good thing about In 't Spinnekopke so we headed over there for dinner.The place was very quaint and old fashioned. Our waiter was great with helping with the menu and we ended up ordering two dishes to split.I got some sort of chicken dish that was really good but after what happens later I think I blocked the name out of my head.Second the Stoemp Saucisse. This is an old Belgian potato dish topped off with a big hearty piece of sausage. Both were actually really good but filling.The heavy cream from the chicken was really starting to make me feel bloated but I pushed ahead because hey- we're on vacation.I decided the only thing that would help at this point would be a bite of Chocolate and more drinks.So we headed to the Belga Queen for a few cocktails and then back to our beautiful hotel bar for some chocolate and beers to round off the night.I passed out in bed that night happy and content with life.However 6:00am is a different story.I wake up with the worst stomach pains I've ever had in my life.You know the kind where you curl up in a ball trying to somehow quell the knife stabbing pain coming from your stomach, all the while praying to a higher power to not let this happen.Well it happened...and it was bad.I was pretty much violently ill for about an hour. Every time I pictured my croissant, chicken, beer or any sort of chocolate it started all over again.By the time I was able to crawl back to bed my throat was on fire, my face and body were covered in sweat and I thought I was going to die.Mr. T had slept through the whole ordeal but after about an hour of being sick and not being able to move off the bed I finally woke him. I needed some serious fluids and pictured myself dying from dehydration right there on the bed.I laid in bed all day with the lights off, washcloth on my forehead and aspirin in hand.I knew Mr. T was really disappointed.Brussels was the part of the trip he was most looking forward to and now our one full day was ruined.I had to pull through. I would feel horrible the whole vacation if I didn'tSo around 5:00 I somehow managed to get myself out of bed and fake being healthy enough to venture outdoors.We were going to do everything we planned to do in Brussels whether my stomach liked it or not!Of course most of my Brussels plans involved drinking lots of beer and eating lots of chocolate.Unfortunately that was out of the cards for me but we did end up getting things accomplished- at least Mr. T did.We walked around the Grand Place and had some drinks at a cute outdoor café.Then we headed over to the Delirium Cafe and stayed there for a while so Mr. T could sample a bunch of beers from their crazy huge beer list.We even made it to dinner!I had encouraged Mr. T to drink enough strong beers at the Delirium that he no longer was as worried for my health as he was before.I knew he wanted to have mussels in Brussels so I convinced him over to Chez Leon.I of course, had only had a bite of croissant and a piece of bread since my troubles that morning so I played it safe (or so I thought) and ordered a small salad and some frites.My salad said it was going to have some bacon in it but what came out was a plate of bacon, fat from the pan and all topped with a lettuce and cheese garnish.Needless to say I didn't really eat that.However I did have the frites and they treated my stomach nicely.Here are Mr. T's mussels.Man they were big! I really wish I had been feeling better so I could try one out but he said they were wonderful and for that I was happy.The next morning I woke up with pains still in my stomach but definitely on the road to recovery.We had just enough time before we left to stop and get a waffle right by the Mannekin Pis.Wow this waffle was awesome! It was perfectly charred and almost caramelized on the edges and warm and fluffy inside.Seriously there is no need for any toppings at all. It tasted better without them.So my Brussels experience was not as much fun as I had hoped but at least we still had one more leg of the trip and I was getting my beer drinking and meat eating shoes on whether it killed me or not for Munich.

Our last dinner in London we made an early reservation to try the offshoot St. John Bread and Wine.We started off with some beers nearby and tried a really nice and fruity Kronenburg Blanc.If you've heard of Nose to Tail Eating then you know about the pioneer of this place Fergus Henderson and his approach to eating.He believes that if we are going to kill animals to eat them, we should use the entire body. Anything else would be rude.We showed up at right around 6:30 and got a nice table on the side of the big airy room.We were having some truly beautiful London weather.The big glass windows in the front were open letting in the last rays of sunlight as well as a slight breeze.We ordered up a fantastic bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (that had the coolest looking little dude on the front) and decided to split four dishes.Here's our menu for that night.The first was the special of the night the Langoustines with Mayonnaise.These were pretty good. Nice and large I think the ones at J Sheekeys were a tad sweeter but we enjoyed them.Our second dish was the Salt Beef, Radish and Pea Shoots.Wow this was really good!! I am not a radish fan and I can take our leave pea shoots usually but somehow everything in this dish combined to be spectacular!Our third dish was the Quail and Aioli.The quail had a wonderfully crisp skin and super moist inside. It was such a simple and straightforward dish that just worked on its own entirely.However the last dish was the best of the night, and quite possibly the best of the whole trip.This is the Ox Heart and Dripping Potatoes.Okay I'll admit I was a squeamish about the Ox Heart at first. I've had chicken heart and beef heart before and I really didn't like either of them that much.Well this dish completely changed my mind.WOW!! The meat had a smooth flavor that was rich but not gamey at all.Each piece was incredibly tender and I found myself wishing we had ordered this to begin with so we could order more.I was busy stuffing my face with the glorious meat when I looked over at Mr. T who had simply stopped eating.\"Try the potatoes\"\"What why?\"\"Shut up and try the potatoes\"Okay, okay.This is when I learned the only thing better than a nice meaty piece of Ox Heart is a piece of crispy Ox Heart potato!I was floored. So much so I called over the waitress to express our delight.She told me it was the first day this dish was offered on the menu and that the cooks had been trying to perfect it for weeks.They take the potatoes, bake them and then fry them three times in the fat and drippings from the Ox Heart.Three Times!!!I didn't even know you could do such a thing.It was glorious. I went all out and dipped some of the fries directly into the oily sauce you see pooling around the meat. Yum!!! We left London the next morning for Brussels with full bellies and happy smiles.Thanks to everyone that helped us out. Oh and we went to Gordon's wine bar every night we were there and absolutely loved it! It was a great experience overall and you must go try those potatoes!!

London- J Sheekey and The Wolseley

Our second day in London we awoke severely jet lagged and kind of a mess.We headed out to see the sights and had a quite piss poor meal in one of the pubs.Note to self- whenever there is an item called the Big Ben Burger on the menu in London, you're probably not in the best food place.However we stopped in for some wine and snacks at the Wolseley and completely made up for it.The Wolseley is a beautiful restaurant located inside of an old bank with fantastic marble floors, shimmering silverware and quite a group of good looking clientele.We stopped in the front bar and ordered up a Croque monsieur and some almonds.The almonds had just the right amount of salt and came quite nicely presented in its little silver dish.The Croque was delicious as well. Really gooey Gruyere cheese inside some thick bread that had been liberally buttered and grilled to a crisp.It was the perfect little midday treat.For dinner that night we headed to J Sheekey and grabbed a seat at their newly opened Oyster Bar.Since they are known for their seafood we decided to go all out and start with the Plateau de Fruits de Mar.This thing was so big I couldn't get it into one shot.The top tier had two different kinds of briny and enormous oysters which I sucked down almost immediately.The bottom was filled with a ton of different clams, cockles, langoustines...I don't even know what else there was..it was a ton of food and everything was extraordinarily fresh.We had ordered a fish pie for after our plateau but we were too full to even attempt it and cancelled the order.So instead we came back the next day for lunch!Here is Sheekey's famous fish pie.Wow- this was one rich and decadent dish with huge chunks of fish swimming in the creamy sauce and crispy potato top.Worth the return trip without a doubt!I ordered the Salt Cod Hash which was basically salt baked cod chopped up and mixed with some potatoes.It came with a perfectly poached egg and some seriously good mustard as a sauce.We also got a side of the Green Beans and the Green Heart Salad.The beans had a very nice garlic butter sauce that really complimented the fish pie.The salad was good but I found the bleu cheese a little overpowering with my salty cod.However the meal was wonderful and I just loved the ambiance and attitude at J Sheekey.We had the same waiter for both our dinner and lunch and he sent over some of their homemade chocolates at the end as a special thank you.How nice!Both of these places were spectacular and I was beginning to think it would be impossible to top the dining experiences we'd had so far.We were going to finish the London part of our trip with dinner at St. John's that night.

The First Leg of the Trip

***CONTENT
To be honest, the first leg of the trip started out at Yankee Stadium for a 1:00 game filled with lots of food and beer.Luckily we kept ourselves somewhat in check and made it to the airport on time and sober enough to get past security.Once on-board however we decided the best thing to do was to continue drinking so we could pass out.So our trays looked a lot like this for the start of the journey.It worked like magic however and suddenly the lights in the plane were on and we had arrived in London.Needless to say we weren't exactly in the best shape. I'm not sure if anyone will ever see the pictures of us getting off the plane. We look a little bit like zombies.We jumped on the tube and made it safely to our hotel and went to the Sherlock Holmes bar across the street for a few drinks to wait until check-in time.We were absolutely starving by the time we checked in and headed out in search of some good eats.About two blocks from our hotel we ran across Wagamama.Wagamama is supposedly the place David Chang kind of modeled his Ramen after at Momofuku so we had to check it out. Mr. T ordered up a bowl of Ramen and I went for the Mandarin Chicken salad.The salad was pretty fantastic.Big chunks of chicken and toasted cashews were scattered throughout and the dressing had a nice light refreshing flavor.Mr. T went for the Wagamama Ramen and said it was alright but pretty bland.The broth was no where near the salty thick goodness of Ippudo and the veggies in the bowl were somewhat lacking.That's what we get for ordering Ramen in London for our first meal. We walked around a bit and did a bunch of touristy things until dinner time.I had posted on Chowhound some questions about London and someone responded with a whole night's itinerary.He sounded kind of like us so I decided to go with his suggestions and try the whole thing out.We were supposed to start out by having a drink at the Kings Arms and but got lost and found ourselves at this pub instead the White Hart.This actually turned out to be our favorite pub of the trip so it was a nice surprise.Look at this photo they have of Kurt Cobain in the back.Pretty sweet. We had some awesome beers and headed over to the place that was supposed to have the best fish and chips in London (according to this guy on chowhound that is).We walked inside Super Fish to find a very empty, sparsely decorated place with a wait staff and clientele which were all Asians.This seemed a little bit strange to me since I had pictured something a little different for my fish and chips experience but we plowed forward an decided to split an order of fish and chips and a crab appetizer to start.The crab appetizer was alright. The sauce they mixed in with the crab meat was a little overpowering for me but Mr. T seemed to enjoy it.Then came our main course- the reason we trekked all the way from our hotel (it was quite a ways away), the fish and chips.Okay this is ONE order..one order!!! Two gigantic pieces of fish that barely fit on the plate!One bite was all I needed to understand that yes, this was the best fish and chips in London.The breading was perfectly balanced, light enough to not overpower the flavor of the fish but incredibly crispy and really not greasy at all.The fish inside was super moist and just seemed to fall apart into glorious chunks of deliciousness as we devoured the platter.The fries on the plate were only so, so, but it didn't matter. That fish was amazing, absolutely the best I have ever had in my life.And I say this with a lot of experience having eaten a fish fry every single Friday of my formative years in Buffalo.The other great thing about this place was the price.The appetizer, entrée and two rounds of beers came to just about 22 pounds.By the time we left the place was packed with quite a large crowd of locals waiting for tables and picking up food to go.We finished the night by enjoying a Pimm's Cup outside on the wonderful Thames River and made it back to the hotel alive.First night in London- success.

After lots of baseball watching and a few too many beers last weekend we made one of the greatest decisions one can make in this state of being at 1:00 AM.We went to NY Noodletown of course.NY Noodletown is seriously one of the best places to grab some awesomely delicious food that's cheap and open late.At 1:00 AM it can be absolutely packed at times but we got lucky and there were a bunch of open tables.Okay I'll be honest- there were only three of us but if you see the amount of food we consumed you would think we had a party!We started out with a dish of Roast Pork.OMG the roast pork here is so crispy and delicious. The skin is crispy with a nice layer of fat underneath that seeps all of its ooey gooey goodness into the meat making it incredibly tender.Mr. T went a little crazy and ordered another plate right away before we even finished the first one.Talk about crispy skin our next dish really needs no introduction!Roast Duck over rice.Okay seriously do I need to even say how delicious this was! Can't you just tell!!Look at that beautiful golden skin and luscious chunks of tender meat.I am seriously drooling a little just looking at it.Next came our order of the Poached Chicken.This dish looks pretty average but then you add in the wonderfully delicious ginger scallion sauce it comes with and all of a sudden this dish is amazing.We all just kept looking at the sauce saying \"why is this so good?\" over and over. (Again we had also had few beers before)One of the last dishes we ordered is the one thing you should truly never miss at NY Noodleown the Salt Baked Shrimp.Salt Baking is something that is truly their specialty. I'm not sure why it's so fricken good but it is.I think the salt baking really brings out the flavor of the shrimp and gives it a nice sweet taste that is unmatched.OMG at this point we were so stuffed it was unbelievable.We got our check and for all of this food and a round of beers it came out to just around $40.00.This is why I love New York. It is the best city in the world and Chinatown just rocks!!!We came home and crashed after that and didn't eat anything until late Saturday night because we were still so stuffed.Seriously though, if anyone ever asks you to go to NY Noodletown, be it 3:00 in the afternoon or 2:00 I the morning- it is ALWAYS a good idea.

This was the first Friday night where there Yankees were playing so we decided to go out and enjoy the game with a couple of beers.We met up with some friends at Foley's. Foley's is an old Irish pub that is an absolute must for baseball fans. It's covered in tons of memorabilia and has some really cool things like seats from Camden yards to a Lenny Dykstra scary head.It's named after the sportswriter Red Foley who worked for the New York Daily News for years. It's actually more of a Mets bar but they seemed to have no problem putting the Yankees game on in the back and even turned the sound on for us.I was pretty excited because I had heard they had a sandwich similar to the chicken finger subs they make in Buffalo.It's actually called the David Wright sandwich and it had grilled chicken covered in hot wing sauce on a roll with lettuce tomato and blue cheese.So really instead of the chicken being grilled instead of fried in finger form it sound quite similar. Unfortunately it was nowhere near as good as what I was hoping for.The bun was too hard and the wing sauce was so spicy and really not that tasty that it overpowered everything else on the sandwich.The blue cheese was excellent but I couldn't get over the spicy sauce.We also ordered their sampler platter of potato skins, wings, mozzarella sticks and chicken fingers.The chicken fingers were fantastic! Think and crispy with just enough breading.The rest of the platter was pretty weak but the chicken fingers more than made up for it.So overall Foley's was just okay in terms of bar food but fantastic in terms of overall atmosphere and service.It's kind of like a really big version of Standings bar in the East Village but without the awesome beer list.It's just a great place to catch a game and relax with friends.Foley's Bar

DiFara's Is Truly the Best

I happened to be in Midwood last week for work and was heading back to the office to grab some lunch.For some reason I happened to think of DiFara's and decided to google where it was in relation to me.When the map came up I realized I was only two avenues away!I literally ran over the two avenues and got there right around 11:45 and was only the third person in line outside.I must have hit the timing just right because within 5 minutes the line was over 30 people long.It was funny waiting in line.In the front were two classic Brooklyn guys who were arguing about the Yankees while every so often touting their pride at being the first in line and finally being able to sit down for their pizza.Behind me was a middle aged man who had brought his mother for the first time. She just stared in wonder as more and more people piled into the line behind her.The rest of the people were a mish mash of local firemen, construction workers and a whole bunch of locals and tourists alike.I kind of laughed at how excited everyone genuinely seemed for their lunch. I mean come on it's just pizza right?But then the door was opened and the line became very serious. The Brooklyn guys split up- one going for a table and one going to the counter to order.I was surprised at how small DiFara's was and didn't know I might have to battle for a seat, let alone know how to order.I got to the counter and asked for a slice of whatever was ready first and grabbed the only solo table right against the wall.About 10 minutes later my slice was ready and I dove in.I don't know exactly what I was expecting. I have heard so much hype about Difara's I was honestly expecting to be disappointed. I mean -come on- again this is just pizza right?I took a bite and suddenly everything made sense.All the praise, all the accolades and honors were worth it. This wasn't just pizza- this was art!!The amazing red sauce with beautiful whole tomatoes, the perfectly charred crust with just enough grit so your fingers feel a little dusty, the glorious rich olive oil, the smell of the fresh basil and the shredded cheese...it was utter perfection.As I ate my tiny table became surrounded by people waiting patiently for their pies. I could feel everyone's eyes jealously staring me down while I ate. I swear I even saw a trickle of saliva drip down the chin of one man salivating from afar.I would have felt uncomfortable but I was so content I couldn't care less!I munched away happily and watched Dom as he worked his magic with each pie. Cutting the fresh basil, grating the fresh cheese- he had such precise caring motions I truly knew I was watching something special.The only thing I was upset about was the fact that I only ordered one slice! What was I thinking?So it appears all the hype is for real. I've had Lombardi's, Grimaldi's, & Artichoke's and they are all good and fine but they don't even come close to the heavenly pie that is DiFara's.So if you haven't had it yet- take the train ride and go. It truly is one of the best things NYC has to offer.DiFara's Pizza

So Mr. Trekker and I are taking the first vacation we have ever had ALONE in the 10+ years we've been together.We always seem to go away for weddings or to visit friends but have never done something just the two of us.We leave on Friday for a trip to London, Bussels and Munich. I'm so excited!!!Our plans so far are J-Sheekeys and St. John's in London, Delerium Cafe and Pierre Marcoloni in Brussels and Hofbrau House and Weissebrau Haus in Munich.Does anyone have any other suggestions? Weve never been and I really want to make this an awesome trip so any help would be great!

After the HUGE lunch at Spice, desserts at Cha-an and breakfast of Defonte's we were finally ready to head over to Brooklyn to get ready for the wedding.My plan was to grab a drink at the River Cafe and take in some wonderful city landscape and then head to the ceremony at ReBar.But then wait...one of my favorite Chocolate makers was right there!! So we did a quick reroute to Jacques Torres and ordered up some more desserts including their amazing Chocolate Kiss Cookie.This chocolate chip cookie is so amazing because every single bite has chocolate.It's actually made with flat chocolate discs so that no matter what bite of cookie you get the ratio of dough to chocolate is perfect.It has a nice buttery dough and the chocolate is fantastic making this a contender for best chocolate chip cookie in the city.We got three of these enormous cookies...yeah that's right three!We also tried out one of their chocolate cupcakes.This was good but a little too rich for me. I think if it was more milk chocolate than dark I could have enjoyed it a bit more.Or maybe I was just completely overloaded on desserts- who knows!!Lucky for me the double espresso there picked me up and I made it through the night and even ate BOTH types of cake offered at the wedding and tried out some great new beers.ReBar has an awesome beer selection of all of my favorites- Ommeganag, Sixpoint and one of the best of the night the White Rascal Wheat beer.It was such a wonderful wedding of two fantastic people and I couldn't have asked for a better Saturday with my family.I wish they could come visit more often!!!Jacques Torres

After lunch at Spice on Saturday we walked over to 9th street and up the staircase to the tiny little tea house Cha-an.It was early afternoon so the place was virtually empty and we got a nice five person table right away near the kitchen.Although we were stuffed we decided to order a pot of Dragon Pearl tea and some desserts for each of us.My father suggested doing the 3 course dessert to split but we all scoffed at that idea (actually I was all for it until I realized he meant to share!)The first dessert that came out was my brother's Chocolate Souffle with Raspberry sauce.It was kind of unfortunate this came out first since it quickly began to deflate. We told my brother not to wait and we all just kind of dug into his!The soufflé had a crunchy chocolate top and moist airy innards that was just perfect with the raspberry sauce and not at all filling for a chocolate dessert.I was quite surprised how good it was.Next came the Sweet Potato Apple Carmel cake with ice cream. This was my brother Jim's dessert and I have to say it rocked as well. Carmel, vanilla, apple and sweet potato all came together to make one of the most beautiful as well as delicious desserts of the day.My friend Carrie got it last time we came and I have to say I think it may have gotten even better.My father on the other hand ordered the special Green Tea roll cake with Red Bean.I'm not a big fan of roll cakes and have never really enjoyed red bean so this one was a bust for me. However he seemed to enjoy the flavor combination and that's all that really matters.The last two desserts were the Black Sesame Crème Brulee's which my mom and I both ordered.Okay I've written about these before so I won't go into too much detail but yum!!! This is still one of my favorite dessert of all time.The Crème Brulee has the regular crispy caramelized top but smooth warm custard bottom but the flavor is almost impossible to explain.It's simply wonderful!! Topped with a scoop of black sesame ice cream you get all of the textures and flavors at once- crispy top, smooth warm bottom, cold milky ice cream... OMG Yum!!!It came with large black sesame crisp on the side perfect for scooping up the ice cream and custard in the bowl is you are too excited to even use the spoon they give you.Cha'an is one of my favorite dessert places in the city.The bamboo walls, relaxing staff and imported women's toilet with all the functions, all make you feel transported from the city to some serene paradise.Now we were truly stuffed to the gills and needed to go change for our wedding over in DUMBO.But wait...isn't there some great chocolate in DUMBO? Lol!!! Desserts number two and three coming soon!

A Fantastic Lunch at the New Spice- Family Weekend Continued

Recently Spice opened up two new outposts, both of which are in the East Village. My family was visiting for the weekend and it was basically centered around food which is just lovely for me!They don't have many options for Thai food in Buffalo so I figured we would do lunch at the new Spice on 3rd avenue.FYI...The night they arrived we gorged on fish at Nobu Next door this time completely empty at 7:30 and the morning before we went to Spice we started out with Roast Beef, Mozzarella & Eggplant sub and a Meatball Mozzarella sub from Defontes.Then went to Mcsorley's for a couple of beers ...This is all before noon!What a great way to start the morning!Anyhow we got to Spice right around 12:15 and the place was empty except for one other couple.I was kind of surprised since the one on University is usually packed at this point!We got a great table right by the windows and ordered up some Thai Iced Teas and our meals.The one slight problem I have with Spice is that every time I go to one they seem to change something a little bit.Today for example the Iced Teas were a little bit too sweet. I still enjoyed it but I think it needed a little less mix and more cream.However it was refreshing and a good start to the meal that was about to follow.For my appetizer I got the Thai Caesar salad.It was Romaine lettuce and crispy szechuan croutons covered in a Ginger Miso Caesar dressing and topped with a large piece of grilled tofu.This was really good! I honestly liked this so much I could have ordered a larger size for my entree instead.The dressing was very a bit lighter than your average Caesar and the tofu had a great bbq chili sauce on top that I absolutely loved. The croutons weren't very exciting- basically some crispy wontons- but I never really eat those in my salad anyway.The rest of my family had the spring rolls, crispy shrimp fritters (my usual order that I love) and some new dish I forgot the name of that was pretty awesome as well.It was some small pieces of chicken diced up with a spicy sauce and rolled into some lettuce cups. Really tasty!For my main course I went with the special of the day the Duck with Peanut sauce.Talk about going a little overboard.I wasn't really thinking about how big and rich this dish was going to be.I was kind of trying to go for a \"light lunch\"..errrr not so much.Oh well. The peanut sauce was fantastic and the veggies on the side were sauteed just enough that they were tender but not soggy.I wish the skin on the duck had been a tad crispier but I really can't complain. It was a fantastic dish that I hope to see on their regular menu.Everyone else ordered the Three Sauce Tilapia, the Siamese Fried Rice and the Spice Cashew Nut.All of the dishes were great but I think the Siamese fried rice was the big winner amongst the family.We were stuffed by the end of this meal and I don't think anyone could finish their dish completely there was just so much food.The best place about Spice though has to be the price.For this whole meal, appetizer, entrée and drinks for five people it came to around $65.00.That is a bargain! And our service was great the entire time. Very friendly, explained dishes when we weren't sure what to order and he even took a group picture of us at the end.Plus we had a lovely table with nice large windows looking out onto the East Village streets that are perfect for people watching.I love Spice and I think I like this location even better than the university one.We left full and happy.But as you know no meal for me is complete without dessert.And if you know my family, they believe in this more than anyone.So we headed over to Cha'an which would be only the first of my many desserts for the day...Spice Thai

So the Choice Eats festival last night was a big success I believe and better than last year for many reasons I will discuss at the end but first the food!!Of course the first stand I see when I walk through the door is Porchetta and find myself suddenly stuffing my face with their deliciously fatty pork sandwich. They were giving away a pretty big sized sandwich portion and I probably shouldn't have started with such a hearty dish since I had a lot of eating ahead of me.Of course my next choice wasn't exactly light.This is the shredded Pork with orange marmalade marinade from Jimmy's No. 43.Yum! This pork wasn't super fatty like Porchetta but had a very tasty sweet sauce that really made the pork extra tender and tasty. Way to go Jimmy's!After that I had countless different kinds of food that all seem to blend together.One of my favorite dishes of the night came from The Smorgas Chef.He plated up a Swedish Meatball with ligonberry, chive mashed potatoes and a side of Gravlax with mustard sauce.Honestly the last time I had a Swedish Meatball was eight years ago at IKEA so maybe I'm a little bit behind the times but I thought it was great.I couldn't enjoy the Gravlax due to my salmon allergy but the mustard sauce had a nice tangy flavor that worked with the meatball as well.Another surprise favorite was the Mango guacamole from Mercadito.I have always loved their fish tacos but usually stick to the standard guacamole. Apparently I was making a big mistake!The mango guac had a fantastic tropical flavor that was mellow yet tangy. I am not someone who \"fill up on chips\" but I went back for seconds of this one.Mr. T's favorites included the chicken curry dish from Fatty Crab and the Lasagna from Max which were both packed with some seriously great homey flavor.Queen of Sheba almost put me down with some seriously spicey stuff but luckily I was able to bounce back and check out some more.Unfortunately I missed out on some of the big BBQ places like Fette Sau and Smoke Joint but I had already had quite the pork fill from the very beginning.I did fill up on the plethora of sweets and drinks however.They had some of my favorite beers rocking last night- Allagash White, Chimay Red, Ommegang, even Lindemans Raspberry Framboise! I also tried a new beer from Left Hand Brewery that had a nice subtle ginger flavor that was very different and quite enjoyable.I also tasted many of the different wines and cocktails in the back, the favorite of which was the Clementine vodka from Svedka. I am sooo picking up a bottle of that!For sweets I enjoyed this fantastic key lime cupcake topped with peanut brittle from a stand that I cannot remember the name of, which is unfortunate because it was spectacular.Whole Foods was giving out mini brownie sundaes made with espresso or vanilla gelato which were just yummy and Momofuku Milk Bar was giving out whole cookies to each person!!I grabbed a Peanut Butter while Mr. T went for the fabulous Corn Cookie.The best dessert of the night however was the Bomboloni filled with chocolate and jelly from Motorino's. Yum!!!!Overall I had a fantastic time and thought there were a lot of pluses to this years event versus last years.The new venue gave much more freedom for moving about and trying out the different stands.The beer and water was centrally located in the middle of the two food areas so you could have food and a drink at the same time.The staff working there seemed a little more prepared as well. This year they checked ID's and gave you bracelets as you waited outside.Once the doors officially opened the line moved quickly and efficiently.The only problem with the event was only one bathroom area and some of the vendors being a little unprepared for the amount of food being consumed.The event was supposed to run from 6:30-9:30. By 8:00 there were a LOT of empty tables that had already run out of food.Hopefully next year they will make enough for the masses and maybe add a toilet or two!Overall I had a great time and can't wait for the next one. What fun to try out so many great restaurants and drinks under one roof!

I'm about to head out for the Village Voice Choice Eats Festival. Last year was their first one ever and I have to say it was pretty awesome. They moved the location this year from the Puck building to the Armory and there looks to be even more restaurants participating.I'm really excited to try out Fatty Crab, Radegast & Kampuchea for the first time.I'm even more excited to see what some of my favorites- Porchetta, Jimmys No. 43 and Fette Sau will be serving up!!!Hopefully it will be lots of pork!Tickets sold out a long time ago but you may still be able to get some via Craigslist. Hope to see everyone there!Village Voice Choice Eats

Okay so it wasn't exactly warm out today but I was in the spring spirit. We decided to forgo making the dinner we had planned and headed over to shack shake for some awesome burgers.As we waited for our food I decided to try out the beer they have on tap that's made exclusively for the Shake Shack from Brooklyn Brewery called the ShackMeister Ale.I am always trying to support the local breweries and have tried almost every Brooklyn Brewery beer to date so I really needed to check this one out.As you can see it wasn't exactly warm while we were drinking the beer but man I really enjoyed it.Obviously a plastic cup isn't the best device for trying a new beer but at Shake Shack that's how they roll.For such a bad drinking device this beer was excellent!It poured a light amber and had quite the lacy head and a fantastic autumn smell.The taste was wonderful as well. It had a nice malty dry hopped flavor that was perfect for drinking in the chilly park.If they bottled this beer I would definitely buy a bunch.It's too bad the Shack is the only place to get it.While at the park I was surprised to see they installed televisions with various movies at the Shake Shack playing.Was it art? Not art? Just entertainment?Who knows but it was pretty cool and a sure sign that Spring weather is on its way!!!

Just wanted to give a big shout of thanks to everyone who reads my blog!I was pretty excited this week to be featured both on Eater and New York Magazines Grub Street. I really don't expect stuff like this and truly just do this to share some good food. So I just wanted to say a quick thanks!! It made me my week!I celebrated by taking myself to Bespoke Chocolates for their Pretzel Covered Sea Salted Caramel Chocolates.Oh my these are so delicious.A piece of wonderful salty caramel is dipped in a rich milk chocolate and then doused with bits of pretzels.Sweet and Salty- my favorites!!The owner is always super friendly and the pretzels come from Martin's Pretzels in the Union Square Greenmarket!So I'm also supporting some local fooder makers.What's not to love! So Thanks again!!Bespoke Chocolate

We were walking around the East Village last weekend when we stumbled across this little gem.They had a large green chalkboard menu standing up outside a small store front listing various german beers and grilled meats.The front doors were slightly open and the smell of grilled sausages wafted out onto the sidewalk.Hmmm...delicious German beer and grilled meats?? Two of my favorite things! I was sold.We grabbed a seat at the front entrance and ordered a couple Hefenweizens from the friendly German folks behind the bar.With only three seats up front and two tables in the back, this is a very cozy little place. The wooden stools and dim lighting add to the effect and I found myself wanting to hole up for a while and leave the bustle of the outside world.We really weren't too hungry since we were on our way to dinner but we decided to order a bratwurst just to check it out.(Thank goodness we did since our meal at China 1 turned out to be extremely uncomfortable and overpriced- but that's for another post)Long, skinny, salty and wonderfully snappy...Snappy, salty, skinny stuff!! Yum!!The bratwurst was awesome! It came with some seriously strong sinus clearing mustard on the side (what is up with me and all the s words today?)The paper it's served on acts not only as a plate but a utensil as well. You simply tear off the perforated end and wrap it around the the brat as you dip it into the mustard.But the best thing we ate here was actually the bread. (sorry for the silly picture)I have no idea how they make this but it was amazing!!! The exterior was super crunchy and the inside had a chewy, slightly sour flavor with airy pockets throughout. I mean this was one of the best breads I have ever had.Mr. T even said it was better than Eleven Madison rolls and I have to agree.I see this place getting very popular very soon. I kind of want to keep it my little secret but the food is too good to do that.The currywurst looks to be their specialty and the pomme frites were getting their first fry of the night while we were there. Yum!! Good stuff!Wechsler's 120 First Avenue (at 7th street)

Monday afternoon I was riding up to the Bronx for a late day meeting. Since I never have much \"above ground\" train time, I used it as an opportunity to peruse some of my favorite food blogs.I just happened to look at Eater where they had a report that Per Se was going to start serving an a la carte menu in the lounge that very day!Holy Cats! Anyone who knows about food, knows about Per Se. And anyone who knows about Per Se, knows it is extremely hard to get into and very expensive. $275 for a prix course dinner (not including wine, etc) and usually requiring a 30 day in advance reservation.So when I heard Per Se was going to start this offer, I knew I had a golden opportunity.I was so excited I decided to go that very night. As soon as my meeting was over I headed back into Manhattan and right to the Time Warner Center.I knew they opened at 5:30 and it was only about 5:15 when I arrived.I decided to grab a glass of wine at the Bouchon Bakery bar. I didn't want to be the first person there after all!I tried to drink it slow, sipping like a proper lady, but I was so excited!!By 5:32 my wine glass was empty and I was shaking with anticipation.I couldn't wait a minute longer so I headed upstairs.The velvet rope was gone from the entrance and I could see the blue doors of French Laundry fame.I was so giddy, so excited and maybe a little buzzed from slamming that glass of wine.I walked right up and pulled on the silver handle. Nothing happened.So I pulled again. Again nothing.So then I gave a push and another push.Push, pull, push, pull- what the hell? I'm sure they said they opened at 5:30.Then I see a woman standing to the left, waving me inside by way of the incredibly obvious openings on either side of the decorative doors.OMG I felt like the BIGGEST loser in the world.Here I was going to one of the best restaurants in the world and before I even enter I have completely embarrassed myself.Every bone in my body wanted to run away but somehow I managed to walk inside. The nervous embarrassment then caused me to fumble with unbuttoning my coat.I was somehow unable to place my scarf in my coat pocket like I have done a million times before...I was a mess.Lucky for me, the staff at Per Se were trained not to give notice to these little foibles and they warmly took my coat and gave me a big smile when I asked about their new bar menu.They took me inside to the lounge which was much larger than I had imagined and right to a big couch with a table facing right outside onto Central park.The view was fantastic! I couldn't believe how perfect the table was-definitely the best one in the lounge area by far. My nerves seemed to calm a little and the waiter handed me the wine list to peruse.I knew I wanted to relax and enjoy my meal so I decided to go for a half bottle of wine.The waiter came over and took me through the list, making sure I would fine the best wine suited for my tastes, but also in my price range.I ended up with a fantastic bottle of Zinfandel. Onto the food- here's the salon menu for that day.Although this is cheaper than their prix fix as you can see it is certainly not cheap!!I was already exceeding the budget quota my non-profit salary can hold with the wine so I decided not to completely blow all of my savings and just go for an entrée.But there were many lovely things to come before that was going to arrive.To start they brought out two little Gruyere Cheese Gougeres.Hot from the oven, these little balls had a fantastic golden brown outside and a wonderfully cheesy, creamy inner that was absolutely delicious. The melty Gruyere cheese literally exploded when I bit in and it was kind of like eating a fantastic ball of fondue. Next up was a small bowl of Celeriac Soup with Black Truffles.Oh my goodness- this soup seriously made me swoon. It had a thick almost velvety texture on the mouth and a deep earthy flavor that surpassed any soup I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. This just tasted elegant. Next up they came around with a little cone of Salmon Tartar with Caramelized Onion and Crème Fraiche.They set it down and I wasn't quite sure what to do.I used to love salmon but developed quite a strange food allergy to the fish late in life. I went back and forth debating about what to do. I mean this is Per Se! I want to have everything they're going to give me here because when will I be able to make it back?And it's not like I'm going to die or anything. However it would make me feel ill for the rest of the meal.So I decided to try a tiny bit of the cone only and then set it down on my plate.The waiter came around and noticed I hadn't eaten the salmon and inquired as to why.I explained my food allergy and he immediately picked up my plate and said he would be back with a replacement.I said I didn't mind but about two minutes later another waiter came around with a similar looking cone this time made of Beet, Horseradish Crème Fraiche and Black Pepper.I am so glad they brought me something else because this was phenomenal.The Beet did not taste like a regular Beet. I almost felt like I was eating a miniature roast beef sandwich. It had a meaty flavor that totally blew me away.I thought I was done with the freebies at this point but then came the largest basket of bread for one person I have ever seen.There were four pieces of mini French baguette, three pieces of some kind of onion roll and five pieces of pretzel bread.I had to try them all of course and the big winner of the night was the pretzel bread.Salty with a slight crunch but not too much this bread was awesome!! It tasted like it was fresh out of the oven and I wouldn't be surprised if they fresh bake it every night.The waiter said the butter was from Vermont and that Per Se then adds some special fleur de sel before serving.The butter was creamy and not to rich, almost silky in texture.I thought it was great but it didn't compare to what I had at Blue Hill Stone Barns.That butter still holds the trophy in my book, however this may be in a tie for runner up with Eleven Madison.Then my entrée arrived. I ordered the Elysian Fields Farm's \"Carre D 'Agneau Roti Entier\" which is \"Ris 'Agneau\", hand rolled Garganelli, Split English Peas, Pearl Onions and Tokyo Turnips with Lamb sauce.Look at this beauty!It had basically three different components to the meat itself. A lamb chop, a small lamb loin and a lamb sweetbread.The lamb chop was incredibly moist, the loin had a fantastic lamb sauce and the lamb sweetbread...Don't get me started.This fried little nugget of goodness really added to the rich flavor of the dish. I was in love!!!The only problem I had with the dish were the other components. The Onions, Turnips and Peas were all very coarse. I'm not sure how they were cooked but everything was a little too hard.When I eat an amazingly moist piece of meat I just want something that is going to complement that flavor and texture. I don't want to feel a cold hard pea in the mix. I kind of wish they had gone for some kind of pea puree instead that would still have a great flavor but not be a distraction texturally.However the meat was amazing and I enjoyed every last bite.I was having such an enjoyable meal I decided to splurge on dessert and went with my waiter's recommendation the selection of Sorbets.From left to right we have the Buttermilk Sorbet with Lemon Poppy Cake underneath, a Caramelized Banana Sorbet, Coconut Sorbet with toasted Coconut and finally a rich Chocolate Sorbet with Chocolate shavings.I love desserts like this because you get to try so many different flavors and they were all fantastic.If I had to choose a winner though it would be the Banana. I just love a good banana dessert!So you would think I wouldn't be able to move after all of this food but then they brought out some complimentary mignardises.Again quite the large amount of treats for a solo diner!There were some jelly candies, an amazing peanut nougat candy and two kinds of chocolates one made with Caraway seeds.I thought the Caraway seed Chocolate was a little strange and I'm not sure if I liked it or not but the peanut nougat was the bomb!!! I tried one of each treat and was planning to ask the waiter to box up the rest to bring home to Mr. T. However the next thing I knew though I was delving into the rest and ended up eating them all! Yes I admit I ate the whole tray and was quite happy about it.On the way out I stopped back at Bouchon Bakery and got Mr. T a vanilla macaron to compensate.The final bill for this wonderfully amazing meal?$133 Which is a HUGE amount of money for one person. Luckily I had just gotten my tax refund and felt I deserved the treat.What made Per Se one the most amazing meals I have ever had was not only the food and view, but the service.I have to say it was utterly impeccable. My waiter was absolutely amazing. He truly seemed to take in interest in me not only as a diner but as a person. He would come by and casually chat as I waited between courses and never made me feel strange dining alone.The service of the wait staff simply blew me away and that is the reason I am going to try even harder to save up my pennies for a full fledged meal in the main room.Not only that but I completely forgot to check out the bathrooms! So I have to go back! Sigh...I have gotten a taste of Thomas Keller's kingdom and I really hope to one day return to the castle.Per Se

I saw your review on Chowhound and I almost skipped it because of the formatting, but I'm really glad I didn't. This was one of the best reviews I've read in Chowhound in a long time. I felt I was right there with you anticipating each dish. I've heard excellent things about the service in Thomas Keller restaurants, but your review really drove it home. It sounds like an excellent place to it alone or bring someone who complains about NYC food service- of course they have to be really special to be worth the expense ;-)

Simply awesome. If only I could get out of work at 4.30...And I can totally relate to the late-developing fish allergy and how frustrating it is! I've got the same deal, used to love salmon but now outta luck on that stuff.That thing looked kinda phallic anyway.

Hi there - thanks for your description and the pictures!! It is my first anniversary at the end of May and I would love to take my husband there for the a la carte. He would die! Do you know if they take reservations for the a la carte menu and if it will still be going on at the end of May or if it is just a limited time offer? Thanks!

One of my favorite places to go grab a beer and watch a game is Standings in the East Village.It's a very small quaint bar that has more Sports memorabilia and TV's than most of the large sports bars in the city.What makes it extra special is their super friendly staff and wonderful selection of rotating beers on tap.Most sports bars have the usual- Miller Light, Sam Adams and maybe a Bass or New Castle.In other words- crap.At Standing they focus more on craft breweries such as Sixpoint, Penn Brewing, Captain Lawrence, Otter Creek, etc.In other words some darn good beer.This past Sunday they held a special Dogfish head event where they tapped a keg of Dogfish Head Red and White.Mr. T and I were in the village so we decided to swing by for a glass.What's so special about this beer?Well it's brewed with Pinot Noir juice concentrate and aged 89% on oak staves and 11% in Pinot Noir barrels.Hmm...beer and Pinot Noir...oh and it's 10% alcohol! Wa-blam-ohh!!The beer poured a golden red color with a medium head at first that evaporated quite quickly leaving a nice lacing on the glass and a very small foam ring.It had a sweet smell on the nose of caramel and apricots that was very gentle.And man the taste!!! This was one of the smoothest, yet most complex tastes I have ever enjoyed in a beer.Up front there was a big citrus flavor that gave away to a slightly sweet honey taste with a little bit of oak.This was fantastic!! It had such a nice thick mouthfeel but was somehow extremely drinkable.You would never be able to tell that this was 10%.In fact- Mr. T didn't know!Halfway through our beers the wonderful bartender came over and chatted with us for a while about the drink.After we told him how much we loved it he walked away saying- \"you would never guess it was that strong.\"Mr. T looked at me kind of puzzled. Oh yeah- I forgot to tell him it was 10%.Mr. T was absolutely floored. He is always drinking barely wines and black chocolate stouts and is used to the strong alcohol flavor in those big beers.There was none of that going on here. I could easily drink a six glasses of this stuff...I wouldn't be able to walk afterwards but I could drink it!It was so yummy. I've been looking for it in the stores but have only found the Dogfish Head Black and Blue.If anyone sees the Red and White anywhere please let me know. This been has made it to the top 10 list of my favorite beers and I would really like to enjoy some more before it's all gone.Standings Bar

We have been on a serious Chinese food kick as of late and Sunday was no different. We woke up and didn't feel like ordering anything so we walked down to St. Mark's and decided to eat in at Grand Sichuan.Grand Sichuan is on the second floor of a building that houses Super Cuts and Chipotle. (Can you believe what's happened to this street!!!)We got a great table right at the front of the restaurant over looking the street which was great for people watching.One thing I liked about their menu was that every dish had a picture. The one thing I didn't like were the delicious looking bubble tea pictures they had when they really didn't sell any :( Oh well.We decided to start with a small plate of Unagi and a special that day the Spicy Peanuts.Okay the Spicy peanuts may be one of the best beer drinking foods I have ever tasted.The peanuts were coated with a honey sugar glaze that had red pepper flakes mashed in.Whew- these peanuts were spicy, hot and sweet all at once. Yum!!! For $5 it was pretty expensive for peanuts but I would get them again if we came with a group of people. There were way too many peanuts for two people to ingest in one sitting. That would just be unhealthy.The Unagi was pretty good. Unfortunately we had just eaten at Nobu next door the night before and experienced some of the best Unagi I have ever had.Obviously this is a fish of a different color but I was kind of ruined for it by the stuff I had just had. I probably shouldn't have ordered it.For our main we got the Spicy Hunan chicken.Basically flattened pieces of chicken sauteed together with green peppers, onions and a spicy Hunan sauce.This dish was pretty good. The flavors were well balanced but almost not spicy enough for me. Mr. T had ordered a side of spicy dumplings and I liked the sauce on this much better so I ended up dipping my chicken into that.As you can see we were in quite the spicy mood!!As usual we ordered more than enough food and ended up taking home a bunch with us in nice little Chinese takeout containers.I never see those containers anymore. I really enjoy eating out of them and I don't know why. Nostalgic purposes I suppose.So I thought Grand Sichuan was really good. I enjoyed the food and the view could not have been better. Definitely a solid place on St. Mark's for some good Chinese food.Grand Sichaun

Mr. T and I used to frequent Wogies on a weekly basis about two years ago. This was one of the few places in the city where I could find a good chicken wing and I had to go often to get my fix.Since then, I have learned to live without chicken wings as a staple in my diet but I couldn't resist stopping by for a plate when we walked by the other day.We were having a big dinner later so we decided just to split a plate of the Garlic Butter wings.Before these babies were even within eyesight I knew they were on their way.The strong smell of garlic permeated the air and my taste buds started to water in anticipation.I felt like Pavlov's dog for a minute.My goodness...am I that easy to condition? Lol!These wings were every bit as good as I remember- plump, juicy, fried to a perfect crisp and covered in a stinky garlic sauce. Then they top it off with a generous amount of Parmesan cheese perfect for soaking up some of the buttery goodness of this dish.Yum!!! Greasy and good. One thing I have to say about Wogies is that they don't skimp on the sides. The carrots and celery were nice big cuts that seemed very fresh and the blue cheese dressing was stellar.Wogies still continues to be one of my favorite wing joints in the city. Nothing will ever be able to beat the stuff they serve in Buffalo but it's nice to have something that can curb my cravings.Wogies

Lansdowne wings are pretty weak, and nothing luke the Scruffy Duffy wings they claim to be. (The Scruffy's cook never went to Landsdowne.)I do have to try these Wogie's wings. (I heard the salt&pepper wings were really good too.)

We found ourselves once again walking around Chinatown last week after a successful shopping excursion at J & R. Hungry and cold we decided to try out a new place and headed over to the Golden Unicorn.On the second floor of a building on East Broadway sits Golden Unicorn. Follow the blinking lights outside, up the elevator and into a huge dining room decked with bright red walls and big golden dragons. We got there about 7:00 and the place was virtually empty. Only two other tables were filled and it felt strangely quiet in such a big room.Undeterred we set down to ordering and got some tasty Cantonese dishes and a bottle of wine.We decided on two dishes the Jumbo Shrimp and Chicken sizzling platter with garlic sauce and the Salt Baked Pork Chop with Chili.The shrimp and chicken platter came out just as advertised- sizzling!!!Huge chunks of chicken and shrimp were mixed with onions, green peppers and a spicy garlic sauce.Mr. T and I always order the garlic sauce when there is a choice between spicy or garlic at Chinese places.My question- what's the difference? The garlic sauce is always super spicy as well!! This one was no different.Big red flakes throughout the dish provided a powerful dose of spice and I was sweating a little bit as I ate.Luckily they brought out a nice big bowl of peanuts which I threw into the shrimp dish to cool it down a bit.Our other dish was the Salt Baked Pork Chop with Chili.I actually didn't care for this dish very much. The breading has a strange taste that we couldn't quite figure out. It almost tasted like brown sugar. Kind of like a funnel cake.Weird huh? Anyway it just didn't do it for me.However I happily ate the shrimp and chicken while Mr. T handled most of the pork. Luckily a couple of big groups arrived while we ate so the room didn't feel quite so empty.We finished our meal with a complimentary plate of orange slices and some fortune cookies.As we waited for the elevator down I couldn't help but laugh at this fire safety picture.Look at this little guy!! Lol!! He's so skinney!!!Anyway...Overall I enjoyed Golden Unicorn and would like to come back for brunch one day and try out the dim sum they are so famously known for.Golden Unicorn

We met up with some friends a couple weeks ago to celebrate Fat Tuesday.Well not really- it was just an excuse to go out for dinner!We had heard so much about the Redhead we figured it was high time we check it out.The Redhead has an old classic, warm kind of feeling to it. The rickety wooden bar and low, dim lighting (which is why the pictures are so dark) give it a certain charm. Kind of like putting on my favorite old sweatshirt it just had a comfortable feel about it.We started off with some appetizers for the table of the famous Bacon Brittle and Sausage pretzel.Now the brittle isn't really a brittle. It's more just peanuts tossed with some molasses and little pieces of bacon.That being said however it was pretty awesome. If this is the nut mix you're serving at your next party be sure to put me on the invite list!Salty, sweet and incredibly addictive I kind of wish I wasn't splitting them with the whole table.The sausage and pretzel was really good as well.The warm pretzel, made in house, had a strong wheat flavor that was incredibly fresh. The kreuz market sausage was just as good as always and came grilled to snappy perfection.Watch out for the mustard though- it's fantastic but spicy! I think I cleared my sinuses out in one bite. For my main dish I ordered the One Eyed Caesar Salad.Fresh Romaine Lettuce tossed with a creamy Caesar dressing and topped with a One-Eyed Susan.The One-Eyed Susan is basically a piece of bread that has a hole in the middle filled with a fried egg and topped with capers.Yum!!! The One-Eyed Susan was awesome!!! They were a little heavy handed on the salt but the creamy Caesar dressing balanced that out. One of the best Caesar salad's I have had in a long time!Mr. T got the Buttermilk Fried Chicken with cornbread, baby spinach, apples and walnuts.The chicken was super crispy outside and super moist inside. Mr. T loves fried chicken and declared this as the best in the city.The other dish of the night was a massive pork chop that came with some roasted brussels sprouts and an amazing pomegranate-pistachio relish that I could have slathered on everything!I think we all pretty much licked the plates cleaned! I really wanted dessert but didn't feel like looking like the only pig in the group so I held off.However I have been dreaming about the Chocolate Bread Pudding they had listed on their menu ever since. It apparently comes topped with vanilla ice cream and their bacon peanuts. Yum!!!!!I am planning to recreate the bacon brittle at home- maybe I can even try doing the whole dessert!The Redhead was awesome. If you're looking for some comfort food there's no better place to go.

I hadn't been to Roni-Sue in forever!!! She's one of my favorite NYC chocolate makers and I had been neglecting her!I decided to swing by last week and check out what kinds of new stuff she had in stock.I ended up picking up two pieces of chocolate that sounded awesome.One piece of Beer, Pretzel and Chocolate and also a piece of Chocolate covered Bacon.The beer pretzel chocolate was only so so. I love salty with my sweet but there was too much bitterness going on in the chocolate to balance out the salty pretzel crunch.The chocolate covered bacon fared much better.OMG this was pure bliss!A super crispy and high quality piece of bacon covered in silky rich milk chocolate. This was out of this world!!!Highly unhealthy and utterly delicious- this was fantastic.So one slight miss and one huge hit from Roni-Sue. You gotta love her.

Snow Day at Eleven Madison

***CONTENT
So this past Monday brought a slew of snow to the city and for the first time in 5 years I got a snow day!!!! No Work!Holy Cats I was so excited!The possibilities are endless on a snow day- there is so much I could do! I decided a good meal was in order.After doing some shopping in SOHO I decided to head over to the Cub Room and check out the place since it was supposedly under new management.As I was walking up to the restaurant I noticed a man outside scattering some salt on the sidewalk. I was almost to the door the man threw the salt directly at me!! WTF!!!I was so surprised I stumbled a little- I didn't know what to do. I walked closer to the menus outside and stared intently at them waiting to see if he would apologize or even acknowledge me.He did nothing except to scatter more salt on the ground. He barely even gave me room to look at the outside menu.After feeling a little bit hurt by this man's behavior and upon closer inspection of the completely deserted dining room I decided to go elsewhere.I was kind of upset and battling the cold winds... I was beginning to think this SOHO trip was a bad idea.I started to instead head for home when I thought- wait- what about Eleven Madison?Yes that's close to my house- Ching!Yes it's always amazing food and atmosphere- Ching! Ching!Yes I have a $28 gift card to use from restaurant week- Ching! Ching! Ching!Yes it's 1:50 and they stop serving lunch at 2:00- Shit!!!!!!!I raced to the subway and grabbed the train uptown. I got to Eleven Madison right about 2:03. I was all ready to head for home when the hostess nicely said that they could accommodate me at the bar if I ordered right away.Thank You! Thank You!I was so happy. I took my seat and placed my order in about 2 seconds flat.As my appetizer I chose the Winter Greens salad with Candied Walnuts and Fourme d'Ambert.Look at this gorgeous plate! Micro greens were piled high atop a pile of chopped apples, cubes of cheese and enormous walnuts.The Fourme cheese was a super stinky and strong bleu cheese that was a little overpowering on its own but absolutely delightful with the citrus from the apples and the oil of the dressing.My favorite part of the salad was the walnuts. OMG I love candied nuts and these were amazing. I could have eaten a whole bowl full of these puppies- and I probably would have if I had the opportunity.I won't comment too much on the bread because I think you already know how good it is but man...It is so freaking good!!!This time the roll was super strong in black olive flavor and arrived warm and toasty from the oven. Yum! I was on cloud nine and my main course hadn't even arrived yet.And here is my main course- the Seared Atlantic Skate with braised Endive, coconut and madras curry.Now this dish is completely out of my comfort zone for ordering since I don't usually like curry.However I was feeling adventurous so I tried and it out and it was fantastic.The skate had a fantastic crispy crust and was perfectly cooked. The braising really brought out a nice nutty flavor to the endive and it paired nicely with the strong curry oil.I finished the entire dish.Now I have to say one of the best parts about my meal was not the food but the service.The bartender was absolutely fantastic. When I asked about one of the wines he gave me a taste and explained the origin in great detail.When I made a horrible face after tasting the wine he didn't make me feel bad but kindly laughed and offered me another one to have instead (the wine was Chasselas in case you were wondering...it's right up there with grappa in my book now).He was very attentive and just a nice person to chat with as a solo diner.Service can really turn a good meal into a wonderful experience.I had no room for dessert so I paid my ridiculously small bill (gift certificate yay!)and headed back out into the snow.What an absolutely fantastic way to spend an afternoon. Sigh...I wish I had snow days more often.

Last night at Nobu Next Door. We walked in a party of three at 7:00 and were immediately seated! No taking down the phone number, no one hour wait, just seated.An hour and a half later, stuffed to the brim with some of the best eel I've had in a long time, we left. The sushi bar was half full the entire time and there were still a table or two available in the main room.Talk about Recession dining!Oh and the Rock Shrimp Tempura with creamy spicy sauce was just as amazing as ever.

Yum!! This is a Green Tea Martini from Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar and Grill. It's a mix of matcha tea, Hendrick's gin and Blue Ribbon's own special honey syrup. This cocktail tasted wonderful and deceptively light. Since it's made with tea I felt like I was being sort of healthy drinking it as well. All that \"health\" went out the window however when our entrée the fried chicken arrived.I didn't get a picture but it was really good. It was fried lighter than most- maybe in a tempura batter and came with an awesome wasabi honey mustard dipping sauce.Yum!! So good!!The rolls the people next to us ordered looked pretty good but we were too stuffed to have any sushi. However they have a California roll on the menu that is made with King Crab...Possible Bar Masa contender? We will be back to find out.

We got another gift card for Bar Masa at Christmas time and decided to use it this past weekend.We showed up around 5:00 and the place was pretty much empty.From 3:00-6:00 they only serve a limited sushi/sashimi menu which was just fine with us.To start we ordered a California Roll, two pieces of beef, and a Unagi Avocado Roll.The California roll was something we had both really enjoyed last visit and this time was no exception. The roll was fantastic. The crab was succulent, sweet and extremely fresh. This has no resemblance to the crappy California Roll you get at other places- this is the real deal.The Grilled Unagi Avocado roll was pretty good. I liked the flavors together but it didn't really blow me away. Ever since I was feed Unagi by Yasuda himself I have never had anything that comes close to as tasty.The pieces of Kyushu with salt and pepper were tasty as well but no where near worthy of their $12 a piece price tag.The spicy tuna roll was pretty large and came with big pieces of tuna rolled with fresh green chili's inside.Man this roll was spicy! I really enjoyed this one since it was quite a different take on the average roll. We finished up with a couple more pieces of Uni, Ika and Toro.While everything we had was very good it just didn't come any where near the goodness of the sushi at Yasuda.And the price!! Jeepers!!! I think we paid almost double what we would have at Sushi Yasuda. The atmosphere isn't that cool that it's worth that much.So unless it's a quick stop at the bar for a California Roll or I find a generous friend with an expense account- we probably won't be back. There's too much good sushi across town to be dropping the greens here.

Peking Duck House

We randomly decided to try out the Peking Duck House last Saturday night down in Chinatown. We showed up pretty early, around 6:30 and there was already a small group of people waiting.I had never been inside the Peking Duck House before and I was really surprised how different it was. Super white walls with low lighting and disco music- it certainly didn't resemble any of the other places in Chinatown that I've been to.After about a five minute wait we were seated and ordered a couple of drinks. Since it was only the 2 of us we unfortunately couldn't get the duck because it is served only for 4 people or more.However they had a duck appetizer so we decided to try that out.This is the chopped duck meat with pine nuts.At first I simply tried a little of the duck and I wasn't sure if I liked the flavor or not of the pine nuts.However once I put it inside the lettuce cup and put a little bit of hosin sauce on top it was perfection.The sauce really balanced out the flavors. We were absolutely loving this dish.Our main order fared just as well. This is Chicken with Orange Flavor. All white meat chicken that was very lightly breaded and covered with a spicy garlic orange sauce.I loved this dish because it was pretty light. Many times when I order an orange sauce I get something that resembles a heavy syrup.This sauce had a very light, clean taste.There was baby corn and slices of garlic throughout the dish that were super spicy and delicious.Overall we really liked Peking Duck House.The ducks that were being sliced up and sent around the room looked and smelled amazing. We spent most of dinner figuring out who we could get to come back with us so we could order a whole duck. My parents are coming to visit next month and staying near the Financial District so this could be a perfect place.After dinner we stopped for a drink at Apotheke.This is the door from the inside of the bathroom. Pretty cool. The bartenders all wore lab coats and they served up a pretty mean drink.Not exactly a place you would find in Chinatown.Peking Duck HouseApotheke

And for $5.50 quite the value.I got lots more to post about- this past weekend we ate at Bar Masa, Blue Ribbon Sushi and Grill, Bespoke chocolates and Medieval Times.Yes that's right-Medieval Times. No stars for their food but a couple for their enthusiasm. It was pretty fun.More to come....

Ever since I saw the 30 Rock episode where the teamsters go to a secret sandwich shop in Brooklyn and bring back some amazing sandwich's with a \"magical\" dipping sauce, I knew I had to find out exactly where this place was.I did find out- it was Defontes in Red Hook.I never made it to Red Hook and luckily now I don't have to.THEY OPENED ONE 2 BLOCKS FROM MY APARTMENT!!!!!Sorry for all of the caps but I was so psyched! And man it seriously delivered.This is the sandwich they are most known for- the number 20 Hot Roast Beef.Basically perfectly rare roast beef, fresh mozzarella and fried eggplant get thrown on a fantastic baked roll that has been dipped in au jus.Oh...my...goodness. It was one of the best freaking sandwich's I have ever had.Something about their roast beef is addicting. It was smokey, salty and just fantastic.Mr. T and I swung by after having dinner at Ippudo.We figured we would get a sandwich, try a bite and save it for tomorrow.That did not happen.One bite and we were chowing down on the whole damn thing.This is after a huge bowl of ramen mind you!!!I cannot tell you how good it was.This place is the bomb! I cannot wait to go back and try out more of their stuff.The people inside are super friendly and get this- the guy who made our sandwich was wearing a Buffalo Bills hat! What is there not to love!!!We are already making plans to return for breakfast this weekend.Thank you Defonte's-thank you 30 Rock- you both rule!!!

The Pizza pub opened in the old Push space over on 3rd avenue.Apparently the owners are the same they just wanted to try something new.I was really excited about some new good pizza in the neighborhood so I went over to check it out the day after it opened.The sign that greeted me outside the pub read \"Free slice with very shot\".Hmmm...interesting I guess.I'm not really a shot taker so I just grabbed at seat at the counter and ordered two slices of pie.First up is the regular.The pizza looked like it was going to be exactly what I love.Super thin with a perfect ratio of cheese and sauce I had high hopes. Unfortunately it just wasn't that great.While the crust was super crunchy- it had no flavor. In fact it tasted a little bit like cardboard.The pizza itself was alright but it lacked flavor overall as well.I added some oregano and garlic salt which improved the pie but it still needed something more.The grandma slice didn't do much better.Again- upon first look the slice looked like it was going to be amazing.The golden crust looked so rich and buttery while the sauce and cheese smelled extra garlicky.Unfortunately the dough was extremely undercooked and the sauce was almost a little too sweet for my taste.So overall the pizza pub was a little disappointing. While they looked amazing they both lacked in flavor.Maybe it's just some early kinks. I will definitely give it another try in a few weeks and check out some of their other slices.They do have some nice TV's and a decent selection of beer that helps. We'll see if they can pull it together a little bt more.

Ok, so I seriously disagree with your comments, however your opinion is your own. I admit when they first open the operation was a little confusing, but since then it has become my favorite neighborhood spot. For $4.50 you get a slice of the regular cheese and a pint. There isn't anywhere else in the area where you can get a deal like that, especially in this economy! The place is super nice, there are flat screens everywhere to watch games, plenty of seating, a really chill staff and awesome music. It is definitely the best spot to eat, drink and hang out with friends when you are on a budget.

These are from the past week and really don't deserve a whole post on their own so I thought I would just kind of throw them together.First up some french fries from Zum Schneider.I've written a zillion times how much I love everything about Zum Schneider- the beers, potato pancakes, atmosphere and now the french fries.Long, skinny and perfectly crisped, these are great beer drinking snackers.If you like McDonald's fries (and who doesn't) you will love these. A treat that didn't quite make the cut is the Triple Berry Kit Kat.I was grocery shopping at New Kam Man in Chinatown when this bright shiny box jumped out at me.Triple Berry Kit Kat!! I had to try it out.The box was unfortunately the best part.This Kit Kat was sickeningly sweet and tasted a lot like strawberry Nesquik.It had a horrible artificial taste I just couldn't get past. Too bad because the packaging is so fun.Last but not least Donburiya.Mr. T and I had lunch together in midtown and I ordered a bowl of the sukidon.It was basically a big bowl of rice topped with stir fried beef, sauteed onions and veggies, two big chunks of tofu and topped with a fried egg.This is the total definition of comfort food.Warm and hearty I ate the whole bowl and basically had to waddle out of the restaurant. For $11 this is a pretty cheap and filling lunch option for midtown Manhattan

Oh Valentines Day...some people really hate this holiday and some people love it.I'm in between- I think it's definitely a marketing scheme by Hallmark but on the other hand why not have a day dedicated to the ones you love?And why not have mandatory chocolate with that as well :)Mr. T did exceptionally well this year in the treats department and got me two of my favorite things.First up- Chocolates!!!Pierre Marcolini makes some of the most delicious Belgian chocolates in the whole entire world! Luckily he has an outpost here in New York and Mr. T picked me up the perfect size sampler.Last year he had gotten me the dark chocolate sampler so this year I got the milk chocolate one.Marcolini's chocolate's are exquisite. I have never had chocolates that are so smooth and rich. I could eat this whole box in one sitting but that would be blasphemy.These chocolates are meant to be savored...and savor them is what I will do!!Mr. T also got me something else I love- Macarons!!Okay there were actually six macarons but I put down the first three- hazelnut chocolate, coffee and strawberry chocolate, before the camera came out.(All that restraint from the Marcolini chocolates took it's form instead in a macaron frenzy to see how many I could stuff in my face at once!)These Macarons are from Tafu in Midtown but they are actually made by Itzy Bitzy Patisserie out in Brooklyn.Luckily Tafu has decided to start selling them so people like me don't have to make the trek out to Brooklyn for my fix.I truly think these macarons are the best in the city. Bouchon Bakery's are a little too big, Madelines are a little too sweet, but these are just right.They have the perfect balance of chewy meringue outside and smooth creamy filling with a shockingly wonderful pure flavor.I cannot wait to eat the rest!!So Mr. T did pretty well on the gifts huh!What did I get him?Two tickets to dinner and a show at Medieval Times!! LOL!!!We plan to spend the day avoiding the Valentine's crowds at Zum scheinder and then go to a nice dinner or brunch tomorrow.I'm having trouble deciding where to go. Our thoughts are Compass, Dovetail or Sushi Azuba.Pretty all over the place huh! If anyone has any suggestions as to which one to go to please help me out- Thanks!!!Oh and Happy Valentines Day!!!!!!Itzy Bitzy PatisseriePierre Marcolini

Mr. T and I had an impromptu dinner the other night at Sakagura.I had been dying for sushi and we decided to meet up and go to Sushi Yasuda right when it opened for dinner at 6:00. I got there right at 6:00 and they were completely booked! No room at all!I was so disappointed :(I guess I shouldn't have been surprised. Even at 6:00 on a Friday night that place is hopping.Luckily Sakagura had room at their bar so we hopped over there and had some small dishes.The highlight of the meal for me was the beers we had- particularly the one Mr. T ordered.This is the \"Ginga Kogen\" beer from Iwate, Japan.This had a fantastic nutty, rich flavor. It was kind of like a Japanese Winter beer.If they sold this in the stores I would definitely pick up a six pack.My beer was really good as well but not so special.I got the Soba Buckwheat Ale.When I ordered it I didn't realize that it was a Rogue Brewing Company beer.I love Rouge Beers but I was hoping to try something a little different. This I can find in my local bodega.Oh well- It was nice but Mr. T's really stole the show.However I love how the bottle is completely different than it normally is in the store. I kind of wanted to take it home.Our dinner was very good as well. Th best dish being of course the Sakagura pork dish.Insanely fatty, rich and salty- It was amazing.Not exactly what i was hoping for but it did the job. Next time I'll plan my Yasuda outing a little bit better.Sakagura

Chikalicious Proper!

***CONTENT
If you remember I did a post last week about Chikalicious Dessert club and their cupcakes. I had to settle for the place across the street because I could never actually get into the actual restaurant because it was too crowded. Well right after I published that post I was kind of just hanging out doing nothing and I realized something...GO RIGHT NOW!!Why not? I was doing nothing and it was early enough that there shouldn't be anyone there.So I zipped down to the East Village and showed up to Chikalicious right around 4:30.There were two couples inside and a woman with some audio visual equipment who looked to be doing a piece on the restaurant.I took a seat at the bar and placed my order.For those of you that don't know, Chikalicious is a prix fix dessert bar.For $12 you pick your choice of dessert and then you receive the Amuse of the day to begin and end with the Chef's selection of Petits Fours.The amuse that day was a Vanilla Milk Sorbet with a Kumquat Soup.Okay when I looked at this amuse I really wasn't expecting much, but when I took a bite I was absolutely floored.I can't even describe how wonderful this was. I love vanilla and this dish just had an amazingly pure vanilla flavor. Mix that with the acidity of the kumquat and it combined to make a taste that was absolutely heavenly.I was trying to show good manners by delicately spooning up the last drops in the bowl but I really wanted to throw back the saucer and lick the insides!Next up was my main dessert course which I was able to watch the chef meticulously put together behind the bar which was pretty neat.This is the Banana Carpaccio with Bourbon-Molasses Ice Cream and Coca Agar Gelee.First of all the presentation was lovely. Each piece of banana seemed so lovingly put into place with the chocolate gelee and bourbon sauce.The dessert was quite wonderful tasting as well.The warm caramelized bourbon sauce on the banana was fantastic with the creamy Bourbon- Molasses Ice Cream.When I had a bite of everything together- banana, chocolate gelee, peanut, sauce and ice cream- this dessert was fantastic.How ever there were only about 4 peanuts on the whole plate! I would definitely add more to enhance the flavor of each bite.Also the chocolate gelee was kind of dull on its own. I could barely taste the chocolate flavor. I almost tasted the texture of the gelee more than the chocolate (if that makes any sense).I think overall it was a very good dessert that could be truly fantastic with a little tweak here or there.To finish up the meal I was given a selection of three petites fours- a Coconut Marshmallow, Black Pepper Pineapple and Chai Tea Chocolate.The coconut marshmallow was tasty. I usually hate coconut unless it's toasted and this coconut was nice and toasty with a soft marshmallow.The Chai Tea Chocolate truffle was just alright. I have never enjoyed the Chai flavor with chocolate. It just doesn't taste right to me.However the last petit four, the one I saved for last because I was sure I wouldn't like it, blew me out of the water!How this tiny little jelly tasted so good I have no idea. It was like biting into summer! The pineapple flavor was once again so pure and strong it was shocking.The black pepper gave just a tiny kick at the end that really sealed in the flavor. I really wanted to ask for more of these but once again I restrained myself.So overall I really enjoyed Chikalicious. I think it's funny I probably enjoyed the beginning and end of the meal the most because they surprised me.I was worried before coming here that I would be super stuffed after the 3 desserts but I actually felt lighter than I usually do.The dessert wasn't heavy and the amuse and petite fours were small so they didn't weigh me down.For $12 it isn't cheap but the experience was worth every penny.They seem to change their menu quite often and I saw about 2 other desserts I would love to try out so hopefully I will be back soon. Valentines Day is right around the corner- might be the perfect place for a date!Chikalicious

Mr. T and I decided to try and eat something light and healthy on Sunday morning because we knew we would be chowing down later on some heavy football food for the Superbowl.We had some fruit, cleaned up the house a little and headed out to get some last minute provisions.It was such a nice day outside we decided to walk down to Whole Foods Bowery instead of just hitting up our neighborhood Union Square.Well the more we walked the more hungry we got, until both of us just decided we needed to grab something. All thoughts of our plan to stick to something light and healthy went out the window when we realized we were only one block away from Momofuku Milk Bar!It was still pretty early in the day around 2:00, but there were still about 6 people in line ahead of us.While we waited, Mr. T decided to get his usual Momofuku order- some pork buns- while I said I would satiate my cravings with a cookie.Well by the time we got up to the counter to order I had been staring at all of the deliciousness around me I just couldn't handle it and ended up ordering some ice cream and a cookie!And not just ice cream- Momofuku's graham cracker soft serve with toppings of marshmallow, pretzels, peanut butter halvah and hot fudge sauce.I think the toppings cost more than the ice cream in the end.Mr. T looked at me like I was crazy but whatever- I have no control when it comes to desserts.Here is the finished sundae.I was really excited but unfortunately I didn't really enjoy it as much as I had hoped.The custard is thick and very, very strong in graham flavor. At first I loved the strong flavor but around bite four it really started to wear on me. As far as toppings go the marshmallow and pretzel were fantastic. I loved the addition of salty crispy bits to the sweet base and I ate almost all of those- however the peanut butter halvah had a strange aftertaste that didn't seem to go with my choice of ice cream.The hot fudge was super dense and while I love a gooey rich fudge this was also a little too strong to enjoy with the strong flavor of the graham.I think this may have been the only sundae I have not been able to finish in my life.Now that isn't to say I will not try out another sundae again from here- hell no!!!!I love Momofuku- I just think I ordered wrong for my tastes.I usually have my sweets- especially sundaes - late at night and I think this was just too heavy for daytime consumption.Next time I will return after dinner and check out a different flavor of soft serve as well. They were out of the Salty Pistachio...that sounds amazing!!!Somehow I was able to down some chicken wings and a gloriously greasy Porchetta sandwich about four hours later, so I guess the sundae didn't do too much damage.Or maybe I just have the ability to eat an insane amount of unhealthy food in one day.Momofuku Milk Bar

I don't know about you but I loooove me some yakitori! I've been to a bunch of izakayas in the city from the disappointing new Mr. Jones to the basement hidden Hagi and the utterly delicious Aburiya Kinnosuke; but never to the jam packed Yakitori Taisho.Why? Because it's always too jam packed!! So last week we planned out our plan of attack and showed up right around 6:00pm.Luckily we able to walk right in and get a seat at the bar.We got a pitcher of Sapporo and started in on some tasty plates of food.First up- some yakitori of course!We decided to go for one of the platters filled with skewers of grilled shrimp, beef, chicken meatballs, regular chicken and scallion all on a bed of cabbage.Each skewer was simply fantastic- moist meat with a slightly smoky char from the grill.I think my favorites were the regular chicken and the scallions.The scallions had been doused pretty liberally with salt and the crunchy kernels on the crisp skin was like eating some sort of fantastic veggie chip.Our next dish was the Tuna Sashimi Salad.Nice big chunks of tuna on a bed of micro-greens covered in a spicy mayo sauce.The tuna was super fresh and I really enjoyed the spicy mayo on top- however there was a little bit too much.I had to start scraping the sauce off the top about halfway through so I could enjoy the taste of the tuna.Next time I would probably ask to have the sauce on the side so I could regulate the amount a little better.Next up was our skewer of beef tongue.This was absolutely delicious as well.Big, strong beefy flavor that was just perfect for gnawing on :)The only dish we didn't really care for was the Yaki Unagi Roll.It was way too huge! The Unagi inside was pretty good but it was completely overshadowed by the enormous amount of rice and generous pour of spicy mayo.They should stick to the grilling.Overall we loved our meal and I think Taisho might be my favorite of the Izakaya joints right now. For all of that food and two pitchers of beer it came to about $50.00.That is quite the deal! The atmosphere is just fun as well and everyone seems to be having a good time.Good food and Lots of Beer! Perfect night in my book!Yakitori Taisho

I have been dying to go to ChikaLicous ever since it opened but there always seems to be a huge line whenever I try.Then I realized they had opened up another store- right across the street where I could try out some of their goodies to go! How nice!I swung by the other day and the choices were overwhelming.Cookies, Pudding, Creme Brulee, Cheesecake. I literally wanted everything I saw. I finally decided to go with some cupcakes.I got two of the premium ones- the Smores and Caramel.What make these Premium?The inner filling.Check out the Smores.This truly tasted like a toasted Smores from my youth.Graham Cracker cake, dark chocolate center and topped with a slightly burnt tasting marshmallow frosting.Yum! I really didn't think it would get better than this but then I tried the Caramel.Wow! I think I liked this even better.The caramel center was sticky, sweet and utterly delicious. This was some intense caramel flavor inside such a little cake.The best part about these cupcakes was the price. Each one was only $2.25.I've paid double that for cupcakes at other places that haven't even compared in flavor.I am so glad ChikaLicious isn't closer to my apartment because I don't have the will power to resist something that tastes that good.Someday I will make it to the main place but in the mean time this will satisfy my craving.ChikaLicious Dessert Club

I love Superbowl Sunday!!!Football talk all day, good commercials, and an excuse to drink a ton of beer and eat a ton of unhealthy foods...What is there not to love!I was in Food Emporium yesterday getting some stuff for the game when I spotted this.McSorley's Dark!!!McSorleys has always been for sale in bottles but it was the light only.Now they have the dark for sale! And look at the labels- they switched them up as well and I think they're pretty cool looking.The dark is far better than the light, in my opinion, so this is fantastic!I'm hoping my friend the Pitted Pruner can get some in his area- he'll be psyched!!Anyway- I hope everyone enjoy some good food and drink today and that we see an exciting game.We plan to be chowing down on some wings from Hill Country, Porchetta sandwiches and some veggies and dip of course (gotta have something not dripping with grease).Happy Superbowl Sunday!!!

This is PHENOMENAL news! I often wondered why McSorelys didn't offer the dark to the thirsty, dark lager loving masses. Finally, our collective wishes have been granted. This is truly an epic find. Thank you TT.

Pastrami at Katz's

Two Sunday's ago was spent drinking beers and watching football in the East Village. It was a happy day- none of my teams are in the playoffs so I couldn't get upset at the end and Arizona halted Philadelphia from possibly winning both of sports greatest achievements in one year. so all was good with the world.After multiple beers we decided it was time for some serious food.And by serious food I mean Katz's delicatessen.Katz's is a NYC institution known most famously from the orgasm scene in When Harry met Sally.It is also well known however for its Pastrami sandwich.Now I have never been a big fan of pastrami. The first time I ever had it was about 5 years ago at a work function.. One of those crappy midtown lunch kind of places brought in a bunch of sandwiches and I ended up with the pastrami. It was cold, dry and pretty much tasted like a peppery piece of ham.I was not impressed.I've had it a few more times since then and the result was usually the same so I kind of gave up on it. The few times I have been to Katz's before I always got their hot dogs instead.Well after all of those beers on Sunday I was feeling no pain and decided to give this meat another shot.We got to Katz's right as they were closing and I sidled up to the bar and placed my order.The man behind the counter pulled out some huge chunks of pastrami and shaved me off a slice to eat while I waited.As soon as I got one look at the meat I knew this was going to be a very different experience.First of all it was bright red and super fatty- it kind of reminded me of a huge piece of Otoro in a weird kind of way.I picked up the warm piece of pastrami and as I put it into my mouth I couldn't help but close my eyes in amazement at the strong spicy flavor that seeped out.It was intense! There was no comparison between this meat and what I had years ago in that sandwich.This was really unbelievable.The man behind the counter took turns between various cuts of the pastrami, making sure I got a little of everything and piled it high on top of the rye bread.When it was finally ready, I grabbed the mammoth sandwich and marveled in wonder as to anyone who could ever finish this whole thing in one sitting! I barely made it through a quarter when I could do no more.It was simply too much and the smoky taste really started to overwhelm me after a little while.Luckily it was easy to wrap back up and take home for dinner the next day which is exactly what I did.So I'm very glad I finally know what REAL Pastrami tastes like. If you've been eating that murky brown stuff like I was- STOP!Do yourself a favor and get on over to Katz's! Tell them the Tasty Trekker sent you! (Actually don't do that- they have no idea who I am and may just think you are a raving lunatic)

I was so excited to try out Artisanal's version of Poutine Mr. T and I went there right after work on Friday.Man it was packed!We had to wait about 20 minutes but we finally got two seats at the bar.We ordered a couple of drinks and then waited for the main event- Poutine!!!I was so excited when it came out! I couldn't wait! And then...sadness. Their version of Poutine could be great...except it needs some adjustments. First of all, I was expecting an amazing cheese, since this is Artisanal after all, and this was the biggest flaw. It tasted like they used unsalted mozzarella. This had no flavor at all. Poutine is supposed to be a salty dish- therefore the cheese should be salted. The gravy also lacked flavor. Usually the gravy has a strong beef flavor and is much darker in color. This gravy was simply to bland. And lastly, while I loved the way the fries came out in the pan- the portion was quite small for $9.50. The pan could have held about three times as many fries. If they are only going to give such a small amount- put in into a smaller pan to serve!I was so disappointed mostly because the fries were so good!They were think and perfectly crispy- they have the potential to be the perfect companion for cheese and gravy.The bartender said they would like feedback since it was a new menu item, but it was so busy that night I didn't want to bother him.I was so disappointed I went home and wrote Artisanal an email telling them what I feel.Is that crazy?? I'm so desperate for a good Poutine I felt that I needed to.We'll see if I hear back. Until then it's Pomme Frites for me.

Blue Hill Stone Barns

We finally made it to Blue Hill at Stone Bars last weekend and I have to say it met all of our expectations and then some.Driving up the winding road to the main barns, I felt my heart start to flutter with excitement. I had no idea how beautiful this place was going to be!It was absolutely freezing and the immense Stone Barns seemed to shine a glorious blue hue against the dark wintery night sky.We walked through the gorgeous courtyard and into the warm inviting bar area. There was a roaring fire going in the fireplace and I was immediately reminded of going into the ski lodges when I was younger after a run on the slopes.We had spent the weekend with Mr. T's parents and decided to enjoy a drink at the bar with them before starting our meal.I took a look at the menu and noticed a beer made exclusively for the restaurant. It was called the Collaboration Lager made by Kelso Brewery and Blue Hill. It was actually a Honey Nut Brown Lager that was brewed by Kelso and then infused with honey right from the farm.Of course I had to try that out.It looked exactly like other Nut Brown ales with dark golden hues and a small head and had a nice honey after taste that I really enjoyed.We enjoyed a drink with the parents and then they were off for home. And we were off to enjoy a delightful meal filled with more food than I think I have ever been served in one sitting.We were seated in the corner with a great table overlooking the entire room.I borrowed this picture from Mens Vouge to show you how nice it was. (Hopefully I don't get into trouble)Once we were seated we ordered a nice Pinot Noir and set to ordering.There is no menu per se at Blue Hill. They give you a list of ingredients that may be used during the meal and ask you a few questions regarding food allergies and your preferences and then we were off!We decided to go all out and get the farmers feast which would showcase the best of what Blue Hill had to offer that night.Below is the only picture that I will have for this amazing dinner because the lighting in the restaurant was awful for picture taking and I honestly wanted to enjoy the meal without thinking about pictures.We were started off with a vegetable tray of sorts.Carrot, Bok Choy and a little head of cauliflower all on sticks.This turned out to be a true example of what Blue Hill is all about and a precursor to great things to come.The vegetable were seasoned with only a splash of lemon and that was it. OMG they were so wonderful!Never have I had a carrot that tasted so much like carrot before! Really! The flavor was just intensely strong!It was amazing. Second Amuse Bouche- Sunchoke and parsley soup- so thick and rich I don't think I could have had more than the tiny shot glass size they gave us.Bread with Ronnybrook butter.The Ronnybrook butter was good but then they brought out a tray with the Stone Barns butter and it just blew that away.Creamy, rich and utterly fresh - the butter was out of this world.It also came with ricotta cheese, arugula salt and carrot salt for putting on the bread.I honestly think Mr. T and I would have been just fine if we could just sit there and eat the bread all night.OMG it was by far the best bread and butter I have ever experienced!Along with the bread came a side of artichoke, blue corn and zucchini chips with a little tray of bologna and capicola.Next came the item of food I will dream about forever.An absolutely miniscule burger made from beet, goat cheese and pancetta with a sesame stick.Holy Cats! This was out of this world!!! I wanted to ask for more! I have no idea what they did to make this little beet taste so amazing but it was one of the best things I have ever tasted.Okay, at this point the food just started to come out like crazy and I don't have time to talk about all of the dishes but I'll try to list all of the courses and comment on a few.Roasted Leeks with apple and mushrooms- leek as it's own main course- you better believe it!Sea Bass with winter veggie puree.Sea Scallop with chopped endive and beet sauce.Chicken with spinach gnocchi in a spinach sauce.Fried whole egg with lettuce puree and beluga lentils. The lentils really looked like caviar!Veal with roasted baby carrots.By the time the veal came around I was so stuffed I could only manage about two bites.Which is unfortunate because it was so insanely delicious I almost wanted to ask for a doggie bag!Palate cleanser of blood orange sorbet.Apple tart with sweet apple sauce.Mini caramel macaroon to end.Whew! That was a lot of food!Now some notes about the dinner.Everything we had was simply wonderful but if I had to say there were any misses it would probably be the desserts.The apple tart was kind of boring and the blood orange sorbet didn't really do it for me. However the mini macaroon was simply perfect.Also we found there to be a little too much veggie sauce with each dish.By the time we got to the egg Mr. T said he never wanted to see another green sauce in his life!However- these were very very small misses in a meal of incredible hits.I marveled at how there seemed to be an endless flow of waiters helping with our every need and never making a mistake.I ordered a Moscato with my dessert and when it poured slightly flat the waiter immediately brought over another bottle and poured a second glass without me even asking.The service was truly top notch.So overall it was incredible. The farmers feast is really way to much food so next time we would definitely only order the 5 course menu.Blue Hill is truly a special place and I can't wait to return in the summertime and walk around their lovely grounds. Everything was so fresh and beautiful it was a little hard to come back to the concrete reality of the city.Blue Hill Stone Barns

There seems to be a lot going on in the world of food lately and I just thought I would pass along some info.The next Choice Eats Events has been announced for March 31st at the Lexington Avenue Armory! Right by my apartment! Yay!!Last year the event was awesome. I showed up early to get door tickets but then left and came back to find a HUGE line. This year I plan to schedule it a little better and have already purchased my tickets. They are $35 and you can get them here. Choice Eats 2009Second Man vs. Food is on tonight and he'll be here in NYC! I'm kind of excited since he is supposed to be going to Katz's and I just revisited there on Sunday (Post to follow soon).Lastly I received an email from the Picholine/Artisanal group yesterday that had a ton of great restaurant deals. The one I am most excited about though is the POUTINE!!Yes! Apparently Artisanal has started to sell Poutine at their bar and I could not be more psyched! I love poutine and to have it made with some really good fancy cheese will be wonderful. Hopefully I can make it there this weekend.

Another Restaurant Week Lunch at Eleven Madison

Restaurant Week! Yay!!!!I love this time of year when I have an excuse to take a half day of work or call in sick just to enjoy a wonderful lunch that I otherwise could not afford.This year it actually fell on Martin Luther King day so I had the whole day off to enjoy!!As usual I had forgotten to get reservations the day they went on opentable so I just had to cross my fingers and hope there would be a spot at the bar for lunch at Eleven Madison.I showed up about 5 minutes to 1:00 and luckily snagged the last table.I was meeting my friend Maria for lunch who had never been here before so I took a seat facing the bar so she could enjoy beautiful windows overlooking Madison Square Park and the gorgeous dining room. The snow had just started to fall and the view was particularly stunning that day.Once she arrived we had a quick discussion regarding the wine list and placed our order.As usual they started us with a choice of bread, olive baguette or French roll.I love their olive baguette so I happily chose one of those and got to work with the salt and butter.Eleven Madison has great creamy rich butter and tasty sea salt for their bread. Up until 3 days ago I would give it first prize in the state but that goes to Blue Hill Stone Barns now (I'll post about that next).However the butter and salt are excellent and a great start to the meal.For my appetizer I decided to go with the Octopus salad with Avocado, Fennel and Satsuma Tangerine.When this salad came out it looked like a huge mound of mostly fennel and frisee. However upon closer inspection this salad was PACKED!There were huge pieces of octopus that seemed to be lightly grilled with just a little lemon juice and olive oil.The salad was accompanied by big chunks of avocado, avocado cream and various pieces of tangerine (although one tasted like blood orange so maybe that was in there as well?).The parts alone were very good, but the parts together were fantastic!The citrus from the tangerine completely changed the flavor of the octopus with creamy avocado. It was such a different dish depending on what was eaten together.I found the fennel a tad overpowering but otherwise this was a great appetizer.The portion was absolutely enormous and I barely got though half of the dish before I had to stop myself and save room for my main course. Maria got the Poached egg with Wild Mushroom and Parmesan.The egg looked like it was perfectly poached with some runny middle mixing into the Parmesan foam.The main course options were honestly a little bit disappointing for me.The choices were Salmon, Boudin Blanc, Risotto, Chicken and a Pork Tagliatelle.I am not a big fan of rice or pasta, Boudin Blanc is a little bit much for me and I'm allergic to Salmon.Therefore by default I had the Chicken.Luckily everything at Eleven Madison, including the chicken, is beyond the norm.This is Roasted Organic Chicken with Celery and Black Trumpet mushrooms.It came with two portions of chicken, one white meat and one dark.Okay...WHY can't I make chicken like this!!!It was so juicy and so moist it was unbelievable.The skin was buttery and crisp while the potato puree beneath seemed to soak up all of the mushroom foam making a brown smooth beautiful sauce for the poultry.Maria ordered the Roasted Atlantic Salmon with Sweet Potatoes and Iranian Dried Figs.I didn't try this dish because of my Salmon allergy but she said it was fantastic.The sweet potato puree with the fish look fabulous and I have to say we were both pretty consumed with our entrees.We were in quite the discussion but at one point we both stopped to say \"Man, this is so good\".For dessert I knew I needed something with chocolate so I went for the Chocolate Mousse with Olive Oil Ice Cream.The chocolate Mousse was fantastic.It wasn't overly sweet but quite smooth with a truffle like flavor and black chocolate bottom.The ice cream really perplexed me and I'm not quite sure it worked with the dish.It tasted a little more sour- like a Crème Fraiche, which I don't care for but the mousse was excellent.Maria got the cheesecake which looked beautiful and was a lot lighter than regular cheesecake.The desserts were good but the savory was definitely the highlight of the meal.So the weirdest part about Eleven Madison was the service.I've been there now 5 times and have had nothing short of spectacular service and this time was no different- they just seemed to be confused a lot.Almost every time my dish was given to Maria and vice versa, there was quite a bit of time between our courses being given and cleared away, and when we were waiting for or check the server came over and put down silverware telling us or desserts would be right out!We had just eaten our desserts!!I wish I wasn't so full- I would have gone for seconds!So that was a little strange but by no means a damper to the meal.At the end we were both full of food and happy.And then such a nice surprise!!A gift certificate for $28! The price of a regular lunch!So our lunch was basically free!!! How awesome is that!Oh restaurant week- you made me a believer again and it's only the start. I may have to hit up another one in the next two weeks. Offers like this are hard to come by.

A NY State Dinner

A couple of weeks ago some friends and I got together and decided to have a dinner that highlighted some of the best food NY state and NYC in particular had to offer.We all split up food tasks and the best cook of the group agreed to host (we really just did all of this as a ploy for him to cook for us!) The problem with our dinner was deciding what to get. NYC has SO much too offer but I think we did a pretty good job over all.My contribution was a Meat & Cheese platter of sorts from Di Palo's.Look at this meat. It's beautiful! Now this dinner actually happened the weekend before Christmas (I'm a little behind) and I had to wait in line for almost 3 hours to get this meat! Not just in any line either! I was in a \"crammed up next to the freezer with a crowd of tourist chattering around me and waving their numbers like someone was going to forget them even though it was on number 9 and they had number 37\" kind of line! Whew!But you know what- it was worth it! The guys at DiPalo's are the best- super friendly and the best quality in town.You can't beat it.I basically got about four different kinds of Prosciutto: Prosciutto di Parma, Prosciutto di San Daniele, Speck and some kind of seasoned and cooked Prosciutto.All of it was fantastic with my favorite still being the Prosciutto de Parma with its salty, nutty goodness. I also really enjoyed the Prosciutto di San Daniele which was very similar to the Parma except it had a slightly tougher texture and sweeter flavor. I also picked up some fantastic cheese at DiPalo's.In the bowl is DiPalo's famous house made burrata.Burrata is basically a round ball of mozzarella cheese that has an inside filled with a softer mozzarella and cream so it's super spreadable.If you never had this before you are missing out! It's so creamy, rich and utterly delicious I wanted to spread it on everything!I also got two different kinds of Pecorino- one aged from Italy and one freshly made.I had never had fresh Pecorino and while it was tasty I much prefer the aged. It has a much stronger and salty flavor that really went fantastic with the cured meat and the little jar of honey I picked up.With all this cheese and meat we needed some carbs!Sullivan Street Bakery- man they make some tasty breads!I can't even remember how many different kinds we had- Pizza bianco, olive stecca, tomato stecca, the Focaccia Florentina stuffed with rosemary and my favorite the Roasted garlic stecca with huge chunks of luscious stinky garlic stuffed inside a buttery bread stick.Oh my Goodness and we haven't even gotten to our dinner yet!The main event?Short ribs, Brussels sprouts, potatoes and celery.Does that sound good? Thinking where's the New York?What if I tell you it was Daniel Boulud's Short Ribs Braised in Red Wine with Celery Duo, Momofuku Brussels sprouts and a Potato Puree!!!This picture doesn't do the meal justice.The short Rib had been slowly cooking for days and the result was a super tender, fall of the bone but surprisingly not fatty piece of meat that almost melted a bit when you took a bite.The Brussels sprouts were straight from David Chang's recipe roasted with fish sauce and rice krispies.Do you understand now why we wanted our friend to host this party??He went all out!By the end of the meal we were so full we had to wait almost two whole hours before we could even think about dessert.Meanwhile we had a wonderful time drinking some wines from Long Island and lots of NY beers such as Brooklyn Black Chocolate stout, Brooklyn Lager and all of the Ommegeng's (Abbey ale, Three Philosophers & Rare Vos)When dessert time finally did roll around it was a five star end.A box of some kind of Chinese Almond Brittle from Chinatown and a Peanut Butter Pie straight from Magnolia Bakery.OMG..again..Magnolia has SO much more to offer than cupcakes!!!This pie had a creamy peanut butter filling inside a crispy wafer crust, crushed peanuts, Reese's peanut butter cups on top and a surprise layer of Carmel that just blew this dessert out of the park!I know I gained about 10 pounds from this dinner and it was worth it.The funniest thing is that we could do it all again with all different foods!This was truly one of those nights that reminds you why NYC is so great! We have the best food and you can do it all at home!!So if this recession is getting you down and you really can't afford to go out do this-Go to the liquor store- get some wine and whip up some delicious food with these recipes. Turn your home into the NYC experience! Daniel Boulud Short RibDavid Chang Brussel Sprouts

Okay so did anyone else see Top Chef last night? I try not to blog about this show because I don't like to comment on people's personalities- just their food. But after last nights episode I think most people can agree on two things-Stephan is quite possibly the most conceited person I have ever seen AND Blue Hill Stone Barns looks awesome.The second thing is the most important because Mr. T and I are FINALLY going there for dinner on Saturday!!I have been wanting to go since it opened back in 2004 I think.I tried many, many times and could not get a weekend reservation.Finally I called exactly at 9:00 two months to the date and scored a reservation for this Saturday. It is crazy how popular they are!Of course it's going to be one of the coldest days of the year so I don't know how much farm walking we will be doing but I am so excited about the food. I will definitely report back!

This weekend was all about two things- football and pork.Actually I guess you could add beer in there as well since we seemed to have a lot of that also but the main events were the pork and games.We met up with some friends and started our night by grabbing some sandwiches at the revered Porchetta.The tiny little shop on 7th street can barely hold more than 8 people, and it was already filled to capacity, so we decided to just grab some sandwiches to go and find a bar to eat.We ended up at Arrow where they had a great 2 for 1 special going on which helped us start our night on a good foot.As soon as we got our beers we tore into the tinfoil and unwrapped one of the most succulent, fat laden sandwich's I have ever tasted.At first glance this sandwich seemed a little on the small side. Once I had my first bite I realized the intensity and fat in this sandwich was going to be enough to fill me beyond belief.The pork was so moist there were literally tiny chunks of fat hidden throughout the meat.Can you see the roll glistening? That is from the fat.Don't let that gross you out.OMG it was so good. The pork was seasoned pretty heavily with sage, garlic and fennel but it just seemed to melt into the crusty roll.This had so much flavor it was unbelievable! It may have been one of the best sandwiches I have ever eaten.Every other bite between the juicy pork you would get a crispy bit of skin from the pork crackling that was texturally strange but utterly delicious.Not exactly heart healthy but pretty fricken awesome!What was almost better than the sandwich though was the side. Crispy cheese potatoes with burnt ends. This was awesome!!! The potatoes must have been made with some of the leftover pork fat because there was a definite pork flavor that came straight from the potatoes.A couple of the burnt ends were almost a little too charred in my bowl but there were enough that were perfect that I can't complain. For $5 this bowl of potatoes was a delicious value that rocked.In the end I have to say it could get no better. Awesome pork sandwich, ridiculous potatoes and two for one beers while watching football.Heaven!!!Later that night after many more beers we decided to have even more pork and went for a late night meal at Ippudo where I had the Pork Classic Ramen with extra Pork Belly added in.I am apparently trying to see how much fat my body can handle in one day.I woke up the next morning and literally had a pork hangover.We had bought the Wii Fit the day before so I decided to try it out and get rid of some of my weekend weight.Unfortunately once I started the Wii fit told me that according to my BMI and health habits my Wii fit age was 43.It must be broken I thought.Then it asked me if I fall over a lot because my balance is very off.I think Mr. T is still laughing from that comment.Anyway the Porchetta sandwich was worth every delicious moment.It isn't cheap- it's almost $10.00- and it isn't something you should eat more than once a month health wise- but it is soo good.Too bad none of my teams won their football games or it would have been a quite perfect weekend.Pochetta

I was so excited when I heard the owners of Bao Noodles were opening up a Banh Mi place only one block away.I walked by what seemed like a million times to find them still hammering away, not quite open for days!Then the holidays came along and I kind of forgot about Baoguette until Tuesday when Mr. T and I were heading home and once again faced with the dinner dilemma.Then we remembered Baoguette.We ran inside the little store and were very pleased to see quite a larger array of offerings than we had expected.There was a green papaya salad, shrimp summer rolls, a catfish sandwich and a couple different kinds of Bahn Mi.Now they had the traditional with Pork, but I decided to try something different and ordered the BBQ Chicken Bahn Mi.This was a pretty decent sized sandwich for $5.00!Chicken, Cucumber, pickled daikon (I ended taking out the Cilantro-ewww!) and shredded carrots get stuffed inside a crunchy roll and topped with a generous amount of garlic aoli and sriracha hot sauce.This was a very good Bahn Mi. Not quite as good as the one I had from Saigon Bakery but pretty close.Everything tasted very fresh and the bread to filling ratio was spot on.I had asked for it medium spicy but next time I would probably go for hot since the medium was pretty tame.Mr. T was feeling like something warm and hearty so he ordered one of the specials that night the Spicy Beef Noodle soup.Mr. T also ordered it medium spicy as well and at first it tasted very strong. But then after a sip or two it kind of died down and next time he will probably get hot also.The noodles were cooked just right and there were huge chunks of beef floating around in the nice meaty broth.They do not skimp on the fillings here either. This soup was about 80% filling and 20% broth. Awesome!!Total bill $13.00.We were both so stuffed we didn't even finish. That's a pretty good deal.And we found out that they deliver! So on those days were we are sooo lazy we can't even walk to one block we can still get our Bahn Mi fix!Ahhh...I love NY!Baoguette

Okay I have really been trying to go off of coffee but life has certainly been making it hard.Remember my favorite espresso joint of the year? The one I would travel all the way uptown to 59th street for Fika?They opened one 5 blocks away from my apartment.How awesome!! It's my Christmas present!I swung by the other day and was very happy to see they had all of my favorite pastries, including the wonderfully delicate vanilla dreams and the sweet raspberry tarts.I got a macchiato and was in heaven.It's funny too. I had been in a really bad mood. Just kind of depressed for a while and this place completely lifted my spirits.The big window store front allowed me to stand and watch the world outside without having to be involved in all of its' business.Sometimes I just need a little time away from the world and a good warm treat to make me feel better.Fika definitely delivered.Unfortunately I may not be able to quit my coffee habit for a while :(

I was checking out Serious Eats the other day and noticed an article about Joe Jr's!!! I'd been dying to go back to this diner and somehow never made it. It was one of the first places Mr. T and I ate when we moved here and we loved it.It just so happens that same night we had no plans for dinner, so I convinced Mr. T to go back for some good diner food.Joe Jr's is a tiny little place that definitely has a neighborhood vibe. Most of the people in there knew our waiter by name and it just feels like its run by a big family.I was planning to get some kind of salad but the pictures from that Serious Eats post got the best of me and I decided to order a cheeseburger.This is one of the greatest things about Joe Jr's. Within 5 minutes of ordering my food the cheeseburger was sitting in front of me.This is the kind of service you want at a diner.The cheeseburger came just like this, open faced with a slice of cheese melted on top of each bun.The patty wasn't super thick but an ample size.Slapped on top of the squishy white bun it was a perfect match.The patty wasn't fancy; it had no foie gras or brisket inside. Just simple ground chuck with a perfectly crispy char on the outside and plenty of juicy goodness inside.The burger came with a small side of coleslaw and a nice crunchy dill pickle of course.We split an order of fries and although they were a little thicker than I like my spuds they were incredibly crispy.Joe Jr's is a great place. Our bill for our meal came to $14.00 which is less than we would have spent on delivery and quicker.Joe's is a great neighborhood staple that I'm so glad I got to return too!Next time we're coming for their breakfast which looks just as amazing as dinner and just as cheap.

I hope everyone had a fabulous New Years Eve! I had a great night out with friends and ended the night drinking some especially good wine and beer (thanks M&J)!I have to say I'm sad the holidays are over but also a little relived. It seems like Mr. T and I have been going nonstop for the last 2 weeks.We ended up sleeping today until 2:00 pm!! That's crazy!We were out late but still...anyway we got some much needed rest to hopefully start the new year off right!Here's to lots of good new food and drink in 2009!!

A Wonderful Christmas

I just returned from a wonderful Christmas filled with tons of good food, family and friends.Way too much eating and drinking went on over the past week and I cannot mention everything so I'll try to give a little outline with a few highlights.The festivities started off at Mr. T's parents, where we started to enjoy the after noon by opening up a MAGNUM of Chimay Blue Grand Reserve.Yes, that's right, a Magnum.Now I have had Chimay Blue before and always enjoyed the flavor but this time it was a little different.There was still the nice malty smell and taste but it was smoother somehow. When I got home I checked out their website and they said it is indeed quite a different beer than a regular sized Chimay.Since it is such a huge amount, it affects the second fermentation of the beer which results in a fuller, smoother product.So the regular, easy to drink 9% abv. Chimay became even easier to drink and enjoy.We were all feeling pretty good by the end of the bottle and decided to break out another special drink for the holiday season.A bottle of 1998 Opus One wine.Wow. Mr. T's father had been waiting for years to open this bottle until it age enough and I think he did it just right.It had a full mouth feel with silky undertones and a woody, leather smell. We let it breathe for a while and even then it continued to change taste with each glass becoming a little drier every minute.It was excellent.We followed that up with some fantastic home cooked food and some Doughnut Plant Crème Brulee doughnuts for dessert.I wish I had taken a picture but they were gone before I could!Little round balls of dough stuffed with a vanilla custard filling and covered in a sweet glaze that had been caramelized a bit, giving it that classic burnt crème brulee flavor.Yum!!!Christmas day we woke up, celebrated the morning with the T's and then headed to the airport to catch a plane to Buffalo.What followed next were day's filled with moree good food and great drinks.I finally got to Ulrich's, the oldest bar in Buffalo and enjoyed a great local brew, the Flying Bison Munich Style Dark Lager, which is brewed exclusively for Ulrichs.It had a great rich taste of coffee and hint of chocolate that warmed me right up on such a rainy cold night.I loved Ulrich's itself as well. It reminded me a little bit of McSorley's with the old exterior and pictures plastered inside.I found it a little strange that it was both a German and Irish bar?? But hey, the beer was good and people friendly, so why complain?The rest of the week I enjoye a lot of great things, lunch at the Roycroft and Panno's, dinner out in Perry at The Hole in the Wall, Sahlens hot dogs on the grill at one of the coldest Bills games in history...Just a great time.The last day I didn't feel like I had my fill of Buffalo food so I went all out!For lunch I got my whole family together and picked up a bunch of great food for us to share before I left.First stop was my favorite place for food in the area, the Bar Bill.Sweet, incredibly crispy Honey Butter BBQ wings, Sicilian wings (think Italian dressing and parmesan cheese on a wing), moist and juicy Beef on Weck, hot crispy beer fries and a couple orders of Zeet (kind of like a sausage hot pocket).Then I stopped at another favorite, Pasquale's, for a slice of their thick greasy pizza (I don't like thick pizza but this one is the bomb) and a perfect chicken finger sub made with breaded chicken fingers dipped in hot sauce, topped with melted Provolone Cheese, lettuce, tomatoes and bleu cheese.Whew!! Thank goodness the family was able to help me eat all of this! It was quite the lunch buffet.I have to reiterate again how good the wings at the Bar Bill truly are. The best in Buffalo- no contest.After this smorgasbord of food it was back to the airport.Except I decided to stop on the way for one more thing- Mighty Taco!!If you grew up in the area you swear by this fast food style taco. Most out-of-towners think its disgusting. Hey whatever- I think it's awesome.I picked up a Super Mighty Pack and wrapped it up tight to enjoy for diner later that night back home.So we retuned to NYC tired, full but happy. It was a great trip and a wonderful Christmas.I can't button my pants any more so a diet is in need but that doesn't mean I'll stop posting.I was so busy the last couple weeks I haven't had time to post about some awesome things I've had lately.So get ready to hear about my Congee face off, a unique NY state dinner and the opening of one of my favorite places 50 blocks closer to my apartment!! Here's to 2009!

I woke up Sunday morning and was determined to get all of my Christmas shopping done before it was time to watch football.I decided to head out to the farthest place first, so I jumped on the 6 train and headed to the Upper East Side. I needed to pick up a gift certificate at Café Sabarsky and I decided I might as well enjoy a cup of coffee while I was there as well.Unfortunately a lot of other people seemed to have the same idea as I did and there were no tables left for me when I arrived.The maitre d' told me the downstairs café, Café Fledermaus, was open with the same menu so I decided to check it out.I walked in the café and was greeted, rather jovially, by two waiters with thick Austrian accents.I was kind of taken a back by the enthusiastic greeting at first, until I realized there was no one else in the café besides myself. These guys were probably dying for a customer, so I happily took a seat.Everything about the downstaits is kind of mod. Black and white checkered floors, sleek black tables and shiny seats. I didn't look at the menu I simply ordered a cup of coffee and what came out before me next was quite impressive.A silver tray with my coffee, a little pitcher of milk and a glass of water.I really felt like I was someone special! Never before have I had such a beautiful looking tray.Then I tried the coffee.OMG it was fantastic!! Quite possibly the best coffee I have ever had. I have heard that there is no replacement for the coffee in Vienna but wow- this Viannese coffee was superb.It was big and robust but also perfectly smooth. I could have drank at least 3 more cups. Thank goodness I didn't though!Fast forward about an hour later and I was a caffeine mess! I had been planning to do some Christmas shopping and I couldn't keep focused.My eyes felt like they were open bigger than they have ever been before. I was practically running down Madison Avenue, sweating a little bit in the freezing cold and feeling a bit like a mad man.I don't know if it was because I didn't eat anything yet that day, or maybe because I have given up my daily coffee and save it now for weekends only and my tolerance was down...or maybe it was juts some really Strong coffee!!I ended up walking (running really) all the way to Union Square! That's about 72 blocks!I'm not gonna lie either. I loved it! I haven't had a caffeine rush like that in years!!So anyway- back to the café- I enjoyed my coffee and got the check.The bill came to $6.50 which is pretty pricey for a cup of coffee.I'm glad I don't live closer to the café because it would be hard to pass up such a wonderful cup of coffee every day and I certainly can't afford that daily price tag. But once in a while it's a nice treat.

Brunch at Noho Star and the Rest of the Gluttonus Weekend

After such a huge meal at Peter Lugers the night before you would think that food would be the last thing on our mind Saturday morning.However we ate quite early the night before and after much more imbibing after Luger's, I woke up ready to eat!We had been planing to get Thai food for lunch, but this being a complete gluttonous weekend, we decided we were all hankering for a good Bloody Mary to help start off our day.So we headed out to Noho Star.We got there around right around 12:30 and the place was already packed!Then it occurred to me...Oh yeah. Saturday brunch in Noho before Christmas equals lots of shoppers and tourists out eating.Probably not the best choice, since we were all starving, however some seats opened up at the bar and we were able to get a breakfast cocktail while we waited. Have a look at this Bloody Mary.Wow. This thing was fantastic.Can you see all of the chunky tomato goodness and the black pepper swirling around?This was spicy, thick and rich. Kind of like a meal on its own and certainly just what the doctor ordered after a long night out.Now I am no Bloody Mary expert but Arian is and he deemed this one of the best Bloody Mary's ever.So after about a half hour wait we were seated and placed our order.Mr. T hates brunch for many reasons, but one of the reasons is he always orders wrong (remember the Soft Shell Crab sandwich?? Again, who orders that for brunch??)Anyway, this time he did much better. He went for a classic brunch item, French Toast with fruit.One of the things that can ruin French Toast sometimes is the sugar overkill.Not here. The dough was light, fluffy with a good flavor that wasn't too sweet so you were still able to add some maple syrup and enjoy.The fruit on the toast was amazing. The bananas and blueberries were incredibly fresh . It's hard to find fruit that tastes this great in December. The fruit was $3.00 extra but worth every penny.I knew we had a big day ahead so I went for something a little heavier and unhealthier for a good base. The Croque Monsieur.When this first arrived I thought it looked a little bit small but once I took a bite I knew it would be more than enough.Multiple slices of thinly sliced ham on a Challah roll topped with Bechamel sauce and Fontina cheese.I loved this Croque for two reasons. The bread to ham ratio was about 50/50 which you don't usually get and the Fontina cheese was perfectly melty and rich on top of the Challah roll.I ate every last bite.So brunch ended up being a success! Mr. T still hates brunch and had some choice words about some of the people dining there, but hey. You can't change everyone!I will not go into too much detail about the rest of our day, but suffice it to say we never really stopped eating and drinking at any point!Here is our food and drink rundown for the rest of Saturday after brunch:Espresso and chocolate at MariebelleFantastic Beers at Half PintPomme Frites and Leffe Bruns at Vol de NuitProsciutto and wine at OttoCheese plate and more wine at 8th street Wine CellarSushi assortment from HaruFour Cheese, Neapolitan and Cheeseburger Macaroni and Cheese's from SmacAnd then late night eats at NY Noodletown which included crispy duck, pork over rice, beef and broccoli and two other dishes that I have little to no recollection of because the beer and wine had definitely caught up with me at that point.And in the middle of all that we somehow watched the Pacquio vs. De La Hoya fight, saw the tree in Rockefeller Center and did the touristy Times Square all in the middle of a lovely snowfall.Whew!!I'm tired out just writing all of that! I woke up on Sunday ridiculously tired and ready for a diet. (which didn't happen because the Bills lost so I got depressed and ordered a HUGE piece of Chocolate Malt Ball cake from Big Daddy's diner :()Anyway it was a lovely weekend that encompasses everything I enjoy in life- good friends, great food and NYC!

A Fantastic Weekend of Food & Drink -Peter Lugers

My two friends from upstate came to visit last weekend and I was psyched!Why? Because they are fun people but more importantly they love good food and wine as much as me!So I knew it was going to be a great weekend. I just didn't realize the amount of food we would eat! Offdah! Talk about being indulgent!But I'm getting ahead of myself.Friday started with a half day of work and then off the Grand Central to pick up the Pitted Pruner and Arian.The one thing I love about the Pitted Pruner is that he almost always knows what he wants to eat. I can sit and contemplate for hours, agonizing over the various choices. The Pruner gets a hankering and that's that.It was no different today. I rolled up and he says \"let's grab some sushi.\"Sure! I already liked the way this weekend was starting.So we head over to Sushi Yasuda.Now we knew we had reservations for Peter Luger later so we didn't go crazy but ordered a couple rolls and some amazing pieces of Eel and Toro.Yasuda delivered as always and we were off to start the drinking portion of our day.Our first stop was the Ginger Man for some flights of beer, then onto McSorley's for some light and darks,then onto Winebar to cleanse our palates a little from the beer and get ready to take on some meat! The day I moved to this city I was told that in order to experience the best steak in my life I should go to Peter Lugers.Eight years later I can finally say I had the Luger experience.We were all so excited!!! We had a 6:45 reservation so we hopped in a cab from Winebar and drove across the bridge.When we arrived the place was packed! There were a ton of people milling about up front and we ended up waiting about 10 minutes in the bar area for our table.Peter Lugers is definitely a no frills kind of place but it has that old school manly kind of charm about it. The wooden beams and square tables just kind of fit, and having come straight from McSorley's we were already in that old fashioned mood.We took a seat and decided to order a bottle of Cabernet, two steaks for two, a bacon appetizer and the creamed spinach as a side.As soon as we ordered our waiter brought us over our bottle of wine and quite a tasty basket of bread.I ended up grabbing a delicious onion roll that was slightly warm and had just the perfect amount of seasoning on it.I had barely finished my roll when I saw another plate, this with one of my favorite meat products, placed before my eyes. Bacon!!!!!!!!!Hoolee Cow!!! These are some enormous slices of bacon!We decided to only get two pieces to split between the four of us and I have to admit, I wish we had just gotten our own.This bacon had so much flavor but not in an overpowering way. It was simply moist, smoky and delicious. Really I think it may have been the favorite part of my meal.Not to say that the steak is far behind!Here is the Porterhouses for two. Photo By Arian AnstettLugers Porterhouse comes sliced up on a gigantic plate perfect for just grabbing and going at it.Our meat was cooked a perfect medium rare and man it was awesome! See that pool of liquid at the bottom of the pate? Yeah that's just some melted butter.Yum!!I was a pure glutton and dipped each meat piece into the warm buttery pool. Glorious is how it tasted. Glorious!Everyone told us to try the steak sauce there, and well I just don't get it.Why would you want to put a sauce on meat that is this wonderful??? I didn't want to do anything to this steak.! It was moist, delicate and full of flavor. I did end up trying the sauce though and it was really strange.It tasted like cocktail sauce for some shrimp? Is that possible? Did they just refill the bottle wrong?Part of me wondered if all of the beer and wine had caught up with me and maybe I messed up and tried to put the cocktail sauce on rather than the steak sauce.A qiuck call to my freinds confirmed it. I was right. It did taste like that. Weird.Anyway the steak didn't need it.So do I think Peter Luger was the best steak ever? Hmm... Mr. T thinks it is and I would put it up there with the best. I feel like I have to go back at least one more time to make sure though before I make that claim.That will not be hard to do. I have been dreaming about that bacon all week!! When we got the check they gave us some big golden chocolate coins! I was too full for dessert so this was the perfect end to a fantastic meal.I left full, drunk and happy.Lugers is not a cheap meal by any means but worth the price tag and definitely worth the trip to Brooklyn and then some.We left Lugers and took a cab back to the city where we imbibed some more (maybe too much?) but had a fabulous time.We woke up the next morning in great need of a fantastic brunch and even more fantastic Bloody Marys.More to come...

Oh boy, I still have yet to visit Peter Lugers...but your photos have me convinced I must go sometime very soon. I've also yet to meet a person who had room for dessert by the time they were finished with the steak...heheheh :)

I thought it was just me that thought the peter luger sauce tasted like sweet cocktail sauce! The bf thinks it reminds him of surf n turf without the seafood part.

The buttery golden goodness resting at the bottom of that steak plate complimented the meat as the moon itself compliments the earth.

Holy Crap! There's only two weeks of 2008 left!!!!Well Time Out New York just came out with its best picks for food and drink in 2008 and I figured, hey, I should do my own! Precursor!!! Just so you know, not all of these places are new to 2008. Some have been around for a long time but I have only been able to try them for the first time this year. This is my little favorites of the year list. The funniest thing is that I didn't blog about half of them! I don't really know why I guess I was just really busy this year and I decided to save the best for last :)So here goes:Bacon Fat English Muffin at Momofuku KoFirst thing I thought of when I started this list. Not only was it one of the most unbelievable meals I have ever eaten OR scored a reservation too, this English Muffin was a sinfully delicious treat I will always remember. La Caille at L'Atelier de Joel RobuchonFree range caramelized quail stuffed with foie gras, potato puree and summer truffle. This was my birthday meal and it met every expectation. The quail was made extra moist by the fatty foie gras and the whole dish came with the best pureed mashed potatoes in the world. Sweetbread Ravioli with sweet corn, lime and chorizo at Eleven MadisonThis was one of those dishes where my eyes literally rolled back in my head and I may have even moaned in delight a little. Rich, buttery and utterly cheap since it was on the restaurant week menu! Eleven Madison never fails to disappoint.New Favorite dish- Whole BronzinoI've had this dish a LOT of places this year and I just love every variation I've tried. It's big, meaty and delicious.Best Meal- BabboStarting with the wonderful charred Octopus I already thought I was in heaven but the huge Rib eye for two had so much flavor I was floored. Babbo deserves all of the hype it gets and more.Best Fast Food Burger- Five GuysThis is a great chain with stellar burgers and fries. I still love my Shack Shake the best but not having to wait more than 5 minutes for some awesome meat and fries is wonderful.Best Gourmet Burger- PJ Clark's & PruneI've only been to Prune once and it rocked with its buttery English Muffin goodness. PJ Clark's I've been to multiple times this year and the Cadillac burger has never disappointed. I love burgers so much it's hard to pick a favorite but these blow my old favorite, Mollys, out of the water.Best Fish Dish- Halibut with corn and English Peas at Little Owl.I had this in the spring and it truly represented what spring was all about. Fresh, clean, lively flavors. A rebirth of food. Lovely.Best Desserts- Gramercy Tavern, Otto & Cafe SabarskyThe German Chocolate cake at Gramercy Tavern was decadent and delightful at once. The Black and white parfait at Otto was a masterpiece of different flavors that all seemed to work together. Chocolate cake with Pistachio frosting is nothing to be messed with at Sabarsky. I wish I could end my meal with these every night!!Where I agree with Time Out New York- Artichoke, Amai & IppudoAll nearby, they have made this neighborhood that much better for food. Artichoke's creamy lactose heavy pizza, Ippudo's thick ramen broth and Amai's lovely green tea cupcake have filled the void of many a desolate food night.Best sushi- Yasuda Medium Fatty Toro and any kind of Eel.He is a master. Sit in front of him and you will have the best sushi ever. Hands down.And the rest:Espresso- Fika & AbracoSausages- Jimmy's No 43Wings & Ribs- Dinosaur BBQSoup Dumplings- Shanghai CafeIt was a fantastic year for food and I was very lucky to have experienced all I have.I will end it kind of cheesy but totally true:Best dining excursion of the year- anything with a bottle of wine and my Mr. T.Here's to 2009!!!

After a wonderful and lovely Thanksgiving with family and friends we came home from Florida on Friday happy but a little tired.Saturday came and we had more company come and stay with us for the weekend.By the time Sunday night rolled around I was exhausted and decided to take a much needed break and took the day off on Monday.I slept in late and decided to treat myself to lunch. I was planning to meet Mr. T for his lunch break at my favorite burger joint P.J. Clark's but then Mr T had to cancel last minute.Well I had already been craving a burger so I decided to head downtown instead and finally check out Prune.Walking into Prune I immediately felt comfortable in the small and homey space. It was quite empty with only a group of four, two couples and another solo diner.I wasn't sure if it would get crowded so I decided to just have a seat at the tiny bar. Again, I love the feel of the place. The sun was streaming in the big open windows and it was the perfect day to sit and people watch.I knew what I was here for so after a very quick look at the menu I went with my gut feeling and ordered the burger and a glass of wine.About 20 minutes later this ridiculously awesome looking plate of food found it's way to my seat.This is Prune's Grilled Hamburger on an English Muffin with Cheddar Cheese.Words cannot explain how freakin good this burger was.At first I tried to pick the whole thing up at once and I was covered in drippy buttery and greasy goodness.Seriously, there was just juice flowing out of the side.Then I cut it in half and found the burger much more manageable.This burger is 80% beef and 20% lamb which definitely gave it a richer and juicer texture than a regular burger.The nooks of the English Muffin were a perfect way to keep the greasy goodness inside. Although I think they had already been slathered with quite a liberal amount of butter. This is not a burger to eat if you're watching your weight- that's for sure!!!This is truly a decadent and amazing burger that is worth every penny of it's $12.00 price tag. Honestly, they could charge a ton more if they wanted to.I am a ketchup fiend and I didn't even think about putting it on my burger once! There was so much flavor I didn't want to change anything at all.The fries were also pretty good. Thin and crisp with just the right amount of salt.Man oh Man, everything was good but this burger was fantastic.So good, it may even be my new favorite high end burger! It is in close competition with P.J. Clark's that's for sure.Another nice thing I loved about Prune was the service. Everyone was super sweet and it was just the kind of place you want to hole up in with a bottle of wine and some loved ones.Prune makes me feel all happy inside :) A truly fantastic lunch.Prune

Happy Thanksgiving!!!! So I'm in Florida this year for the holiday which is kind of strange. It doesn't really feel like Thanksgiving because of the palm trees and sun. So I decided my Thanksgiving post wouldn't be a regular turkey and potatoes post either.Instead I'm going to show you one of the best fish tacos I have ever had right here in St. Augustine.These are the baja fish tacos from Nalu's.Nalu's is actually just a small stand, kind of like a street meat cart in the city.You roll up, place your order and then sit at a little picnic table and wait for your food.About 10 minutes later you have a Styrofoam container filled to the brim with tacos, rice and beans and chips.The fish is only called the fish of the day and I think ours was a Mahi Mahi. It came with cabbage, cheese, and a baja sauce that was delicious!!! For around $7.00 I was stuffed to the gills and happy as a clam.The best part about Nalu's? It's open today until 3:00! So if your in Florida and your bird didn't quite turn out as you had planned, you still have time to run down and get yourself some good eats for the holiday!Happy Thanksgiving!!!!

I absolutely love all of the autumn beers that come out around October. This past year I was so busy traveling here and there I feel like I never got a chance to really have any special harvest ales.I saw Post Road Pumpkin in the store the other day and I grabbed what looked to be the last six pack.Post Road is actually made by Brooklyn Brewery. I can't believe I have never tried this one considering it's brewed so close to where we live.The beer poured with a nice orangy amber color and a small head.It had a faint smell of pumpkin and nutmeg on top but not overpowering like some pumpkin beers.The taste wasn't overpowering either. The pumpkin flavor was very prevalent but subtle and there were notes of caramel that rounded out the smooth flavor of the beer.This is one of the best pumpkin beers I have ever had. I could easily have a couple in a row without feeling too full or sick from the flavor. Very drinkable.

Okay, I have to start this post just by showing these pictures. OMG how good does this food look!! These are the Brussels sprouts con vin cotto and the Octopus, celery and lovage. I honestly had to look up what lovage was(thank goodness for wikipedia) and it's basically a plant that resembles celery.It doesn't really matter because in the end the taste of these two dishes were ridiculously good and I am honestly salivating a little just staring at them right now.But I'm getting ahead of myself.Mr. T and I headed out on Saturday ready to do some shopping and hit up Bottlerocket's Thanksgiving wine and food tasting.We got to Bottlerocket about 2:30 and the line was already huge!!Mr. T is not one to wait in line for anything, so after some discussion we decided to leave the line, do some shopping and go enjoy a nice lunch at Otto instead.For those of you that don't know, Otto is one of Mario Batali's restaurants that is known mostly for it's pizzas and wine. We had been here a couple times at dinner and it was always hectic and rushed. I never really had a good time.But after enjoying such a fantastic meal at Babbo last year I said I needed to give Otto another try when it wasn't so crowded. So this seemed like the perfect opportunity.As we walked to Otto the beautiful sunny day we were having gave way to dark storm clouds and as we we entered the restaurant we realized we would probably have to wait out a storm for a while.So rather than just ordering a glass of wine or two we decided to go for a whole bottle!What else can you do on a rainy Saturday afternoon?After trying out a couple different wines we ended up with a very nice bottle of red from the wonderful bartender.After selecting our wine we decided to start out with some appetizers. Our first order was some prosciutto.I have to say, this is some of the best prosciutto I have ever had in NYC. It was perfectly sliced and had a soft, creamy texture that was simply delicious.We also ordered the Sformato di Parmigiano salad.This was basically a cheesy egg custard of sorts with a radicchio salad covered in balsamic vinegar.This was also excellent. The sformato had an interesting texture and taste that went perfectly with the strong balsamic and salad.We gobbled both of these up in a matter of minutes.Our first dishes were all so good we decided to order some more and went for our wonderful sprouts and octopus you saw above, as well as an order of the Rigatoni con Sausage & Swiss Chard.The pasta was of course cooked perfectly and the swiss chard and sausage were mixed with a little garlic butter sauce that made this dish outstanding,The nice thing about the dish was that it wasn't too heavy. Sometimes after a bowl of pasta I feel like just going to take a nap. After this one I felt surprisingly light and ready to eat some more even.Which is good because if I had been too full I may have missed out on one of the most fantastic desserts ever!!This is called the Black & White.The bottom is milk chocolate chip gelato, covered with a creme fraiche gelato with hazelnut brittle pieces mixed inside, chocolate sauce and topped off with a caramel crema.Separately, these ingredients wouldn't work, the bitter caramel, sour creme fraiche and sweet chocolate all have their cons but together they combined to make one of the greatest tasting desserts ever.Words cannot describe how wonderfully delicious this was. I could have eaten about ten. Sundaes have always been my favorite dessert treat and this is definitely one of the best.We finished our meal off with a couple of macchiatos and happy filled bellies.One of the best parts of the meal was the price. For all of this food and a fantastic bottle of wine the total was a just under $100. That is quite a good deal in my book.The best way to enjoy Otto is definitely like this. Go at an off hour, sit at the bar and just while away a lazy afternoon with the one you love. What a perfect way to spend a Saturday.Otto Pizzeria

\"The best way to enjoy Otto is definitely like this. Go at an off hour, sit at the bar and just while away a lazy afternoon with the one you love.\" -> much agreed! My favourite time to visit Otto are weekday afternoons, and lazy weekends when it's calmer and less touristy. Give the pumpkin copetta try in your next time visit - it's my favourite gelato copetta on the menu as of this week, lol :)

It's starting to get chilly once again on Tuesday so we decided to go out and get a big bowl of some RAMEN!!!Ippudo is a new place that opened this summer near St. Marks place. It's always very crowded whenever I walk by so I was a little nervous we would have a long wait.We decided to go early and at about 5:30 we walked inside and got a seat right away.Ippudo has a nice airy but sleek interior. It was a lot more spacious from the inside than I had imagined.We looked at the menu and realized we both wanted to order the same exact things we had at Momofuku the week before!We like what we like!Because of that, we ended up comparing each thing with Momofuku. It's kind of impossible not to when something is so fresh in your mind.Anyway, we decided to start with some steamed pork buns.The two buns came out looking a little bigger than Momofuku's but quite similar in style.The pork inside was thinly sliced and came topped with lettuce and mayonnaise.I thought the mayonnaise took away from the taste of the pork a little and the bun to pork ratio was a little off. This bun was a little too big for the amount of pork inside.This one goes to Momofuku BUT I do think these come in a close second. I think Momofuku has the best pork buns ever but I could also chow down on Ippudos all day long if I had to. The flavor of the pork was nice and it was a little less fatty than Momofuku's.Next up were the chicken wings.The wings were a decent size and had a great snappy exterior. They were covered in a black pepper sauce that really had some bite to it. Man that stuff can sneak up on you!After my second one I was chugging water like a mad man!The wings were very good but I am still in love with Momofuku's. While I enjoy a black pepper sauce I like my wings to have more of a tangy flavor to them.Bonus points though to Ippudo for the little side of pickled veggies that were fantastic!Okay, now for the main event...The reason for coming to Ippudo in the first place. The Ramen!Okay, although this picture isn't the prettiest one in the world, you have to believe me that this ramen was amazing!!This is the Pork Ramen Classic - Shiomaru Moto Sji. Which is basically ramen noodles, pork, berkshire pork chashu, cabbage and scallions all in a big bowl of soup.I don't know how to describe how good this was. The broth was thicker than Momofuku's and somehow the pork flavor seemed to have been completely infused throughout the soup making each bite just heavenly.The noodles and pork slices were both thinner than Momofuku's but the flavor was still spot on.There's something about a digging into a big steaming bowl of ramen on a cold night. It was almost like getting a hug from my Mom- warm and comforting.I thought Momofuku's ramen was good but this one was fantastic!So overall our meal was very good and I forsee many cold winter nights spent slurping up some soup in this dining room.The only small problem I had with Ippudo was the service. Although it was attentive, I felt very rushed the entire time. When we were walking out I saw that there was a line of about 15 people waiting so I guess they really want you to get in and get out fast.So if you want to go out for a leisurely meal, this isn't the place for you. But for some delicious ramen that will leave you feeling like all is right and good with the world, step right up!Ippudo

My Iphone had been giving me tons of trouble ever since I bought it. I took it to the Meatpacking Apple store and the \"Genius\" at the \"Genius Bar\" didn't help me at all.It wasn't that he didn't help me, he just didn't listen to me! He gave me the same talk he would have given anyone regardless of their problem. I came home, did what he said to do and nothing changed.I decided to try my luck at the 5th Avenue store and was met with the most wonderful man ever! Within 10 minutes I was out the door with the problem solved and feeling like I mattered.Now was that so hard?I decided to walk over to the Time Warner Center and pick up some tasty treats to celebrate my success!Mr. T has been working hard all week again so I got us a couple things and brought them home.I went directly to Bouchon Bakery which is Thomas Keller's bakery on the 3rd floor.The place had a line about ten people long with the usual tourists.I felt kind of bad because they all looked so baffled by the choices! I mean, I come here all the time and still have trouble deciding. I can't imagine being here for the first time and trying to decide on just one thing!!So of course I chose two.First was the Nutter Butter Cookie.Remember these cookies from when you were little? This has the same kind of taste except about 4 times the size and much better!The outer cookie was excellent with just enough crunch around the edges and a soft chewy center.The filling was okay but there was a little bit too much of it.A little filling goes a long way and this was just a tad too sweet to have so much.Mr. T decided to just squeeze some out so it had a tastier cookie to filling ratio.Then he ate it right up.The other treat in our box was my favorite. The seasonal Pumpkin Macaron.Here they are side by side.I have always loved Bouchon Macarons but this one may be the top one of all time.The outside was a light pillow filled with a dough that was so moist it was almost like biting into pudding.There was just the right amount of inner sweet buttercream with just a hint of nutmeg.This picture didn't come out so well but you can see the contrast of the insides.This had such a smooth pumpkin flavor it was simply fantastic.Both of these exquisite treats were also only $2.75 each, which is pretty good for any bakery!Thomas Keller's bakery is always coming out with new stuff so it's just fun to go and check out what he's got. It's hard to resist once you do though so be forewarned!Bouchon Bakery

What are your thoughts on the jelly doughnuts from Bouchon? I think they're just available on Saturdays.

This Halloween my was my friend's 30th birthday so we traveled to garrison NY to spend it with her and the best people in the universe my friends!!!!I stopped at the Jas mart on my way to pick up some funky candy and of the bunch I picked this was the winner.It's a mini cheeseburger candy!!This little concotion was yummy!! The outside bun was sesame seed cracker with an inner burger of chocolate covered in what tasted to be an almost peanut butter cheese top.It was surprisingly good (and look at Mr T's fingers....he could be a hand model no?)They came about 25 mini guys per box and had all the crunchy, salty sweet goodness I enjoy in a Take 5 candy bar but in better wrapping.Not only that it looked like my favorite food in a candy treat!!!Happy Late Halloween!!! And Yay Obama!!!!!

I had a day off of work on Monday and spent it, unfortunately, doing work stuff :(I had a LOT of things to buy to get ready for a conference I'm going to present at this week.I found myself in Times Square, which is not exactly a great place for food.Once I got what I needed from the Hershey store and a few other places I started to look around for some lunch options.I was actually planning to grab a cab down to Prune to FINALLY try out their burger but then I stumbled across Brooklyn Diner.It looked pretty empty and I was starving, so I decided this would be a good lunch place.I went inside and grabbed a seat at the bar.The whole place was bright and shiny and quite a bit bigger than expected.I looked at the menu and was a little shocked at the prices. Even for Times Square they were pretty high!Oh well. I ordered a beer and the Brooklyn Diner specialty cheeseburger.The beers on tap were pretty impressive.They had everything from an Ommegang Abbey Ale to an Abita Light.I ordered a nice Oktoberfest and my burger came out in about 5 minutes.Wow this thing was massive!!!It was a big juicy burger topped with cheddar cheese, thin crispy onions and bacon.The bacon was amazing. It was perfectly crisped and really helped amp up the flavor of the burger.I wasn't a huge fan of the onions. I ended up taking most of them off and next time I would probably just ask for it without.The burger itself was very tasty. I usually enjoy a thinner patty but this was pretty good.The fries were also excellent with just enough salt and a perfect inner potato to crispy outside.It came with a pickle that was the size of my head!Okay maybe not my head but pretty huge.Apparently this place is big on it's desserts.The whole time I was sitting at the bar I was staring at the pies and cakes in the back. Next time I definitely need to check one of those out.Today was not the day however, as I barely finished half of my meal. There was just too much food.Overall I still think the Bacon Cheeseburger at P.J. Clark's is the best.So the lunch was pretty good and the beer hit the spot..but you know what really will make me go back? The staff.I have never been in a restaurant where everyone was so friendly.Not with just me but with each other.The waitresses were all joking with the manager. The bartenders were talking with the busboys. The hostess even helped bring some of the dishes out to customers!It was just a really nice atmosphere. I found everyone happy and genuine.This is hard to come by when you work in the touristy section that is Times square.So in the end I paid more for a burger than I ever have ($16.75!!!)But I came home with a huge amount of leftovers and a good feeling in my heart.That's not always easy to come by and it made for a good day.

I talked about Amai bakery WAY back when they first opened on 3rd avenue. I've been there multiple times since and have come to love the little tea and cookie shop.The other day I swung by and decided to forgo my usual green tea cupcake and instead got a caramel chocolate and a pumpkin.They all have the same style, a small cupcake with a heavy, somewhat lopsided swirl on top.The chocolate cake was light and fluffy with a nice coca flavor. The cake could have been a little bit moister but it was still quite fabulous. The one thing I love about Amai cupcakes are that they aren't very sweet. You know how you can almost feel the sugar eating away at your teeth from some of the other bakeries in the city (And I DO love Magnolia, I just have to be in the mood for a super sugary treat when I go)There is none of that here. The frosting was light with just a subtle taste of caramel.It actually reminded me of the flavor of a Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks but not as sweet.The pumpkin was fantastic as well.It had the same fluffy cake and a slightly sweet vanilla frosting. The cake had a wonderful taste of pumpkin and spices which combined with the frosting, just really made it stand a step above the Chocolate Caramel.One of the best parts about this place is that they give you little plastic containers for each cupcake so they don't get mangled if you take them to go.Check out their wares if you're nearby. They are always experimenting with different flavors and come up with some pretty neat and tasty stuff.Amai Tea House

It was a FREEEZING day Wednesday and I was not prepared to handle the weather.My thin black work pants were no match for the sharp wind and I dashed home after work to get some warmth.I walked inside my apartment and instead of feeling the rush of heat I felt nothing. I went back out into the hallway and saw a sign up that said \"Sorry for the inconvenience the boiler is broken\".Inconvenience!! It's fricken freezing!!So I called Mr. T and told him the situation.We decided to do what any normal American would and use it as an excuse to go out for some beers and dinner!We met up at McSorleys and over a couple of darks and lights we decided to go to Momofuku Noodle bar for some warm comfort food.We got to Momofuku right before 8:00 and only had to wait about 2 minutes for a seat.Both of us knew exactly what we wanted so we placed our order and got our appetizer within minutes.Of course we had to start with the pork buns.Okay...SO much has been written about these things it's a little ridiculous but oh my goodness ..they are amazing.Just big juicy slabs of pork belly sandwiched inside some steamed buns with Hosin sauce and pickled cucumbers.It is fatty fatty goodness!!!Sometimes I swing by late afternoon when they're not busy and pick some up to go.They are a little pricey at $9 for 2 buns but they are addictively delicious.For our mains Mr. T got a big bowl of ramen to warm his belly. The Momofuku Ramen.Look at this beautiful bowl!I took a couple bites and it was delicious!!!I was really surprised how tasty the broth itself was until I found out that David Chang makes it with roasted pork bones, mushrooms and bacon.I think that would make anything taste wonderful.Besides the wonderful noodles inside there was also some more pieces of pork , some bamboo shoots and a poached egg.This dish will warm you up and make you as happy as a clam on a cold day!!For my dish I got the Smoked Chicken Wings.When they first came out I was a little bit worried. They looked small and soggy.Thank goodness looks can be deceiving! I don't know how they got these wings so crispy without having a char all over the wing!The chicken had a wonderful aroma and when I bit in, the crispy exterior gave away to the taste of chili, garlic and scallions.These wings were wonderful!!! I literally fell in love. I wanted to seduce these wings, take them down to the courthouse and marry them. I just love wings.So once again Momofuku really hit the spot.Mr T and I are seriously thinking of moving downtown a little bit to be closer to all of these great places.Could you imagine if I could have Momofuku as my neighborhood joint!! It's only about 12 blocks away right now but what if it was only 2!!!Our lease is up next month...we will see...McSorleysMomofuku

I don't know about you but I kind of change my wine though the seasons.The last couple months we were drinking a lot of Pinot Gris and Sauvignon Blanc.Obviously it was summer so white was the choice.But now summer has ended and it's time to get back into the reds and one of my favorite, cheap and wonderful wines to drink right now is the Las Hormigas Altos Malbec.It pours a dark reddish purple color and has an excellent dry, black cheery taste with a smooth finish.There have been a lot of great Malbec's coming out of Argentina lately and this is one of my favorites.It's a full body wine but so well structured that it's quite easy to drink.The best part is the price.In NYC it usually averages around $10.00 a bottle. So you can enjoy a nice wine without breaking the bank.It's a fantastic way to settle in and get cozy with some scary Halloween movies on a weekday night. So go out, grab a bottle, Return of the Living Dead Part II, your favorite main squeeze and call it a successful October night at home. You will not be disappointed!!

Sweets at Chocolate Bar in Buffalo

Friday night I went out to dinner with my family at Papaya, an asian fusion place in Buffalo. The food was pretty good and the atmosphere was fun. But the best part, in my opinion, is that it's next door to a dessert place called the Chocolate Bar!I had always heard good reviews about this place so I was psyched.Walking inside I immediately liked the decor.It was dark, sleek and a little sexy I guess. A good place for a date...Or with your entire immediate family..whichever you prefer.They have a surprisingly large selection of wine and spirits, for a dessert place, so I ordered up a bottle of Pinot Noir and we put in our dessert order.Now since I'm on vacation and have SO much trouble choosing between desserts, I did the only thing one can do in these situations.I ordered two.The first one was the special of the month the pumpkin gelato.This dessert was certainly quite stunning to look at and really got me in the Halloween spirit.Unfortunately it wasn't that great.I think they made the pumpkin gelato desserts earlier in the day and then threw them in the freezer.As a result, I couldn't even cut into my gelato when it first arrived.It was covered in ice crystals.When it finally thawed there was some decent gelato but that took about 15 minutes and the freezer burn gave it a slightly strange taste.The winner of the night was the dessert my brother ordered. The Bananas Foster Crepe.Wow!!! The crepe was moist and doughy with sweet brown sugar bananas rolled up and served with a side of cinnamon ice cream.This scored on all levels. The bananas had a nice char without becoming squishy and the sauce has a salty, sweet flavor that was simply excellent.We had a ton of desserts and I tried them all. The cakes and crepes were what really shined for me.The ice cream sundaes weren't as cold as the gelato, but they were still colder than I would have liked and the hot fudge sauce was a little too thick.Maybe they had an issue with their freezer.Everything else was so good I am definitely going to give them another chance next time I go back.The best part of the whole evening though?Getting to spend some quality time with my family.We are about to have another member enter soon...My brother and his wife are about to have a baby!! So it was an exciting dinner but I was also feeling a little sentimental and sappy the whole weekend. (All the wine didn't exactly help :)All I know is this kid better have a pretty big sweet tooth.And love football..because it case you didn't hear the Bills beat the Chargers and are now 5 and 1!!!!! It gets no better.A beautiful fall weekend in Buffalo with an amazing family and great games.Chocolate Bar

I've always been a person who NEEDS to have at least one piece of chocolate or sweet every day.I just don't feel right until I do.But lately I've been needing more. Not more chocolate but more dessert...Cupcakes, puddings, ice creams...my daily mini Toblerone and my scoop of Nutella just haven't been doing the job lately.So the other day after lunch, I was heading to the nearby bodega for my sugar fix.You know, a Rocher or some other single serving piece of chocolate they usually keep on the counter. Something that makes me feel less guilty than buying a whole candy bar!But once I got inside, one look at the sad display of sweets I knew I needed something more.So I decided to take a little walk and trekked all the way down to one of the best chocolatiers in the city..Jacques Torres.Walking into his store is what I imagine it smelled like when Charlie first walked into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.Except no Oompa Loompa's.I was overwhelmed by all of the goodies and treats everywhere.Carmel chocolate covered popcorn, rich fudgy brownies, wicked hot chocolate.The possibilities were endless.But then I saw exactly what my body needed..a big, warm, fresh out of the oven Chocolate chip cookie!!Yes that would do just fine:)This picture doesn't do justice for the cookies.First of all it's enormous. At least twice the size a cookie should be.Second, it was baked to perfection!The outside edges were brown and crisp while the center was warm and gooey goodness. Somehow the cookie had an almost perfect balance of dough to chocolate ratio in every single bite!That Jacques Torres doesn't mess around :)So I feel a little bit guiltier than I would have if I had just stuck to my bodega candy.BUT my tummy is about ten times happier!!!!

I'm going back to Buffalo this weekend to watch the Bills take on the Chargers in what I imagine to be a very, very tough game. I'm beyond psyched to see the game up close and personal for the first time this season.Last time I was home I talked a little about the food I had enjoyed although I never got around to talking about Tempo in downtown Buffalo, where I had a delicious Arugula and Prosciutto salad that was surprisingly accompanied by Feta cheese. It came with a light lemon mint vinaigrette. The acid from this dressing really helped balance the strong taste of the Feta and it was delicious.My main course that night was also phenomanal the whole Branzino.Yum!!! This came glazed in a Pesto sauce with a salad of sweet peppers and potatoes on the side.It was fabulous! I have had a lot of whole fish here in NYC and I would put this one up against the best here in the city.It was delicate, moist and simply bursting with flavor.Tempo was a beautiful place as well.It was located in a beautiful old building with shiny wooden floors and huge ceilings.We got the best seat of the house as well, the large table in front of the windows which really made it special.Well anyway...I am not sure what food adventures await me this time.It's more about hanging with family, friends and watching the Bills. And that's the most exciting part :)See You Soon!!

I was walking home from work today and had my mind on getting some sweets. My plan was to walk through Chinatown, up the LES a little bit and then stop at the Chikalicious Pudding store on my last leg and pick up some cupcakes since I've never tried them out.Well as I was walking up Allen street I literally stumbled across this dessert shop. How Sweet It Is.Since that was exactly what I had in mind, I went inside and loved what I saw.A little counter housed a bunch of pastries, muffins, brownies and most of all different kinds of cupcakes!!The woman behind the counter was extremely nice and she explained each off the different flavors of cupcakes, to me: Red Velvet, Peanut Butter & Jelly, Nutella, German Chocolate...I could go on but I think you get the picture.The last one she said got me though. Their special of the week. The Chocolate Guiness Stout cupcake with pumpkin icing and pumpkin cream cheese frosting in the middle.Holy Halloween!!!I somehow made it all the way without digging in just so I could get some pic.How cute and festive is this?Now from the outside it looks like just a normal old chocolate cupcake.But as soon as I started to unwrap the paper I knew this was going to be different.As I peeled away the edge I was hit full force with the smell of nutmeg and cinnamon.It was like I had autumn wrapped up right in front of me.An then I saw the inside.Wow! This had a lot going on.Now I had been a little worried because these ones had been in the refrigerator and sometimes that kills the cake.Here the cake somehow stayed incredibly moist. It tasted wet almost.Now if the smell was any indication of the flavor capacity of this baby, I was blown out of the park.There was so much going on in this cake..the chocolaty thick Guiness cake, the rich creamy pumpkin cream cheese filling, the pungent and powerful pumpkin in the icing.It was almost a little too much. I could only get through half of the cupcake and I felt little overloaded.I think that the cake was so rich that having both a frosting inner and icing outer was a little much.However, separately everything was fantastic!Not all of their cupcakes had filling in the middle and next time I think I would try one of them. But the shop is super cute, the staff are super friendly and hey..they had some free brownie samples on the counter..what more do you want in your dessert shop.

The weekend was the NYC Food and Wine Festival and I have to say it was pretty awesome.We had tickets to the second session of the Grand Tasting Saturday from 3:00-6:00. We showed up at the welcome center first and were greeted with free chocolates, a generous gift bag filled with all sorts of goodies and a free Waterford Wine glass. I was pretty jazzed already and we hadn't even gotten into the Tasting yet!The tasting was held on Pier 54 and it couldn't have been a more perfect day for the event. The sun was shining and everyone just seemed to be in a great mood.Mr T and I got a chance to try everything! I mean everything! There wasn't a station we missed.The best dish of the night goes solidly to Alex Urena from Pamplona.This was braised Washugya Brisket with Manchego rice and Black Olive sauce.OMG this was so good! The meat was so tender it just fell apart as you cut inside.The sauce was excellent as well as the rice but the meat really stole the show on it's own.Towards the end we came back for another bite and he had run out of the sauce and rice. We tried the meat on it's own and it was still beyond delicious.Pamplona is now on the top of my list to try out.The second best dish of the night was the pizza from Bayard's events catering.This is no ordinary pizza. It's made with Ribola cheese and topped with white truffle oil.Wow! Both Mr T and I were kind of blown away. We weren't expecting much from this pizza but it was insanely delicious. The crust was extra crispy and the truffle oil and cheese just made it decadent. The next dish wasn't the best of the night but I have to include it because it was made by Dave \"I'm not your bitch, bitch\" Martin from Top Chef.The duck on the top was very good but the bottom cracker was a little overwhelming, taking away from the flavor of the duck.However, Dave was super friendly and just seemed to be having a good time so I have to love it..and him!Other food highlights were the amazing toffee milk chocolates from XOXO chocolates out of Boulder and the mushroom dumplings from Waikaya.But what was even more prevalent than the food was the drinks!!!They had so much alcohol it was unbelievable. Tons of wine vendors everywhere doing tastings of everything,including my favorite La Crema. There was also beer like Blue Moon, Corona and Sam Adams. And then there was the liquor!! OMG! There were shots of Jim Beam, Mini mojitos, tons of different flavored vodkas, Peanut Liquors, tequila...on and on.People were just doing shots left and right!Mr. T and I stuck to wine and beer only and after an hour after being there we were already feeling no pain.It was an awesome event.We did the Meatpacking Uncorked on Friday night which was pretty cool as well. All of the Meatpacking boutiques opened their doors for a shopping and wine tasting event throughout the area.They were very generous there as well! Diane Von Furstenberg was giving out mini bottles of champagne to everyone!So all in all it was an awesome weekend.It was so cool just to see so many chefs as well.Over the course of the weekend I saw, of course Dave Martin, Cesar Casella, Anita Lo, Anne Burell, Paula Dean and the best one ever....Morimoto himself!!!I cannot wait till next year and am even thinking of making the trip to the South Beach one in February. We'll see what happens!

Okay..where I left you last was our Room Service meal, which really improved our health and well being :)I spent the rest of the day at the pool while Mr. T did a little bit of work from the room. We wanted to go out for a nice dinner that night but I was having trouble choosing. I mean every good place in Vegas has a place in NYC!!Robuchon, Craft, Nobu...I had no idea what to do.Which is why we ended up at Yellowtail inside our hotel. The omakase on their menu looked fantastic so we decided to try it out.Unfortunately, as I told you in my first trip post, the food was not very good.For an expensive place, I have to say I've had better sushi at Whole Foods!All of the plates had strange combinations which just didn't work and the quality of the food was just a little below average. It seemed like a place that was really trying to find itself but lacked the money to get the high quality produce it needed. Then some things were just downright weird. When the dessert came out it was a chocolate fig custard in a ramekin with a little wrapped up present box next to the dish.Excited I immediately reached for the box to see what was inside.Inside was...nothing!! Apparently it was just part of the plate decoration?? But it was so strange. Why not put something inside? A piece of chocolate? Anything? Who wants an empty wrapped up box with their custard?Anyway as I said before, the only thing that saved this dinner was our lovely table with a view of the fountains.So here's a picture of us enjoying some champagne and watching as the fountains started to play some Frank Sinatra. Ahhh...That night we went out and met Catfish again, this time in downtown Las Vegas.It was actually Biker week so the streets were filled with people just partying and enjoying life. It was very fun.We woke up the next morning, played a little AM Blackjack (well I did) and packed up our stuff to drive to San Diego.I took one last walk through the botanical garden in the hotel.And I stopped off once more at John Phillipe to pick up a little treat.Mr. T requested something white chocolate and spooky. So this ghost was perfect.Boo!! Scary and tasty!We grabbed our rental from the hotel and headed towards the open road, but we had one more important stop on our way.A place I have always heard about but never experienced before.Can you see the sign? Know what it is?In-N-Out Burger!!!!!I was so excited. All of my West coast friends rave about this fast food joint.We ordered some burgers and I grabbed a table out front while Mr. T waited for our food.This place was packed! When I walked outside they were calling number 18 and we were 37.That's always a good sign but I was starving! I practically tackled Mr. T for the food when he finally walked out the door.There are only 3 choices here for food, the double burger, single and cheeseburger. I went for the classic cheese while Mr. T got the Double.Here's a look at our goods.The verdict?As far as fast food goes this is very very good. The burger was a lean patty but very moist. It came on a grilled bun with the cheese melted on top and bottom and some kind of thousand island like spread on the bottom.The bun really helped to make this burger. It had a nice squishy top and crispy middle. It kept the lettuce and tomatoes in check while still allowing the patty to shine through.The fries were the only disappointment. They were crispy but lacking in flavor. Even salt didn't really help them. Oh well the burgers are good.I would definitely get In-N-Out burger a LOT if I lived here.We tried out 2 other fast food joints on this trip. Carl's Jr and Jack in the Box.The Jack in the Box burger and decor Both freaked me out a little. The one we went to was kind of dirty so I think that was a big part of it but the clown/scarecrow pictures really bothered me.Carl's Jr was a pretty good burger. It was late at night so I'm sure it wasn't as fresh as our In-N-Out burgers. It was still very good though so I would love to come back and try a fresh one.Okay.. then we were on to San Diego where we had a great time with Mr. T friends.The first night we went to Karl Strauss and enjoyed some really good Amber beer they brew right there at the restaurant.It was so good we brought a growler home.And also some really good food like my Shrimp and Goat cheese corn salad.The rest of our San Diego trip was spent chilling out, listening to his friends band play a great show and watching some football and eating some Wings at D Street Bar.Which by the way had some seriously big meaty wings.It was a great trip and I'm sure we'll make it back to the West Coast soon.I'm sad it's over but we got the NYC Food & Wine Festival this weekend! That should be fantastic.So until then!In-N-OutKarl Strauss

Okay I already gave a quick rundown of some Vegas stuff so I'm going to skip over Day One since we really didn't do much and basically just felt crazy from the whole trip getting there. We basically checked in, did some gambling in the hotel and just grabbed some food there. The next morning we woke up ready for a day of relaxation and fun.We started out by heading to the hotel pool where we meet up with my friend from college, Catfish. (Not his real name and the story is way too long to tell but we'll be calling him Catfish)The hotel pool was absolutely stunning. There were actually 5 pools situated in the large courtyard. One large and four smaller pools that had beautiful fountains in the middle.We grabbed some chairs and hung out by the pool for a few hours.I was on vacation so I felt the need to have a strawberry daiquiri that probably filled my calorie quota for the day but hey...its vacation.The daiquiri was awesome! One of the best I have ever had- super fruity. Although everything jut taste better on vacation :)It was a scorching hot day and after about 2 hours, we were done with the sun and needing some good food.We decided to walk across the street to Cesar's and get some seafood at Joe's Seafood Prime Steak and Stone Crab.Okay..the thing about Vegas is that everything is HUGE! It seriously took us almost an hour of walking around Cesar's to finally find Joe's. We were starving when we showed up and decided to order a big lunch.Mr T and I split the Blackened Mahi Mahi sandwich, lyonnaise potatoes and 5 large stone Crab Claws.Look at these huge claws! There was so much meat inside we were barely able to finish it all. The claws came with Joe's famous mustard sauce for dipping. I enjoyed the mustard sauce but honestly just a little butter is really all you need with the sweet meat of the crabs.The lyonnaise potatoes were perfectly crisped and the Mahi Mahi sandwich was full of flavor without being too spicy. It was an excellent lunch and we basically rolled out of the restaurant we were so full.We walked around a little bit more and then decided to head back to the Bellagio to do some gambling and relax.We ended up meeting Catfish at our hotel and decided we had done enough of the Strip for one day and wanted some more action.It's kind of rare to know someone who lives in Vegas and can take you to some non-touristy stuff.So off the strip we went and down to a couple of bars.Now I'm not going to talk to much about the night because..well I'm not sure how much of it I can actually explain. It was a little crazy!At the Bellagio we had been paying about $12 a drink for a beer or cocktail(when we weren't gambling)You're standard overpriced hotel stuff.The first bar we went to we ordered 3 beers and 2 shots of whisky (no whisky for me but the men felt like going a little nuts). Total bill for that round? $9.00.You better believe we took full advantage of this! After probably too many rounds we decided to head to another bar, which may be one of the shadiest bars I have ever been to in my life.I can't even get into describing the place but it was definitely the underbelly of Las Vegas. It was great! We definitely saw lots of things they don't tell you about in Tripadvisor!Well suffice it to say I woke up Friday morning and felt like a truck was slamming into my head repeatedly.$9.00 rounds hurts the next day.We had such a big lunch at Joe's we never ate any dinner, which in retrospect, was a very bad idea when you're drinking like a fish.Neither Mr. T and I could make it out of bed. So we did the only thing we could do when staying in a five star hotel.Order room service!Room service to me is the absolutely epitome of decadence. Growing up, my family traveled a lot and never once did we indulge in this treat.So even though my skull felt like it was about to split in half I was super excited for our meal.Here's the gorgeous layout.Fresh Flowers on the table, butter engraved with the Bellagio logo, juice freshly squeezed. I was in heaven!I ordered the two egg breakfast with bacon and home fries.The bacon and eggs were the much needed greasy food my body required to recover from a night of drinking cheap beer and liquor.Mr. T ordered the sirloin burger.The burger was okay but had a little bit too much spice. It tasted like they put some Worcester sauce into the meat and maybe a little too much onion powder.However, it did the job.The best part about the whole meal? Mini condiments!I have no idea why mini things make me laugh so much. I think it's a girl thing.Give me something and make it miniature and I'll love it no matter what.After the meal I felt a TON better and was able to actually have a productive day.More on that later.Joes Prime Seafood

Going out to lunch by myself is something I really enjoy doing. I find it sort of...therapeutic I guess.Unfortunately I usually work right through my lunch break so it's a rare occasion when I can actually go out and enjoy a leisurely lunch.Well today I did. I was feeling a little bit overwhelmed I guess and felt like I needed a little time alone. So I took a half day of work and walked into SOHO to find a place in the sun to enjoy lunch.I was craving a fish sandwich of some sort and went right to Spring Street Natural where I had enjoyed one before.Unfortunately they only had 2 tables set up outside and they were already filled.I decided to head west and see if I could find any other outdoor spots.Well I ended up walking all the way across to 6th avenue to an old standby Aquagrill.I've been to Aquagrill a bunch of times for dinner or just some oysters and drinks, but this was my first time at lunch.I was surprised to see the inside dining room virtually empty! Quite a change from the packed, bustling atmosphere that usually greets me at night.The outside porch had a few more people than inside but I was able to get a table right away. They had a special Cod sandwich on the menu today that sounded right up my alley so I placed my order and they brought over the bread.They gave me three different types of bread today, all of which were excellent.The first, and my favorite of the bunch, was the onion focaccia.The onions had been slightly caramelized giving the top of the bread a sweet moist tang complementing a crisp salty bottom. Yum!! Sweet n salty all the way baby!The middle was a long cigar shaped piece of cornbread. As I took a bite I noticed a little kick to it. Upon closer inspection I saw some hues of green which makes me think it was baked with a little jalapeno as well.The last was your classic ciabatta that was perfect for dipping in the wonderful olive oil they brought.As usually happens with lunch, my entree arrived about 3 minutes after I ordered it. I never understand how they are able to make everything so quick at lunchtime!I ordered the Crispy Casco Bay Cod Sandwich.This was big piece of fish that had been fried and then topped with sun dried tomatoes, red and yellow peppers and baby arugula. Here's a side view.Both pieces of bread were grilled and the bottom piece had been slathered in a delicious basil mayonnaise. This really made the sandwich for me. The peppers and mayonnaise gave it so much flavor. I would have preferred to have my fish grilled rather than fried but that was all they were offering today.They did substitute the french fries for micro greens though which was nice. It's good to try and be somewhat healthy right?Overall it was an excellent meal.The waitress I had was very nice although I feel as a solo diner I was treated a little bit differently.For example, I was never told the specials like all of the other guests. My menu was simply placed in front of me and I was told the specials were on the side.Other patrons around me were given vivid descriptions of each one upon sitting and lots of attention. And when the check came back for me to sign, my server barely turned towards me to drop it off. The table next to me was ready to order so she slipped the check back to me almost behind her back, so she could take their order.I thought it would be nice for some eye contact and a thanks but oh well..whatever.The food was good, I had a lovely spot to people watch. Just what the doctor ordered! And for $13, not too pricey either. Quite a nice way to spend an afternoon indeed.I have tons of pictures from my Buffalo trip I have to share s well. I hope I can get around to it before I leave for some fun and sun in Vegas!!Aquagrill

We were aching for a good burger the other night but one look at the Shake Shack cam told us the line would be at least an hour. Neither of us felt like cooking either so...we headed to the computer and checked out seamlessweb.Mr. T and I order in a LOT! Too much honestly. We have started to become sick of our options because we always choose the same stuff.Well as I was scrolling through the choices I ran across Jackson Hole.The picture on the website looked like a pretty good burger and I was starving!So we placed our order.About a half hour later this mammoth mound of meat arrived at my door.Whoa!! This burger really was huge! I was impressed by the juicy looking exterior and wonderful smell as I opened the bag.Unfortunately the burger didn't end up tasting as good as it looked and smelled.The first problem was the temperture.Had ordered medium rare and this baby was cooked all the way though.Because of this, the inside was a little dry and not nearly as moist and flavorful as I would have liked. It was actually a little weird. The outside was almost dripping with juice and grease but the inside seemed to be void of any moisture at all.Th meat was also a little bit gritty. I think I have been so used to burgers like the Shake's and PJ Clark's where they use good meat and get a nice salty char on the outside.This lacked both the quality meat and char so I was left a little disappointed. I'm not sure if they cooked it kind of weird or what.I was kind of surprised of all the great reviews it got when I looked it up. I guess if I was having a couple of beers at Jackson Hole I may have enjoyed it a little more. The size certainly is impressive at least. But I've never been a fan of the \"bigger is better\" mantra. Give me a good quality slider for goodness sake and I'll be a happy camper!Next time I'll probably just go wait in line for the Shake when I am craving a good burger.Jackson Hole

The chicken sandwiches at Jackson Hole (with same topping combos as the burgers) are the way to go. They have a huge moist chicken breast instead of the burger. (Gimme a copsegmore or a Soul one any day!)The burgers are cooked under a lid so they're partially 'steamed.' You won't get a char and a pink rare middle the way they cook them. But it is a lotta meat, and I like them occasionally, even though they are more generic tasting than the Shack or 5 Guys.

Mr. T was in Pennsylvania for a meeting last week and got a ride back to the city with a co-worker.He called me to say he was getting dropped off in Chinatown. Since I usually walk home from work that way, I decided to meet him for dinner.It turned out that Mrs. Wu (Mr. T's co-worker) was meeting her husband as well! So we all decided to have dinner together.Now the Wu's actually grew up in Chinatown, so they know a little something about the area!We decided to leave the dinner pick in their hands and they chose Penang.Penang is a Malaysian/Thai restaurant located on Elizabeth street.Upon entering I was greeted by the usual feeling I get at most restaurants in Chinatown- a kind of homey bustle.We sat down and got some beers and tea and looked at the menu which was HUGE!!There was many different kinds of food it was really quite overwhelming.Luckily the Wu's said they would order for the table...And order they did!We had tons of tasty food; crispy orange beef, chicken satay, tripe (okay Mr. T and I didn't eat the tripe but the Wu's seemed to enjoy it). So much food there was really to much to write about.So I'll just tell you about our two favorite things of the night.First up- Mr. T's favorite the Home Made Roti Canai.The Roti Canai is a kind of Malaysian flatbread that is made by kneading the dough, flattening it, allowing it to rise and then the whole process is repeated.What comes from all of that process it this big piece of dough.As I broke into the hot crusty exterior it flaked away to reveal a fluffy warm inside perfect for dipping into the tasty chicken curry sauce.I couldn't believe how light and airy this dough was. Almost like a pastry.The Wu's had gotten four orders of the Roti, which I thought was a little excessive, but by the end of the night they were all gone!Now while I really enjoyed the Roti, it wasn't my favorite dish of the night.Oh no...that spot is usually reserved for some sort of sweet, calorie laden dessert that it will take days to burn off my hips. And tonight was no different. I give you the Peanut Pancake.Oh...My...Goodness...this thing was so freakin good!They took the same kind of dough as the Roti and stuffed it full of ground up peanuts, butter and sugar. The they slathered some kind of sticky sauce, possibly honey, all over the top to seal the deal.Sweet...Stckey....Salty....Sensatioanl!!!This was just everything I love about dessert without the chocolate!I couldn't stop eating this thing! The rest of the night I felt like I had a huge rock in my stomach because it was so dense, but man oh man it was worth it.It turns out that Penang is a chain restaurant with 2 locations in New York and also some in New Jersey, Maryland and North Carolina.I guess they must be doing something right huh?All I know is that the Wu's can pick our meal for us anyday and we will be an extremely happy couple.Penang

I think I've said before how much I Love, love, love Gramercy Tavern. It is just a wonderful spot. The place is beautiful, the staff are friendly and the food is spectacular.Mr. T and I swung by the other night for dessert and I had one of the richest, most decadent pieces of chocolate cake ever.This is the Gramercy Tavern German Chocolate cake with Milk Chocolate Coconut ice cream.Oh my goodness. Just looking at this picture is enough to make me want to run over there right now and get some more.The cake itself was super moist and it came covered with a Carmel coconut glaze on top that was absolutely wonderful! I was a little worried at first that the milk chocolate ice cream would be too much with the rich chocolate cake, but it paired well. The ice cream wasn't too sweet and instead the coconut flavor really brought out the coconut in the cake.Once again Gramercy tavern hits all the right spots. I don't think I have yet find something there that I don't like. It's all fantastic.

So today is my birthday and I am now officially OLD.To make matters worse I have been sick since Tuesday, my friends that were supposed to come in from out of town are going to be about 4 hours late, since they are hours late we can't do the dinner I wanted because it will be packed by then and we have tickets to a beer crawl tomorrow and it's supposed to pour all day.Needless to say I am depressed. I really need to go out and get one of these.And after lots of these things will look better.After all, I have a wonderful boyfriend and family and that's all that matters in life right! Now I'm going to get a beer.A Happy beer :)

I was walking around Brooklyn Heights the other day looking for a new work lunch spot. I always stick to the area right around Montague Street but there's really nothing that good there.It was such a gorgeous day out so I decided to wander a little further than usual and wandered right out of Brooklyn Heights. Into what I believe is the Cobble Hill neighborhood (I am so bad about knowing where I am in Brooklyn. That is going to be my New Year's resolution- pay attention to street signs in boroughs other than Manhattan!)Well I didn't actually find a new lunch spot, I stumbled across a cookie and gelato shop called One Girl Cookies.What caught my eye first was the cute little sign hanging down out front that simply said \"Cookies\".It was so simple. No need for fancy pictures or neon signs. If you want some cookies- come here.The whole shop was actually cute. The inside was long and narrow with some boxes of cookies up front and a glass display case in the back that showcased the cookies.There was also a small wooden bar attached to the side of the counter for tasting as you pleased.I was greeted warmly by the woman behind the counter and after perusing the items I decided to go for two kinds of cookies.The classic chocolate chip and the Penelope cookies.The first one I tried was the chocolate chip.I was impressed by the texture of the chips first of all. They had retained their silky melty texture even though they had obviously been baked hours ago.The cookie had a faint hint of anise on the end which I don't really care for. I did enjoy the rich buttery flavor of the dough, but I thought the cookie was a little too thick for my tastes. The only thick chocolate cookie I have ever really enjoyed was at Levain Bakery. Somehow Levain's stay moist and gooey in the middle and crunchy on top. I have no idea how it happens there. It's like magic.I found this cookie was a little too dry in the middle which is why I would have preferred it to be thinner.Surprising I liked the Penelope cookie much more.The Penelope is a butter cookie that has apricot preserve middle and a layer of chopped nuts around the outside.The apricot preserve was so fresh I could have sworn it had been made minutes before. The nuts were a mixture of almond and walnuts which were ground down so they blended in with the buttery texture of the cookie.I really liked this cookie. My only complaint was that there wasn't more apricot and nuts! They were so good I wanted twice as much!But that's just me. I always want extra frosting when normal people think it's too much! I have a problem overloading with the sugar!!I would definitely like to go back and check out their other cookies. On the top of the display case they had some homemade whoopee pies!They were two pieces of the moistest looking pumpkin cake squashed around a thick middle of cream cheese frosting.Um can you say awesome!!!I had to use all of my will power to get out of the store without shoving one in my mouth right there.I mean I just found this place. I can't eat everything all at once!I will see you again Pumpkin Whoopie Pie just you wait.One Girl Cookies

Their cookies are amazing! If you go back you have to try the Cecilia (chocolate sandwich cookies with mocha filling) and Lucia (shortbread bar with chocolate and caramel). Got them last year for my birthday and I still dream about them.

I have always thought Mr. T and I are extremely lucky to live in the neighborhood we do. We are super close to multiple trains and buses, we are surrounded by Danny Meyer restaurants, which are all fantastic and we have the beautiful Madison Square Park right nearby to relax and enjoy the sun.One of the coolest things about Madison Square Park, besides the Shake Shack of course, is that once a year they turn the north end into a US Open party.They put up a HUGE screen and bring in some bleachers where anyone can go and watch the matches.Pretty cool huh!The best part though? They serve beer, wine and food!Mr. T and I stumbled across this the first year they set up shop and come back to chill now annually.This year we were pretty psyched to hear that Hill Country was one of the vendors there. So on Saturday afternoon we ambled over to check it out.We got there around 3:00 and were pleasantly surprised to see they added tables and chairs on the lawn!We bought a couple of Coronas and decided to split an order of the Beef Ribs.For $9.00 I was pretty impressed with the amount of meat they gave us. A lot of times they skimp during these park events but not here.We grabbed one of the tables and watched some tennis.Unfortunately the ribs didn't taste as good as they usually do at Hill Country itself. They were a little over seasoned and tougher than normal. I think the travel must have hurt them a bit.I have to tell you though neither Mike and I really cared that much.I had actually attended a funeral that morning and was feeling drained and emotional to say the least.But sitting out in that sunlight, relaxing with a cold beer and watching sports with Mr T was exactly what the doctor ordered. I felt about ten times better just relaxing and enjoying the day.As we were sitting a squirrel came right near by looking for a place to bury a nut he had found.If that's not a sign that summer is over I don't know what is!The matches are being shown through the end of this week so head on over if you get a chance. It's really something quite special.

The First and Last Lobster Roll of Summer

If you look back to my posts last summer you'll see that Mr. T and I pretty much were having a lobster roll a week! This Summer we decided we had to reign ourselves in a little but we did a little too much. We hadn't had one at all!You can actually get lobster rolls year round but there's something about having them in the summertime that just makes them extra good. So realizing that this was technically the last weekend of summer we knew we needed to get our Lobster Roll fill Stat.So we met up with some friends on Friday and headed to Pearl Oyster Bar. The place was packed as always so we put our name in and came back about a half hour later. We were told we would only have to wait a few more minutes so we took a seat in the window and had a drink.The few minutes turned into at least 20 minutes and I have to say I was getting anxious. It's hard watching everyone's food going by when you're starving and I thought about going somewhere else a few times but I am so glad i didn't!We finally did get our table and we put in our order immediately. They had a steamer special that day so we decided to split a large bucket.Wow! These clams were enormous!! They were so plump and juicy I could have sat there all day dunking them in melted butter.They made me as happy as a clam!Then the main event arrived. The Lobster Roll.Pearl's lobster roll comes garnished with a little bit of lettuce and a huge pile of shoestring fries. Some people dislike the shoestring fries but I think they're fantastic!Each one is perfectly salted with an excellent crispy exterior. Yum!And how about the roll! Check out these huge chunks of lobster!The lobster meat is slathered in Mayonnaise and stuffed into a top loading bun that's been grilled and buttered so its crispy on the inside and soft and squishy on the outside.The lobster roll was awesome. I noticed it had a little more mayonnaise than it used too. I could have gone for little bit less but it was still fantastic.Lobster rolls here are going for $27 bucks right now which is pricey but worth every penny.I think we all pretty much licked our plates clean. Pearl is hands down the best lobster roll in the city. Mary's come close but it's really just not the same. I have to say I love the hustle and bustle of Pearl as well. You feel kind of energized in the harried chatty atmosphere.The only thing I would change about Pearl is the beer selection. They only have three beers on tap and I honestly don't care for any of them. Oh well, that's a small price to pay for such an excellent meal. And we got it in just before the end of summer!! Success!!

Last Sunday Mr. T and I meet up at J&R to get some sort of cord.I honestly am not even sure that's what we needed but it seems like we are always buying something that requires a new cord or cable.I had been walking around the Seaport earlier because I hadn't been there all summer. BTW I wasn't missing much! At least on the main drag of the Seaport itself. It was overrun with tons of people! More than I have ever seen! I could hardly move there were some many people and so many different languages going on I felt a little woozy.I did find a nice calm street right off the strip though.Front street actually was completely empty and filled with lots of cute shops and restaurants. That's why I love New York. One block can make a world of difference!!Anyway after we were unsuccessful finding the cord (or whatever it was) Mr. T needed we decided to walk over into Chinatown a little and get some food.We couldn't decided what we wanted. Noodles, Pork Buns, Beef Jerky...We finally decided to walk all the way through and go to Prosperity for some Dumplings.Prosperity Dumplings is a tiny little storefront that can really only fit about 6 people eating inside comfortably. Although there s usually many more people than that.Luckily it was kind of an off hour so we placed our order and grabbed a seat on the side. We started out with an order of the Steamed Pork Dumplings.Oh Yum! These babies were steaming with pork goodness!!That orange stuff on top is hot sriracha chili sauce which we douse the dumplings in. Prosperity also offers a soy vinegar sriracha sauce that is almost as strong as the chili sauce! We like to put a little of both on our dumplings.What can I say- we're greedy!We also got an order of the pan fried pork dumplings which are simply fried instead of steamed so they have any excellent crunch on the bottom and top.I like the pan fried a little better than the steamed. Almost anything that's fried is going to taste better!We gobbled these up like we had been on a starvation diet all week! They were just really fantastic!Oh and the best part of all- the cost!For this feast of food we ended up paying a total of $4.50.$4.50!It's okay to swear out loud right now. The first time I went there I said Holy Shit too!$1.00 for the 5 fried dumplings, $2.00 for 10 steamed and a $1.50 small water.That's a bargain. And a tasty bargain at that.Don't expect any frills- this is a no nonsense dumpling house. You get in, order and get out. But it's excellent.Try the sesame pancake as well- you won't be disappointed!

A Soho Lunch Au Natural

I had a half day of work last week just for the hell of it. I realized a little too late that summer was almost over and I wanted to enjoy it a little more. It was a perfect day outside- 80 degrees and sunny. I decided to take myself out to lunch and soak in some late summer rays.I got out of the subway in Soho and thought I would wander around a little bit and find an outdoor place. Well I had really only gone about 10 feet when I saw Spring Street Natural. I walk home from work by this place at least twice a week. The tables are always occupied with the Soho shoppers and tourists of all kinds.Today there was actually one small rickety table unoccupied in the sunlight. Just what I was looking for- I grabbed the seat. The table itself wasn't actually rickety. It just happened to be right on top of those grates leading into the restaurant cellar. Okay- I have a serious phobia of those grates. I don't even walk on them in the city because I am so scared of them opening up and swallowing me whole.Luckily, after shifting around my seat here and there I was able to at least get my seat onto the sidewalk and stable ground. I figured only my food would be lost now if the grates opened and I would be safe. I decided to order a glass of wine though just to sooth my nerves :)This place boasts itself as a neighborhood restaurant that focuses on serving up fresh, healthy food at affordable prices. Apparently they try to serve foods that haven't been processed.All I know is that they had a special swordfish sandwich with roasted garlic mayonnaise which sounded really good!!So I placed my order and a basket of bread arrived.The man put the bread down so quickly I barely even saw him at my table. It was almost like the bread appeared out of thin air!First I tried a bite of the multi-grain which was really thick and tasty. Unfortunately this place suffers from the rock butter syndrome which was so hard I thought I was going to slice my hand open trying to spread it on the bread.Well the other kind of bread didn't look like it required butter so I tried a bite of that next.Yum! This was excellent. For the life of me I could not figure out what it was made of but it was moist and slightly sweet with a great tangy bite at the end. I found out later from the waiter that it was their house made tomato bread.Tomatoes-I eat those damn things everyday and I never would have guessed that was the flavor!Well about 3 minutes after I had ordered, my fish sandwich arrived.Now if I was a busy Soho shopper or someone on a lunch break, the quickness of the order would have pleased me.I was kind of more into relaxing and enjoying the sun so I found this a little too fast. It also made me wonder about the quality of my meal because really! How can they put it all together in that time?Luckily my fears were for naught because the sandwich and fries were piping hot and right off the griddle.The swordfish sandwich was good albeit a little boring. The fish was a little thin in texture but the buttery toasted onion ciabatta roll made up for it. The roll was soft and squishy with plenty of pores to soak up the garlicky goodness of the mayo on top.The hand cut fries were a little hit or miss, as it seems is always the case with this style. Some were soggy and limp because they had been cut too big, but the ones that came out crispy simply rocked! I only wish they could have all been cooked that way.So I sat there munching on my sandwich and happily enjoying my spot in the sun. It was nice to people watch on the busy sidewalk and enjoy the last days of summer with a peaceful solo lunch.I got the bill and it came to $15.25. Not too shabby for a glass wine and a sandwich! It really hit the spot as well. A pretty good place for a quick bite.And FYI I didn't fall through the grate. Whew!!

This is going to be kind of a quick post. We've been so busy lately with guests it's been a little ridiculous. I am kind of happy the summer is ending so stuff will slow down but also sad because summer is over :(Anyway, Mr. T had family in town so we wanted to meet up for dinner at a casual fun place. I figured Mercadito Grove would be a good because we could sit outside in the sun and they have a bunch of vegetarian options.I made reservations a week before for 8 people outside. The day of the dinner I called the restaurant to confirm and was told they had no reservation recorded. I was a little upset but said okay then can I make one for 8 people outside.The man then tells me they can't sit that many people outside.Okay now I'm a little pissed. I wouldn't have suggested this place if I hadn't had a reservation outside. Not only that but we already planned the entire night around going to this place. We argue a little and then he says fine. Come in by 5:30 and we'll seat you outside.Well 5:30 rolls around and as we walk up to the restaurant I see all of the outdoor tables filled. I walk inside and the host says \"oh someone called and I explained to them you would be sitting inside and they said that's fine.\" Please pardon the use of the O Rly bird but this is exactly how I felt.Obviously this guy didn't realize it was me that he talked to and was trying to pull a fast one. I could feel my blood pressure rising as I looked at the tiny table inside that was supposed to fit our large group comfortably.Not wanting to cause a scene I close my mouth and take a seat. The tables were so small that we end up smashing a couple glasses in the process of sitting down. Not exactly how I wanted to night to start out.Once seated the host comes over and tries to sell us on doing this tasting menu that is going to cost a lot more than we were planning to spend. Once he FINALLY stops talking we tell him we are just going to do the regular menu.He seems a little perturbed but turns and leaves us to decide.Okay I'm not going to keep going on about this guy because it's obvious he's an idiot and the rest of the dinner ends up going pretty well.The important stuff in the end is the food, right?I ordered the fish tacos which are hands down the best in the city.They beer batter some Mahi Mahi and serve it with a Mexican style coleslaw and a chipotle aioli. The tacos are pretty small for the price but they are really good. The fish is nice and crispy and the chipotle gives it a spicy kick at the end. The margaritas are pretty good as well. They use only fresh fruit and come in all different flavors like pineapple, mango and even habenero. Fresh fruit make such a difference! I always feel so full and gross after a frozen margarita. These guys I could drink a ton of (which might not be such a good thing)!In the end Mercadito was okay but I wouldn't go back to that location with a group again. I have had much better service at the East Village one and no attitude at the door.

Just a quick update- I was walking around Kalustyans yesterday looking to pick up some cinnamon sugar coated almonds when I spotted a new item. Chocolate covered toffee encrusted pistachios! Okay those three things are some of my favorite things in the world and now they are together in one candy! Yum!I bought a quarter pound and came home to share them with Mr. T. Next thing I knew I was back at the store about an hour later buying more because we had already gone through the bag! Go get some!!

Eleven Madison Made Me a Liar

This meal actually happened a couple weeks ago. I'm a little behind but it was so fatastic I needed to share it with the world:)In my previous post about Park Avenue Summer, I said it was the best Restaurant Week meal I had ever had.And it was...until two days later when I went to Eleven Madison Park and got my socks knocked off.Now I have been to Eleven Madison twice before for dinner, and while I enjoyed it, it never blew me away. I mean the crispy pork was always amazing of course, but that's all I really remember being fabulous.Well now I can say, Eleven Madison blew me away AND it was during restaurant week!It was the last day of restaurant week and Mr. T and I had the day off of work. We decided we would try to get in one more RW lunch. We started out by going to the Tavern room at Gramercy tavern.We walked up and were greeted by about 20 people crammed into the front room waiting for a seat.We turned around and headed straight for Eleven Madison. I was scared they would be packed as well but we were able to score a seat at the bar.Unfortunately we had our backs to lovely dining room and beautiful windows overlooking the park, but I turned around a couple of times during my meal and that made it a little better :)We started off our meal by ordering some beers. Mr T got the Kostritzer, Schwarzbier and I got the Professor Fritz Briem, which is a Berliner Weisse from Germany.With Berliner Weisse beers, due to their fermentation process they are very strong in lactic acid. Many times people add fruit syrup to the glass in order to reduce the sharpness of the beer.I enjoy the beer on its' own but the bartender had some really neat flavors so I decided to try them out.He gave me three different syrups a strawberry, pomegranate and honey lavender. The Honey Lavender was my favorite by far. The sweetness of the honey really mellowed out the tart flavor of the beer and gave it a silky feel.I still prefer my beer 'au natural' but it was nice to try something new.And I have to say, being a total girl right now, it was kind of fun having those cute mini pitchers to pour into my beer!!The restaurant week menu here works the same way it does everywhere else. You pick an appetizer, main course and dessert for $24.08.For my appetizer I ordered the Big Eye Tuna.The presentation was beautiful and the tuna itself was tender and delicious. It was covered in a fantastic olive oil and complemented with rolled up pieces of kiwi, watermelon and mango.I honestly didn't care for the fruit with the tuna. I thought it was so good on its own the fruit just took away from the flavor.I asked for a copy of the menu when we left and realized that the dish was different than I had ordered. On the menu it was supposed to come with Heirloom tomatoes not fruit. I wonder if the kitchen ran out of tomatoes last minute and whipped us this idea!Luckily they didn't run out of anything for Mr. Trekker's appetizer the Sweetbread Ravioli with Sweet Corn, Lime and chorizo.Oh my Word! This dish is permanently in my list of the five best things I have ever eaten in my life!I took one bite and I felt my eyes roll back into my head. The sweetbread had a rich creamy texture and the light eggy ravioli was covered in a corn foam that was utterly delightful.Words cannot describe how good this dish was. I wanted to take my piece of bread and soak up every last drop of that corn foam. Good thing sweetbreads aren't available in every restaurant. I think I would be about 500 pounds!For my main course I ordered the Seared Skate with Cauliflower, Lemons and capers.I was wowed once again. And by skate! The skate was cooked perfectly so that the outside has a great crispy crust but the inside was moist and flaky.The cauliflower and capers tasted like they were caramelized in butter almost and sprinkled with a little lemon for some acidity. Simply wonderful!Mr. T ordered the Colorado Lam Sausage with Eggplant, Tomato Confit and Roasted garlic.I'm not a huge sausage eater but this dish rocked. The roasted garlic and tomato confit added a slightly sweeter flavor to the spicy sausage.My favorite part of his dish though was the mashed potatoes. Gramercy tavern has my favorite mashed potatoes in the world and these were almost identical. Super creamy and smooth they were almost like a milky potato puree. Yum!!We were both very happy with our entrees and I don't think we left anything on our plates. We were stuffed but of course the best part about restaurant week is that dessert is included!Who cares if you feel like you might explode!! Dessert is on the way! I got the Araguani Chocolate Custard with Passion Fruit Sorbet.The dish was almost more like a custard tart with a scoop of sorbet on top and passion fruit syrup on the bottom.The sweet custard and sour passion fruit worked well together and I ate the whole thing in about two seconds flat.Mr T ordered the Sheep's Milk cheesecake with Summer Berries and Lemon Verbeana.The cheesecake had a light airy texture and the berries and lemons gave it a crisp refreshing flavor. An excellent way to end our meal! So there you have it. Without drinks our total for the meal was $48.16. We kind of laughed a little because the other times we have been here we have dropped a LOT more money and never experienced this level of deliciouness. I was truly wowed by this meal and the marvelous talent of Chef Humm.All I know is next restaurant week this will be on the top of my list to get a reservation. Hopefully this time at a table so I can enjoy the room a little more. I'm sorry Park Avenue Summer. Your meal was great, but I lied. It wasn't the best I have ever had. Eleven Madison swept me off my feet. It is truly in a league all of it's own.Simply wonderful.Eleven Madison Park

One of the Worst Meals of my Life at Ushi Wakamaru

Okay, I want to preface this post by saying that I really don't enjoy giving bad reviews. Who Does? I wish every meal out could be a fantastic culinary experience. But you know what? That just does not happen all the time. And it really didn't happen to Mr. Trekker and I this past Thursday night. It started out nice enough. We meet up after work at Pegu Club where we enjoyed some really tasty cocktails. When I walked inside I immediately fell in love with the look of the place. Long hardwood floors and candle lit tables gave the room a hip but cozy feel. I ordered the Pisco Punch which is pineapple infused pisco brandy with grapefruit, lemon juice and lime syrup. It was so tasty I easily could have had four or five of these things. Dangerous for sure.Mr. T tried out their signature Pegu Club cocktail and the Tantric sidecar which were both awesome although definently stronger than my Pisco Punch. After a couple drinks we headed across the street to Ushi Wakamaru for what I thought was going to be a fantastic Japanese dinner. It was not to be. I am kind of sorry I didn't take pictures but honestly they probably wouldn't have done this review any justice. Things were bad from the start. We sat down and were given our menus. After looking over them briefly we decided what we wanted and then waited. And waited. It took about 15-20 minutes before anyone acknowledged our presence. Finally a waitress came over and took our order. Luckily she was much quicker in bringing out our drinks. Maybe a little too quick. About 2 minutes later she comes out with Mr. T's sake and my glass of wine. As I go to have a sip I notice something brown floating in the bottom of the glass. Now this isn't just a small piece of cork...This is something quite large and gross looking, possibly some sort of food but I couldn't really tell. We flag down our waitress and show her and she quickly takes it away and brings me out another glass. Whew..A couple bumps in the road so far but I'm hoping things will get better once the food comes. It does not. Our first order, the special Toro negori with Bonita flakes. Out comes a bowl with what looks like ground up tuna with some black chunks in it. The Toro has the consistency of slimy baby food. I could hardly pick it up with my chopsticks because they just went right though it. And the taste..well it kind of tasted like slimy baby food as well. It was so gross texturally I couldn't even get down more than a bite or two. Mr. T was able to eat most of it but kept saying, is it supposed to be like this, with every bite. Next came the black cod miso. The cod was so overcooked it was difficult to even cut into it. The protion was tiny as well but out of all of our dishes this was to be the highlight of the meal. At least it was at least edible. Next out is our Japanese Beef Sashimi. Five tiny triangles of beef that were so oily and gristled they were disgusting. Mr. T likened the taste to what we assume dog food would be like and I agreed. It just tasted dirty. Mr. T had gotten an order of soft shell crabs and was busy trying to enjoy those. About halfway through he stops and says, \"something is wrong with these\" He couldn't put his finger on it but decided to stop eating them. Not being a soft shell crab eater I couldn't weigh in but I applauded his decision to stop eating them if he was unsure about the taste. Unfortuntely it would be too late. The abalone came next and fared no better. Mr. T discreetly spit his first piece out because it was too tough to even chew or swallow. Upon inspecting the other pieces we realized this was the case for them all. At this point I just wanted to leave but we only had one more thing coming out which was the eel sushi. I took one look at it and knew I wasn't even going to give it a try.At this point I look over at Mr. T and notice drops of sweat coming down the side of his suddenly very pale face and I realize he is about to be sick. Those soft shell crabs didn't taste funny for no reason. I wanted to complain, I wanted to argue about the quality of our food, I wanted to understand why our stuff was so bad! But one look at Mr. T and I know he just wants to pay and go, so he can be sick outside rather than in the restaurant. So we do. And the entire rest of the night we are both sick. This is by far the worst meal I have ever had and I will never be returning to Ushi Wakamaru. I have no idea how it gets such good reviews, maybe we just had an off night but I really don't think so. The quality of all of the food was so bad and the cleanliness of the restaurant as a whole is seriously in question. With so many great Japanese places in the city like Shushi Yasuda, Abiyura Kinnosuke, Le Miu...why would anyone go here? It is the one place that I don't think deserves my second chance.

BBQ Face Off!!  Dinosaur vs. RUB

***CONTENT
So we went out to two BBQ dinners this past week and I have to compare them since we got basically the same things. Okay- just to start- I have eaten at both RUB and Dinosaur BBQ before, although the dinosaur I ate at was in Syracuse, but I knew what to expect walking in.At Dinosaur we started off by splitting an order of their Honey BBQ and Garlic Chipotle wings.This is one of each and once I saw them coming to our table I couldn't help but smile. These were actual wings!! They were big, meaty and oh so close to the Buffalo wings I grew up with!! The Honey BBQ sauce was nice although I thought it could be a little sweeterThe Garlic chipotle however rocked!!!They had an excellent smokey garlic flavor which just enough spice at the end to leave your lips and mouth burning for a few seconds after. For my main I ordered the 1/2 rack BBQ Plate that came with a choice of two sides and cornbread.The ribs were just as I remembered from Syracuse. Meat that was juicy, moist and covered in a sweet, tangy and thick BBQ sauce.I was pretty boring for my sides, I admit. The coleslaw was alright but I've had better. The iceberg wedge with blue cheese was nothing special but it was nice to see salad offered as a side at a BBQ joint. It made me feel little bit better about all of the red meat I was consuming.Everyone also got a piece of cornbread that was so moist it must have been made with about four sticks of butter. No joke.Three nights later we found ourselves at a neighborhood joint RUB. We decided to order the same stuff and check out the differences. Here is our order of buffalo wings. The wings were a tad smaller than Dinosaur's but still bigger than most. The sauce on these were pure spicy BBQ with a salty kick. These were good but I found the sauce a little too salty for my tastes although I did enjoy the bbq flavor.Here we split a full rack of St. Louis style ribs with an order of BBQ baked beans and coleslaw on the side.We had a full rack at RUB so we got both the long and short end of the ribs. I have always loved RUB ribs. They are moist and beefy without tons of fat. The sauce is good as well, but I usually add a little more of the spicy sweet sauce on the side to give them a little more flavor.The sides at RUB are really great.It's one of the few places where I can get vinegar based coleslaw rather than mayo. And Mr. T swears they have the best baked beans in the city.They are thick, rich and have burnt end pieces swimming about. Quite decadent!So here's what it breaks down to.Score card please:Dinosaur had huge juicy wings that almost stole the show from the ribs- 1 point DinosaurDinosaur's Ribs were more moist than RUB and had such great flavor that I never even thought about adding more sauce- 2 points DinosaurDinosaur gives you free buttery cornbread that is awesome. RUB gives you wonder bread- 3 points DinosaurThe beans and coleslaw at RUB are pretty awesome although Dinosaur gets a little nod for having lettuce as a side offering. 1 1/2 points to RUB 1/2 to DinosaurRUB aesthetically is alright but kind of small and cramped where as Dinosaur is a large, boisterous, fun place. 5 1/2 points DinosaurRUB is 3 blocks away. Dinosaur is about an hour subway ride- 2 1/2 points RUBSo there you have it. Where it matters most Dinosaur is the big winner.Not to say I don't still like RUB...Its just not on the same level as Dinosaur for ribs and wings. Dinosaur is BBQ the way I like it and I guess that just makes me an up state kind of girl:)My goodness how I love meat!!

I see that you hold the Honey BBQ wings at Dino BBQ in high regard, but how do they stack up against the Honey Butter BBQ wings at the world famous Bar-Bill Tavern? Also, now that Dino has won the first leg in the BBQ challange, I think that Blue Smoke should now challange Dino for the BBQ belt. Keep us posted.

Ah yes...Nothing will ever beat the Honey Butter BBQ Wings at Bar Bill. Those will always be the best! But if Bar Bill started to make a garlic chipotle sauce like Dino's??? Now that would be interesting.I have a feeling you could possibly make that happen Pitted Pruner:)

Okay so Fantittalliastic isn't really a word but that's how I feel after I had one of these falafels today!!I was heading to work this afternoon, through the West Village, when I happened across Taim. I saw a guy outside the small shop, eating what looked like an amazing sandwich so I stopped in to grab some lunch.It was about 12;45 and the 5 stools inside Taim were filled and there were about 5 others waiting patiently in the sardine tin space for their food.They had an awesome sounding Sun dried Tomato Falafel special but I decided to try one of their usual ones first so I went for the Red Whole wheat Pita falafel.About ten minutes later I was out the door on my way to the office to indulge in y amazing pocket of goodness.Look at the little guy in there when I opened him up!Don't be shy little guy! You should be strutting your stuff with all of those toppings and awesome balls of flavor!Yum! I took a bite right into one of the falafel balls and the wonderful taste of red roasted peppers came shooting at me.See those red flakes- those are the peppers. And look at all the other stuff!! I really shouldn't have called this guy little! This pita was packed to the brim with hummus, isralei salad of cucumbers and tomatoes, green cabbage and tahini sauce. This was the most solid pita sandwich I have ever had in my life and I ended up eating the whole entire thing! Once I was done I honestly was so full I had to go for a walk around the block before I could start working again! What an awesome lunch and guess what it cost me?$5.45. Crazy cheap and delicious. I am so happy I know how close Taim is to my office now. Their fries looked ridiculously good so I will be back soon with Mr T. to try those out. And it'll help me save some pennies for my bigger, more expensive outings!!

Park Avenue Summer RW Lunch

I have always wanted to try Park Avenue (any season all seasons) but it always seemed so pricey. So when I noticed it on the Restaurant Week List this year I jumped on the reservation.Unfortunately they only offer a lunch so I had to take a half day of work. Luckily Mr. T's office is nearby so he was able to meet me for lunch and still bring home the bacon:)I walked inside about 20 minutes early and was greeted warmly by the maître d' and receptionist. Since Mr. T wasn't there yet I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a beer from their summer beer list.This is the first \"summer\" thing I noticed. They had 3 beers, all wheat, listed for summer beer enjoyment.I thought this was kind of neat- wheat beer is great in the summer because it has that lemony thirst quenching ability- so why not highlight it?They also had a very nice white wine sangria special which many people were drinking. It came with some blueberries and raspberries floating in the bottom. It looked so nice, even though I hate sangria I thought about ordering one.Mr. T showed up and although we were 15 minutes early, we were shown to our seats and scored a great table for two right by the bar. This table was nice because we only had one couple to the left so we weren't very cramped.I looked at the RW menu and have to say the options were so nice it was quite difficult to decide on what to order.Eventually we decided and the waiter brought us over a basket of warm toasty bread.This being Park Avenue summer and all- what kind of bread do you think they served us?Well corn bread of course!! Two different kinds.The first was almost like a mini loaf that had an excellent crunchy exterior with some red pepper and paprika throughout the middle for flavor- very nice.I thought the second roll was simply a piece of white bread until Mr. T opened it up and revealed the pieces of corn inside.Very clever and quite tasty!!Next up our drinks arrived.Mr. T was working so he ordered a glass of iced tea. And it was truly the best iced tea he has ever had.Okay- let's start with the glass of tea itself. It came in a large plastic glass with one of the most beautiful thick slices of lemon I have ever seen. And that huge brown straw? Not a straw- a sugar cane!Summer in a glass!Then came the iced tea condiments for making it really good!!!Out came a little tray with granulated sugar packets, a vile of mint leaves and a vile of sugar water.Once Mr. T swirled these all together I tasted one of the boldest and brightest iced teas I have ever tasted!When he had finally finished mixing his tea our first course was ready to come out. Mr. T ordered the salmon tartar.Mr. T loved the crusty bread, pesto and huge chunks of fresh salmon. He didn't really care for the olive oil but gave the rest of the dish a huge thumbs up.I went a little safe with mine I guess...I had heard Park Avenue got best caesar salad in NY mag so I had to try it out.Well I have to say it was pretty fantastic!! I immediately took off the anchovies (can't eat those salty buggers) and amidst the shaved Parmesan cheese there were pieces of lemon zest that really brightened up the flavor of the crunchy romaine.It all sat atop a cheesy piece of bread that was so thin and crisp it was almost like a cracker.This was a seriously good Cesar Salad. Both of our appetizers were also huge! When Mr. T finished his salmon he was already pretty full. I knew we had a lot more food coming so I somehow willed myself to stop eating about halfway through my salad so I could enjoy my entree once it arrived.And here it is! The sliced Filet Mignon sandwich with horseradish cream and cherry tomatoes.This sandwich was pretty good. It wasn't the best meat I have ever had but the horseradish cream sauce and caramelized onions underneath gave it a great flavor.I have to say Mr. T's was the winner of the entrees. He got the Herb Grilled Chicken with cherry tomatoes and zucchini.Wow- this chicken was packed with herby goodness. The chicken was spiced up on the grill and then covered in pasta and some sort of pesto Parmesan sauce that was creamy and delicious. The green and yellow zucchini were crisp and brought some great summery colors to the plate.We were so stuffed from all of the food I wasn't sure I was going to be able to do dessert.But hey- I always find room for dessert!!Now if Mr. T was the winner of the entrees, I at least was the winner of the desserts. I got the dark cherry parfait.The parfait had four parts to it. The bottom was crushed and slightly caramelized cherries, the second layer was chocolate crunchies, the third layer was half whipped cream and half cherry mousse and the top was some kind of cherry chocolate cookie.It was so good I ate the whole damn thing.Mr. T got the Strawberry Watermelon Panna Cotta.While this dish was light and refreshing- it was a little boring. The Panna Cotta was almost too light and the berries, while good, were simply berries.The watermelon was covered in graham cracker crumbs and was probably the best part of the whole thing. It wasn't bad by any means but probably the most disappointing dish in our other wise fantastic meal.Before leaving I stopped in the restroom and was greeted by such a wonderful scent of fresh flowers and a spankingly clean restroom, I just had to take a picture.After all- these things are important! I have sworn off certain places where the ladies rooms were too dirty.So overall- this was the best restaurant week meal to date. The food was excellent, the portions were more than ample (we both brought home leftovers, which we never do), the service was friendly and efficient and the place itself was just beautiful.I loved how they really seemed to pay attention to making sure the summer theme was in almost every dish and I will definitely be back to see what they cook up in Autumn, Winter and Spring.The total cost of our meal with 2 glasses of wine, a Hitachino White Ale and the Iced Tea was $84.00. This is one place that is doing Restaurant Week right.Park Avenue Summer</a

So while we were waiting for our plane back to NYC we stopped at the bar for a drink to kill some time.I was looking at the beers on tap when this one caught my eye. Alexander Keith. I had never heard of it before so I decided to try one out. It had a golden red color with a decent head. When I took a sip I was kind of shocked. It honestly had hardly any taste to it at all. I mean no taste! No good flavor, no hoppiness, just an incredibly bland and boring beer.I looked it up and apparently it's made by Labatt's which make sense why I haven't seen it in NYC. I have to say I don't really care for most Labatt beers so it wasn't surprising I didn't like this one either.It's too bad really because I really liked the shape of the beer glass it was served in.

I can't testify for the red version you tried, however I grew up in Nova Scotia Canada and what you should have tried is Alexander Keith's India Pale Ale. It is my favorite beer in the world and I would love to be able to get some down here in Phoenix. If you ever find yourself in Halifax, take the brewery tour, it is still made in the same building since the 1700's. http://www.keiths.ca/

Our first night in Buffalo my parents picked us up at the airport and we meet up with my family for dinner at a place called Prosit in Williamsville. I had never been here before but my father insisted I would love it. Why?The Beer! Prosit is basically a small (very small) Polish/German restaurant that serves lots of different Polish and German beers. Being Polish this was quite a treat! They even had a nice little beer garden in the back with a couple big wooden tables perfect for relaxing after a long day of traveling.When we arrived, the biggest table in the back was actually being occupied by the owners sister and her daughter celebrating a birthday. Once they noticed how large our group was they immediately offered us their table in lieu of the smaller one which was extremely nice.The rest of my family arrived and we ordered up a couple rounds of beer.I decided to go with the Okocim beer which is a polish style pilsner that is light and crisp. Perfect for a hot humid day. They were nice enough to bring out a bunch of bread while we drank including a dark caraway rye and a raisin pannetone that came with some sweet creamy butter and slices of Parmesan cheese. We had a couple of rounds and were having so much fun we decided to sty there and have dinner as well!They started off by giving us some tossed salads.The salads were made with fresh greens and came with your choice of two salad dressings the creamy tomato bacon or creamy gorgonzola. I couldn't deicide so I asked for both on the side and I have to say they were both really good.That's the tomato bacon in the picture.For our main Mr. T ordered the Sampler Platter.The platter came with a huge cheese pierogi, potato pancake and a polish sausage, along with some sour cream and red cabbagea and veggies. Unfortunately the Polish sausage didn't have a very good flavor to it. It just tasted a little grainy and weird. Luckily the potato pancake and pierogi were good so he just enjoyed them.It also came with a side of sauteed apples which is another staple dish I remember enjoying at Polish dinners growing up.For my main dish I give you Ta Da! The Mr. Pisinski sandwich!Only a place is Buffalo would have a sandwich named this!! And it was quite tasty! It was thick slices of ham covered in a melty cheese with mustard on grilled rye bread. The serving was huge so I ended splitting it with my friend, the Pitted Prune, who had joined my family about halfway through dinner.We ordered some desserts to share and all of them were amazing!!! Especially some kind of peanut butter torte/pudding that was out of this world!!!Prosit has a nice old world charm about it. If you notice, all of the plates and glasses were antique and the inside of the place reminded me of my grandmothers house, in a good way! The service was very comfortabe and the owner came over a couple times to make sure everything was alright.Prosit is a place that literally seems untouched by time. I hope it stays that way.Prosit Restaurant

So we just got back from a fantastic voyage to my hometown in Western New York. We ate a bunch of good food and even made it up to Canada for the day which I will report on later. Unfortunaely we are so exhauted from our trip I only hve time for a small post on something Buafflo has a lot of- strange sodas.Anyone who hs lived in the Western NY area will probably agree that the best drink growing up was Loganberry.Loganberry is an awesome grape flavored drink that is everywhere in the city! I mean almost every single restaruat has it no matter what. When I first went away to college I couldn't believe people hadn't heard of it before! Well we found another soda that is pretty crazy as well.Here is the Saranac Shirley temple soda. This was a great find since Mr. T actually spent a whole weekend once drinking Shirely Temples with vodka!! We had to try it out as soon as we saw it at the store.It had a great pour to it with a classic frothy head that looked absolutly thirst quenchaliscious on the steamy hot day we were having.Look at the glass! They even threw in a cherry!Unfortunatly the soda looks a lot better than it tastes. Overall it was just WAY too sweet. I think between the two of us we could only get down about half.The funny part was that we looked at the sugar content on back and I think it was 36 grams. Then we looked at the Root Beer's sugar and it was 38!! How's that for surprising! I'm glad I don't drink soda on a regular basis. I'd rather get those sugar grams in the form of candy bars.

I was walking around my neighborhood the other day and noticed that both Japonais and Butai have happy hour specials that seem like a pretty good deal. I was craving some sushi so I stopped in to Butai to check out their deal.I walked in around 6:30 and was the only person besides two men having beer at the front. I grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a glass of their Pinot Grigio and asked about the specials.They had the usual rolls; tuna, salmon and California on special, but they also had some kushiyaki. I decided I had to do a little of each.To start I ordered a spicy tuna roll.This was a pretty good roll. The rice was a bit too sticky for me on the outside but tuna had a great flavor and the size was perfect.A minute later my skewers came out. I ordered the pork belly, asparagus with bacon and cherry tomatoes. The pork belly skewer was awesome!!! It was a juicy crispy bit of belly that sat a top some ponzu dipping sauce. Really tasty!! The bacon wrapped asparagus was pretty good as well except that the bacon was a little more fatty than I usually like. Luckily I had ordered the cherry tomatoes. After all of this pork fat I felt like I needed a little something healthy!The tomatoes had a great char to the outside and were a refreshing contrast to all of the meat.There was so much food I honestly couldn't finish it all and for the glass of wine and these dishes the bill came to $16. Quite a bargain actually!!I also just really liked the vibe of the place. Of course it was empty but the servers all seemed very nice, the music was good and the whole decor was kind of relaxed trendy (if that makes any sense).Hopefully it was just empty because it was a Monday. I'm going to walk by later on in the week and see how the place looks then. But a good happy hour spot if you're in the area. They also have $3 beers and $5 cocktails. Not to shabby!Butai

I happened to run into the Park avenue Summer festival yesterday as I was heading out to do some errands. There are a MILLION street fairs in the city during the summer and most of them are filled with the same old boring stuff. Crepes, mozzareppas, gyros, pashiminas and bed sheets.Well the Park avenue one had all that stuff too but it actually has some other cool stuff that make it one of the best street fairs going. They had tons of dresses, jewelry and best of all tons of free food samples.The one that had the biggest line was the Ciao Bella truck. Now it was pretty early in the day for ice cream but it was free so I had to get some!They were offering about 6 different flavors including which was a tough decision but I decided to go with the Pistachio. First of all, the sample was pretty big!! It was like ordering a regular small bowl at an ice cream place. The ice cream was dark white and had whole pistachios sticking out everywhere.The verdict? The flavor of the ice cream itself was fantastic. It had a natural nutty flavor and the ice cream was rich and creamy. The unfortunate part for me was the whole pistahios. There were honestly too many! Every time I had a bite I would get 3 or 4 pistachios. The nuts messed up the consistency of the ice cream for me. So much that I didn't even finish my sample! I appreciate the fact that the flavor is all natural but when I want ice cream, I don't want to be chewing it. So overall I guess I wouldn't buy this in the store. I stick with my Ben & Jerry's for now.

Last Sunday we spent most of the day holed up in a bar with friends and watching the championship game of the Euro Cup. It was a pretty exciting game and we all had more than just a few beers.Then a huge rainstorm came again right at the end which forced us to order another round so we wouldn't get wet! By the time that round was finished we were \"feeling no pain\" as my mom would say and decided to make a trip down to Congee Village for some much needed food.We walked into the restaurant and found it relatively empty. Not too many people want Chinese food at 5:30 on a Sunday I guess! Even though there were only 3 of us, they sat us down at a huge table and we ordered up some Mai Tai's and ton of food.First order out was our Pan Fried Dumplings.These came out with a nice crispy outside and steamy greasy insides of pork. They were good but just an average sort of dumpling.Next was a HUGE order of chicken fried rice. I am not usually a rice fan but this was really good! There were big chunks of scrambled egg, peas, oinions and carrots. It all combined for a great toasty flavor.Our next dish was the house special chicken.This is basically a chicken that was roasted in some sort of soy garlic sauce. I thought this was really good. The skin was a little bit more soggy than crispy but the flavor was spot on.We also got a half order of the 5 Spice Duck.The duck was a little disappointing. Certain pieces in the middle were moist but the end pieces were dried out.Also, for a name of 5 Spice it was pretty weak in flavor. I guess I was expecting a little bit more kick and more of that rich smokey taste I've had from duck in other Chinese places. It was just lacking overall.Then out came our Blue Crab dish. Look at this monster!!!We ordered it with the garlic butter sauce and man was it messy!!! This is not something you order on a date that's for sure! It's also kind of difficult to eat after drinking beers all day and I was covered in sauce by the end but it was super tasty.We finished up with a side order of sauteed Chinese Greens. This was a nice refreshing side dish to offset all the fatty meat we were having and once again HUGE in size.Overall we had a really fun dining experience! We ordered a couple of Mai Tai's and the bartender kept coming out himself to deliver them to us, making them stronger and stronger each time. I think we left a little more happy then we came in!!I could see this being a really fun place for a big group dinner that's pretty easy on the wallet. They finished the meal by giving us some orange slices and we were off. Another successful Sunday in the city.

I happened to be in the Sheepshead Bay area the other day for work so I headed over to the Fruit and Vegetable Market on Avenue Z.This is my favorite place to buy fruit in the city because they have such a huge selection of hard to find stuff and the quality and freshness of their fruit is really hard to beat. Not to mention they have a ton of Russian candy in bulk so I always come in and try a couple different ones each visit!So after picking up some beautiful ripe plums and a couple pieces of candy I decided to go across the street to the newly reopened Gourmet Food Market. They closed for renovations over a year ago and I was happy to see their place looked pretty goo. They had much more space than before and it seemed a little nicer.I did a quick walk around and started to head out the door when something in the bakery case caught my eye. Peering through the glass, I see this giant pastry that looks like a cross between a macaroon and a bombolone!!I go in for a closer look, and see a sign in front that says it's called a Margarita. A Margarita?? That' really odd.I ask two different store clerks if they can tell me more about this ginormous pastry but no one seems to know what it's about.Well now I'm really intrigued so I buy one and head back to work to open it up.I feel a little silly cracking into such a giant sweet before lunchtime but no one seems to notice or care. The outside top is dusted with powdered sugar and the ring outside seems to be covered in some sort of crushed nuts.As I crack it open I realize the top and bottom \"macaroon\" parts are actually just made of a light meringue.Inside things are a little bit crazier though! There were multiple nooks of nougat here and pockets of cream there, but no uniform layers. I wasn't sure where to begin and how to go about eating it.The one layer tasted somewhat like an almond paste while the other tasted a little bit like hazelnuts and honey. The whole thing was texturally awesome as the meringue outside crisped and melted into the creamy sweet paste inside and crunchy chopped nuts on the edges.For $1.99 this gargantuan pastry was a steal and so different than anything I have had before! I probably would have eaten the whole thing right there, but about halfway through my stomach begin to churn a little from eating so much sugar.I still had a ton of work to do so I decided I should be responsible and curb my dessert eating until the end of the day.I tried to look up some research on where this pastry originated and exactly what it's made of but I had no luck finding anything. Possibly they had the name down wrong? I would love to know more about it.I am planning to go back in a couple of weeks so I'll stop by again but if anyone has any ideas, or has eaten this mammoth treat before, I'd love to know more about it. My stomach will thank you immensely!!

I decided to trek out to Williamsburg Sunday morning to check out the Unfancy Food Show and see what it was all about. It was about 90 degrees and extremely humid around 12:00 and I thought the walk to the bar from the L train was going to kill me.By the time I got to the place I was sweating profusely and looking for some good food and drink.I was actually one of the first people there and the vendors were still setting up. I was surprised to see how small the event was but they really packed a lot of great stuff in the timy space.There were so many great things there, especially the sea salt and almond chocolates from the Mast brothers, but I couldn't really pick anything up because I was afraid it would melt on the walk back.The one thing I did decide to buy though was the ice cream.I had a sample of the chocolate flavor upon walking in and the rest of the show I just kept thinking about it. So on my way out I stopped back and picked up a scoop for the road.I already knew the chocolate was amazing from the sample so I decided to go for something new and asked for the pistachio.Wow!!! One of the best ice creamsI have ever had. The pistachio had a great earthy nuttiness flavor and the itself was thick and rich without being overly sweet. The ice cream came from Van Leeuwen Artian Ice Cream and I highly recommend checking it out. The people their were super friendly and you could tell they were serious about their gelato.I actaully looked them up and found out they are the new artisan ice cream truch people in SOHO! Who knew!Overall the entire event was very nice and I got to try a lot of good stuff. Hopefully next year it won't be so warm so I can actually purchase some stuff to bring home. But man, that ice cream really hit the spot.

It's funny- if Mr. T and I look back on all of the places we've eaten at since moving to NYC over 6 years ago- I can almost guarantee that we've been to Spice the most.Our first time there, a college friend from Vegas had come to visit. We were so poor we hadn't been out to eat anywhere and had no idea what to do with him!I remembered hearing about this Thai place and we decided to give it a shot. Two hours later, filled with a flaming volcanic chicken dish and multiple sake bombs, we were a little tipsy, a lot full, and still had some pennies in our pockets.The rest is history.Spice is one of those places that we almost always go to when friends come to visit. The city restaurants can be a bit of a sticker shock and this helps ease that pain.We came back here about 2 weeks ago for lunch when Mr.T's best friend was visiting from San Diego. Their lunch specials are a great deal because you receive a free appetizer with every entree and entrees are generally $7-$9!I went with my usual starter the Crispy Shrimp Fritters.Yum! These fried balls of goodness are stuffed with baby shrimp and then placed in a pool of spicy thai chili sauce and cool sliced carrots. Whew!! Depending on who's in the kitchen these things can light your mouth on fire! They are great though and quite a large portion for a starter.For my main dish I went with a new item on the menu- the crispy fish. I usually order the Garlic Beef with Vegetables dish but I was feeling adventurous so I went for it.Okay- they said this was Tilapia but I have never seen a Tilapia that was that thick in my life! There was more fish on this one plate for about 3 people!The fish was fantastic. It was lightly battered, so that the breading could easily be pulled away and huge chunks of white fish could be eaten with the spicy sauce and vegetables.Mr T couldn't get enough of my dish. He said it was his new favorite and I have to agree.The best part? Since there is more than enough fish for two people we could literally spilt lunch here and pay a total of $9 for two people!Ridiculous- right? That is why this place is always a neighborhood standby.Don't expect the best service. They are efficient to the point of being a little abrupt but that has never bothered us, and the quiet trance music in the background gives it a cool kind of vibe.Spice is definitely worth checking out if your in the money woes or just want a great cheap thai meal. It's good to know that there is still one place in this city that has stayed as affordable as it was since the day we moved in.Now if I could only say the same thing about my apartment....

Mr T completely surprised me the other day by making dinner reservations at Market table for Friday! He's surprised me with dinners before (okay only once before) but this was special. I had tried to go to Market Table a bunch of times and something always came up to prevent it from happening. So I was absolutely thrilled when he told me the news and I decided not to leave him after all :)We got to Market Table around 6:30 on Friday night and the place was relatively empty. First of all, I love the space!! High wooden ceilings made the space open and airy while the big windows bring in the sunlight and look right out onto the street corner for optimal people watching time. The wind had started to pick up as we were walking in and we hoped to see a rainstorm while we ate, but unfortunately that never happened. We were seated in the middle of the room at a big wooden butcher block table. We ordered a bottle of wine and listened to the specials of the day. I was excited because they were offering the burger as a special that night. I am on a perpetual quest for the best burger so I knew I had to order it. But first we started out by splitting an appetizer.This is the house cured salmon gravlax on pumpernickel with frisee and egg salad.They brought the dish out already split up on two plates. This is such a simple thing to do but it really makes the meal more enjoyable.I actually can't eat salmon so Mr. T took my piece but the egg salad and frisee were wonderful! It came with a mustard sauce on the side that gave a little spicy kick to the creamy egg salad. Mr T loved the salmon as well. I just thought the pumpernickel, egg and mustard together were a great flavor combination.As one of the specials they had Beau Soleil Oysters from Nova Scotia, so I got one of those.The oyster came with some kind of spicy chili sauce which I didn't use since the oyster itself was so perfect all it needed was a splash of lemon. For our mains the burger arrived and it didn't look as impressive at first as I had expected.Then I realized what was missing. The tomatoes!!! They had stopped serving them because of the salmonella scare! That made sense. The waiter offered to bring some out if I wanted but I declined. The tomatoes never make the burger for me anyway.The burger came topped with caramelized onions and a thick white cheddar cheese. My thoughts...Well?It just didn't have anything distinguishing about it. The toasty Cheddar cheese was excellent but I hardly tasted the onions. It wasn't until about half way through the burger that I remembered they were there. The bun was nice and soft but lacked the squishiness factor of a potato roll. I was just expecting something a little bit more. The charred outside of a Shack burger, the buttery flavor of the Seymour Burton meat, the addicting saltiness of a PJ Clark patty...there was nothing like that. It was simply a very good burger that lacked that extra oomph! to make it memorable.What were memorable though were the fries! OMG they may be my favorite in the city! Every single one was perfectly uniform with a crispy, salty outside that was so good they didn't even need ketchup! The other excellent part of the night was Mr. T's whole roasted Branzino. Wow!! The fish was incredibly moist with a slightly sweet flavor that was brought out by the whole pieces of garlic and lemon that were stuffed inside. It came atop a bed of sauteed bok choy that had soaked up the garlic and lemon juices flowing out of the fish. It was spectacular!!! We ate the entire thing!As a side we ordered the hush puppies which came with honey butter sauce for dipping.These were also very good but I was so busy enjoying my fries and stealing bites of Mr. T's fish that I couldn't really focus on sides!We were so stuffed after the fish we couldn't even fathom doing a dessert so we just finished our wine and paid.Overall I really liked my experience at Market Table. The space is beautiful,service was spot,the food was excellent and my wonderful man planned it all!What more could a girl ask for!Market Table

So we had a fantastic, and I mean really fantastic, culinary weekend of eating with my parents in town. Unfortunately Mr. T was uploading some things onto my iPhone and somehow erased all my food pictures!!!So I'll just give a couple brief highlights from the trip. I have actually been to all of these places before except for Babbo so it was nice to take my parents to places I love.Thursday night- scored a last minute reservation at the Little Owl. Couldn't believe my luck. Of course we ordered the pork chop and gravy meatball sliders which were a hit. But my favorite of the night was the Halibut with corn and English peas. It was one of the best fish dishes I have ever had. The fish was super moist with a crackly skin on top which was heavenly alongside peas and their puree. It tasted like spring.Friday lunch at the Spotted Pig. Dad loved the burger (hated the shoestrings though which my mother and I happily ate instead). Mom liked her grilled cheese which was rich and thick. Only part of the meal we didn't like were the deviled eggs. The diced green onions on top had just a little too much kick for us and took away from the eggs.Friday night dinner at Cafe Sabarsky- chocolate cake with pistachio icing and a chewy nougat center. Need I say more.Saturday brunch at Jane was solid. Not much to report there.Saturday night dinner at Cru. Service was probably the best I've ever had in a restaurant. Completely wonderful and accommodatingly. Best dishes of the night were the Soft Shell Crabs stuffed with a crabmeat salad. The Saffron Tagliolini was recommended as an appetizer and was amazing. It came with shrimp, lobster and crab that were all plump and sweet in a wonderful shellfish sauce.Sunday the parents left but we meet up with Mr. Ts family to celebrate father's day at Babbo!!!Wow- what a meal! I browsed the boards here for what to get and I was not let down. We ordered so much food I can't talk about it all but the Grilled Octopus with \"Borlotti Marinati\" and Spicy Limoncello Vinaigrette.The dish was enormous and the octopus had a great char to the outside that was just unbelievable. I have been dreaming about this dish all week!We also ordered the Rib Eye which was also one of the most flavorful pieces of meat I have ever had. I completely understand now why Babbo is so hard to get into. Thanks for all the great recs!!So a fantastic week of eating...I really need to go on a diet for a little while:)

My parents were in town this weekend visiting for the first time since last September. My father is a dessert manic and came across Cafe Sabarsky last time they were in town and fell in love with the place. So we headed over there early on Friday and grabbed some dinner.Cafe Sabarsky is actually inside of the Neue Galerie which displays German and Austrian artwork. The cafe serves mainly Viennese food with a big focus on desserts. I wasn't feeling particularly hungry since we had a big lunch at the Spotted Pig earlier (which I'll post about later) so I just ordered the Dill and Cucumber Salad.This was a great dish fit for the extremely hot day we were having. The yogurt sauce was light and the cool cucumbers and tomatoes just tasted really refreshing. Although the dill was a prominent feature of the dish, it was on the lighter side.I had some bites of my parents Bavarian sausages and they were both very good.But come on. The really great stuff here is the desserts. I ordered the Mozartorte.Oh my goodness this was soo good!! It's basically a chocolate cake with pistachio icing on the top and a chewy nougat cream center.The icing was so wonderful and so different than anything I have ever had before. It was thick, almost like a gel, but went perfect with the light cake and nougat inside. Wow! One of the best desserts I have had in a while.Cafe Sabarsky is just a nice place to visit. It has that old school charm to it with the big wooden walls and windows looking out onto the park. It wouldn't fit in my neighborhood but on the UES it just works. Cafe Sabarsky

Mr. T.'s sister and husband are moving to Florida in a couple of weeks, so they threw a going away party on Saturday night. They ordered a bunch of appetizers to snack on at the bar throughout the night and most people gobbled them right up.Most people except for Mr. T. In his defense he was called out of the party for a work matter halfway through and then tried to play \"catch up\" when he got back by drinking a bunch of Duvel's and forgoing the food all together.We woke up Sunday morning and needless to say he was a little worse for wear and starving! I went through a list of foods I could go grab but there was only one thing he wanted- dim sum. Nothing else would do. I took a look at the temperature outside and saw it was around 95 degrees. No way in hell were we going to schlep all the way down to Chinatown in this heat! Then I remembered seeing that Wakiya did a weekend dim sum brunch. We looked it up on their website and decided, although a bit pricier than we wanted, the two block walk was about all we could handle that day, so we headed out.Wakiya is the Chinese restaurant that opened to a mixed bag of reviews last year inside the Gramercy Park Hotel. People had high hopes for the place but the early reviews slammed it for small, overpriced food. I hadn't heard about it in a while but it hadn't closed down either.I took that to mean it had improved.We walked in right about 1:00 and the place was empty besides one group of four and a solo woman dining. We were seated immediately at a huge wooden table that looked out onto the park.The space was a little strange in the sunlight, but I could tell with the lights on low it would be very sleek and stylish.We took a look at the menus and decided to order 4 dishes to split between us. They also offer a $35 prix fix but we thought that would be too much food and kind of a waste for the shape we were in.The first dish we received was actually a last minute pick. We had asked for the Pork Bun but they were all out, so we subbed in with some spring rolls.The spring rolls were surprisingly good. The last one I had was at Chinatown Brasserie and I hated the filling and thought they were small.Here they were a pretty good size and came with a great dipping sauce. My only complaint was that they were a tad too greasy. I had to napkin off the bottom of the roll because I was a little grossed out.Next came the Crab & Pork Soup Dumplings. This is really the main reason Mr. T loves dim sum so much. He is infatuated with soup dumplings.They looked nice and plump with a thin skin but unfortunately they just didn't have a remarkable taste. The insides were somewhat bland compared to other ones we have had, and for $16 we could have gotten about 4 orders of great ones at Shanghai café instead. It came with Ginger Vinaigrette for dipping which added flavor to the dish but almost overpowered the Dumpling.The next dish we got turned out to be our favorite. The Shrimp Shumai.Shumai is a funny thing in the city. I feel like every place has a different take on what makes it. Here the shumai was exactly what it should be. A solid whole shrimp atop ground up pork with a great sauce.Our last dish was the only one I had picked out- the Spicy Beef Salad with Yuzu dressing.The presentation was gorgeous but as soon as she placed the dish down I realized what was missing- the salad.Okay...I know that the term salad is a very loose term these days. I actually looked it up on wikipedia to see how they defined it. They said it is a \"mixture of cold foods, usually including vegetables and/or fruits, often with a dressing.\"When I think of a salad I think of greens. Lettuce, arugula, spinach, something leafy. No leafy stuff in here!It actually wasn't cold either. The base was a mixture of slightly cooked celery, radishes, green turnips and corn. I don't really like any of these vegetables so most of them were left on the plate. The beef was good and I loved the yuzu dressing, but the dish was very uneven. Sometimes I would have a bite and almost choke it was so spicy. Then other pieces were simply bland. We took a brief look at the dessert menu before leaving and saw a sesame white chocolate dessert that sounded absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately our waitress told us their pastry chef had just left so many of the desserts were unavailable.For the 4 dishes it came to a total of $50.86. Pretty pricey for a dim sum brunch. I did enjoy the atmosphere though and would probably come back for a drink at the bar and an appetizer. The glasses of wine were surprising priced from $11 and up. I think they start at $20 a glass across the hall at the Rose Bar so that's a significant difference.Wakiya

We decided to go and check out the MET rooftop last Saturday since neither of us had ever been. The place was packed but we managed to fight through the crowds and found our way up to the top of the building.For some reason I thought the view was going to be better. I mean, it was nice but the bushes that go all around the side kind of block the view if you're not super tall.They had a pretty cool exhibit at the top though by Jeff Koons. Here's a picture of one of the displays.Anyway- this is a food blog not an art blog right!So after the Met we walked downtown a little and realized we were pretty hungry. We were meeting friends for dinner later so we didn't want a huge meal just a little snack.I realized we were only a couple blocks away from Mia Dona so we headed over there and grabbed a couple seats at the bar. Mia Dona has a long slick looking space. While the front is kind of dark and cool the back is more mellow and bright. They even have a couple of tables outside for enjoying the nice weather.The bartender came over and we ordered a couple of drinks. He was extremely friendly and chatted us up a bit about the restaurant and about Donatella herself.While we were contemplating our order the bartender brought over a basket of fantastic bread. Look at that whole roasted garlic!!I love garlic and this was fantastic as well as the focaccia.The bartender saw we were struggling with what to order and suggested we try the octopus. We decided to take his recommendation and ordered that and the crispy baccala.The Baccala came out first and was really interesting to look at. It was just different layers of stuff. The crispy fish was in the center on top of the fried ricotta cheese and topped off with potato and tomato sauce. It was a little difficult to get a bite with everything at once but it was very tasty.Then out came the octopus.First of all, it was a pretty huge piece of octopus for an appetizer. It was grilled perfectly and came with some green beans and an anchovy sauce that was killer!! I would definitely get this again.Overall we enjoyed our short time at Mia Dona. Friendly staff, good music and excellent food. We noticed that they sell pitchers of beer for $12! Between that and the octopus we will most certainly be back!Mia Dona

So Mr. T and I had some gift certificates to Bar Masa we received for Christmas. We have always wanted to try Masa proper but starting at $400 a person for dinner really isn't in our price range! It was a Saturday and we were feeling some really good sushi in a non-rushed environment. We decided to go for a midday meal around 3:00. The minimalist décor and draped curtains completely fit our mood. There was only one other table of four when we arrived. Everything was perfect...at first.Since it was an off hour, they weren't offering any of their hot dishes- just a limited sushi and sashimi menu. I won't go into every dish in detail, just some of the Two pieces of young Yellowtail Hamachi. We were shocked at how small the pieces of sushi were. I'm a small person and I could probably eat about 50 pieces- no exaggeration. And while it was soft and light I think I have had better at other sushi joints.Hotate which is scallop seared with salt and yuzu zest. This was excellent. I'm a sucker for yuzu on anything so it didn't surprise me that I loved this dish.Kyushu Beef with salt and pepper. This was also excellent. It's difficult to get meat so tender that it melts but this one did! We liked it so much we order two more pieces.Masa Toro Toro Roll- The Toro was definitely rich and lush but for $68 it wasn't worth it. I have honestly had a more succulent piece of Toro at Aburiya Kinnosuke.The California Roll on the other hand was amazing. I have never been a big fan of the California Roll, and now after trying Bar Masa's, I will never be able to have a regular one again. The crab was so buttery and fresh it was unbelievable.Another big hit was the Grilled Japanese Unagi Big Roll. I'm not an unagi fan so I can't comment to much but Mr T said it was some of the best Unagi he's ever had.Duck with Foie Gras in a Moo shu Pancake. This dish was good but nothing memorable. I also thought for the price the portion could have been a little bigger.Okay so onto the strangest part. About halfway through our meal a young woman came in pushing a stroller and sat down at the end table about 2 away from us.I thought it was a little strange to come to Bar Masa alone with a baby but hey- it's the middle of the day! Why not? It's not crowded and maybe she wanted some really good sushi!So Mr T and I continued enjoying our meal when about 5 minutes later I hear this strange sound.Okay I'm not going to go into details about how loud and gross the sound was but I basically looked at Mr T, who was facing her, and just said \"she's not doing what I think she is.\"One look at his saucer wide eyes told me all I need to know. To make the story short, this went on for about 15 minutes during her sushi roll eating. It was followed up by a belly raspberry blowing session and a very nice, but very loud song. She then paid her check and left.My question is- who does this!!! I have never seen this before in a regular restaurant much less an upscale establishment. Yes this is only Bar Masa, not Masa, but when you're spending this much money on lunch I prefer to enjoy it.For our food with 2 Sapporas, a Hitachino white ale and the cocktail it came to $280.00 without tip.Okay- the woman nursing aside- I will probably be back to Bar Masa for the California Roll and maybe to try out one of their hot dishes that we missed. Overall though, I find the sushi to be a higher caliber at other places in the city for less money and the portions bordering on minuscule.

I'm confused as to why your meal was ruined by the presence of a mother nursing her child. Would you have preferred that the hungry baby scream its head off for the duration of the meal? I hope you're not suggesting that a nursing mother doesn't have the same right to an \"upscale\" meal that you do or that a nursing mother should stay home to avoid subjecting you to the natural reality that (shock!) babies drink breastmilk. Grow up.

Hi Andrea,Sorry for your confusion. I never said my meal was ruined, I said it was starnge and that it had never happened to me before. Of course Im not suggesting a new mother needs to stay home, I'm suggesting she goes into the ladies room for a moment or at the VERY LEAST not sing loud songs while she is breastfeeding so as to intrrupt others and cause a scene.I'm pretty sure if you were trying to enjoy a nice calm, expensive meal with your significant other you wouldn't want to here loud sucking noises followed up by tummy blowing noises while you are trying to eat. Come on now. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to realize that. And honestly, yes a nursing mother has the same right to an upscale meal as I do.And I have the same right to hope she gets a babysitter next time.

I just happened to be in Times Square last week for a work function. If you live in NYC you probably try to avoid Times Square as much as possible. It's just really crowed, noisy and filled with people handing out fliers for everything!!Since I don't find myself there very often I decided to check out a couple places, one being the Hershey store. As I was walking around looking at the usual bars, kisses and nuggets, something caught my eye.A Green Tea Hershey Bar! I couldn't believe it! The bar wrapping was written entirely in Chinese so it's quite obvous they haven't begun manufacturing these for regular U.S. consumtion just yet. We LOVE anything at all with green tea so I bought one and dug in.The green tea had a slight artificial flavor but I still thought it was good.As far as chocolate goes I don't think Hershey is winning any compititions when you have chocolatiers like Maison de Chocolat around, but I grew up on the almond bars so it holds a special place in my heart.I really think there would be a market for this bar here in the US though and I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see it out on the shelves soon. If you find yourself in Times Square you might want to pick one up.

Mr T's sister and husband are moving to Florida in about a month so Kate and I decided to meet up for what may be our last \"fancy lunch\". There are so many great lunch deals in this town I can only take advantage when I have a day off. Since Kate works from home and enjoys food just as much as me, she's the perfect companion for these excursions!We were a little disappointed with our last lunch at Perry Street, so I was somewhat apprehensive about our next pick Asiate. I have heard very mixed reviews but figured the view should hopefully make up for anything bad!I showed up right at 1:30 for our reservation and the hostess started to seat me at a table in the middle of the room. There were a few tables open right at the corner of the wall to wall windows and she happily obliged when I asked to be seated there.I didn't get any good pictures of the restaurant so I borrowed some from the Asiate website.The view is really stunning. You can see all the way uptown and to the east quite a ways. Really quite breathtaking. Kate came a moment later and also needed to take a moment to soak in our wonderful view.I took a look at the menu and immediately got a pang of nervousness. I had thought the entire lunch menu was a $24.08 prix fix where you choose two options from a variety like Jean Georges.It turns out there is a very small $24.08 menu and the rest are regular appetizer and entree prices ($14- $38). I decided to stick to my guns and go for the prix fix with the steak. Kate went against the prix fix and simply ordered the short rib entree.We both decided to get a glass of wine and each happened to choose the cheapest wine by the glass of the red and white ($11 and $13 not exactly cheap).For being the cheapest on the list both were excellent and they were quite generous with their pour as well.Next a man came around with a basket of bread. The choice was olive, whole wheat and your classic brioche. Both Kate and I went with the olive.The bread was very good but mine seemed to be lacking a lot of the olive flavor. I looked over at Kate's piece and she seemed to have double the amount of olives inside! Score one for her I guess!The one problem I had was with the butter. I had to struggle to cut into it because it was so cold and hard. I'm always afraid the whole thing will go flying and hit someone at another table. If they just let it sit out a bit it would have been much better.Next my appetizer arrived the Toy Box Tomatoes.I was honestly expecting some kind of tomato bento box for some reason but this was just beautiful on it's own. Tomatoes, arugula, burrata cheese and some great olive oil. I could have eaten an entree size portion of this dish honestly. It was kin of funny to have a dish like this at an Asian place but hey- the Italians got food down pat so why not borrow?Next the waiter set down a cup of soup in front of Kate. We both started to protest thinking it was a mistake when he told us it was complements of the chef. How nice! I guess they didn't want me eating my appetizer alone.The soup was cauliflower and it had a great velvety texture but there was a hint of some spice we couldn't figure out. We went back and forth, each tasting and contemplating. Finally we asked the waitress who told us it was curry.Well I'm glad we asked because neither of us had come up with that! I have to say I didn't care much for the soup, probably because I hate curry so much, but how nice of the chef to send that out.Next our entrees arrived both looking like amazing! I had ordered the Grilled Sanscho Spiced Sirloin.Um okay..seriously I don't mean to compare the two but I had just eaten at Les Halles and this steak blew it out of the water. It was lean, juicy and the sanscho sauce really complemented the steak, whereas the au poivre completely overpowered. I know in some respects that's like comparing apples and oranges but it was the most recent steak I'd had so the flavors were fresh in my mind.Kate couldn't get enough of the potatoes on the side which were crispy medallions seasoned with just the right amount of rosemary on top.The veggies were also fantastic. They reminded me of the vegetable plate I had as an appetizer at Bar Milano. To be honest I got just as many vegetables as a side here as I did as an appetizer there and for a lot less money. Kate had a similar array of vegetables with her Short Rib. The short rib was very good. Nice caramelized crusty top and a relatively moist meaty interior. We both decided it was very good but the steak dish was the clear winner.We were both too stuffed from our amazing meal for dessert but they brought us over a little tray with a mini macaroons, dark chocolate ganache an a mini biscotti. I love the little dessert plates! Its exactly the right amount of sweet I need after a meal and it's free!!I honestly have to say our lunch was one of the best bargains I've had in the city. For $24.08 I had a fantastic spring appetizer, amazing steak and a couple little treats for dessert.Yes the glasses of wine were a bit pricey but the pours were nice and the view was spectacular. Lunch was simply fantastic all around. I wish I could do this stuff every day!Asiate

I was out getting my lunch the other day at work and decided to stop at Lassin and Hennigs to check out what kind of prepared food they had that day. I walked inside and started to head to the back salad counter when I was distracted by a new bakery item. Red Velvet Cupcakes! They looked so freakin good I bought one immediately and ran outside to eat it without even buying any lunch! Wow! This cupcake did not disappoint. The frosting was your classic cream cheese but it had a stronger tang to it than usual. They definitely used a little more sour cream in their recipe rather than extra sugar which was good.The main thing I was surprised about was how moist the cake was! I mean it was super moist. One of the best textured cakes I have had in a while. The flavor was nice as well. I find most Red Velvet's in the city have either too much of a chocolate flavor or none at all. This was perfect with just a hint of cocoa.But that's not even the best part!They come in two sizes- regular and mini. So you can eat a mini and not have the same amount of guilt as when you eat a huge one! The mini's are only $1.25 and completely the right size for satisfying my sweet tooth. So if you find yourself by the Brooklyn Promenade sometime this summer, you may want to stop off and pick one of these little guys up. You won't be disappointed.Lassen and Hennigs

The weather was so nice last Thursday I decided to take myself out to dinner. Mr T was out of town on business so I figured I deserved some good food and quality alone time with a big juicy steak :)Les Halles happens to be right near my apartment so when I saw there were lots of open tables outside I had a seat. I came here once about 5 years ago, before Anthony Bourdain became so huge and the place wasn't overrun with tourists.I remember thinking the fries were unbelievable so I was pretty excited to try those out again.I sat down and waited for a little over 10 minutes for the waiter (kind of a long time when the place is empty).I asked him about one of the glasses of wine and he proceeded to try and upsell me from a $7.50 glass to a $17.50 glass of wine! I politely refused his suggestion and ordered a very nice Côtes du Rhône.As I was contemplating my dinner order the bread arrived. It was pretty average bread basket but the butter took it up a notch with its rich creamy texture.My waiter came back a minute later and I asked him what cut of meat the Steak au poivre was. He proceeds to tell me \"round steak...you know the butt\".Hmm..the butt. I thought this was half amusng and half odd. Not exactly a mouth watering description! But hey- I ordered it anyway so who am I to say! Since it was a round steak it was a little bit tougher than most but still delicious. The peppercorn sauce on top was good but almost a little too spicey for my tastes. About halfway through I had to take a little break because my mouth was on fire. I'm beginning to realize that I can't handle spicy foods like I used to. Ah...just one of the wonderful joys of getting older :)As you can see the steak was cooked perfectly and how about those fries!Well..they were very good- light, crispy almost like a McDonalds fry back in the day but not quite as good as I remember them being the first tme I came. Overall a solid dish though.The place stayed pretty quiet the entire time I was there and it was very enjoyable to just sit and watch the crowds of people bustling down Park Avenue. I have definently had better steaks before and the service was a little strnge but it ended up fitting the bill nicely.Les Halles

So I have yet to meet the person that dislikes cookies and I hope I never do.I saw on Eater yesterday that Ruby et Violette was reopening and I just happened to be in Hell's Kitchen for work so I ran over on my lunch break.The space is small and narrow but they have a few cute tables for you to sit at and the white decor makes the space feel a little bigger than it is.I walked in about 12:00 and was cheerily greeted by all the women behind the counter.I had no idea what kind of cookie I wanted...which was perfect because they were doing a cookie tasting!!! Okay free cookies! This already the best day ever!I took a bite of the Homerun which was a chocolate based cookie with Baby Ruth candy bar chunks and caramel apparently imported from Italy.This was good gut very sweet. A little too much for me. The other two I ended up tasting though I ended up buying.The first one on the left is called the Perfect cookie. Why perfect? Because it really is the perfect balance of semi-sweet chocolate and cookie dough in a semi-cripy crust gooey center that might make it the most perfect chocolate chip cookie.Don't get me wrong- I love Levain but sometimes it's just to big - and City Bakery? A little too crispy for my tastes. This fell right between.The other one on the right is a new one they were trying out- the camel popcorn cookie. This was also very good. I was worried about the Carmel drizzeled popcorn gettinghard through the baking process bu it didn't . It tasted kind of like a salty Carmel Frappocino to me (in other words pretty freaking awesome)The last one though was my favorite- the Marshmallow. Can you see him in there!This little guy was so chewy and sticky that he literally got stuck inside the bottom of my bag. Hey little fella!I finally got a piece broken off to get a picture of.Um Yeah...This is basically a perfect with marshmallow inside..Need I say more? One of the best cookies I have ever had. Chewy, moist, gooey, rich all of it!I loved this place. They also have ice cream which is whatever the flavor is and then the cookie dough mixed in.For example the espresso is espresso ice cream with espresso cookies dough batter mixed in. The pistachio is pistachio ice cream with perfect cookie dough mixed in. This place is like a dream come true for ice cream and cookie lovers!!! If only I lived closer!The staff were super friendly ands after my disappointment at Insomnia this was a nice surprise. Worth the walk over to 10th Avenue- check them out. Really nice little delights!

Degustation Continues to Wow

Mr Trekker and I went to Degustation back during the very first month it was open and it blew us away. The space, the food, the price- everything! We swore up and down to make it our go-to restaurant for the future. Well somehow it fell off our radar. Luckily though, a recent chowhound thread brought it back into my mind and I'm happy to report our visit Friday night was everything we had remembered.Degustation really isn't a restaurant in the common sense in that all 16 seats sit around a bar with the cook and kitchen being the center of the show.The night we were there I was happy to see the same chef from last time. Although he actually spent the night training someone else. A woman ended up cooking most of our food and it was just as wonderful.Last time we had done the tasting menu so this time we just decided to order a bunch of dishes and split them between us.We started out with one of my favorites from last time the Croquetas.Four little balls of fried balls of cheesy goodness that sat atop some awesome orange pepper sauce.The next dish was my favorite of the night the crudo of Hamachi.The hamachi was so fresh and texturally wonderful with crispy artichoke chips on top and the oil drizzled over the fish. I thought this was a pretty big portion for the prices as well. There were about 5 big pieces of luscious strips.The next dish was the Snapper with avocado. The snapper was cooked fine but I thought it was way over seasoned. There was so much cilantro I couldn't tastes anything else.If the Hamachi was my favorite dish, this came in a very close second. The grilled octopus.First of all, this octopus tentacle is huge and so meaty. To be honest I have only had grilled octopus a couple of times (usually a fried calamari fan) so I don't have much to compare it to, but this was awesome. It came with some octopus mayonnaise that really brought out the flavor of the dish. This was not on the menu last time we were there and I really hope they keep it on.The last three dishes we got were the meat courses. First was the Wagyu Beef which came with some kind of weirds foam on top which I didn't care for but the beef itself was delicious.The next dish was the Quail which I didn't get a shot of because it was so good we devoured it before I had a chance.When we came here for the first time this was the first Quail dish I ever loved. Since then I have ordered Quail almost every opportunity I have. This was a wonderful reminder of why how Degustation really changed the way I think about some foods.It came with some wonderful mushrooms and pine nuts which really brought out the flavor once again.Our last dish of the night was the Lamb.I am honestly not sure what I thought of the Lamb dish. It was good but.. it reminded me of sausage?! Does that sound weird?Mr T loved it...I thought it was maybe a tad too salty. I love a rack of lamb the best and when I have it any other way it always disappoints a little. It was still pretty good though.Overall- the meal was fantastic. Every dish was good to spectacular, the wine was wonderful, atmosphere romantic and the bill was actually reasonable!! They could charge so much more!!Let's cross our fingers that they don't because it;s one of the best deals in the city.We ended up heading to Cha'an for dessert and finished the night with my favorite dessert the Black Sesame Creme Brulee.Yay!! A successful night of eating. Two great small places that fall under the media rader but soar high above much of the hype.Places like these remind why I love being a New Yorker.

Hallo Berlin

***CONTENT
For some reason I really seem to be hitting the German spots hard these days. We were meeting Mr. T's sister and brother-in-law for dinner Thursday night and she suggested Hallo Berlin. We got there right about 6:00 and took the last outdoor table. We were all having trouble deciding what to order so we went with the Sausage sampler platter.Look at all those sausages!!! My arteries are clogging up just thinking about them! I was surprised to see that they came all cut like this but it ended up being better for sharing. We also got some herring which was actually really good. I grew up in a Polish household so my herring consumption was quite large. This was very good for herring. Much better than I could have imagined.The potato pancakes were kind of meh...No where near as good as Zum's and really a little mushy.The fries were just like the pancakes- a little too soft and lacking an overall crunch. If I'm going to injest this many calories I want to hear the fried crispiness!The cucumber salad was actually pretty bad. It was really soft and watery.So overall Hallo Berlin is probably my least favorite German place in the city. The food obviously wasn't that great and the night we were there they were out of the first 3 beers we tried to order!Also of the 6 times we've been there the service has been almost non-existent. We would have to get up from our seats to go and get our own beer.Once we ordered food a nice waitress began to bring us stuff but it was obvious she was entirely too busy to really be attentive to the outdoor tables.Hallo Berlin is a fun place but I would take Loreley or Zum any day.

Okay Okay...If you're sick of hearing everyone talk about the new Pizza Joint Artichoke then please skip this post. But if you want to see some pictures of some amazing delicious pizza please read on.Ever since the slice place on St. Mark's closed years ago to become a Chickpea, I have had a severe pizza void. SEVERE I TELL YOU!Now that void has been filled:) Look at these slices of pizza! Can you say pure pieces of bliss! If only you could smell the aroma...omg. I barely made it in the door before diving into the box.Artichoke offers a few different types of pizza. First your classic slice.This had an excellent sauce that is thicker in texture than a normal pizza sauce with a slight tangy flavor. This slice was cooked a little bit too much for me but the cheese was awesome! Maybe a blend of mozzarella, Parmesan and Pecorino? Good stuff.The next piece is their signature Artichoke pizza. Which is seriously bigger than my head.I honestly wasn't sure about this pizza at first. I had a bite, pondered a little then another bite, pondered and then all of a sudden, I had eaten the whole thing and was craving more! WOW! It's cheese, artichokes, spinach, olive oil, garlic all baked and thrown together in a sloppy, buttery, wonderful mess. Overall this pizza kind of reminded me of the spinach and artichoke dip from Houston's but better...and on a pizza!Last but not least- the Sicilian.I enjoyed this more than the regular Neapolitan slice. The cheese and sauce were the same but the the crust was more even. It had a great crunch to the edges.I would gladly have any of these slices again and hopefully I will. It only took me about 6 times before I finally got to Artichoke when it wasn't closed and man it was worth it.Maybe my luck is starting to change.

So there were two points this past weekend where I was eating something and literally had to stop and take a moment because the food was that good. First up is the Cubano Sandwich from the Spotted Pig.Oh my goodness this is the best sandwich I have ever tasted in my life. For starters the bread has an excellent crunch and the insides are toasted and buttered with maybe a little garlic. Next is the amazing healthy serving of gruyere cheese which comes just oozing out of the sides of the sandwich.But oh wait...there is so much more. The slow roasted pork is incredibly mosit and melty, proababy due to the fact that it's cooked in duck and pork fat! Topped with pickled jalapeno peppers and an amazing Prosciutto de Parma it has all elements of a kick ass sandwich.It came with an arugla salad on the side which really helped to lighten the rich flavor of the pork although I would have enjoyed my sandwich either way!The other amazing thing I ate was the Beef Short Rib at the new BBQ joint Wildwood. This thing is mammoth!!! Fred Flinstone style it comes out and is packed with flavor. I had thought Hill Country was the best but this place brings BBQ to a whole other level. The meat was again incredibly tender and moist with a fantastic sauce.We had a couple other things there- the brisket being the other highlight of our meal- and really enjoyed it.What's really nice is that they also have an excellent beer list with everything from Ommegangs to Lagunita's. I envision myself spending a lot more time at Wildwood in the future!Now I need to get back on track and try and have some vegetables or something. It's really hard when this city is filled with such good meat.

Yama is a tiny little sushi joint that sits just below 17th street. The inside has 2 small rooms with about 5 tables each and a tiny sushi bar in between. The place is very minimalist with little to no decoration which is just fine, since the sushi would steal the show anyway. This is their Sushi Entree no Shellfish. This came with 2 pieces of tuna, salmon, yellowtail, mackerel and a tuna roll.As you can see their pieces are HUGE!! They come on a huge wooden slab that's kind of intimidating once they put it down in front of you. I have trouble fitting a regular piece of sushi in my mouth all at once...here it was impossible! The pieces weren't only big in size but big in flavor.All of the pieces we ordered were super fresh and full of flavor.The Sushi Entree also came with your choice of soup or salad.We didn't realize the pieces of sushi were going to be so big so we had ordered some more food along with the platter. I got a piece of Toro and Mr. T got a piece of Unagi.Look at that piece of Unagi! It was so big it was almost comical. We also got a spicy tuna roll which was actually white tuna inside and covered with a spicy mayo sauce. I really liked this roll. It was a different take on the average roll. The mayo was creamy with a little kick but not overly hot.We were so full we didn't even come close to finishing our meal. We got the check and it was about $40. We honestly could have ordered about half what we did and still have been full. What a great deal.Watch out though- this place gets crowded!!! We showed up at 6:00 on a Monday night and got one of the last tables. This place is popular. The seats are kind of close together and the air was a little stuffy but it was worth it for the quality and price of the sushi.Yama Restaurant

We live around the block from Yama and there's always a crowd. I've tried it once....food is great, but there's something about dining underground in a confined space that I find uncomfortable. But hey....everyone loves it!

Hey citygirl15,I have to say the air was a little humid and dank while we were there which I think was due in part to the underground lair. I did make a mental note to myself never to go if the temperature id above 80 degrees. I can't imagine how warm it would be then!

So we swung by Loreley the other day for one of my favorite things in life- German Beer!!! I love almost every single kind of beer Germany has to offer: Wiezens, Schwarzbier, Dunkels, Bocks. You name it I've probably already had it. Luckily there are a couple German places in the city where I can get my fill and one of my top favs is Lorely.Loreley sits almost in the middle of the East Village Lower East Side and SOHO. It has a great outdoor patio in the back and long wooden tables inside.It was a nice day so we sat by the open windows up front to watch the baseball game and enjoy the warm breeze.It was such a hot day I really wanted something refreshing, so I got a crisp Warsteiner beer and we ordered up some food. I went for the classic Bratwurst mit Brot. Basically a brat with bread and mustard. The brat was really good. I think it was a little bigger than the ones they usually serve at Zum Schneider and came with some great spicy mustard and a little side salad.For $5 you can't get a much better deal in the city. I got everything I need on this plate: meat, carbs, veggies. Just what the body needs for drinking some beer.Mr. T got the Currywurst mit Pomme Frites.Basically a brat in curry sauce with french fries. There was tons of curry sauce- much more than the wurst really needed but I think some people probably put the sauce on their fries as well. I absolutely hate curry so I only tried out some of the fries. Thin and crispy, they could have gone for a little more salt, but overall they were quite good.Zum Schneider is still my favorite place for German food but Loreley is right up there with it. Loreley also scores some extra points for being less crowded and having a television. Both are great in my book...German Beer & Brats = Happy Girl.Loreley Restaurant and Beirgarten

We had some last minute house guests on Saturday night which was nice. Why so nice?Well first of all because it was one of my best friends but also because this friend loves something just as much as I do- brunch!!!Mr T hates brunch. He literally despises it for no reason. So the only time I get to enjoy this meal is when we have company. I was excited to go and eat some Croques at one of our favorite brunch spots Resto but I called and it was all booked up. I had heard that The Smith had been getting some good brunch reviews so we headed down there instead.We got to there right around 12:15 and squeaked in before the big brunch crowd and were seated right away. The Smith offers a free cockail wth each meal and had a bigger selection than just your avaerage bloody mary. I decided to order a bellini while the rest of the table got the blood orange mimosa'sI have to say I was a little jealous when the mimosa'a came out. They looked so good with that fuzzy red orange color. My Bellini was prepared well though, not too sweet with just enough champagne.For my entree I decided on the Eggs any way with bacon and hash browns. (Boring I know)A couple peices of the bacon were charred on the edges and really crispy. I love extra crispy bacon so this was right up my alley. The Hash Brown were little discs of potato with the skins on. Almost like you would have scalloped potatoes. These were pretty good although I thought they could have been cooked a little more for crunch factor.Here's another Eggs Any Way dish scrambled.Mr. T got the special soft shell crab sandwich. Soft shell crab kind of grosses me out so I didn't take a picture. Who gets that for brunch anyway??!!The best dish of the morning I think was the Croaker.Basically just a Croque Monsieur with eggs, ham and gruyere chesse. The croque came on top of sourdough bread which gave it a slighly sweet taste. This Croque looked small at first but it was actually enourmous. My friend barley finished half of it. There's a lot of thick slices of ham under those eggs!!So overall I thought The Smith was a good place for brunch. The food was good, the atmosphere was bustling but not overly loud and it came with a delicious free brunch cocktail. What more could a girl want on a weekend morning!!!The Smith

I've been to The Smith for dinner. Noisy it is, but it's great for a casual, inexpensive (by NYC standards) dinner.Next time, try Gemma for brunch, about 6 blocks south of Smith.

So I was really excited to check out a new place that just opened nearby Bar Milano.It was started by the same two brothers that opened 'ino, Inoeca and Lupa. Given the success of these places you can imaginethe hype for Bar Milan has been big.I decided to swing by late Sunday morning for some caffeine. I was greeted warmly by the hostess station as I came in and was lead to a seat at the bar. There were about 10 people enjoying breakfast in the bar room and one at the bar.The bar room at Milano has windows all around looking out onto 3rd avenue. The space is sleek and bright.The bar itself was very comfortable. There are only about 8 seats and each one is very roomy. A long narrow table runs down the middle for people to stand at when there are no stools left and tables line the walls.The wall on the right side even had newspapers hanging from a rack so you could catch up the morning news without leaving your seat.I took a seat at the bar and ordered up a macchiato.My macchiato was very good. It was bold and strong, reminiscent of what I enjoyed in Italy years ago.While I enjoyed my drink I had a very nice talk with the bartender.He gave me a rundown of the restaurant including some facts like the stemware is hand blown in Poland, the mixologist was on Iron Chef and the time to come is on Sundays for some good company and food.I decided to take him up on his word and came back on Sunday for dinner.I showed up right around 5:00 and grabbed a table in the bar room. Over the next half hour my dining mates showed up and we got some drinks.I ordered a very nice glass of Elana Walch Muller Thargau and Mr T got a Southhampton Double White Ale.The bartender had told me this place would be known for its cocktails but thier wine and beer list was quite impressive as well. It wasn't huge but everything was well selected. Ommegang and Southhampton are two of my favorte breweries so that was great for me.We placed our order and they brought over a basket of bread.Okay..again I'm no big bread expert but it was pretty awesome! The onion bread was nice and salty, the regular roll had a perfect crunch to the outside. The only part I wasn't a big fan of was the breadstick, which was too crunchy and lacked flavor.For my first course I ordered, what would be my favorite dish of the night. The Spring Vegetables with Garlic and anchovy.This dish was absolutely lovely. The vegetables were cooked perfectly so that they were crisp but without losing any flavor. Tiny little croutons flavored with garlic were spread throughout and gave it a little kick without overpowering the nice fresh tastes of the veggies.Now I should add in here that when I was ordering I asked our waiter what kinds of vegetables were in this dish. He had told me beets, carrots, vidalia onions and brussel sprouts. Hmm...not exactly correct was he. No beets or onions here. Just Brussel Sprouts, Carrots & Yellow squash. Mr T ordered the Scallop with Uni and Meyer Lemon.When this came out I have to admit I took one look at it and thought really...$17.00?? Come on.I tried a couple of bites and it was very good. It really tasted like a refreshing summer dish but honestly I could have eaten about 3 more. The portion was so small!! Beside's the size, the only appetizer that disappointed taste wise was Kate's Porcini Mushroom dish.We couldn't figure out what the side of custard was and asked the waiter. He mumbled something about cheese and walked away.Okay- I know it's the first weekend and if you don't know that's alright. At least tell us you don't know and try tofind out though. That was a little annoying. He really didn't seem to care.After about 10 minutes more our entrees came out. I had the Sea Scallops with Celery Root Puree.Okay- I have a lot of questions about this dish. The Diver Scallops were fantastic. They were nicely seared and had a great meaty flavor that matched the caviar.The Bay Scallops were...interesting to say the least.They are the one's in the shell.They weren't cooked, I think they were steamed and I wasn't too sure what to do with them. I cut one in half and this overpowering smell of salt and brine came flooding toward me.It smelled like the Pacific Ocean had flopped on my plate and died. Kate was sitting next to me and got hit by the wave of salty brine as well. Mr. T grabbed one to try because he thought we were over reacting...His face said it all...He cringed and forced a swallow. OMG this was bad. I'm not sure who decided to try this kind of scallop but it didn't work.Mr T ordered the Agnello Misto..or the Lamb shoulder, loin and tongue.The shoulder and loin were very good. They were packed with flavor and were interesting to eat side by side texture wise. The tongue was a little disappointing ...it was kind of tough with little flavor compared to the loin.Our last entree was the Tagliatelle alla Bolgnese.I thought this dish was very nice. The pasta was cooked al dente and the ragu was tasty. It wasn't stunning but it was a solid dish.Some final note on our dinner.The space is just lovely. I felt so relaxed and happy in our seats. The place was packed towards the end of the night and I still felt comfortable.As with any new place service needs some work. But unlike new places where the waiter is running around, ours seemed indifferent. The only time I got eye contact from him was when I wanted the check.If he had been more attentive we probably would have had at least one or two more rounds of drinks. So basically he lost out on at least $20 more worth of tips. He also gave us one horribly wrong dish description and mumbled something illegible about the other.The other down side was the portion size. Every dish was quite tiny. I am a light eater and after eating the bread, appetizer and entree I'm usually ready to explode. Here I was only slightly full.For me that's alright but the other two were still petty hungry! For the price we paid I would have expected more food.So overall my experience was mixed. I will definitely go back for a drink at the bar with the friendly bartenders. And I really want to try out their fried rabbit dish but not until they work out some service issues.

I'm glad you had a nice meal there Tom. I really want to like the place. That fried Rabbit dish sounded amazing. I'm going to give it another shot after they have a few weeks to settle in.

It was such a gorgeous day on Thursday I called up Mr T to see if he wanted to grab some dinner outside. We knew everyone in the city had the same idea and most outdoor places would be packed. We decided to go for a neighborhood standby where we can almost always get a table- Mumbles.Mumbles is really the definition of a corner bistro. It's located on the corner of 3rd and 17th street and serves a pretty wide variety of food. Mumbles has some good staple dishes on their menu but their specials are almost always fantastic. They also have drink specials every night where they lower the price of a few select wines and beers. That night Blue Moon was $3.50 a pint- not to bad.We placed our order and they brought over a basket of bread. I usually forgo the bread basket but I was starving so I grabbed a piece of cornbread. Wow! It was really buttery and rich. The first bite was heaven compared to that dry crumbly stuff you get at some places.Now since it was before 7:00 we got the early dinner special which is basically a free salad or soup with each meal.It's basically your average dinner salad, nothing too exciting but good. Growing up I remember getting salad with every meal for free. Now it seems like a rarity.Mr T got the corn chowder which he thought was fantastic. The soup was mostly pureed corn so the consisitency was thick and creamy. I took a picture but it honestly looked kind of gross so I didn't put it up. Creamed corn is for eating only :)Then came our mains.I ordered off the regular menu that night and got the Grilled Yellow Fin Tuna.First of all the presentation was lovely. Second of all it was very good. The tuna was slightly seared, just as I had asked, and came covered in a teriyaki beurre blanc over wilted greens. This dish was something I would expect at a higher end Asian restaurant. It was really quite outstanding.It came with lobster dumpling on the side which were alright. Kind of a take em or leave em kind of side. The tuna was so good it didn't really need anything else.Mr T ordered from the specials menu and got the tortellini carbonara.This dish was alright. The tortellinis didn't taste homemade or anything but the flavors of the bacon and peas were nice with the sauce.So overall it was a good dinner with the tuna, corn chowder and cornbread being the highlights of the meal. We would eat at Mumbles more but the service can be a little spotty. It's nice to have in the neighbourhood though for dining al fresco.Mumbles Restaurant

We decided to go do some shopping the other day at the Time Warner Center in Columbus Circle. Mr T needed some new work clothes and I was in desperate need of a new pair of shoes. Trekking around the city so much really puts a toll on your feet. My current pair of shoes actually has holes in the bottom from walking so much!I almost always head to Fika when I'm uptown but I felt like I needed to try someplace new so we stopped into Zibetto, about a block away. Zibetto was very tiny inside with a long skinny counter and standing room only. Everyone in the place from baristas to patrons were European. That's a good sign I believe. Europeans know their coffee. I ordered up a cappuccino and Mr T got a macchiato. My cappuccino came out smooth and creamy.I usually ask for a little sugar but this drink didn't need it at all. If I worked up in midtown I would have a hard time choosing between Zibetto's and Fika's coffee every day!After our drinks we walked over and did about 10 minutes of shopping. Apparently we thought the Time Warner Center had more stores inside than it did! It really doesn't have much at all and we were left with tons of time before we wanted to go to dinner at Bar Masa.So I suggested filling up on some treats at Bouchon Bakery! The first dessert we got was their Chocolate Chip Cookie.I was a little disappointed in this overall. The first couple bites I had were of the outside edges. These were wonderful, crisp, chewy and buttery. As I got towards the center though, the middle tasted kind of greasy. I think it was a little too thick and undercooked.The other treat was much better- the Vanilla Macaron.This was about as close to perfection as it gets. The outside was light and airy and the inside was sweet and chewy. The vanilla also tasted really natural. Sometimes when I get vanilla desserts they taste artificial. Here I felt like I was biting into a fresh vanilla bean. So although shopping was a bust we enjoyed some good caffeine and sugar. We actually ended up doing an early dinner at Bar Masa since we were bored but that's a post for another day when I'm not so sleepy :)

Holy S**T! I couldn't believe it! Ko!!!We had both been trying every ten minutes it seemed over the past 2 weeks with no luck. But Monday night!! Could this be possible.I was so excited I felt like Charlie in the Chocolate Factory getting the Golden Ticket. I was practically running down the street on the way there. I had avoided reading reviews since it opened so I would be surprised. I couldn't wait to see what was in store.In case you don't know, Momofuku Ko is run by Chef David Chang who was Food & Wine's best new chef in 2006. If you think winning best new chef means Chang has relaxed a little, you don't know David Chang.He has since opened Ssam bar and now Ko, which is his newest venture.The restuarant has 12 seats and serves only dinner. Getting a reservation here is like winning some sick sort of foodie lottery. That's why I was so excited.We got to Ko right at 8:45 and had to wait for about 10 minutes until our seats at the bar were available. While we waited we stood at the front table and were given an excellent glass of Cleto Chirarli Rose and some snacks. First they brought out a bowl of Nori chips and Ama Ebi heads. The chips were okay but the Ebi heads were a little much for me. I actually really liked the flavor but I couldn't get over the texture of the insides. I've never been big fan of eating heads :)Then they brought over a bowl of Shishito Peppers covered in Toasted Almonds.These were really good. The peppers had a nice bite to them and the almonds were almost a little caramelized from being roasted which balanced the spice of the pepper.We were just finishing our glass of wine when our seats became available. We walked along the back of the bar all the way until the end. I was happy to see we were seated last. The stools were spaced quite far apart and there was actually a ton of room between myself and the wall. Much more spacious than I would have expected. Mr T and I had decided to go for the wine pairings with each dish, so we didn't look through their drink list. They did have some great beers though including two favorites of mine Hennepin and Allagash.The chef behind the counter greeted us, confirmed our food allergies and we were ready to rock! Within seconds they sent over our first amuse bouche which was basically 2 salty pork rinds.These were good. Definitely the best pork rinds I have ever had. A nice start to the meal, but what came next blew me away. The English Muffin with Chicharron. My picture came out so badly I actually asked Tina aka The Wandering Eater if I could use hers and she generously agreed. Thanks Tina!!! (As you can see her pictures are ten times better than mine)These two muffins came out looking perfectly toasted on the edges and across the nooks. Then I took a bite.For the second time that day I couldn't speak. Now if the burger was amazing I would call this transcendent. I can't even describe the flavor. It wasn't overpowering just spectacular. The little nooks and crannies were soaked in luscious pork fat that wasn't oily, just delicious. There are no words in the dictionary to describe the bliss I had when eating this muffin. All I can say is I love pork fat.Then came our first dishes. For Mr. T it was a Fluke Sashimi with chives and poppy seeds. For me it was Ama Ebi with avocado and tonburi and horseradish oil.This dish was nice. I like the fact that it was a light first course. After eating the fat laden English muffin I was a little scared I wouldn't be able to handle 11 heavy courses! This was served with a glass of Cantine del Taburno Campania.It was a nice start although not a very memorable dish.Our next two though were both huge winners. This was mine- Spring Pea Soup with lobster, black trumpets and yuba. Paired with a glass of Dewazakura Dewasansan Nama Genshu, Yamagata Prefecture.Wow! The soup was so rich and velvety and the lobster was like butter. And seriously, this dish was beautiful. The green of the soup and the pink of the lobster reminded me of spring. But honestly, I liked Mr. T's even better. He had Oyster on the half shell with pork belly and kimchi consommé. I have never been a big fan of kimchi but the consommé was very light. It made me want to give kimchi another chance. The oysters were both huge and come on...have you ever had a crispy pork belly that you didn't like? After these dishes I really didn't think it could get any better, but then came the dish of the night. A Soft Cooked Hen Egg with caviar, onions and potatoes. Oh my...Once again my taste buds were in a different world. A world they only thought as big enough for the muffin but now this.This dish had every flavor going on in perfect harmony. The onions were cooked down so they were soft and sweet, the creamy yolk oozed out of the egg in a rich cream with the caviar and the fingerling potato chips brought a salty crispy finish to the dish. This is about as perfect as it gets for me. Possibly the best dish I have ever had in my life.The wine that accompanied this dish was pretty amazing as well. I had a sip and tasted a strong fresh flavor of grapefruit. It was a Scholium Project Sauvignon Blanc. I liked this wine so much I looked it up once we got home. The winemaker leaves the wine undisturbed in the barrel and allows it to ferment itself rather than using sulphur. This wine is actually one of the most natural wines possible! No wonder it was so fabulous. Here's a link to it.Scholium WinesThe chopsticks at the restaurant actually rested on the cork from this wine. Isn't that neat!Both of us also received the same following dish. Sea Scallop with Bacon, almonds and myoga. The scallops were slightly sweet and meaty. They were seared and served with Bacon from Benton Farms. This was very good, standard sort of dish.It was served with Allagash White, which happens to be one of my favorite beers. Isn't that nice!At this point we were really happy and feeling a little ambitious. We decided to order a beer we had never seen before in addition to the wine tasting. The Belfast Bay Lobster Ale.The beer poured a reddish- amber color that was bubbly and fruity. I wouldn't go out of my way to find this but thought it was good. I'd almost classify it as an extremely drinkable summer beer.Okay, back to the food. The next course blew Mr. T away. We had been watching the chef in front of us take a huge chunk of Foie Gras all night and shave it over a dish.Well here is that dish! The Foie Gras Torchon with pine nuts, lychee and reisling.See all that powder. That's the shaved Foie Gras. Once again, there were so many different flavors going on between the sweet lychee, salty pine nuts and rich foie gras. This dish was a little too rich for me. I enjoy a little foie gras here and there but this was a lot. Mr T thought it was fantastic though.I really enjoyed the sake this was paired with though the Kamoizumi Komekome. It was crisp and refreshing. An excellent contrast to the rich foie.One of our final big dishes of the night was the Beef Short Rib with daikon, pickeled mustard seed and carrots. The short rib was deep fried which really charred the outside of the meat so that it was hard. What this did was compact all that beefy flavor inside the center of the meat. I can't really explain it, but it was the most powerful meat flavor I have ever had in one bite. This was served with a glass of Iporus,Crianza Rioja. The smooth Rioja stood up well to the strong beef flavor. Our savory courses ended in traditional style with a bowl of Miso soup with rice and pickled vegetables. This was a good way to ease into the last part of our meal but nothing really stood out for me. The rice was grilled with a little pork fat and rolled into a tube. I was honestly so full at this point I kind of used this as a little breather course before the dessert.As a pre-dessert treat we were given a pineapple sorbet with dried pineapple on the bottom. This was a great palate refresher. The sorbet was a little tart, making my mouth pucker a little.I honestly think my mouth was expecting more pork fat and was reacting in shock of something so sweet!Then our desserts came. I was served a Cereal Milk Panna Cotta with avocado, chocolate and corn flakes. This really didn't do it for me. It was kind of boring. The Panna Cotta wasn't very sweet and the avocado with the dish confused me a little. I took a couple bites and then left the rest. I was much more into Mr T's dessert.He got Fried Apple Pie with Sour Cream ice cream and Miso sauce. This was fabulous! Once again Chang somehow combines all of the elements to utter delight. Sweet fried pie, cool sour cream and salty miso. This was served with Boeri, Ribota Moscato. What a great end to a truly fantastic meal.Some Final thoughts on our dinner.I really liked the way the pairings changed from wine to sake to beer. I thought the pours were a little on the small side but I enjoyed the ones they selected.The service was fantastic. Everyone was incredibly friendly and worked well together in such a small space. When we first arrived, at least three groups of tourists came in the door looking for the noodle bar. Each time, the waiter greeted them warmly and then politely steered them in the correct direction down the street. I marveled at his calm and professional manner, when clearly this had to be frustrating to deal with so often.One truly great thing about our meal was that David Chang showed up about halfway through and stood in front of us for a while, inspecting each dish and chatting with the chefs. It's so infrequent that you see the executive chefs anymore! That was really neat. And by the way he is HUGE!!! His arms were like tree trunks. The man works out! But seriously you could tell by the way he was talking with each person that he has a true passion for his food. So if you can't get a reservation here at Ko at least try out the Noodle Bar or Ssam. Both are phenomenal. But I do urge to try...try for your meal here at Ko. You may have to hit the refresh button a million times and see that damn \"page cannot be displayed\" a bunch of times, but in the end it will pay off. It is worth every single second.Momofuku Website

Okay so that isn't really true. I found the love of my life 10 years ago and then last night he scored a last minute dinner reservation where I meet the second love of my life, the Pork Fat English Muffin.But I have to start at the beginning. What was supposed to be another ho-hum Monday turned into a fantastic culinary day.I woke up Monday morning and decided I needed a day off so I called in and did a little work from home in the morning. Mr. T called around 11:00 asking if I wanted to meet up for lunch and catch the first half of the Yankee game with him. So I jumped on the train and headed up near his office. I told him I would look around at some of the bars up there and see what looked alright. As I was dodging the pellets of rain I literally ran into a place I've always heard about, but never been to, P.J. Clark's. In case you didn't know PJ Clarks is old school New York. The building dates back to 1868 and it really still feels like an old saloon inside. It's always packed whenever I come by, so when I saw two bar stools open I grabbed them and called Mr. T to come meet me.Once he showed up we went right for the signature item the Cadillac. And the first item on my awesome day of eating came out.A t first glance the burger isn't anything special looking. I was actually in mid-sentence when I took my first bite and once the burger hit my taste buds all thought left my head except for the amazing taste . The burger was so juicy that the entire bottom bun was soaked through. The bun was perfectly soft and the bacon! Man that was some awesome bacon!!! I wanted to ask what kind they used but never got around to it.Even the pickle this burger came with was awesome. Nice and crispy!! I really couldn't believe how good it was! I was in burger heaven! The fries were really good as well. Salty, thin and crispy. Just the way I like them. This may have moved up into my all time favorite burger spot. I have to go back a couple more times to ensure it wasn't a fluke but I'm pretty sure it wasn't.The only problem I had with PJ Clark's was the price tag. The burger was $10.50 alone. The fries cost $4.50 extra. That's a pretty hefty price tag. But I honestly think it was worth it for the enjoyment I got from my burger. Really good stuff.So after lunch ended Mr T went back to his office and I headed home to do some errands The Yankee game had been rained so there was nothing else to do during the day than laundry, etc.A little after 6:00 Mr T came home. Now I am an early eater and usually have dinner made by around 6:30 or so. Since we had eaten lunch so late I wasn't feeling hungry just yet so we decided to hold off.Then as I'm taking dishes out of the dishwasher Mr. T suddenly says \"What do you think about eating dinner around 8:45?\"I must have looked at him like he was crazy. 8:45? Why would I want to eat that late? Doesn't he know I have to get up early for work? Was he just being obnoxious?Then he turned the computer screen around so I could see it and calmly said \"I just got us reservations for Ko.\"To be continued.....

Yesterday we hit up the first night of the Gotham Imbiber Cask Ale Festival over at Chelsea Piers. We knew we would be drinking lots of strong beers throughout the night so we started out by ordering some good beer food.And there is nothing better than some big salty hot pretzels to go with the suds.Mr. T and I have been to Chelsea Piers a bunch of times, usually in the summer, to sit out on the patio. While the food on their menu isn't fantastic, the pretzels consistently blow us away.They're so big and buttery! And come with some melted processed cheese for dipping. Yum!!As a special for the beer tasting they offered a cheese plate.This came with 3 different cheeses of which I enjoyed the cheddar the best. It had a smokey flavor that went really well with the stouts we were drinking. Now how about that cask beer!Here is just one side of the menu. They had 39 casks all together and quite a diverse amount. We tried a bunch but these were the two winners in my book.First the Flying Bison Warbird.Okay, so I'm from near Buffalo and I'm a little bit biased, but this beer really is awesome. It's an Imperial/Double IPA that poured a slightly orange brown color with no head (cask beers don't usually have much head). The beer itself was quite smooth with hints of Carmel throughout and a slightly orange zesty finish.For an 8% beer it's dangerously drinkable.The other winner of the night was the Otter Creek Sea Otter.This is a Baltic Porter from Vermont that poured a reddish black with a little bit of head. The beer had an excellent smooth chocolaty taste and the texture was almost velvety. I loved this beer and will definitely pick some up if I see it in the stores. I believe Whole Foods carries Otter Creek.One more beer that I didn't get a shot of but needs a mention is the Sly Fox Ichor. This is actually a barleywine that would be a great after dinner drink. It was very sweet but for a 10% beer pretty light in body. Obviously this should be served in a small snifter instead of drank down in a 16oz beer glass like Mr. T did. But hey, this was a festival after all. Why not get a little crazy!The festival itself was fun and well run. You had to buy a sheet from the bar of \"tokens\" and then bring it over the the cask table and they would give you the beers. The lines moved quickly and everyone really seemed to be enjoying themselves. We were lucky enough to have a table but there was plenty of room to stand if needed. Besides the fact that it was freezing cold inside the brewery, everything was fantastic.Oh I almost forgot- the Lollipops!!!We were drinking our beers when our friend pulled out this box. Bacon Maple Lollipops!!!Apparently he saw them online and decided- hell why not! See the brown stuff inside! That's bacon!So how were they? Pretty good I have to say! The outside tasted like a really sweet maple syrup, almost a little too sweet, but then you would hit the bacon and get a chunk of salty grissle. The whole texture was a little weird for me, and I don't think I would be eating these as a daily thing, but they were pretty good.A sweet and savory taste combination I never thought I would have in a lollipop that's for sure.So if you're into beer I recommend heading over to the festival. It runs all weekend long and they still have plenty of great beers to go though.Gotham Imbiber Cask FestivalChelsea Brewery

I had always heard about a delivery service for fresh baked cookies down by NYU and thought that was a great idea. I remember many a night, up late cramming for tests in college and craving some sort of sugar. The company was actually started by some undergrads in Pennsylvania and the business has just grown from there.What a great story!So when I heard last week that Insomnia cookies opened their own store, I ran down and ordered four different cookie to try out. The cookies are fresh baked so they came out hot and ready to go.I was planning to wait until after dinner to eat them, but who could wait with hot cookies!So I bit into the M&M chocolate chip cookie first because it was literally oozing melty sweet chocolate all over the bag!The cookie had a nice crisp outside and warm gooey center. I enjoyed this cookie. The m&m to dough ratio was good and it was a nice size.This is ended up being the winner of the bunch.The next was the Chocolate Chunk. This cookie was also good but a little bit too baked for my liking. Even when the cookie was hot the edges were charred a little too much making them hard instead of chewy. I think the cookie was a little to thick as well. I will try another one of these though because the chocolate was so good. I think I may have just had a bad batch.The last two did not fare so well. The Peanut Butter and the Sugar Cookie.The Sugar was thick and hard, no bend at all even when I tried to break it in half. Once I had a bite I found little to no taste. Really disappointing.The peanut butter fared about the same texture wise. At least it had a little more flavor but I wouldn't order it again.So Insomnia Cookies didn't exactly do it for me like I was hoping. Then again, they cater to college students and whether I want to believe it or not...I'm really not that close to the college age I once was :(But I love the concept and can see eating some of the M&M ones on a cold winters day. Yum!!Insomnia Cookies

So my Easter wasn't too exciting this year. I woke up on Sunday not feeling well and so we cancelled our family plans. I had gone down to Black Hound bakery the day before to pick up some nice Easter treats. How cute do these look?The one on the right is a Meyer Lemon Easter Egg cake and the one on the right is their Spring Strawberries & Cream cake.I had planned to bring these treats for Mr T's family to enjoy but since we knew we wouldn't see them for a while we decided to enjoy them ourselves late Easter night. And they were fantastic!!The Egg was filled to the brim with Meyer Lemon filling that was zesty, cool and refreshing. We gobbled this up before I got a shot.The strawberries and Cream was just as good as the lemon.Look at those big chunks of strawberry! The cake itself as really moist and light with layers of vanilla cream in between. The white chocolate icing was my favorite part. It wasn't too heavy or sugary and came with some vanilla cake crumbs on the bottom. Yum!! We devoured both of these. I feel a little bad not sharing with anyone else on Easter but at least it's an excuse for me to return. The people in the bakery couldn't have been nicer yesterday so I am happy to give them more service.Black Hound

We stopped by a new Irish bar last Saturday down in the LES to celebrate St. Patrick's day without the crowds. Luckily the Sixth Ward was exactly what we were looking for. After a day of mostly lounging and shopping we walked in around 5:30 and the place was just beginning to get filled up. We sat down and ordered some Buffalo Wings and beers.These puppies came out steaming!!! They were right out of the fryer hot and crispy just like they make them in Buffalo. The sauce was a little tangy, sweet almost, not like a typical hot wing sauce. I almost want to say it tasted a little like honey BBQ but really good. The wings were a good size for NYC as well and not super fatty. A better than average wing I would say.They also had a decent selection of beers including a Bluepoint Blueberry (sign of Spring!), Weinstephaner Hefeweizen and Red Hook IPA.The Sixth Ward itself was pretty cool. The inside reminded me a little bit of a hotel lounge with the back lights on the walls but the round booths, ample bar seating and multiple (albeit small) TVs made up for the lights and actually made it quite relaxing.The biggest draw is the pool table and large outdoor space that is perfect for drinking some beers when the weather gets nice. Outdoor space is prime in the city. Hopefully this place won't get too packed in the summer.

So I took the train up to Chappaqua on Sunday to visit with one of my best friends and partake in the Hudson Valley restaurant week. My friend picked me up at the station and we decided to go out for some pre-dinner drinks and catch up a little bit.Mr. T grew up around this area and I remembered going to a great bar called Peabody's back when I used to come visit him. I looked it up when I was home and sure enough, they still had a website and everything so we decided to go there. Well Peabody's apparently changed it's name to the Quaker Hill Tavern and we must have drove past it about 5 times when finally we figured out that's what it was.The place itself is still the same. Your typical Irish bar with nice bartenders and a great neighborhood vibe. It's nice because it's so close to the train station as well. I asked the bartender when they changed their name and he said about 3 years ago! I wish they would change their website as well! I do love their beer glasses though. Anyway, after that little hiccup and a couple of beers we headed down to the Crabtree Kittle for dinner. Since it was a Sunday we decided to do an early dinner so I wouldn't get back into the city too late. We made reservations for 5:00 and when we pulled into the parking lot I was surprised to see it so full. We waved the valet parkers away and found a space in the back.The Kittle House itself has a nice old school elegant charm about it. It almost reminded me of one of those old estates you find down in the south. We walked inside and were greeted by about six eager hosts and hostesses. They were all very friendly but it was a little overwhelming. After one woman took my coat we were seated in the main dining room. The dining room itself had the same old school elegance as the front of the house. Every table was covered in white linen and gold mirrors and various paintings were hung on the walls. There were nice big windows on one side, which allowed the sunlight to stream in and brighten the place up a bit.We sat down and were given the restaurant week prix fix menu, which listed our options for food and a few select glasses of wine. I knew we had planned on splitting a bottle so I asked for the larger list. And larger list I received!!He came back with a binder that weighed at least 5 pounds! I could barely manage it. I had no idea that the Kittle House had won various awards for their extensive wine list. We both thought it was pretty funny since we were both so surprised. I ended up picking out a bottle of white and we ordered our meals.Now the nice thing about going out to dinner with friends is the sharing! Sometimes I know Mr. T gets annoyed by me always trying out his food. Here my friend and I decided to split everything.First they brought over some crusty bread and then our appetizersI decided to start with the Sweet Potato Gnocchi with Brussels sprout leaves, lemon and ginger sauce.Wow. I thought this was really good. The gnocchi's were nice and soft and the sweet potato flavor mixed with the ginger sauce gave this dish an almost Asian flare to it. Really nice.My friend opted for the Hudson Valley Farmhouse Salad.On the menu it described this dish as being field greens, fresh herbs and local vegetables.I tried a bite and knew immediately there was something in the salad I didn't like. Cilantro!Now I have never cared for cilantro and Mr. T is extremely allergic to the stuff so we are always careful when we're out to avoid this at all costs. I was kind of surprised it wasn't listed specifically on the menu. Oh well at least Mr. T wasn't here to get sick.I had a couple more bites, eating around the cilantro and found the salad to be good. They used a Meyer Lemon dressing on top which I thought could have used a little more kick to it but overall your average dinner salad.Then our main courses arrived. I ordered the Grilled Prime Sirloin Steak.See that little bundle of color there on the side? That's actually haricot verts that were wrapped up by a slice of carrot. Kind of neat I thought.The beef came with a very nice cabernet sauce and was topped with a shallot confit. The only part of the dish I didn't really care for was the potatoes boulanger. To me it was just a really big hash brown. Carrie seemed to like it though, so to each their own! Although I enjoyed my beef immensely I have to say the other entree we ordered was the clear winner of the night.This is the Fillet of Nile Perch. First of all look at the presentation. This huge piece of fish sits atop a blend of mushrooms, asparagus, leeks and mussels. The entire dish is then coated with a basil broth. Everything just worked in the dish. The leeks and asparagus complemented the basil in the broth and the fish was cooked perfectly. Our last course of the night- dessert!!We ordered the Crème Brulee and the Peach Tart Tatin.The first one I tried was the Crème Brulee. I have to say it had a slightly odd flavor and texture to it. The brulee itself was really thick.almost too thick. And while it was listed as being a Tahitian vanilla bean brulee it had a weird aftertaste that was almost a little sour. Our second dessert was much better. The peaches were just tart enough and it came with a Meyer Lemon rum sauce that was amazing. We gobbled this up in no time flat. After our meal was finished we retired to the bar for an after dinner drink. They have a lovely long mahogany bar that is just gorgeous.Some things I forgot to add overall. The pacing of the dishes was very good. At no time did we feel rushed and we were able to savor everything with ample time in between to chat. The presentation of the dishes was wonderful as well. Each plate which was brought out was just as wonderful to look at, as it was to eat.Overall our service was pretty good as well. Our waiter was very accommodating and even though every table was filled when we arrived the service never seemed to slip.So to sum up overall, for a $26 three course meal, it was an excellent restaurant week deal.

Last weekend we got to experience a very special treat. Some non-NY pizza that was actually good! Have a look:Where is this Pizza from you may ask? St. Louis! It's from a place called Imo's Pizza which is actually extremely popular out there. One of our friends is from St Louis and she decided to order some half baked pies and have them shipped up here for us to enjoy. How awesome is that. She actually used to work at Imo's growing up so we had a true Imo's experience.We started the night off first with another St. Louis culinary delight. Some toasted ravioli's.These beef filled raviolis were deep fried squares of deliciousness!! I found them to be a lot more satisfying for dipping in the marinara sauce than mozzarella sticks. They kept their crunch and while the inside was hot there was no tongue burning that usually accompanies my mozz stick eating. I had brought along a growler of the Southampton Black Lager from whole Foods bowery This is basically a German style schwarbeir that tasted malty and little bit like dark chocolate. It was really light and easy to drink. I would definitely buy this beer again. And isn't the growler kind of neat!Once our hunger was quenched a little by our appetizers the pizzas were thrown in the oven.So what makes these pizzas so different than nyc style? The cheese.This is Provel cheese. It's a processed white cheese that's a mix of cheddar, swiss and provolone. Who doesn't love processed cheese!Now at Imo's the pizzas are usually cooked in a pizza oven of some sort and come out nice and easy.Here we threw them in a regular nyc apartment oven and hoped for the best. About 5-10 minutes into the cooking process a little smoke started to stream out of the oven. Then it seemed to increase a little...then a little more...then a little more...then a LOT more!!Suddenly the entire apartment was filled with smoke! We had the windows open, fans on (it was freezing this night as well mind you) door open. We didn't want to take the pizza out because it wasn't done just yet. So we just stood there fanning the smoke away and coughing until finally the pizza was done. A little sacrifice goes a long way for good food.The pizza came out and looked amazing:I offered to help cut the pizza up since everyone was still kind of running around getting the smoke out. So of course this is what I did:Luckily I only had time to cut up one of the pies before one of the St. Louisians saw what I was doing and stopped me.See Imo's pizza is always cut into squares! Me and my nyc pizza styling's were all wrong. Luckily she took over and they came out looking more like this.The pizza was awesome. The dough was really thin almost like a cracker and the Provel cheese has an awesome almost slightly sour taste to it that I loved. I actually put some non-melted Provel cheese on my salad and really liked it too. I may have to get some shipped up to me!Now our other friend went to college in St Louis so he decided to recreate his glory college days by bringing over some cases of Natty Ice. Well we got really back into the college days and started drinking that and playing cards. It was tons of fun until the next day.Mr. T and I woke with horrible headaches and didn't really move much for the first couple of hours.Thank goodness I don't have to party like I used to in college. My body can't handle that anymore! So our Imo's night was a huge success.Those people from St Louis are pretty cool....even if they do talk funny :)

It was Mrs. T's birthday this past week so we all got together for dinner at Allen & Delancey. Our reservations were for 6:00 and we walked in as the first people in the restaurant. Now I had been in here once before but only for a drink at the bar.The back is absolutely stunning. I loved walking through the heavy red velvet curtains to reveal exposed brick and a ton of candles! Incredibly romantic. I would describe the style as refined bohemian. If that could be a style :)Now it was too dark to take pictures of anything but here is a picture of the inside courtesy of the Allen and Delancey website.We placed our order while sipping some great cocktails and then our bread arrived.Oh my goodness the bread is divine! They said it was baked to order right out of the oven. They gave us two pieces, one regular white roll and one bacon and sage. I ripped into the bacon and sage and steam wafted up into the air. The top had a nice crispy coating of salt and butter while the insides were soft and so fresh! It really doesn't get much better than freshly baked bread. We had finished our cocktails and decided to move onto wine for the rest of or meal. We were split on ordering red or white so we decided to get a bottle of each. We had a couple of ideas in mind but asked the sommelier for some assistance.The sommelier was wonderful. He listened to our requests intently and then gave a couple of his picks based on what we ordered. Get this- He recommended a red that was $20 cheaper than the one we had asked him about. It was a Spanish wine, the 2006 Petalos and it was fabulous! We had had some snooty service from some other sommeliers in the city and this was a welcome change.Then our appetizers arrived. I ordered the Sea Scallops which came with a bacon cream sauce, cipollini onions and verjus. The scallops were huge and cooked so that the middle was a little raw which I enjoy. I thought the flavor of the bacon cream sauce with the sour verjus was very interesting. It was a completely different spin on a classic scallop dish that I really enjoyed.For our mains I ordered the Colorado Lamb Chops Persillade, Braised Middle Neck and Potato puree.Now I know lamb is fatty but this was a really fatty piece. That being said, the rest of the dish completely made up for it. The garlic and parsley crust on the lamb was excellent and the braised middle neck was really moist. The best part were the potatoes that reminded me exactly of the potatoes they serve at Gramercy Tavern! More like a potato smoothie...yum!!!!!I tried a bite of the other dishes which were all good but I have to say the Fluke with Cauliflower Cream was amazing! I'm not ure what they did but the little bite I tried was packed with flavor.The only dish that disappointed me a little was the Cabbage Beef and Onions. The onions and cabbage were delicious but the beef itself had a strange flavor to it. We asked what it was cooked in and the waitress said just the cabbage. Huh..Not sure what it was but I didn't really care for it.I was stuffed at this point but I always make room for dessert!I ordered a macchiato (which was one of the best I have ever had btw) and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Tart, malted milk sorbet and Whiskey Vanilla shake.This dessert was good. The tart was a classic chocolate peanut butter tart and the shake was a great accompaniment to the richness of the chocolate. It didn't really blow me away though.I think I have to change my dessert orders. I always order the chocolate one and there' s only so much you can do with chocolate. I tried a bite of Mr. T's dessert the Sweet Cream French Toast with Oatmeal Ice cream and Caramelized Banana. It was really good. I'm a sucker for a caramelized banana!Then the check came and this was just something else that I thought was nice.As the waitress handed us the check she said \"Just so you know the gratuity is already included since you're a party of six\". Now this might not seem like a lot but I can't tell you how many times we've probably left double the tip after a long extravagant meal filled with wine and cocktails. And especially in this place where the low lighting makes it difficult to read the bill it was just a wonderful consideration at the end.Allen and Delancey really impressed me overall. On the way out I mentioned to the sommelier how much I enjoyed the wine he had suggested and he took the time to write down the name and year so I could buy some at home. What a great meal!My one small complaint would only be the lack of bathrooms. I believe there was only a single one for the entire restaurant and bar. I had to wait about 15 minutes on our way out just to get in. But overall just a really pleasant experience with the family.

We woke up this past Sunday a little too late because of the spring ahead change in time. The plan was to go to Chinatown for dim sum but we figured it was already too late and most of the good stuff would be gone.Instead we headed down to Chinatown Brasserie where we knew we could get some good food, albeit more expensive.We walked in around 1:30 and the place was packed! The entire waiting area was filled and there were no empty table. Luckily there were a couple of open stools at the bar.I decided to try out one of their cocktails and ordered a Bellini martini.This was little too sweet for my tastes. There was way too much peach puree and not enough prosecco. I wouldn't order one of these here again.For starters we got some pan fried crab, shrimp and spinach dumplings.These were a little bland. I was expecting a little more flavor from the crab but there was hardly any inside.I'm not usually a big fan of the sauce they send it with so that didn't help. I thought the skin would be nice and crispy since it was pan fried but I guess I was wrong.For our main dish we ordered the Crispy Orange Beef with orange zest, chili's and grand marnier.This was excellent. The beef had an interesting texture of both crispy and chewy that I really liked. The sauce had a hot and sweet orange flavor that was wasn't too rich and syrupy like most places you get it. I really enjoyed this dish.We also ordered some soup dumplings which would have been great except the dumpling dough itself kept sticking to the steamer. Every time we picked one up the dumpling would ripe and we would lose precious drops of soup. I'm not sure why this was happening but it kind of ruined the dumplings. Overall I did enjoy our meal. If the dumplings hadn't had the ripping problem they would have been spectacular. And I did enjoy having a fancy atmosphere for eating dumplings. It's a good alternative for those days when heading to Chinatown proper just isn't in the cards. Chinatown Brasserie

Hello !I am a Blogger and web developer (and artist) who has been trying to improve the blogosphere for Bloggers. The problem? Too many irrelevant press releases. Also, hard to make money.So I invented Blogio, which is a pipeline between marketers & bloggers. The idea is to let marketers choose their niche and write RELEVANT material that bloggers might care about. Also, share the revenue with the Bloggers.This week, we (finally) officially launched. We're testing this new concept to see if it works. So, we have our first half dozen orders from marketers. And your blog happens to be in a niche requested by one of these marketers.I'm asking you to take a look at Blogio. If you like what you see, open an account (there is no charge) and expect good, relevant content from Blogio. If you don't like what you see - well, I tried. (Your comments & suggestions are welcome).Even though you don't know me, I ask that you take a leap of faith and consider my sincere goal - to help the blogging movement grow and prosper.

So I have been on hiatus the last week for various reasons. First being the craziness of my work environment lately and my inability to focus on anything but that.Second Quite a busy weekend filled with awesome food like St Louis style pizza, and meals at Allen & Delancy and Chinatown Brasserie which I will post about soon.But third and most time consuming has been my plight to get a reservation at the new Momofuku Ko. Every second not doing the two above things have been spent hitting refresh on the website. I know I'm a loser and now I am even more of one because I was away from a computer all day and the site went live...No Resy for me :(I leave you with a picture of a fancy New York City restaurant bathroom (guess which one) because I don't feel like talking about food right now.

I don't know anyone who doesn't love a good cupcake. Cupcakes always remind me of my youth. I think of birthday parties at school, where parents would send in their kids with frosted delights to celebrate another year. The best part was seeing what kind of cupcakes came in! Plain old yellow with chocolate frosting..okayA funfetti cake with raspberry frosting- Awesome!! You would be a super cool kid for a day if your mom sent in something covered in sprinkles or maybe stuffed into an ice cream cone!I think that's why when I saw these cupcakes I was super excited.Wow! Look at all those chocolate chips! And could that be...peanut butter icing as well!!! This doesn't look like anything my mom made!But wait- what's that! A Lime Green Cupcake with Vanilla sprinkles!This must be the best birthday party ever!I bite in, expecting a rush of flavor like a Reese's from hell and instead get a bland artificial peanut taste atop an okay cake that needed a little more butter.The Key Lime Cupcake fared better. The frosting actually tasted like a Key Lime Pie and although the cake was still a little too dry for my tastes the inside had more cream filling.In a town filled with cupcakes range from super sweet (Magnolias) to pretty but bland (the ones above Crumbs and Cupcake Cafe), my favorite are still at Sugar Sweet Sunshine. But to be honest those aren't even that great.I yearn for the days of grade school, of home baked cupcakes that might not always look the greatest but man they were good! Maybe there's a reason bakeries can never do what Mom did. Maybe it's to remind us that the best things in life are always made with love...and who can do that better than family?So thank you Crumbs...thank you Magnolia...thank you every other bakery in the city. I will no longer search for the perfect cupcake because I know where the best one already is...home.Er yeah...I won't be back there for a while though. So if anyone knows of something to fill the void a little until then I'm all ears!!! I just gave up the searching part!

Mr T had to work all day Saturday so I was on my own. I spent the morning shopping at Trader Joe's and doing various errands that I felt like I needed to get done. Once I was finished with everything I came home and realized it wasn't even noon! What the hell was I going to do with myself all day!I happened to have NY1 on and they did a piece on the Plaza Hotel reopening today. It was like a message sent from heaven! I would go and check out the new hotel!So I grabbed the train and headed uptown to the Plaza. I decided to make a pit stop first at Fika since it was only a block away. I was super excited for my favorite macchiato in the city but unfortunately it was kind of gross.There was a new barista working and I'm not sure what she did but my macchiato was pretty bad. This kind of thing makes me nervous. I told a lot of people about Fika and how much I love it. I really hope no one else goes and gets a bad brew. Oh well..in every one's life a little bad coffee must be had- it has been stellar every other time I have been there so I'll chalk it up to an off day.Walking into the Plaza it was quite obvious that the word was out on the opening. It took me about 3 minutes just to get in the door because of the line of people waiting. Once inside I did a quick walk around. Only part of the hotel was actually open. The right back side where the Oak Bar and lobby used to be is still closed off for renovations. The new lobby is now to the left and is also where the Champagne Bar is located.Now to be honest I had planned on getting a drink to celebrate the opening but there were no seats available. The place was packed! Second I looked at the menu and nothing was exactly in my price range! I think the cheapest thing was a glass of Chardonnay for $16. This wasn't a special occasion or anything so I couldn't bring myself to spend so much on a drink. At least not alone- I would want to enjoy this with someone.They also served food in the Champagne Bar and everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic! They had some sort of lobster and crab slider that looked amazing. I will definitely be back.After looking around the Plaza some more I decided to head out and walked over to do some shopping on Sixth avenue. I eventually wandered into Times square and found myself outside of ESPN Zone. I wanted to check on some of the college basketball scores so I went inside.Now I was in ESPN Zone once way before I moved to NY and barely remember it. I saw all of these people heading upstairs so i decided to follow them. Up and up past bar after TV after bar after TV...you get the gist. But then low and behold at the very top it opened up and there was a huge game zone! I mean huge! There were basketball hoops, bowling games, jet skiing, waverunning, golfing game and then your average arcade games as well. It was better than a Dave & Busters! I had nothing to do so I decided to buy a game card and ended up shooting some hoops versus a couple of 10 year olds. Not my proudest moment but man it was fun! After about a half hour of gaming my arms were so exhausted they were shaking and I had a little bit of sweat running down my back. I realized that my body wasn't exactly in the same shape it used to be when I was younger. I was feeling kind of bad about myself when I realized hey, being older kind of stinks but there are lots of things I can do now that I couldn't do in High School....Like drink beer! (Not legally at least!) So I decided to go and get a drink!I grabbed the train down to the West Village and went to Blue Ribbon Bakery. I grabbed a seat right by the window and ordered a Paulaner Hefeweizen.If you're a solo diner this is one of the best places to hang out in my opinion. There's good drinks, good food and great people watching. I perused the menu a little bit and then realized I had a hankering for some oysters.I am just getting into oysters and really don't know much about them. I decided I should go some place where it's their specialty so I could have some help. I finished my beer and headed down to Aquagrill.I got to Aquagrill right before the start of the dinner rush and got the last seat at the bar. I looked at the wine list and was really disappointed in their white wine by the glass selection. I decided instead to just get a Peroni.Now as I was looking at the oyster menu the bartenders were changing hands and got into quite an argument. Basically the dinner bartender yelled at the brunch bartender about not having stocked the bar for him.Now I know things happen- this is a business but usually restaurants try to have things somewhat behind closed doors. Here the fight was in front of everyone at the bar. It was kind of weird and put me off a little.Anyway once the fight ended the bartender steered me toward trying two oysters. The first was a Beavertail Oyster from Rhode Island. This is the oyster on the right. I really liked this one. It had a slightly sweet taste to it which was really nice.The other oyster was from Alaska a Canoe Lagoon on the left. I didn't really like this oyster very much. It was a little too briny for me. I did like however how different the two oysters were. I was looking for something to really differentiate for me the flavors different kinds of oysters can have.After the oysters I decided it was time to head home. Mr T ended up finishing work a little earlier than he thought and we grabbed some burgers near home at Molly's. Although I had a great time wandering the city by myself it was nice to have some company in the end!AquagrillBlue Ribbon Bakery

Great Macchiato at Abraco and the Burger that Put me Down

I'm on a big kick right now of trying out different places for espresso and macchiatos. I can no longer have a cup of cheap coffee from the deli like I sling back on the weekdays. The weekend is now reserved for tasting new coffee delights.This weekend I knew I had to try out Abraco. Abraco has been getting great reviews from everyone it seems. Ever since my experience at Fika where my Ninth Street Espresso macchiato had no comparison, I have been more open to trying out different joints. Abraco is much closer than Fika as well. It's down on 7th street in the East Village where we find ourselves almost every weekend.Abraco is a very tiny little espresso bar. When we arrived on Saturday there were about 5 people inside, which meant there was no room for us! That's how tiny it is!We patiently waited outside until a couple people left and then squeezed ourselves inside.As soon as we walked in the door the man behind the counter gave us a huge smile and jovial welcome. Everything about him reminded me of a cartoon character with his wild hair and throaty voice. I liked this place already!Mr T and I both decided to order macchiatos and I went for a Ginger Snap cookie.My macchiato came and I spooned a teensy bit of raw sugar from the bowl on the counter and took a sip....Yum. Serious good stuff. I loved it! It was such a good balance of creamy, strong, rich and smooth. I really can't explain it....and I don't even want to! It was plain delicious!!Mr T announced it to be better than 9th Street and I would have to agree. Fika is still my fav but I have to place this as a very close second. It may move into a tie soon because of the location but we'll see what happens.The Ginger Snap cookie was a classic- nothing more nothing less. Net tie I want to try out their olive oil cookies which sounded intriguing. The best part about the whole experience, besides the amazing coffee, was the service. The place was crowded the entire time we were inside and the barista treated everyone like a long lost friend. I just felt good inside being in there.Unfortunately we should have stayed and had some sandwiches there :(Instead we went to meet friends at Village Pourhouse to have some beers and watch some College Basketball. About 2 beers in I realized that my early morning English Muffin a Ginger Snap cookie was not going to tie me over. I decided to order the burger because, well....any place can make a decent burger right?Wrong.It came out of the kitchen and it looked okay (are those grill marks painted on..)So I took a bite.Eww...It tasted like it had been covered in pepper and meat seasoner. I mean I could hardly taste the beef! And the texture was just strange. I was really hungry (and a little buzzed) so I ate about a quarter of it- masking the taste with ketchup, tomato and mayonnaise (and I never have mayonnaise on my burger). Then I finally stopped. I was beginning to feel a little gross.Damn you alcohol! You cloud my food judgement!Well- long story short- I woke up the next morning about 5:00 with searing pains through my stomach. I felt like someone was stabbing me repeatedly with a sword.I'm sure there is an importent moral to be learned in this story, but I don't know what it is. I just wish I had just stuck with my great macchiato.

I had a work function the other day and they ordered a bunch of pizza's from a place called Monty Q's on Montague Street in Brooklyn. I had heard people I work with rave about this stuff so I was pretty excited to try it out. Pizza is such a funny thing. Although it is only made of three main ingredients people swear by some kinds and really hate other kinds.I grabbed a fairly small slice to start and tried it out. The first thing I noticed was the grainy bottom and crust. This is usually the sign of a brick oven pizza. The second thing I noticed was the sauce itself which was quite sweet. I actually like a tomato sauce that's more on the sweet side but I have to say the sweetness got to me a little on the 2nd slice. I don't think I could eat more than 2 because of it.As you can see this slice of pizza is very thin and has an awesome floppiness to it that I love in pizzas. I also thought that the sauce to cheese ratio was perfect.Because of the sweet taste of the sauce I actually added a little bit of parmesan cheese to the top, which I never do, and I really enjoyed it.Okay now for the down side. I found that the pies were very inconsistent. A couple I looked at had bright white crusts and no bottom char which tells me they were undercooked. Another pie I looked at had super thin slices on one half and thick on the other half like the dough wasn't properly tossed.This was a large order so I can't be too hard on them. I am interested to try this place for a slice on a regular work day and see how it comes out. That will be the true test. Overall a pretty good pizza.

Giorgio's Still Got It!

We went out for our \"Valentines dinner\" this past Sunday. We always celebrate a day or two later. I hate going out on the day itself. I feel like it's very hard to get a true representation of a place on such a crazy restaurant day.This year we didn't even try something new. We wanted to stay around our neighborhood so we decided to go to Giorgio's of Gramercy. We used to frequent this place quite a lot but hadn't been in at least a year. We started the night out first though with drinks at Gramercy Tavern. We grabbed the last two seats at the bar and each had a lovely glass of Tocai from the Channing Daughters to start. Gramercy is such a wonderful place to relax and after our glass of wine we decide to stay for one more drink since we just enjoy the surroundings so much.This time we went for one of our favorite beers the Saison DuPont. Between the wonderful selection of beer and wine, great smelling food and lovely ambiance it was hard to tear ourselves away from Gramercy Tavern. We contemplated staying for dinner but then decided to keep on with our original plan.We walked over the block to Giorgio's and the first thing I noticed was the walls. They redid the place since the last time we were there and the white walls had been replaced by a bright bold red. The effect was stunning. My elegant little place now seemed sexy! I really liked it. And although I love Gramercy Tavern I was looking for more of this kind of quiet, gentler atmosphere.We sat down and ordered a bottle of Sancerre to begin. On Sunday's every bottle of wine is $15 off. It's a pretty good deal...Come to think of it I think we almost always come to Giorgio's on Sundays! As we were looking over the menu they brought out an amuse bouche.This was a Pastrami Cured Crostini. This was okay- I've never been that big a fan of Pastrami but a little nibble like this once in a while is nice. We placed our order and they brought over some crusty bread with a nice olive oil for dipping.Now I should point out that when we walked into the place around 6:30 it was pretty empty. Over the course of the next half hour or so it became packed with a large party taking up the entire back and several couples up front by us. I think this caused a little bit of panic because our waitress was running around and it was quite a while before our appetizers arrived.Luckily neither of us was starving so we didn't mind too much but I was kind of relieved when they finally got to our table.We decided to get two appetizers we could both share because...well sharing is kind of romantic, yes?First up were half a dozen oysters.Now we are just getting more into oysters so forgive me if I'm not exactly positive but I think she said these were Pemaquid Oysters. It was a special that night so it wasn't written on the menu.. These were really good! There was some kind of citrus sauce in the middle for dipping but all these required was a little squeeze of lemon and they were fantastic.We also decided to get the Giorgio's Antipasto. This was also excellent. There were a couple pieces of prosciutto, soppressata, boccaccini and robiola cheese, green beans, olives and apples. The green beans were barely touched by us to be honest but the rest we devoured. Then came our entrees. I was so excited. I had been dying for this dish and it delivered.This is the New Zealand Rack of Lamb with lemon roasted fingerling potatoes and a horseradish demi-glace. The lamb was cooked a perfect medium rare and had an herb crusted coating on the outside that tasted exquisite with the horseradish demi-glace. The presentation was beautiful and the taste was amazing. This was a huge amount of meat and I ate the whole thing! The only thing I didn't care for were the shaved Brussels Sprouts. These were combined with parmesan cheese and I think the cheese was a bad idea. To me there is nothing better than a simple roasted brussels s sprout with a little salt and pepper. Why mess with a perfect vegetable?Mr. T ordered the Pan fried Trout with Molasses Braised pork Belly. The picture doesn't do this dish any justice. The trout and the pork belly were so interesting and really played well off each other. The whole dish was covered in an apple cider reduction which again helped the whole sweet and savory come together. It also came with a side of corn pudding, which was actually more like a muffin ,but really tasty.We also ordered a side of Parmesan Mashed Potatoes. These were okay but we barely touched them. We were to into our own dishes of fish and meat to be bothered filling up on potates!Well after all of that food we were pretty stuffed...but this is our Valentine's Day dinner! We needed to end with something sweet! So we ordered desserts.I got the Walnut Crème Brulee with caramelized bananasWow- what a totally new spin on a Crème Brulee! The top was lightly dusted with powdered sugar and although it was mostly bananas it still maintained that classic crisp sugary top. The walnuts really took a back seat here flavor wise but that was alright with me. I love caramelized bananas!!!Mr. T got the S'more Bread Pudding. This was a chocolate marshmallow bread pudding covered in caramel sauce, graham cracker and vanilla gelato. This was a little too rich for me. The bread pudding itself was REALLY Chocolaty. I think if it had a little more marshmallow flavor it would be more balanced. The vanilla gelato however was great!We ended our meal very happy and content. When the bill arrived we wondered aloud once again why we don't come here more often. That fantastic meal was a pretty reasonable one as well. Giorgio's is one of those true gems one is lucky to have in their neighborhood. It's good to know they are still making such wonderful food and my return visit won't take as long next timeGiorgio's Of Gramercy Website

It was such a cold and windy day on Saturday I really felt like just curling up somewhere with a nice warm drink. I had been wanting to try out Saint Ambrous because I heard their coffe was excellent. On the way there it got so cold though that we decided to make a change and headed to Caffe Dante which was closer.Caffe Dante is an Italian Coffee Shop that has been around since 1912. They serve food as well but I've never eaten a meal there. The place itself is cute and cozy though.We sat down and ordered up a couple of drinks to warm ourselves up a bit. I got the Cappaccino Dante.The Cappaccino Dante is basically cappaccino topped with a dusting of cinnamon and cocoa.It was really creamy and oh so delicious. Caffe Dante really knows how to make a good cappaccinno. Mr T had a double espresso which was also pretty good. No where near the Fika goodness but pretty darn good.Caffe Dante has tons of delicious looking pasteries like cannolis, eclairs, tiramasu...Just tons of Italian desserts. I'm trying to cut down on the number of sweets I eat a day so I decided just to go for two mini cookies rather than a huge piece of cake (which I really wanted). The pink cookie was cherry and really quite nice. The second I thought was just an M&M butter cookie but it had the flavor of anise. I hate anise!! I don't know why people have to throw this in and ruin a perfectly good cookie.Apparently this place is a big tourist spot because right as we were finishing our drinks a bus load of British teenagers filed into the place. And I'm not exaggerating-it really was a busload. There must have been 30-35 teens!It was a little overwhelming! Luckily we were finished so we grabbed our check and left. Caffe Dante's a great spot for a quick pick me up on a cold day.

I was dying for some more delicious caffeinated beverages the other day so we grabbed the train uptown to go to Fika. We actually stopped off on the way at the New York Public Library just to walk around and were surprised to see a really great exhibit on Jack Kerouac. We were delighted to have found such a great thing to do on a Saturday that didn't involve any money so....we decided to go out to dinner!!!That's just the way we roll :)After Fika we walked down into the Times Square area and headed towards Sake Bar Hagi. We had tried to go here once before and there were no tables. This time we showed up at 5:45, 15 minutes after they had opened, and scored the last table. 5:45...Who eats at that hour? And this place is packed!!! Even though this is in Times Square it is NOT a tourist destination. Hagi is a basement itzakaya barely visable from the street above. When Mr. T & I entered we were one of the only people inside who weren't Japanese.That's a very good sign when you're looking for some good eats.We sat down and ordered some Kirin Light, shochu and a bunch of dishes. The point of an itzakaya is to relax and take things slow, so it was about 20 minutes later when our first items started to arrive.First up was one of the specials a Duck Yakitori Skewer.Mmm Mmm... Fatty greasy goodness! The duck was really moist but also had a great smoky taste to it. I was about to order a couple more when Mr. T reminded me that this was only our first dish and I should probably wait for our others to see if I could eat more....(some times he has good ideas)Next up was another special the Yellowtail SashimiThis was pretty good. I was kind of expecting to be blown away by the sashimi like I was at Aburiya Kinnosuke but this was just your average good fish...Good but not melty transcendence.Next we tried out the Yellowtail Collar.I was really excited about this but because I heard the collar was awesome but this was kind of disappointing. First of all it was really fishy tasting and then there was tons of meat! I thought the collar was supposed to have very little meat and that's why it was so good and interesting tasting...I'll have to try and get it at Aburiya again and see what it's all about.Next up was the Grilled Fatty Pork.This was pretty good. The pork was a tad overcooked making it a little tough but the flavor was nice. My favorite dish of the night was next the Sea Eel Tempura.The eel was only slightly battered so it was light and crispy. The best part was the salt they served with it on the side that tasted like yuzu. Wow! I could have eaten a couple plates of this stuff!So at this point I was feeling a little bad about eating so many salty, fatty and fried foods so we ordered a salad to end on. The Bacon and Spinach Salad to be exact.Holy Cats!!! This was the fattiest thing of the night. I think what they did was fry up a bunch of REALLY fatty bacon in a pan, throw some spinach in a bowl and then pour the fried bacon and ALL of the grease in the pan over the salad as a dressing.I mean this was literally dripping with liquid fat. I have to say it was disgusting...The one big bust of the night. Before I headed out I stopped off in the Ladies and saw this sign posted. I thought it was so funny I took a picture:Kind of cute and comical.So overall I liked Sake Bar Hagi. We decided next time we needed to order some different stuff because the people around us were eating some dishes that looked amazing!!! One of the best parts about Hagi is that it's cheap. You can try out tons of food without breaking the bank.If you're going to come to Hagi- come early. By the time we left it was a little after 7:00 and there were at least 15 people waiting on the stairs for a seat. This is a pretty popular place.

It was a cold and wonderfully snowy Tuesday and I loved every minute of it! We haven't had any snow this year and I always love the first big one.I walked home from work and decided we needed to go out to a cozy Irish bar for dinner and to watch the snow fall. We didn't want to go far so we decided to head over to Fitzgerald's. Fitzgerald's is just a local pub with the classic dart board and mega-touch machine. The one thing I love about it though is the windows up front. You can sit and just stare outside at the goings on of the world and that's exactly what I was looking for. We grabbed a seat and had a couple beers before we decided to order. We both went for the Fitzgerald Burger.The Fitzgerald burger is basically a ground chuck burger topped with cheddar cheese on a sesame seed bun. Classic toppings and a side of fries make the meal complete.The burger is pretty big- about 10 ounces and I couldn't even finish it. It was cooked perfectly medium-rare and for $6.25 was quite a bargain.Unfortunately Mr. T's Happy Hour Guinness was also $6.25. Not exactly a great deal for a Tuesday night out but the bartender was friendly and he ended up giving us the last drink on the house. You really can't ask for more than that. A good place to have in the neighborhood when you're looking for some pub grub.

So....THE GIANTS WON THE SUPER BOWL!!!!Holy cow! Who saw that coming! One of the best Super Bowl victories of all time and the Giants are the ones that pulled it off. Mr Trekker is a HUGE Giants fan. So when Eli threw that bullet into the end zone we were going crazy!!! I woke up the next morning with half blurred memories of drinking way too many beers and some kind of weird blue shots chanting \"Eli\" \"Eli\"!Now normally after a night like that I would be done for the entire day. I had pro-actively taken the day off of work ahead of time just because I knew I wouldn't be feeling too well after such a big game. But you know what- I woke up feeling great!I literally bounded out of bed with the adrenaline from such an amazing victory still pumping through my blood. I wanted to continue the celebration but had no idea what to do. Mr T was on the couch dedicated to watching sports highlights all day but I needed to get out. I decided to call up Mr. T's sister, who works from home, to see if she wanted to go check out one of the amazing lunch deals I'd heard about around the city. Minutes later I was out the door and headed down to Perry Street to meet up with Kate.Perry Street is located way over on the West Side Highway inside the bottom of one of the glass Richard Meirer buildings. I walked inside and was surprised to see it quite deserted. There was a table of two ladies, one group of five and a table of two men and that's about it. I was the first one to arrive so once the waiter sat me at the table I had a chance to look around the placeThe space itself is very calming with white hues and lots of open spaces. Very minimalist in terms of decor. They had a couple of round banquets that would be great for big groups and windows lined each wall.The waitress brought me the menu and the first thing I noticed was the wine specials on the left hand side. They had a Pinot Blanc, a Torrontes and a Cotes du Rhone listed for $5 a glass! Now I'm not one to have a glass of wine at 2:00 on a Monday but at these prices I felt I had to! Also I was still celebrating the Giants so I figure that was a great excuse. I ordered a glass of the Pinot Blanc and then Kate arrived. Once she looked at the menu, she agreed with the wine price and decided to try a glass of the Cote Du Rhone and we placed our food order. At Perry Street you pick 2 courses from the list and a dessert for $24. What a bargain!! This might be the best deal in the city!We were just starting to rehash the events of the night before when the bread arrived.They gave us each a roll and we dug in.The bread had a nice soft center and slightly sweet taste. It wasn't particularly special but it was a good start to the meal with our wine.Then the waiter brought each of us out an amuse bouche.This was a celery root and cranberry soup. As you can see it was very pretty to look at with a beautiful rose shade.The soup itself was very good. It had a thick, almost velvety texture to it. I had a celery root soup amuse bouche at Jean George proper and hated it- this was much much better.Then our first courses arrived. I had ordered the Spinach and Goat Cheese Omelet with Shoestring Potatoes. I have to say it didn't look very appetizing when it arrived but then I cut inside.The egg itself was okay...I think it could have been a little fluffier with a better egg to cheese and spinach ratio but it was pretty good. The shoestring potatoes were nice and crispy and a perfect complement to the omelet.Kate had ordered the Peekytoe Crab Salad with Honey Crisp Apples and Fall Vegetables.This dish was much more appetizing to look at when it arrived but unfortunately it did not deliver. There were just too many flavors going on. I had a bite of the crab and hardly tasted it. Instead the entire dish was overwhelmed by an overall tart flavor. So we were a little disappointed with Kate's dish but had high hopes for our second courses.I ordered the Pan Roasted Chicken Sandwich with speck, arugula & fontina cheese.I thought this was really good! The top half of the bread was layered with a roasted red pepper puree and the bottom of the bread had what tasted like an olive tapenade. The layer of Speck gave everything a slightly salty taste. I ended up taking a little bit of the red pepper spread off since there was so much but overall I really like my dish.It came with a side of homemade potato chips which I honestly only had one of- they were quite boring and I never felt the need to go back for more.You know the Lays slogan \"Bet you can't eat just one?\" Well here I could! Kate ordered the Grilled Beef Hanger Steak with Herbal Spinach and Liquid Gruyere.Unfortunately this dish completely bombed. The steak itself was so tough it was almost rubbery. The spinach and cheese had a flavor of jalapenos that completely overpowered everything. Not only that but the whole cheese thing was totally unappetizing.At one point Kate said \"They really treated my steak like a fondue party gone wrong.\"I thought that pretty much summed the dish up perfectly! At this point we had ordered another glass of wine and were feeling the effects more than usual since it was so early in the day and ended up laughing about how bad the dish was for a while.I felt kind of bad that Kate was 0-2 at this point but luckily our desserts fared much better.They had given us a choice of white chocolate dessert or dark. I chose the white chocolate and it was excellent!!There were balls of white choclate mousse sandwiched between two layers of meringue and topped with a scoop of yuzu ice cream.This was light and refreshing! I was so full but I ended up eating the whole thing!Kate ordered the Dark Chocolate Pudding.She also loved her dessert but couldn't come close to finishing it because it was so rich.So in the end my meal was pretty good but Kate's was less than stellar. She even said she never come back.When we looked back on the food, especially Kate's, there were just too many things going on. We both felt a little like we were eating at a southwest Bobby Flay type restaurant rather than a Jean George establishment. I think I'm going to give this place another try in a couple months. With the $24 price tag I really want to like the place! Oh well- at least we both enjoyed the cheap wine! Yey Giants!!!!Perry Street Website

Seymour Burton- Does It Get Better Than a Burger Fried in Butter?

We were hanging out in the LES this past Saturday having some drinks at Marshall Stack when I got a huge burger craving. And not just any old burger - I wanted a good gourmet style burger. I remebered hearing about a new place Seymour Burton opening up so we decided to head over and see if we could grab a table. From the outside Seymour Burton struck me as odd looking. It's on sleepy East 5th street which houses Sophie's and Lavagna. For some reason the outside didn't seem to fit on that block. It was a little too bright and sterile looking. Once I went inside though the place felt much better.We were greeted at the door by the chef. Now this has never happened before. We asked for a table for 2 and got the last one available. They had a large communal table that ran down the center of the room that was open but reserved for a private party.The place itself was nice. They made good use of the amount of space avaiable. Besides the communal middle there were tables on either side, and the back was the open kitchen. I always love an open kitchen It just makes it more exciting.The walls were painted red and kind of worn looking. Not in bad way! The whole place felt lived-in. It was kind of cozy. Unfortunately though I had an extremly wobbly chair and the whole meal I was kind of afraid that it would collapse at any moment. Luckily it didn't but that's something they should fix.There are no printed menus here. Everything from food to drinks is written on the Chalkboard aganist the wall.The first thing I noticed was the beer selection. Every beer except Pork Slap was from the Ommegang brewery. Ommegang makes all Belgain style beers which Mr. T & I love so we were really excited. Unfortunatly I had already had a bunch a \"big\" beers at Mashall Stack so I needed to put some food in me before having another one so I just ordered a Pork Slap while Mr. T got the Witte Beer. There were wine glasses on all of the tables and when the waitress came over with our drinks she asked if I wanted my Pork Slap in the wine glass! I thought this was really funny! So I said sure- why not! And I have to tell you it was pretty damn good in that wine glass.Well anyway, we were both starving so we decided to start with an order of Latkes and then get the burger and macaroni & cheese for our mains to share.We placed our order and they brought over some bread and this. This is hummus and olive oil together. Pretty untraditional but pretty awesome!Then out came our Latkes.These were enourmous. I was not expecting them to be so thick. Somehow the entire Latke stayed really crispy even though it was so large. I thought these were pretty good. I still enjoy Zum Schneider style of Potato Pancake the best but I would give these a close second.Once we finished the latkes we were pretty full. As I said they were huge! But we still had tons more food coming. Offdah..Luckily we decided to split the rest.The Macaroni and cheese was a generous portion of elbow Macaroni topped with three different cheeses and breadcrumbs. The cheese was nice in that it kept some of it's stringyness so that when you pulled your fork away some would linger on the bowl. Th best thing of the night though has to be the burger.It came topped with Vermont White Cheddar cheese and raw onions atop a huge English Muffin. The juices were already starting to stream out onto the muffin before I even bite into it. This was super juicy and amazing!!!The meat had that great salty char that every burger should have but rarely does. The chef came around and I asked him what kind of meat he used. He said it was 50% chuck and 50% brisket which is formed and then fried in butter.Butter. Something about the way he said it just made it seem so bad. But hey a burger isn't healthy anyway so why not go all out! Yum!!! I was in love.It came with a huge pile of fries that were similar to the fries I get at a local takeout cheesesteak place Ziggiz. The small ones were nice and crispy while the bigger ones were kind of limp. They were decent but could have been a little more uniform. All in all though a great burger.We were so full we couldn't even come close to finishing the mac & cheese or the fries. We decided next time to either just get the Latkaes or just the burger. Both is way to much. The bill came and we were happy with the prices. Quite an affordable place. The chef came over again before we left to make sure we liked everythng. I thought this was nice and he seemed to have a friendly rapport with our waitress which is always nice to see as well.Seymour Burton is a great addition to the neighborhood. We will be back- maybe sooned than later. That burger is calling my name!!Seymour Burton Website

Roze-What's up hun? How you been? Thanks for the comments.I read about Seymour Burton the other day from the New York Times' Frank Bruni who said this burger approaches greateness. Here's the link:http://events.nytimes.com/2008/01/09/dining/reviews/09unde.html?ref=diningThanks for the comment. Ziggiz Rocks. Those fries from Burton look money too. Look forward to seeing more reviews from you. I commented to you on my site and left you an interesting question. A bit of a challenge. check it out.NYC FOOD GUY

Roze-Thanks for the response. As far as waffle fries go, I've never experienced them in any way shape or form except the frozen variety at places like Big Nick's. It would be pretty killer if someone whipped up some fresh ones, huh?I like your selection of fries, they're quite diverse. Les Halles' were delicious. I had them a few weeks back and I have to agree, being packed in like sardines takes away from the experience a bit, but the food was great.My top 5 fries1) Houston's - potatoey shoestrings, well spiced and delicious2) Ziggiz - you know the deal hear, thin, double-fried, amazing3) Burger Joint - as close to satisfying that McDonald's desire without eating McDonalds4) Kensington Kosher Deli - well done steak fries (great neck, ny)5) Shake Shack crinkle cut - well salted and delicious

Mr. Treker's parents had reservation for dinner at Craft last Thursday and invited us to join them. We always love going out with his folks and had been doing pretty well on our budget so we decided to tag-along. First of all, I have to say that while I have always been interested in trying out Craft, it has never been on the top of my list. Why? Well I have heard so many mixed reviews about this place over the years. There are people on the blogs like Chowhound, Yelp etc. that absolutely hate it. On the other hand, there are also people on those same blogs that sing it's praises-even calling it the best restaurant they've ever been to!I guess I was just always scared to take the chance that I might be one of those \"haters\". Working for a non-profit agency I'm not exactly raking in the big bucks! Part of the reason I started reading blogs was so I wouldn't be disppointed spending the little cash I had on a bad meal. Well anyways- when Thursday night came I was honestly just excited to be spending some quality time with family out of the apartment. Budgets are good like that! They remind you what's really important in life! Okay- enough preaching- back to the place.The first thing you notice upon walking into Craft is the beautiful lights hanging from the ceiling and the walls. I wouldn't call the layout romantic, I would describe it as comforting. The hostess sat us down at a huge wooden table. I really loved the whole feel of the place. It was rustic and sophisticated at the same time. The waiter came over and described the menu to us in detail. It's split up into first course, main course and sides. To me it sounded just like every other restaurant, but it's really not at all. I'll explain why a little later on.The first thing to arrive at our table was the bread.I tried a peice of the whole wheat bread and it was quite tasty but nothing special. As I was contemplating trying out the white bread they brought over an amuse bouche for everyone.This was a rock shrimp with olive oil and a little sprig of carrot and parsly on top. The olive oil was wonderful..... Again the amuse itself wasn't anything phenomanal but it was a solid start.We were all kind of settling in and really enjoying the warmth of the place when our first courses arrived. At Craft all of the dishes are put in the middle of the table and everyone shares family style.The first thing I tried? For some reason I went for the Foie Gras.Now I know I don't like Foie Gras. It's just too rich for me but I still try the different variations everywhere we go. I took a bite with some of the sauce and was really surpised. Rather than the overly rich taste I usually hate- It was actually quite smooth. The sauce really balanced out the flavor. Our waiter told us the sauce was actually just some Golden Raisins. Wow! Probably my favorite spin on a Foie Gras dish.This is the Wagyu Carpaccio with Honshimeji. Honshimeji are tiny little Asian mushrooms that were atop the meat along with some arugula salad and some oil. I loved this dish!! Wagyu meat is so good on it's own it doesn't need anything fancy to go with it. The tiny mushrooms and salad really just enhanced the flavor and texture of the meat.I had actually ordered the Quail as my first course for the table and it was also very good. I think the Quail at Irving Mill had a slighly better char to the outside which I enjoyed but this was well prepared and very tasty.The last course we got were the Sweetbreads whch didn't come out in the picture. OMG though- they were really really good!! I never thought I liked sweetbreads but here they had so much flavor...and the portion was huge!! These were a big hit!I ordered another glass of wine and our sides and entrees started to arrive. Heres our tubular pillows of cheese the Gnocchi.The Diver Scallops were enourmous and had a great crunch on the outside. I think they were finished off with a little melted butter and that's about it. Fantastic!The Chathom Cod was grilled and came with a lemon butter sauce on the side. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce really helped to enhance the dish.This is just a big old pot of braised short ribs. We actually ordered two so they just brought out this huge thing. If there is a better example of a perfect wintery comfort food dish- I don't know what it is. Tender beef and veggies in a sweet, brown sugar sauce. Sweet & Savory at the same time...Yum! One of the best I've had to date. Plate of Multiple Food ItemsOne of the greatest things about the meal though came in the form of our other sides. The duck confit and the Jerusalum Artichokes were both amazing. What are Jerusalum Artichokes? Don't ask just order!!I was so full yet I kept going back to those damn artichokes.When I finally put down my fork from all the great food our plates were whisked away and we were each given a Meyer Lemon spritzer as a palate cleanser. Now I was ready to burst about 2 minutes before but for some reason that spritzer perked me right back up. So we decided to get one more round and some dessert.I ordered a fantastic glass of Cabernet while the rest of the group got some port. There were a lot of great looking desserts on the menu it was hard to chose. In the end though I think I chose the winner.I got the Toffe Steamed Pudding with a side of Coffee Crunch ice cream. The bread pudding came out more like a souffle and was pretty light for a usually heavy dish. It came with a side of toffee sauce and creme fraiche. I hate creme frachie but the ice cream I ordered more than balanced out the dish!Wow this dessert was awesome. The ice cream was rich and creamy with chunks of coffee mixed in. It tasted like it was homemade. Next time I think I would get their ice cream sampler to check out all of the other flavors.At this point I really was ready to burst. They brought out some dark chocolate and peanut butter candies for the end and I could barely finish one tiny peice (although I did). With the check they brought out a muffin for you to take home for your breakfast the next morning just like Gramercy Tavern & Eleven Madison do.I've always thought this was such a nice touch and a good marketing tool as well. When you wake up in the morning you're immediately reminded of the great meal you had. Chances are you'll enjoy your breakfast and go to work happy and excited to tell co-workers about your meal! Well breakfast in the morning was delicious. The entire muffin was surprisingly moist and tasted like it had just been baked.So to sum it all up, I really enjoyed my experience at Craft. First of all, our waiter was always available to answer any questions we had and accomodate our last minute changes BUT he wasn't intrusive. Sometimes I feel that the wait staff are hovering over my table and it's really off-putting. Here the staff seemed as relaxed as we were and things just flowed smoothly.The food as I described was spectacular. Each dish was delicious and executed perfectly. I understand the concept now in a better way. Many times I think the sides make a dish good. Here each main ingredient really stands on its own. The Jerusalum Artichokes were all about artichokes not helping out a fish dish. The butter on the Scallops was only about enhancing the natural flavor of the Scallop. It's all very complicated in it's simple little way.Anyway I am so happy to have gone to Craft and am now even more excited to use our CraftSteak gift certificate than I was before. I can't wait to see what they can do with a huge cut of beef!!Great food, Relaxing Atmosphere, Attentive Service and Fabulous people to share it with- quite possibly a perfect meal!Hey- I guess I'm one of the Craft lovers!

I was so excited when I heard Five Guys Burgers was opening in Brooklyn Heights right near one of the offices I work at. They had an opening date that kept getting pushed back and pushed back until I thought it was never going to open! But then it finally did and luckily I was there on opening day.Since then Five Guys is my lunch treat. I generally try to eat a healthy breakfast and lunch during the week to make up for all the other crap I put in body the rest of the time. But Five Guys is so good I have to make allowances for it once in a while.So what's so good about Five Guys? Well here's a picture of my burger just after opening it back in my office. Looks kind of squashed and sorry huh. It has a nice soft bun and a good flavor to the meat but what I think makes the burger truly is the toppings.Five Guys offers either a Little Cheeseburger (which this is) which is one beef patty or a Regular Cheeseburger which is two beef patties. Then they offer all these topping for free: mayo, lettuce, onions, ketchup, tomatoes, pickles, fried onions, sauteed mushrooms, mustard, jalapeno peppers, green peppers, A1 Sauce, BBQ sauce & Hot Sauce!That's a lot of toppings! I get mine with the standard mayo, lettuce tomatoes, ketchup, pickles and fried onions. It's a whole lotta flavor packed into a little burger. The other thing that makes Five Guys so great are the fries. They are a bit bigger than McDonald's but with a better crunch and lots of salt. Never order anything bigger than a small fry if you go. They easily give you enough for about 3 people!!I heard one of these opened up in Midtown and is swamped. Luckily in Brooklyn Heights I can just call my order in and then walk over to pick it up in about a minute. This is no Shack burger, don't get me wrong, but it's pretty fricken good!Five Guys Website

So winter is the time for comforting food and I don't know anything more comforting than soup dumplings. We've been on somewhat of a tear of trying different places out and this Monday was no different.We woke up- happy from the Giants win and happy with a day off of work. So we decided to head down to Chinatown and fill our bellies with some yummy soup dumplings.It was freezing outside so we decided to go some place closer to the subway than Joe Shanghai so we didn't have to be outside so much. We headed towards Shanghai Cafe.Shanghai Cafe was really different inside than I thought it would be. It reminded of a place trapped in the 80's. Remember when you went to get your school picture taken when you were younger and they all the cool kids got the laser background?! For some reason that's what I thought of when I walked in here. If that gives you any indication of the decor!It was about 1:30 and the place was packed. We had to wait about 5 minutes but scored the back table.We put in our order and within minutes out first plate arrived. The Soup dumplings!!As you can see these are bigger than the ones we had at Yeah Shanghai. These are a different style. At Yeah we got plain pork. Here we went for the crab and pork dumpling. Picking this thing up you could tell it was pretty hefty. I was so excited to take a bite!Look at all of the crab and pork inside. These dumpling were jam packed and bursting with flavor! The soup itself was wonderful and we both agreed these were much better than Yeah'sThen we got our pork over rice.I really didn't like this that much. There was little pork and tons of rice. I like my pork to be more of the style of NY Noodletown's pork. I know that's a different style and I seem to prefer it. This takes the place of Yeah Shanghai for us as far as soup dumplings is concerned. We're checking out others though..this search is to be continued....

On the way back from Chinatown lunch the other day we swung by Ferrara to pick up some little desserts for later that night.Ferrara bills itself as America's first espresso bar which is funny because Ive never had an espreso there. I always just seem to stop in because they have wonderul Italian pasteries that you can buy mini-sized. That way you can try a little of everything!They have tons of cookies, bars and even mini wedding cakes along the display! Mr T and I just decided to garb some to go and eat at home later.The Cream Puff was filled with French style custard cream. The cream was good but I thought it could have been a little richer.Sfogliatella- this is the Clam shaped pastry. It's flaky and filled with ricotta, farina and fruit. This was rings of crunchiness that unfortunately didn't have much else going on. I wouldn't get it again.The piece de Resistance!! The Napolean- I have tried Napoleon's all over the city and this is one of the best I have ever had. It was Bavarian cream filled Pan'di Spagna. The Pan'di Spagna was fluffy and light so the cream and icing were the center of the show. So Good!! Going back to get another one this weekend.Cannoli- this was you classic crispy mini tube filled with ricotta cream & chocolate chip. Italian Perfection.

Since we had just started our budget we passed on going to watch the football games at a bar and just got some beers and watched them at home this weekend.If your a Giants fan you know that this past Sunday was a great day for football. Eli Manning came out and got a huge win to send them into the Superbowl! Mr. T is a huge Giant's fan so we were jumping up and down in celebration. We were obviously several beers in by the time they won and a budget didn't seem so important anymore at that point :)So we decided to go out and celebrate! We jumped in a cab down to McSorley's and had a LOT of these.McSorley's was great. It was exactly the kind of crowd we wanted after such a crazy game like that- drunk and rowdy! We had a couple rounds and stayed out later than I have in ages! With all the drinking going on we kind of forgot about food all day. We were all set to grab a cab down to NY Noodletown for some grub when we remembered we were right near possibly the best drunk food in the world- Poutine.Poutine originated in Canada and it basically became my favorite drunk food when I turned 19. My friends and I would go across the border to go drinking and then stop at Burger King before heading back to the US. Poutine was always on the menu and one drunken night I decided to try it out. This proved to be a life changing event. The warm gravy and melty cheese on top of those salty crisp fries was amazing!! We started to look forward to the poutine more than the beers every time we went I think.I don't understand why the Burger Kings here won't add it to the menu! One of my friends wrote a letter asking them but never got a response:(Well luckily I moved to New York where there is one place that has it- Pomme Frites.So when we found ourselves literally half a block away we raced over and grabbed an order. Look at this masterpiece:The photos are a little blurry (I wasn't exactly seeing to well at this point) but I think you can see why this is the best drunk food in the world.My college friend loved Poutine so much she would make it at home when she had too much to drink :) It's really that good! So if you find yourself in the East Village and \"feeling no pain\" as my mother would say, Pomme Frites will be your savior.Pomme Frites Website

I decided to schedule a hair cut appointment for this Satudray since I knew Mr. T had to work most of the afternoon. I always get my hair cut on a weekeday and am usually so exhausted from work I just go right home after. My hair cut place is uptown around 54th street, so when I got done Saturday about 1:30 I decided to walk around uptown for a little while since I never do that anymore. If you named just about any place below 23rd street I could tell you exactly where it is....Uptown not so much. I never spend time wandering here. So I was pretty excited. I was feeling like a good cup of coffee to start out my day so I headed over to a place I had heard about last year called Fika.Fika (prononced fee ka)bills itself as a Swedish espresso bar that's also kown for it's chocolates. Look you can almost see me in the reflection :) Fika is quite small with only about 3 tables and a short bar to sit at. I walked in and took a look at their pasteries.I wasn't feeling chocolate for some reason so I decided to order a vanilla cookie and a single Macchiato.Now Mr. T and I just started a very strict budget so we can save money to actually pay off some of our debts so I was pretty happy when I was told the bill $3.25. That's pretty good! The cookie was only a dollar! Not too sabby for nyc.So I happily grabbed a stool at the bar and sat down to enjoy my wares.Now I haave to say that I do not know that much about coffee. Some people are really into where the beans are from, how they grinded, etc. Me? I just know what tastes good.My favorite coffee place in the city is 9th Street Espresso. We usually end up in one of their locations every weekend. If were going to the East Village we first head over the Avenue C for an espresso or if were in the West Viallge our first stop is usually Chelsea Market for a spot. So I was shocked when I took a sip of my Macchiato.Why was I shocked? Because it was so AMAZING!!! I couldn't believe it! It was a little lighter than 9th street's but so perfectly balanced. I think I drank it in about 10 seconds. I feel kind of bad because I love 9th street so much but man...Fika stole my heart!Then I tried out my cookie. The barista told me that it was very light for a cookie. I picked it up and it started to crumble...Oh no I thought. It's just really dry, but then I took a bite.Wow! It was really light! Look at the airy holes inside.It was kind of a cross between a cookie and a merengue. I was extremly happy with my choices! I sat at the counter grinning and just watching the city go by as I enjoyed my treats.I had such a nice time at Fika I decided to stay uptown for a little bit and walk around. I hadn't been up here in years so what the heck. I left Fika and headed west.As I was walking down 7th avenue I saw all of these people standing in a line. I couldn't figure out what they were waiting for until I looked up and saw the sign. Carnegie Deli!How funny I thought! I didn't know people actually stood in line for that place. I felt like a true tourist. I decided to enjoy it and see what other \"touristy\" things I could find when I stumbled actoss this place.See what it's called? The New York City Irish Bar. I couldn't help but laugh. This was right outside of Times Square in the middle of tourist central. I couldn't help but wonder how many poor Irish tourist had been drawn into that place and probably charged about $9 for a Guiness. The city can be mean like that sometimes.Then as I walking out of Times Square I saw this placeSince when did Juan Valdez open up a coffee shop in New York!!Well I really was enjoying my time walking around but Mr. T called and said he was done with work and hungry. So I decide to head downtown to meet him for some food and drinks. We met up and headed over the Crif Dogs since he had never had their hot dogs before and we figured it fit into our budget. We got there and the first thing I noticed is that they don't sell beer anymore! What's up with that? A hot dog and a Pabst's Blue Ribbon is what defined this place! Oh well- we placed our order and took a seat. Now since Mr. T never tried this place before we went for 2 plain Crif dogs so he could try the original. Now usually this doesn't take longer than about 5 minutes but for some reason it took almost 20 minutes for our dogs! The place wasn't even crowded! Strike Two in my book. Well the dog itself was awesome as usual at least. It has such a different flavor than a Gray's Papya or regular ballpark frank because it's fried. And at $2 a pop it's quite the bargain.After Crif Dogs we decided to continue our journey of staying on a budget by hittng up some 2 for 1 bars. We started at the Continental, then went to the Library Bar and finally ened up at Essex Street Ale House. We did pretty well for ourselves on a small budget!After all those beers we needed some more food so we swung by Snack Dragon Tacos on the way home. Snack Dragon used to be just a taco stand on the side of the street. Now it actually has it's own space with a little counter on the inside you can eat at.I was starving so I ordered 2 tacos- the fish and the steak.Here's the Steak:The steak itself was really good. It had defiently been slow cooked for a while in some great spices. The cheese and sauce were good as well. I didn't really care for the tortilla itself though. I prefer a hard shell taco.Then I tried the fish:The fish itself was sole and I really didn't care for it. It tasted a little too...well fishy. I loved the cabbage that it came with though and ended up putting that on my steak taco instead.Then we splurged and took a cab home. Still though..quite a cheap day for us!Fika Espresso BarCrif Dogs

So I looked all over for the Sam Adams Utopias 2007 and actually gave Whole Foods my number back in December telling them to reserve me one if they got some in. They called about 3 weeks later and said they had one- YEY!!! And that it would be $179!! Um...Not so yey.I can't afford that! The 2002 was only around $100. I was shocked and decided that even though I really wanted to try it I just didn't have the funds. I was a little upset but I moved on...until last week when something caught my eye. We were looking for a place to watch the football games at on Sunday and I was checking various bar websites looking for specials. As I was checking out the Village Pourhouse I saw they were doing a Brewtopia night where you could buy various tastes of beer for $1 a taste. The real thing that caught my eye though was at the very bottom. they would also be selling tastes of Sam Adams Uptopias for $13.I was so excited!! Yes $13 is a lot when you only get around 1 oz of beer but hey-- I needed to try it.So Mr. T and I met up and got our Utpoias first thing.Just in case you don't know, the Sam Adams Utopias isn't just any beer. It's the strongest and most expensive beer in the world weighing in at 27% alcohol. Its actually considered a Barley wine. As you can see from the picture there was absolutely no head whatsoever to the beer.Wow!! When I took a whiff it almost knocked me off my barstool! It smelled like the bottle of Sherry I took out of my parents liquor cabinet when I was a rebellious teenager (that was a BAD hangover)! I mean this smelled strong!!I took a sip and it burned a little at first. Kind of like taking a sip of Brandy. But then something wonderful happened. It really mellowed out. The aftertaste was smooth and a little sweet. Very tasty!! This is the kind of drink you relax and enjoy.I'll admit I think I like the Thomas Hardy's Barley Wine better. I simply enjoy the flavor more, but this was an experience and I'm so happy I got to try it!There were about 50 beers on the menu available for tasting and Mr. T and I realized we had actually already tried them all except for 4 beers. We were pretty impressed with ourselves although their were no Belgians on the menu and some crappy Germans.We tried the four we had never had and then left. The place was getting really packed and we just wanted to go home and get some shut eye before the long weekend. All in all a success!

We stopped in to the new hot spot Allen and Delancey on Saturday night and it was packed! We got there bout 5:45 and had to wait about 10 minutes for a seat at the bar to open up.What a gorgeous space though! I got a chance to look around a little and now I know why people are calling it a romantic place. Candles everywhere and just a cozy feel to the whole place. Unfortunately they were completely booked for the night so we just grabbed a drink. I ordered the Delancey and Mr. T ordered the Allen. Aren't we the yuppies!!!The Delancey is basically prosecco with elderflower syrup and a splash of pomegranate juice. Very pink and girly- a good drink. I am hoping to go back soon and try out some of the food. Neil Fergusen is supposed to be pretty handy in the kitchen.

So Mr. T was dying for some soup dumplings this past weekend so we headed down to Chinatown to indulge. Our first stop was for me though as I was wanting some Bubble Tea. We stopped into Vivi Bubble Tea. This place is a girl's paradise! Everything inside is pink and they play some really poppy Japanese music. The girls behind the counter are just like the store- cute, bright and bubbly. They had tons of flavors and I had trouble deciding what to get. I finally settled on the Chocolate Mochi Bubble Tea.The neatest thing about the tea is the lid. They slap a plastic film on the cup so you just have to poke your straw through like a Capri Sun kind of! The bubble tea was pretty good. Next time I would get a regular black bubble tea to see how it compares to other ones I've had.Next we walked over to Joe's Shanghai but of course there was a line out the door. We didn't feel like waiting so we went back over to Bayard Street and got a table at Yeah Shanghai.The outside is pretty crummy looking but the interior is quite nice.We sat down and ordered some Pork Soup Dumplings and some Tiny Fried Buns. First came the Soup Dumplings.These were piping hot and delicious!!! You have to be careful when you eat these things or you'll get burnt. The trick is to bite off the top and let the steam from the dumpling escape. The you just pop the whole thing in your mouth.It's really crazy how they get so much soup inside a little dumpling. Next came the tiny fried buns. I'm not ure why these are called tiny since they were anything but smalls! They were huge!!! I really liked these. The tops were a little salty and the bottoms were fried crispy.These were basically just a bigger version of the soup dumplings except that the soup got absorbed into the dough of the dumpling.The pork was delicious!!!! Yum!!!! We were so stuffed we had 3 buns left over and couldn't even think about finishing them. Then they brought us the check and I couldn't help but laugh. See what they gave us with it?Hershey's chocolates!!! No fortune cookies or Chinese dessert but Hershey's! Now I love chocolate so it was a nice surprise but I just found it comical. Anyway for $9.50 for everything Yeah Shanghai cannot be beat. I wish I lived closer to Chinatown. I'd be full every night for a lot less money!

Who's Eating All The Donuts?

So Mr. T and I had an excellent day yesterday traveling around Chinatown and the Lower East Side basically just getting different culinary treats which I'll post about later, but one of our big stops was to Doughnut Plant. Actually here's what happened.Friday night we came up with a plan to go to Chinatown and wander around and get some soup dumplings. I woke up Saturday morning and while Mr. T was getting ready I decided to see what was on TV. Saturday morning TV is pretty bad and the only 2 channels I usually check out are the Food Network (for obvious reason) and the Travel Channel (in hopes they will do something about food). Luckily for me they were! They had an entire show dedicated to doughnuts! I watched eagerly waiting to see if they would go to Doughnut Plant and of course they did!!! After watching all of that I knew we had to get some.So after Chinatown we wandered over to the store. It seems a lot of people watched that show because there was bigger line than usual waiting for donuts. We had to wait about 10 minutes before we got to order and once we were there I realized in horror that they were out of my favorite kind! The Tres Leches!!!I was upset but that didn't stop me from ordering something else- so I went for the 2 new kinds they were promoting the Gingerbread and the Pistachio.Once we were out the door we dug in! Here's the Gingerbread:This was exactly what I expected. A great gingerbread flavor with a huge amount of icing. No Tres Leches but really good!The Pistachio was really good as well but a little bit weak. I thought there would be a stronger pistachio flavor to it but it was a little bland.Anyways I was happy but not quite fulfilled. And when Im not fulfilled I just can't stop.I woke up this morning at 8:00 sharp with doughnuts on my mind. I NEEDED a Tres Leches!!! I couldn't stop thinking about it! Now Doughnut Plant is quite a ways away from my apartment and I did have some things to do before all of the football games were going to start so I checked the Doughnut Plant's website to see where else their doughnuts are carried. I saw that Dean & Deluca and Joe's Coffee both have them. Since these 2 places are only about 15 blocks away I decided to head out. My first stop was Dean & Deluca. They had the Pistachio, Vanilla Bean, Chocolate Blackout and regular Glazed. No Tres Leches! So I walked over to Joe's. I was excited when I looked in Joe's case- it looked like there was one Tres Leches left! I ordered a coffee and asked about the doughnut. \"Oh that? That's the new Meyer Lemon flavor\". Doh!!So what did I do? I got it. Yes that is the Meyer Lemon and it is quite tasty. No Tres Leches, but quite tasty.So my question is- who's eating all the doughnuts? I am in dire need of some!!! Doughnut Plant

In case you haven't noticed it yet I really like my burgers. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a good pub burger like you can get at Molly's or sometimes the fast foodie but charbroiled Shake Shack spectacular, or even the gourmet burger like at the Spotted pig. All of these hold a special place in my heart but all are very different from each other. One thing they all do have in common though is that there's usually a wait to get one.But there's one place I can always go to and get just what I feel is a regular old great cheeseburger with no waiting in line (Shake Shake, Spotted Pig), no pushy tourists bumping into me (Spotted Pig) and some good tunes on the jukebox (sorry Molly's). And this place is the Stoned Crow.The Stoned Crow is a basement bar near Washington Square Park where I love to just relax, drink some beers and listen to some good music. They have movie and music posters all over the walls and usually a good neighbourhood kind of crowd. But why am I talking about this again on my food blog? Oh yeah- the burgers!!!The chef at the Stoned Crow is the former chef at Corner Bistro. So all those great burgers they were talking about there years ago have found a new home here. And my they are mighty good.Here's a picture of mine:I love how they serve it openfaced so you can decide what condiments you want on top without having to deal with taking off onions covered in cheese, etc. It's a good size- 8 ozs I believe and always cooked to order perfectly. It doesn't come with fries but you can order a side for $4 and you get a huge basket that could easily feed 3 people.So why are you over at Corner Bistro waiting in line again? The grass is greener over here!Stoned Crow Website

We took a trip up to Albany last week to visit Mr. T's relatives for some post-holiday celebrations. Mr T's aunt isn't a real gourmet chef or anything but her food tastes like it is! She always cooks such amazing food we felt that we needed to bring something amazing to complement it.I read about this new little dessert place that sold Macarons on one of my favorite blogs and I decided that just might be the dessert to make the meal.Madeline's is a cute little coffee and pastry place on 23rd street. We got inside and realized there were over 25 flavors of macarons to choose from!! We told the women behind the counter we were going to order a bunch and she took out these cute little boxes. We were a little overwhelmed and just started ordering.So what did we end up getting? Well I think in here there's Strawberry, Toasted Almond, Praline & White Russian.In this box there's Blueberry Raspberry, Port Wine, Lemon, Chocolate and Vanilla.They were all so delicate on the outside and chewy on the inside it was wonderful. At one point we were cutting them in fours so we could try them all! My favorite of the bunch was the praline. I'm a sucker for any kind of praline, cashew, peanut kind of dessert and this was no disappointment.These macarons look small but one is more than enough for a dessert and at $2.50 a piece they should be.So the macarons were a hit and once again the food was fabulous! What a nice end to the holiday season!

So it was such a beautiful day out today Mr. T and I decided to meet up after work and do some walking around. we actually were planning to buy some groceries at Whole Foods but the line was almost out the door! Seriously! I haven't seen it that crowded since they first opened!Anyway we made a detour and ended up at Maoz Vegetarian to try our their falafels. Now we are NOT anywhere close to being vegetarians. We love our meat but I have to say this was one tasty falafel. They have a fixings bar inside so you can top your pita anyway you like it, carrots, coleslaw, tomatoes, etc. Tons of sauces as well. You can also order a falafel salad if your like me and don't really eat the pita.I got the Junior Maoz meal and it was great. The fries were surprisingly good as well which I wasn't expecting. A great new \"fast food\" place.After that we decided to walk over and finally try out the Dessert Truck on University. I was so excited!!! As we are walking down the street I begin to realize I don't see it anywhere ahead. Then I realized that it's closed on Mondays!!! I was so upset. At this point I needed something sweet so we ended up going into the burger joint Stand.We were both pretty stuffed from our falafels but there's always room for ice cream! We order 2 milkshakes to go - one vanilla and one toasted marshmallow.These milkshakes are made with gelato so they have a thicker consistency than your average shake. The vanilla was very good- classic taste. The Toasted Marshmallow was fantastic!!! They actually had a whole marshmallow inside with a brown toasty top. I felt like I was drinking a Smores!!! I actually came home and threw some mini M & M's inside for the end just to really get that Smore's taste!!! So good!!! Now I have to get back to being a little healthier tomorrow to make up for that but it was worth it!!Maoz

I've already said a million times that the Tavern Room at Gramercy tavern is my favorite place in the world. And I've talked about the suckling pig from Eleven Madison Park as being one of the best dishes of 2007. And I've also put Union Square Cafe as one of my \"wish list\" places to go to in 2008. What do all of these places have in common?Danny Meyer- genius restaurateur. All of these places are his and all are fabulous! The one place that I haven't talked about yet though is his smaller, though not lesser known place, the Shack Shake.The Shack Shake is just what is sounds like. A little hut in Madison Square Park that sells burgers, custards, hot dogs and just great stuff. In the summer the line can be over 2 hours long. Lucky for me I only live 1 block away! So whenever it would rain or the weather would be nasty I would run over and grab some food because there would be no line.Well now Danny Meyer has fulfilled my dreams and decided to keep the Shack open all year round!! I drop by now all the time with little to no wait at all. So why is the wait usually so long? The burgers. Now the Shake Shake burgers have been blogged about everywhere to the point of it being ridiculous so I wont say much other than it is one of the best burgers in NYC. Here's the burgers in the box.Close up of the Shake Burger.The Shake burger is a patty with cheese, tomatoes, lettuce and their special shake sauce. It's fantastic!!! But as I said everyone already knows that.What everyone may not know is that they have another sandwich, especially for vegetarians, that is so good it almost rivals the Shake burger! It's the Shroom Burger. Here it is:Kind of unimpressive at first. What makes it so good? Keep looking.Oh yes. what is that inside oozing out? Munster Cheese AND Cheddar cheese!!! It's basically a fried up Portabella Mushroom Burger filled with cheese and topped the same way the Shake Burger is with lettuce, tomato and special sauce. So good it deserves one more close up:)If you haven't been now is the time to check it out. They even put in heat lamps last week!!! And they supposedly have hot vanilla now too!!!Shake Shack

I went back to Roni Sue to pick up some more choclates for some work people and was shocked to learn they were completely out of the peanut butter squares!!I didn't know what to do! This was my last present and I was banking on those squares. I started looking at the various truffles when I saw these squares on the bottom shelf. They looked exciting so I asked about the flavor and found out they were Hazelnut. Then I tried a sample and almost fell over! I think they may be better than the peanut butter. So rich and smooth. I knew I had a winner.As I was waiting for my chocolates to be packaged up I started talking with Roni-Sue and found out that she's coming out with a new line of cocktail chocolates this weekend! She reached behind the counter and handed me a sample of the Manhattan chocolate.Wow- really good. The dark chocolate was strong and bitter at first and then the flavor of boubon slowly seeped in. It was nice because it blended well together- neither one overpowering the other. I can't wait to see what other kinds they make! She mentioned something about a margarita chocolate! Hmmm....

I literally have a list of over 300 bars & restaurants I want to try out in the city. About 1/4 will probably close before I get a chance to go, but those will be replaced by newer and even more exciting places!These are the places that are at the top. And luckily we got gift certificates for Christmas to 3 of them!!! L'Atelier de Joël RobuchonAllen & DelancyCraftSteakMercadito- completed 2/1/08Peter Luger (can't believe I haven't gone yet)Bar MasaBlue Hill at Stone BarnsPerillaFatty CrabArturo's Pizza (same here)InotecaDresslerJoes Shanghi (and here)Union Square CafeSushi YasudaPrune (going for the burger at lunch then I'll wait for brunch)These are in no particular order...just hoping to get to them all sometime in 2008. As you can see they are kind of all over the place; upscale, downscale, organic, MSG filled, etc. Hopefully at this time next year I will be looking back on this list and it will have been completed!

My 2007 Year in Review- AKA Better than Bruni

Okay so maybe I don't get paid by the New York Times to go out to restaurants and maybe millions of people don't read my reviews BUT I think that if Frank Bruni comes out with a year in review than gosh darn it- I can too!!! So here is my 2007 list. Just to note- Not all of these places opened in 2007. Some opened before but I had never been to them before. So this is actually MY year in review- not restaurant openings. Just wanted to make that clear so here goes:Best Dishes I Had in 2007:Vermont Farm Suckling Pig from Eleven Madison Park. This rectangle of pork was crispy and delicious it is almost unbelievable so much flavor can come out of a dish this small.Pork Ssam and Skirt Steak Ssam at Momofuku. Okay so this is top of Bruni's list for best new restaurant and I totally agree. I don't know what they put in the meat there but I wake up in the morning and crave this sandwich- seriously.Bluefin Tuna Sashimi at Aburiya Kinnosuke. Best piece of sashimi I have ever had. It literally melted as I tried to pick it up. I can't believe I haven't been back yet.Beef Jerky at Malayasia Beef Jerky. Not really a dish but awesome beef jerky that I am in love with.Beef Ribs at Hill Country I felt like I was in a Flinstones show eating these mammoth ribs! Luckily they were tasty as hell to boot!Black Sesame and Green Tea Macaron at Morimoto- this was the best palate cleanser ever!Worst Dish:Beef Cheek Sandwich at Resto- This was a special one night we stopped by and it was so bad we couldn't even get through one of the four mini sandwiches. It was basically a piece of fat covered in some kind of spicy peppers and other things that were so hot you couldn't even bite into it. Best Desserts I Had This Year:Peanut Butter and Milk Chocolate Caramel Parfait from Irving Mill. OMG this might be the Best dessert I have ever had! Filled with Crunchy Meringue and Peanut Brittle; it really doesn't get much better than this if your a chocolate fan!Black Sesame Creme Brulee with green tea ice cream at Cha'An Tea House. Okay so this place has been around a while but I didn't know it existed until this year. Such a great display of tastes and textures that complement the end of your meal rather than kill it.Best New Restaurant:Degustation. I loved this place. The space was gorgeous and cozy at the same time. The food was wonderful and it didn't break the bank. I didn't write a review only because I kind of wanted to keep it all for myself- it's that good!Biggest Disappointment:Borough Food and Drink. We went to the opening party and enjoyed the look of the place and their food and drinks. Subsequent visits however proved to be different. Bad, slow service, inconsistent food (the burger used to be so good) to just really bad bad food (undercooked chicken, etc). We had high hopes for this to be a great neighborhood spot but if things stay on track this space will soon ne empty once again. Maybe it really is just a cursed spot?

Between the holiday season and everything else going on I am a little behind on posting. Some reviews may never make it, we'll see what happens but I'll try and give it a go!So last weekend my friends from home came to visit to see NYC at holiday time. We did all the touristy stuff like Rockefeller Center, Times Square, Time Warner Center, etc. We even stopped for a drink at Hawaiian Tropic Zone since we figured we were already acting like tourists we might as well do it up!By the end of the day we were starving and wanted to get out of all of the crowds. I figured Tribeca would be pretty devoid of people so we hopped in a cab and headed to EN Japanese Brasserie for dinner.We got there about 6:15 and were seated right away even though our reservation was for 6:45. We ordered some beers and shochu while we looked at the menu.EN is basically an izakaya where you order small plates of food to share while drinking. We decided to go slow and order only a few dishes at a time and then stop when we got full.The first dish we started out with were the Ebi Shinjo.These are basically balls of ground up shrimp that's covered in sea salt and fried. I don't need to tell you that anything fried has a good chance of being tasty and this was no exception. The outside had a nice light crust and the inside was filled with hot chunks of shrimp. A perfect dish for drinking with beer!Next up was one of my all time favorite dishes Miso Black Cod. I've talked about having this before at Nobu, where it was first made. I was impressed with EN's version. The fish was cooked perfect and although the sauce seemed a little bit thicker than Nobu's the flavor wasn't as sweet. Very good!Our next dish was probably my least favorite of the night the Crispy Fried Chicken.The chicken came out a little too greasy (I hate when you can see the grease spots- gross!) The poultry itself was moist but it lacked flavor. Our next dish was the Stone Grilled Wagyu. This is kobe-style beef that was so tender and moist it was falling apart a little bit. It came with a ponzu citrus sauce that gave a nice acidic taste to the meat.Our last dishes were some pieces of cho toro (which I can't find the picture of) and a spicy chu toro roll. Both were fantastic but a little on the small side for the price I thought.We still had some room left at the end so we ordered some desserts to share. First up was the trio of ice creams. That's black sesame, pumpkin and vanilla. I was really excited about trying out the pumpkin but it ended up being only so so. The black sesame and vanilla both were great but no where near as good as at Chinatown Ice Cream Factory.Next was the Flourless Chocolate Cake with Green Tea Ice Cream.Kind of a classic dessert dish you always see on the menu in Japanese restaurants nowdays. This one didn't disappoint with the bittersweet chocolate of the cake balancing perfectly with the green tea ice cream.We went all out for our last dessert and decided to try something new. This is the Oshiruko.It's described as a Sweet Red Bean Soup with Mochi Rice cakes. I thought it was pretty disgusting. I have never been a big red bean fan and that's all this was. My friends liked to dip some of the ice creams into the soup as a topping but no one enjoyed the rice cakes.Towards the end of the meal my friend and I were getting sick of all of the beers and decided to try out their cocktails. The waiter recommeneded this one to my friend and it was awesome!!!It's called the Seppun. It's shochu mixed with yuzu citrus, grapefriut juice and shiso. Really tasty. Much better than my White Peach drink that had a little too much peach pulp. Our waiter was attentive the entire dinner and it was nice to have a quiet place to relax after the hustle and bustle of the day. I think EN is a great place but maybe a little too pricey. Those little dishes really add up in the end so you have to be careful of how much you order.EN Japanese Brasserie

Just a quick note about some AMAZING chocolate Ive been eating lately. There is a fairly new Chocolate shop in the Essex Street Market called Ronnie Sue's. It's a tiny closet sized space but what it lacks in size it makes up for in taste!!!I went in to pick up some last minute Christmas presents. My favorite candy they have is their Peanut Squares. I got these about a month ago and knew immediately that I needed to pick some up for My chocolate peanut butter obsessed friends and family.WOW!! How good do these look!!!! You know why they're so good? Its a blend of milk and dark chocolate so you have a little bitter with sweet, then they add natural peanut butter (which I love) and then add a last swirl of white chocolate and peanut butter on the top. Holy cow- so creamy delicious and rich. One square is absolutely decadent. The best part is that Ronnie Sue herself is pretty cool!! She always has something for you to taste and she's just quite a spunky lady. I really like her.So what are you waiting for!!! Get over there and try out some delicious chocolates and tell Ronnie Sue she's the best!!www.roni-sue.com

hehe, I live just a minute away from Roni-Sue's! I must admit, I pop in for a quarter pound of brittle or a truffles a little too often - she does satisfy a sweet tooth quite well! :) the essex st market is turning out to be quite the food scene...shopsins, anne saxelby's cheeseshop, and now roni-sue! :)

So I have long been a fan of a blog called Lovescool. I frequently used to check it out because it was all about my favorite things- desserts!So when I saw that the writers of the blog were finally going to make their dream of opening a bakery come true I knew I had to go. Imagine my surprise when I saw that it was opening only a couple blocks away from my house!!! So I hit it up the very first day it opened and grabbed some tea and a green tea cupcake. It was awesome!!!!I went back yesterday and had to pick some up to bring home. I was planning to just get the Greeen Tea Cupcake but once I saw they had Pumpkin as well I had to get one of each.The Green Tea cupcake is really good- I've had it before. Unfortunatly this one must have been made the day before because it was a little stale and hard.The Pumpkin on the other hand was perfect!!! The cake was moist and light. A very good dessert if you're not looking for something overly sweet. Amai is defiently a nice addition to the neighborhood.amai tea house

So after a completely emotionally draining week at home I was spent. All I wanted when I woke up Saturday was to have a relaxing trip home where I didn't have to deal with anything. Of course this didn't happen. Saturday ended up being awful and when we finally got home about 5 hours late I told Mr Trekker I was getting into bed and I wasn't sure if I would ever get out again.Luckily, he intervened and said the six little words that I can't resist \"I'm taking you out to dinner.\" So I dragged my depressed self out into the night air. Buffalo had been so cold I was always darting inside to the heat. NYC on the other hand was perfect. There was a chill in the air but it felt crisp and fresh against my skin. I was finally starting to feel a little better so we headed to Gramercy Tavern to see if we could get a seat at the bar.Of course we walked up and saw that the bar was about 3 people deep and there were also people waiting outside. I was a little disappointed but I had been expecting that we wouldn't be able to get in. So we went over to our backup Bar Stuzzichini.As I walked into the door I could already see the people- everywhere!!! The bar was jam packed and people were waiting all over the place! I couldn't believe it! This ended up being the case everywhere we tried! Lunetta packed. Craftbar ridiculously packed, Pipa completely utterly ridiculously packed. I was beginning to fall back into my depressed state more and more with each place. I forget the crowds of people that come into the city in droves during the holidays.We were just about to give up hope when we walked by Punch. We looked in we could see a couple empty spots at the bar. Hallelujah!!!We ran in, grabbed our stools and gave a huge sigh of relief. It had been almost an hour since we left our apartment and we were starving! I tried to look around at the scene of the place to calm the rumbling of my tummy.We have been here many times for brunch but the space looked very different at night. The front bar area was dark with candles at each table and on the bar. It gave a nice secluded feel to a usually bright white and sterile room.The bartender came over and handed us the menus.First of all I was shocked at the incredibly reasonable prices on the bottles of wine. There were easily over 30 bottles that were under $30. I finally chose a nice Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand and we set to ordering our food.Mr T. ordered an appetizer of Steamed Clams & Tiger Shrimp which came in a Lemongrass Broth with Grilled Toast. I tried a bite of his shrimp and declared it bland. Mr. T looked at me like I was crazy and pushed a piece of the soaked toast into my mouth. Um...okay I was wrong. The bread had soaked up all the spice that the shrimp obviously could not. It ended up being a pretty decent dish but we agreed we wouldn't order again because it still needed something to bring out the seafood flavor a little more.For our entrees we both ordered the Filet Mignon. I honestly wasn't expecting much as this was our what, fifth, sixth choice of restaurant maybe?! But I was pleasantly surprised.The filet itself was extremely tender and huge! So huge I ended up taking half of it home with me! It came atop some buttery mashed potatoes and a side of braised leeks. The Leeks were the only thing I didn't really care for since they seemed too limp and watery, but see that chunk of something on the side there?Oh yeah!! That's a big piece of Double Smoked Bacon!! It really doesn't get any better than this! The smokiness of the Bacon was intense and would have overpowered the meat if you weren't careful. Luckily I just had a little nibble with each bite and it was perfect. So even though I took half of my filet home I caved in for dessert. (Honestly what girl doesn't!) We decided to split their Vanilla Creme Brulee and got some Butterscotch Ice Cream on the side.The Creme Brulee was great...I've honestly never met a Creme Brulee I could hate. But the ice cream stole the show! It was so rich, creamy and decadent I don't think I would be able to eat a whole scoop on it's own. I really needed the vanilla from the brulee to take a little of the rich flavor away but it was good!!! Mr T. is no where near the ice cream fanatic that I am and he declare it one of the best he's ever had.So we had a very nice experience at Punch overall. You really can't beat it as far as value goes. The Filets were only $24 each and our fantastic bottle of white was $26!! The appetizer was the only pricey thing and we didn't even enjoy that much.Punch is not a destination place but a solid place for the neighborhood that we will be returning to soon.Punch Restaurant

So we had to travel up to Western New York unexpectedly this week because of a death in the family. Death is never an easy thing and this was especially hard. So when Mr Trekker and I found ourselves with some down time I knew I was in need of getting some comfort food.We headed out to Pasquale's which is a casual Italian restaurant in the neighborhood. They have an awesome Baked Ziti here but I was feeling something extra unhealthy!!Before I even opened up the menu I knew exactly what kind of fried, greasy goodness I needed. A chicken finger sub!This is truly something that I believe is made only in Western New York. It's breaded chicken fingers dipped in Buffalo Wing Sauce on a hero with lettuce, tomatoes and blue cheese.As you can see it also is topped off with some provolone cheese that gets nice and melty once its squished inside next to the hot chicken fingers.I was going to wash this all down with a Loganberry soda, another WNY staple, but I didn't think my body could handle all the sugar. This is such an awesome sandwich and so easy to make I can't believe it's no where in NYC? I almost want to open up a shop and start selling these babies myself.Hmmm...maybe I'll get a truck...and call it the Chicken Fingers Sub truck and sell these out of there!!! Everyone loves truck food right :)Pasquales

You're so right....I've not found anywhere that makes chicken finger subs. Buffalo is it! I sometimes make my own, but they never seem to turn out quite as good as what you can order in the Buffalo area. I live in NC now....and when I visit Buffalo I fill up on yummy foods like these subs, as well as pizza, loganberry, and chicken wings. Buffalo food is the best!

i totally agree that buffalo/rochester is the only place to find a chicken finger sub. i've grown up in buffalo and am going to school in the Maryland, DC area..and one day i had an intense craving for a chicken finger sub and then when i started looking at resturants...no one had one. then i mentioned my craving to my friends (from Philly, and Maryland) and they both gave me this atonished face like what the hell are you talking about.needless to say, buffalo food is the best in the world. best wings, best pizza, best hot dogs, best chicken finger subs!

Hi,Just another ex-WNY who found your page by googling for \"chicken finger subs\" and NYC.I can't believe that no place here makes them. Such a great and simple sandwich. All told, I find the subs (\"heroes\") here in general to be sorely lacking.I've been living in NYC for 10 years, and the cravings still don't go away. I'd kill for a Jim's Steak-Out chicken finger sub right about now.

We've lived in the area for over 6 years now and never tried out the steakhouse 5 blocks away, Angelo and Maxie's. Even though we love steak!! A couple weeks ago we noticed they had opened a little outpost of their steakhouse called Maxie's Bar and Grill. I walked by it one day and noticed they had a lot of plasma televisions and it looked pretty nice. Once Sunday rolled around both of us wanted to go watch the football games but we were in no mood to sit around a dank bar all day. We decided Maxie's might be a good choice.We got there right before 1:00 and only about 3 tables were filled, There was an older couple at the bar drinking large martini's (at 1:00 gasp!). I was a little surprised to see that the bar itself only had a view of one of the TVs. The rest were spread out in the dining area. Since we were watching multiple games I decided to ask the waitress where our best choice would be to sit. They were extremely accommodating and told us to sit wherever and they would make sure to put on the games we wanted.So Mr. T and I grabbed a seat, ordered some drinks and settled in. We decided to order a Caesar salad and some chicken wings to split. Why we started with this order and no beef I'll never know. We were in a steakhouse for goodness sake!Needless to say the wings were pretty bad. One whiff of sauce and I knew it was Franks Red Hot mixed together with some other sauce that gave it a strange fluorescent orange glow. The wings themselves looked big and meaty but were actually about 50% fat. No good.The Caesar salad was exactly like you would expect at a bar and grill. Good thick dressing- pretty standard salad except that it was pretty big for $4.95! I would get it again just because it's such a great value. After our disappointment with our wings we decided to try out one of their burgers. They have about 10 different burgers ranging from a Coffee Burger with Roasted Shallots to a Mexican Burger with Salsa and Guacamole!We finally decided to order the Snake River Kobe Beef Burger with truffle butter and Munster Cheese. They have about six different cheeses you can choose from including goat cheese which I hardly ever see.The burger itself was cooked perfectly and super juicy. I honestly expected the patty to be a little thicker but it ended up being a nice bun to meat ratio. As you can see the burger came on a Onion Bun. I actually enjoyed the flavor of this roll a lot but I think they should say something on the menu about it in case people prefer plain.The burger is also supposed to come with shoestring fries but I asked to sub in their waffle fries which they happily did. They were very crunchy around the edges but could have had a little more crunch throughout the middle. Not to bad though. Pretty decent waffle fries.One small con was that they had way too many waiters on shift for the amount of people. Our waiter was extremely friendly and attentive but sometimes we felt like the others were just hanging out listening to our conversations. I assume this is something they will change though, as they ease into their new space more and get a feel for the times and crowds.Overall we enjoyed this place. The burger and salad were very good and cheaper than many other places in the neighborhood. On the way out we noticed they had menus out saying they delivered.We were so happy!!! Our other go-to bar food delivery place has gone severely downhill and we had been looking for a replacement for months!!So this means we probably wont be back for a while because we will be ordering it 3 times a week but hey- we'll be giving them lots of business!

My aunt happened to be in town for a conference the other night and we meet her and a friend out for some drinks at The House. After some great conversation and a couple glasses of wine, Mr Trekker & I found ourselves alone once again and feeling pretty hungry.We didn't want to venture to far away so we decided to head over to The Smith, which had just opened in the former Pizzeria Uno spot. I had seen they had fish tacos listed on their website so I thought we might check it out.The place itself reminds of Schillor's Liquor Store with it's black and white tiles. We grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a couple beers.They have a good selection of beers on tap and the menu looked quite good but we didn't end up staying more than one drink. Why? Because it was kind of creepy.It seemed like there were about 50 to 60 people working there. There was literally a busboy per table. They all would stand at the back of the restaurant and stare out over the room. I have never seen anything like it. I'm not sure if it was opening night or maybe they just thought they would be more busy! We just found it really strange so we decided to leave.Now we were REALLY hungry and just wandering around the East Village when we wandered right by Momofuku Ssam Bar! I love Momofuku!!! And there were two seats left! Success!We had a seat and took a look at the menus.I ordered a glass of the first white wine on the list and Mr T ordered the regular Hitachino Ale. The Hitachino Ale was really nice! I've had the white and red ales before and never cared for either of them so I was surprised to like the regular one so much but I did.We decided to start out with the bread and butter and some pork buns.I'm not going to talk about the pork buns because I think everyone knows by now how fantastic they are. The bread on the other hand was pretty good as well. They served it warm with two kinds of butter. The first was a sea salt butter from Vermont and the second was a goat butter from England.Both were very creamy and rich. I don't think it was worth the $8 price tag since you get bread for free in many places but Mr. T really enjoyed it.Then we got our Marinated Hanger Steak Ssam minus the kimchi (I hate kimchi). I loved this dish! A friend had ordered it last time we were there and I was so jealous I hadn't done the same. The meat was cooked perfect and the sauce was great for dipping. The funny thing about this dish though is that Mr. T didn't like it. He said it had no flavor! We ended up getting into a minor argument over the taste since I just thought it was excellent. How can two people have such different tastes over one dish is beyond me. (I think his taste buds were off that night :)Anyway after our Ssam we decided to splurge for dessert.This is their PB & J concoction. This was kind of disappointing to be honest. The peanut butter was a little too crunchy and the concord jelly was a little too sweet for me. I'm a huge peanut butter and jelly fan but this just didn't do it. Oh well- I have way too many desserts that I'm already obsessed with anyways!I woke up the next day and immediately wanted to go back and get another Ssam! I think they put something in their food that makes you crave it. Unfortunately Mr T didn't feel the same way so we didn't. Until next time Ssam!!Momofuku

A Punch Brunch

Friends were in town, so we decided to go out to brunch Saturday at Punch. Punch is kind of a weird place. I always feel like I'm at a hotel restaurant when I'm inside and I'm not really sure why. Once you get past the bar everything is white. Tablecloths, tables, walls; it really feels a little too formal for brunch even though that's not what the place is going for.We've come here a lot though because it has a pretty great prix-fix. For $14.95 you get a basket of fresh baked muffins and jam, a bloody mary/mimosa, coffee and an entree. Not too shabby!The mimosas are always great as well. They definitely use some decent champagne and a good juice to liquor ratio.We were seated immediately and got our menus. The basket of muffins came right away which was nice but then it took about 15 minutes before our waitress came over for our order. This seems to be a constant brunch problem in NY. No one ever seems to be on the same page.We ordered our entrees and got our drinks.For my entree I went pretty basic- the Grilled Chicken Caesar salad with a side of Applewood Smoked bacon. The Cesar salad was awesome!! The dressing was creamy without being too heavy and light on the anchovy flavor. Mr. T was a little adventurous this morning and decided to get the Lobster Crawfish roll.This was not the best choice. First of all, when it came out there was a noticeable orange hue to everything. He offered me a bite but the color was so weird that I said no. He ended up eating only the french fries because the seafood had a strange taste to it. Not a good brunch choice.My friend got the French Toast. This I did try and it was really good. It was nice and gooey on the inside and came with a vanilla syrup that rocked. I have to say it was almost as good as the french toast we had at Jane.My other friend ordered the Apple Smoke Bacon and Cheddar Cheese Omelet. This was also pretty awesome. The bacon was nice and crispy without all the grease and grime that you get sometimes and the omelet was nice and fluffy.Overall, besides Mr T's dish, it was a great brunch. The only problem again comes with the service. After we ordered our meals we never saw our original waitress again until about 20 minutes after we were done with our dishes. Everything was given to us by various other wait staff.We had to flag her down so we could get our check and then flag her down again to pay it. No one ever came by when we were eating either to see how our meal was going. This seems to happen a lot at brunch places but never at dinner. Why is this? Something about the customer turnover in the morning? Wait staff calling in sick on the weekends? Any thoughts?

So we went to Florida about a month ago and I took lots of pictures of our food and whatnot but never put them on my blog. I feel that since it's called Nyctastes it should only be about food from NY.Anyway, some of the friends I went with thought I should have used the photos since we went to some really great places! So to appease them I decided I would show a few in the form of a survey which also pretty much sums up our trip.So...Here goes.Let's say it's your last day in Florida and you started it off by drinking one of these:You decide to continue your day by consuming many of these:Until late into the night when you realize your multiple beverages just won't cut it and you need something to eat. Unfortunately the only thing open at this hour of night in Florida is the local gas station.Please tell me. Which one of these would you eat?Instant Ramen Noodles (chicken flavor), The Cattleman Sandwich (an enormous soy cheeseburger), a Ham & Cheese sub (2 for $5 with the Cattleman), a Stuff-itz (generic pepperoni pizza hot pocket) or a cup of gas station cheese whiz?

So I was out shopping in Soho early one afternoon trying to get some early Christmas shopping done. I HATE dealing with the crowd of people that swarm Broadway between Thanksgiving and Christmas. The holidays turn people into a crazed and unruly bunch. If you don't believe me try walking down Broadway in a week or so. You will never be the same!So I set out early and went to just about every store imaginable and came up with nothing. I was pretty depressed by the end and my stomach was running on empty. I needed some comforting food fast. That's when I remembered Soho Park.Soho Park opened about a year ago and is basically just a cafe/ grill sort of place that caters to the SOHO shoppers. I figured I could grab some good food fast and be on my way.I decided to order some Pomme Frites with a side of Garlic Aioli and a bottle of water.They gave me this license plate and told me to sit wherever. The license plate was to act as my order number so the waiter could find me.I thought this was kind of neat and went with the kitschy decor of the place. Since I was solo I just grabbed a seat at the empty bar and got a better look at the place.For just a grill type place they have a surprising amount of top shelf liquors and some good beers!! For example, they had Kindl Berliner- Weisse, War of 1812 Amber and one of my personal favorites- the Sixpoint Sweet Action! So I happy relaxing and just taking the place in but I was thirsty. It had been about 10 minutes and my bottle of water had never come. I got the attention of one of the waiters and asked him if I could have my water. He nodded and came back a second later with a glass of ice water.Now clearly this was not the $2.75 bottle of water that I had paid for. I tried to say something to him but he was gone before I even had a chance to open my mouth. I figured- oh well- I'll drink this now and get my bottle of water when my fires come. So I sat there and waited. And waited. And waited. About 20 more minutes went past and I just sat their watching group after group of people get their food. I kept telling myself maybe they had ordered after me. Maybe the fries are backed up. Maybe I'm not invisible!!Finally I watched a group of six people come in, order their food, receive their food and leave all within about 10 minutes. I had had enough.Not that I wasn't trying to get someones attention- I was. I had been trying to flag down a waiter forever. I finally got us and went to the counter with my dilemma. They immediately asked me where I was sitting and said it would only be a second. I went and sat back down and my fries came out right away.Now clearly these were not MY fries. My order had been lost but there was no apology or anything from anyone. I was kind of upset and wanted to complain but I was starving and needed some food.My basket of frites were decent. Half of them were cooked perfectly crispy and half were a little limp. Sometimes I would get one with tons of salt. Sometimes one with none. I think they must have put an old batch in with a fresh one.The garlic aioli I didn't care for at all and I ended up using ketchup instead:( So overall, I was pretty disappointed in my meal. In the end I spent about an hour in this place and came out a little less happy than I had going in. Oh- and I never got that damn bottle of water either.http://www.sohoparknyc.com/index.php

So I have a couple posts from a few weeks back ,since our computer decided to break down and we had to send it away. Leaving me a shell of a human being behind!! Just kidding!Anyway, during this time, I had two of my best friends in the world come visit for a weekend. Yey Me!!! They came in early afternoon on Friday and we kind of just chilled out for a little while and then walked down to the village.Our first stop was the Stoned Crow for a couple beers. I love the Stoned Crow- It's one of those divey bars where I could chill out at all night and listen to some good music on the jukebox. They have Sixpoint Sweet Action on tap as well, which is always a plus for me.Once we finished a beer or two we realized we were starving! None of us had really eaten any lunch but we also didn't want to spoil our dinner so we spilt a burger between the 3 of us.This was actually the first time I have ever eaten at the Crow although I do know the chef is the former burger slinger from Corner Bistro, so I knew it had to be good. And oh boy- it was!!!Unfortunately there's no picture because we were all so famished we attacked it right away! But it was a perfect medium rare, with a salty char on the outside and a good toppings. A very good burger and pretty cheap by NYC standards as well.Once Mr. Trekker met us at the bar after work we decided to head over the East Village for drinks at Angel Share. Mr. T felt he had to \"catch up\" with us since we had been out for a while and sucked down a couple of Groovy cocktails! Man they were good! That place is dangerous with their awesome drinks!Since the burger did little to cover all of the alcohol we were ingesting we decided to go no further and just have dinner next door at Village Yokocho. We got a table in the back where we could cook our own meat Japanese BBQ style and it was awesome! We ordered WAY too much food and had hardly any room left on the table for our plates! This is really such a great place to go to with a group of friends. Interactive dining:)We were all incredibly stuffed after dinner but I really needed something sweet. I remembered Cha-an was just down the block so we headed there. The place was full when we walked in but after about a 10 minute wait we got a table.This place is just a very tiny and cute Japanese Tea House which serves up some of the best desserts in the city.We sat down and ordered some sake.This is one of the few places where they pour your sake into a bottle like this. The sake is at the bottom in the clear part and then they put an ice cube in the blue bubble so it keeps the sake nice and cool. Pretty neat!Then came our desserts!!Okay, their black sesame creme brulee is to die for!!!! But it was time for something different so this is the Sweet Potato Apple cake with Carmel ice cream on top and the signature cookie! As with all Ch-an desserts this was a heaven!!! The cake itself was super moist and sweet but not sugary (if that makes sense)! Carmel goes perfectly with apples of course and it was just all around tasty! We couldn't leave without getting one order of Green Tea truffles. I am really starting to become obsessed with the flavor of green tea. Green tea cookies, ice cream, cupcakes (oh yes cupcakes, I'll post about those soon!) The truffles are the most decadent of the bunch and more than one would be too much for me but it was a perfect treat for the end of our meal.

I had to throw in this picture from Halloween night of one of my favorite candies in Large size!!!We were in the Duane Reade and ran across a bag of Boston Baked beans that were absolutely huge!!! Look at this bag!! I've never seen these in anything but a small box! I even put some other candy bars near it so you can really tell the size. I mean come on! This is a party sized bag! I really wanted to buy it but then I would have just gorged myself silly on the sugary peanuts. I did happen to buy the smaller candy bar in the back called Carlos V. It had a picture of a king on the front that I assume is Carlos V himself. He reminded me a little of the Burger King guy. Unfortunately the chocolate was disgusting. Next time I'll go for the big bag of beans!!

So we had been planning to get tickets for the Bills Jets game on Sunday for a couple of weeks now. We both took Monday off so we could go early and tailgate without any worries for the next day of work. Unfortunately fate intervened and took all of our money basically.In the last week BOTH of our televisions, the living room one and bedroom one broke, and our Laptop stopped working. We basically had a technological meltdown in our apartment. Luckily our laptop is still covered under warranty, so we just mailed that out in the hopes that we will see it again soon fixed (knock on wood), but our TVs were another story.I hate to say it but we have both become slaves to technology and couldn't last a day without the stupid thing. So we spent many late hours going to Circuit City, Best Buy, J & R, basically anyplace in the city that sells Television's- we went to.In the end we came home with two fantastic new television's that should hopefully last us for a while. They should at least for the amount of money we spent on them! But the week really left us quite penniless so we decided to have an easy stay at home weekend and not buy the football tickets.As Sunday rolled around though I was getting antsy and really needed to leave the apartment. Mr T was happy just gazing at the big new TV all day but I needed to go out and do something! So since it was a nice day and the football game wouldn't be on until 4:00 I thought we go out for brunch.I jumped on Opentable Sunday morning and was surprised to see a reservation still available for Jane at 12:15. I have heard tons of positive reviews of Jane for brunch all over the Internet. A lot of people say it's the best brunch in the city, up there in the ranks with Balthazar & Five Points. So seeing a reservation still available I grabbed it.Once I got Mr. T up and ready (he doesn't really function until about 1:00 on the weekend) we were off!We got to Jane right on time and there were already about 15 people in line waiting for one of the walk-in tables. We went to the hostess station and immediately were seated in one of the two people tables against the wall.I had heard the seating at Jane could be cramped and uncomfortable because the tables are so close together and was expecting the worst. I was pleasanly surprised to see the tables, although close together, were quite sizable giving you enough room to comfortably enjoy your meal. Compared to our table at the Spotted Pig, where the plate of food barely fit, this was roomy!Once we sat down we were handed our menus and a basket of bread was promptly dropped off by another server a few seconds later. We decided on what to order and then tried out the bread.The bread basket was pretty to look at but nothing special. The flatbread crackers were surprising spicy, which I actually didn't enjoy but the other pieces of bread had a nice flavor.I thought it was a little strange that they gave us our bread so quickly, but as I would soon find out these other servers were a blessing in disguise as out waiter was not the fastest man in the room.It was about 15 minutes after we got our basket that he finally arrived to take our order. I went for the Country breakfast and raspberry mimosa. Mr. T went for the Vanilla french toast and the bellini.We handed our menus and started to get into a discussion about the upcoming week.Literally about 3 minutes later a server was at our table, plates of food in hand.Now I don't want to complain, but this was a little too fast for me. When I go out to eat I want to enjoy the experience, not have my food and run. We hadn't even been given our drinks yet! We didn't end up getting those drinks either for another 10 minutes or so. Our waiter seemed to have disappeared somewhere during this time.Anyway onto the food! This is my Country Breakfast. As you can see there's quite a lot of different things on this plate but it still looks boring, no? Anyway the grits were cooked perfectly as were the eggs and the bacon was some of the best I'd ever had. I wish they had given me more than one slice! The biscuit and gravy were pretty forgettable but the sausage had a nice taste without being overly spicy. Here's Mr. T's Vanilla Bean French Toast.I have to say this was pretty good. The slices were nice and thick but had a milky texture almost when you cut into them. They were very sweet though. So sweet I could almost feel the toast giving me a cavity as I chewed it.After we were both finished it took us about 20 minutes to finally flag down our waiter and grab the bill from him. You would think with all of the people waiting the waiter would want to turn over his tables more quickly.Once we paid and got outside the line of people waiting had doubled in size, which leads me to this question. Our brunch was very good indeed but nothing special. I actually thought the country breakfast dish I had at Acme for brunch was better than this. The french toast was great but only slightly better than we've had at other places as well. Why does this place get all the hype? I certainly wouldn't wait outside for an hour to eat there again. Maybe I missed something?!http://janerestaurant.com/index.asp

We met up with some friends and hopped in a cab down to 88 Palace which is located in the mall directly under the Manhattan bridge. This is my favorite part of Chinatown. When you're more west, you see a lot of tourists and get some spillover from Little Italy. Down here there's none of that. This is the heart of Chinatown.In order to get to 88 Palace you take a huge escalator up to the top where the restaurant takes over the entire floor. In case you didn't know, for dim sum the food is wheeled around on a trolley by servers. As the servers pass they tell you what they have and then stamp your card once you take something. You're never quite sure what's coming next which makes it kind of an exciting way to eat!We walked in, got our card and were ready to go! As we sat down, our friend said \"Okay, we gotta remember to pace ourselves\".About three minutes later there were already five different plates in front of us. Pacing is not an option here!The first cart came around and we grabbed some steamed Bok Choy. I love Bok Choy and this was perfect. Nice and crispy with a very light sauce.In the background you can see the next two things we grabbed the beef noodle and shrimp noodle. I was NOT a fan of these at all. I have a thing with different textures. Some things just kind of creep me out and the texture of these noodles did just that. Ewww....they were slimy and gross. Next up was some kind of beef dish. I have no idea what this actually was since the woman didn't speak any English but it was good. It had the same kind of sauce you'd usually find on a beef and broccoli dish but better. When this next dish first came around I thought it was a turnip cake but it turned out to be shrimp toast. This also had a weird texture but it was good. It reminded me of some sort of shrimp frittata. The next dumplings were my favorite dish of the brunch. Again I have no idea what they were but they had different kinds of vegetables inside and something else we couldn't quite decipher but they were amazing!! After these dumplings we had a bunch of other stuff. Some fantastic shumai with whole shrimp inside, not that minced up stuff you get from delivery guys; some roasted pork buns and beef and pork dumplings. We were getting pretty full at this point and decided we would get 2 more dishes and some dessert. There were egg custards on some of the carts that I had been eyeing all morning and I couldn't wait to get some.As soon as we heard the woman describe the next dish we jumped on it immediately.This is a bacon wrapped shrimp dumpling. Wow it's basically a large shrimp wrapped in bacon, covered in dough and deep fried! Okay, not exactly healthy- but awesome. It was really rich so one was more than enough for each of us.We had one more dish to get and decided to go out and try something a little different. We had passed up on a bunch of the more exotic things as they had been going around like the tripe, etc. But hey- we're in Chinatown so we decided to go a little out of our comfort zone order this: Yes- that is a chicken's foot. I have to tell you that just looking at them I felt a little queasy. Once I bit into it I was surprised that it was basically all bone! Just skin and bone and that's it! I was NOT a fan of these at all. No one really was. Oh well at least we had tried them out.Unfortunately the egg custards never came back around so we decided to just settle up and grab some outside. The total bill for all of this food? Roughly $10 a person. What a fantastic deal!Almost everything we ordered came with 4 pieces so everyone had a bite and we had tons of food left over that we couldn't even finish. I will definitely be heading back here for brunch again soon. When we left it was about 12:30 and there wasn't an empty table in the house. I have to say this is one of the best deals in the city by far.

I know I've talked about going to Zum Schneider a lot in previous posts but I've never actually taken any pictures of the food! Well finally I have!With Oktoberfest being over Mr Trekker & I decided that we would have no trouble getting a table at Zum Schneider last Saturday night so we took our time. We walked around the East Village a little, did some shopping and even stopped into Nolita House for a quick drink.Finally around 7:00 we decided to head over. Walking up to the place we could already see a crowd of people standing outside. We could not believe how packed it was! Luckily most of the people waiting were lager parties and we were able to snag the last table for two outside. I prefer the inside and the ruckus and commotion that comes with it much better, but we were starving so we took what we could get.Zum Schneider is your typical beer garden with a ton of great German beers that come in 3 sizes small, regular and large. Of course being that we love beer we always go for the large! I ordered one of my favorite beers of all time the Hacker Pschorr Dunkel.It was a cool fall night and this beer was perfect. Dark and creamy with a nice frothy head. Mr. T decided to go for the Spatan Optimator which is the same dark color as my beer but a little sweeter and stronger. A big one of those and I would be \"feeling no pain\", as my mother would say!The waitress came over and told us the specials. We always order the same thing every time we come here but tonight the waitress really talked up a pork special they were having. Mr T decided to forgo the usual sausage platter and try it out.I on the other hand ordered the same thing I always do. The house salad and a brat. Zum Schneider has my favorite salad in the city. It is always super fresh and comes with a lemon, honey dressing that is delicious!! My brat was pretty good as well but I honestly didn't even have more than 2 bites of it.Why you may ask? Because of this:The pork special!!! Holy Cow this was so freakin good!!!! First of all, the piece of meat was bigger than my head! The outside skin was cooked perfectly crispy and the meat inside was so moist it just fell apart as you cut into the shank.It was so big I just had to help Mr. T eat it! Yum!!! If you ever see this listed as a special-go for it! I wish they would make it a regular item.Unfortunately, as the weather gets colder the outdoor seats will be gone and it will be even tougher to snag a table here. So if you're gonna go- be prepared to wait amid the ruckus!http://www.zumschneider.com/

We returned from our trip to Florida on Wednesday and were beyond tired out. Mr. Trekker did the correct thing and took the rest of the week off from work. I went in on Thursday & Friday and of course had two of the most stressful and hectic days ever. Luckily I get out of work early on Friday's and was home by 3:30. Since Mr. T was home as well and neither of us had had lunch yet (since he was just waking up), we decided to grab a late lunch at Casa Mono.Casa Mono has been in our neighborhood for years now and always gets rave reviews. Unfortunately the place is super small and seating is a little cramped. It is also filled to the brim for dinner at night with at least an hour waiting list. The nice thing about the place though is that they serve their menu all day! So we figured it being an off hour we might be able to have the place to ourselves.It was a really rainy and gross day so we hurried into the place and found it almost empty. There were 2 couples dining at the bar and one table was occupied. We decided to grab a seat on the far side of the bar near the windows to enjoy the dreariness of the day.We order a fantastic bottle of white wine,which the sommelier helped us choose and of course I don't remember the name, and got to work on ordering.We figured we would order 3 plates here and then head over to Pipa, another place we'd been meaning to try out, and order a couple more. For some reason we both thought the tapas would be tiny and the plates expensive; seeing that it was a Mario Batali place.Our first dish was the Pumpkin & Goat Cheese Croquetas.The plate was pretty big! As you can see there's a good 6-8 croquetas there!Inside the croqueta.Yum!!! These were heavenly. It's a little hard to tell from the picture but the goat cheese to pumpkin ratio was about 50:50. Usually the cheese kind of overpowers any other taste but the pumpkin really came through. Absolutely delightful!Next we got the Fideos with chorizo and clams. I honestly ordered this because it was the dish that Iilan Hall made on Top Chef that won him the round. Since I am not a pasta fan; find chorizo too spicy and dislike clams, I figured I would at least try it and Mr. T could enjoy the rest.Know what? I think I may have eaten more than him! The flavors were fantastic together! The chorizo was minced into little cubes so the spice didn't over power it and the sauce that was on top cooled it down as well. This is a perfect example of why I love eating out! On paper, this sounds like a dish I would loath. But somehow, this chef got everything together just right to make it spectacular!Our final dish was the lamb chops with chickpeas. I couldn't get a picture because the sky had turned black as night because of the storm and the sun had been the only light. It was very good though- perfectly cooked with a nice char on the outside.After the 3 dishes we were stuffed. When we got our bill we realized our moderately priced bottle of wine ended up being more than all 3 dishes put together. Really quite a deal!So was Casa Mono perfect? Well unfortunately our service was horrendous. As I said earlier the whole time we were there only about 6 people at most were there with us. You would think that with a wait staff of about 6 people we would have no problems.Unfortunately our waiter sucked. He took forever to take our food order, he never filled our water or our wine glasses (we had to flag him down each time) and he literally would stand in front of the bar and gaze right through us looking stoned.So that was a little upsetting. Especially because one of the waiters seemed to notice our displeasure and did nothing. Oh well. The food was good enough that we will be going back and maybe I'll even give Batali's other place, Otto, another shot.We were too full to get any more food so we just went to Pipa for a quick drink. I stuck with a Negro Modelo but Mr. T tried out their Coconut Lime Mojito and it was fantastic! Really tasty and quite a fun place. Next time we won't eat so much before planning to eat there!http://www.mariobatali.com/restaurants_casamono.cfmhttp://www.abchome.com/Restaurant1.aspx?DeptRowId=27

We stopped by the new Italian place in our neighborhood, Bocca on Friday night for an after work drink. I got there a little before 7:00 and there were plenty of seats still available at the bar.I ordered a glass of Tocai Fruili and waited a couple minutes before Mr Trekker showed up. The space is pretty nice. The walls are painted red with gold accents and the bartender was engaging and entergetic. Many of the tables were filled with people dining and it was very lively.After Mr. T showed up the bartender brought over some complimentary bar snacks for us! Not your ordinary peanuts either.This whole spread was just for us!Fried olives, bruchetta, ham and cheese croquettes, fried mussels and some weird cubes of bread with garlic, olive oil and orange maybe?To be honest nothing was amazing but the croquettes were decent and it was free! That's hard to come by in the city! We didn't stay for dinner since we wanted to rest up for our flight to Florida the next day but we'll probably stop back again since the service was so friendly.

I love Top Chef. Let me say that again I Looove Top Chef!!! It is one of my favorite shows in the whole world. Which makes it odd that we have never gone to any of the Craft restaurants even though most of them are in my neighborhood and Tom Colicchio started all of them.So the other day I was heading home and walked past 'Wichcraft. I decided today was the day to try out some Tom cooking.I grabbed the menu and immediately decided on a fantastic sounding roast beef sandwich. As I approached the counter and ordered I was informed that the sandwich was actually no longer on the menu. Needles to say I was a little sad but I quickly changed my order to the slow roasted pork sandwich with coppa, pickled pepper relish & fontina on grilled country bread.The sandwich itself was pretty good. Everything was obviously very fresh and the melted cheese and pork went really well together. Unfortunately the pickled relish was way too spicy for me. It was covered in red pepper flakes and consumed the whole sandwich.The bread was great so next time I would order it sans the relish and see if that made it better.Unfortunately I have to say the waitstaff at 'Wichcraft left much to be desired. They were quite slow and unfriendly. Not the type of service I would have expected.Anyway, later that night after some shopping Mr. Trekker and I decided to stop for a glass of wine on the way home. Since we were right near Craftbar we decided to go there. Two Crafts in one day would be a feat!!The space itself is sleek and stylish. We saddled up to the bar and ordered some wine. I went for a glass of the Roger Champault Sancerre Blanc Perris 2006. It was so dark in the place it was hard to get a good picture but WOW. This wine was awesome. One of the best wines I have had in a while. It was light and crisp with a hint of peach on the end. I was so impressed with this wine that I looked it up and ordered a bottle when I got home. In the back of the picture you can see the huge breadsticks they gave us. I am not a big bread fan but these were good. A nice thing to crunch on that didn't interfere with the taste of the wine. The service was great and we both decided we would have to go back another time try the food. I'm glad we checked it out, next on my list Craftsteak!!! I have to save up some money for that though!http://www.witchcraftnyc.com/http://www.craftbar.com/

Stopped into City bakery the other morning on my way back from shopping. This place is really close to my apartment but I never seem to swing by and pick up their delicious pastries.As I was browsing the baked good I ran across a Miso Garden muffin. This sounded interesting so i decided to pick one up. I also grabbed an Ice Coffee and headed home with my goods. Here's a close up of the muffin:The top of this muffin was excellent- nice and crusty on the edges but also chewy. Perfect texture.The inside of the muffin had nice texture as well. Unfortunately I did not like the taste. The miso flavor was very light and the rest almost tasted a little bit like carrot but it just didn't go together for me. Luckily Mr. T seemed to like it so- to each their own I guess. The one thing I do have to say is their Iced Coffee was fantastic. Not too bitter, nice and smooth. I will definitely be going back for another one of these. Next time I think I'll try their Blueberry Corn muffin- that looked goood!

As you already well know, I love good beers. Especially of the German variety. So it goes without saying that I love Oktoberfest. Every year I try to go to some sort of celebration. Growing up we would go to Oktoberfest in Ellicotville and peruse back and forth between all of the tents trying different beers from the microbreweries up there.This year I was excited to go to Zum Schneider for their celebration to have some big beers and listen to some music from the Oompah band. Unfortunately when we showed up last Saturday the place was already filled WAY beyond capacity and the waiting list was a mile long. I was pretty disappointed. We were going to try to go back this past weekend but it just didn't work out.So yesterday we decided to try out a local German place the Silver Swan and have one Oktoberfest beer.Walking into the Silver Swan I immediately noticed that everything about the place seemed old. The wrought iron bar stools, the dining room which was furnished like my grandmothers living room to the people who were eating. It wasn't a bad thing- just something you notice right away.We grabbed a seat at the bar and perused their beer list which was quite fantastic. They had tons of German beers and also some good Belgian and English brews at well. Being that I was celebrating Oktoberfest I went for the Spatan Oktoberfest.I've had this beer many times before and I have to say it's hand down my favorite Oktoberfest beer. It's very light and smooth for an Oktoberfest beer with a slightly sweet, nutty aftertaste.The free Bavarian pretzels at the bar were a perfect complement as always. The bar was pretty much empty since it was an early Sunday evening, a far cry from the usual boisterous party of my past Oktoberfest celebrations. It was nice though. A relaxing hour sipping a good beer before I had to start worrying about the Yankees again.....

It was an unusually warm and sunny October day on Saturday. A little too warm for the season if you ask me, but Mr. Trekker and I decided to go out and enjoy it anyway. We were craving some good beef jerky and had heard there was a place in Chinatown that we had never tried before which was supposed to be better than our usual place New Beef King, so we headed down.We had to stop at J & R to pick up some cables for our new receiver so we jumped on the 6 train. When we arrived at the Brooklyn bridge station we were feeling a little adventurous so we decided to stay on the train and do the loop to see the old station that used to be used.I have to tell you it was a little scary. We were the only ones on the train since it had been the last stop and there's something a little eerie about being completely alone in the dark depths of the subway tunnel. Halfway through, the train came to a complete halt for about 3-4 minutes. I had a mini panic attack of being trapped there forever. Visions of a power outage and a huge rainstorm suddenly flooding the subway station all came to mind. I started to have trouble breathing and my heart was racing when suddenly...the train started to move again. Phew!!! That is the last time we ever do that. Although it was kind of neat to see.Anyway after I calmed down and had a successful stop at J & R, we headed into Chinatown.Just the other week I had been talking to Mr. T about my lack of having good ice cream in the city. See I am an ice cream addict. At least once a week I have a huge craving for the stuff and I usually just run out to the store and pick up a pint of Ben & Jerry's. I have never been to any of the top places like Cones, Il Laboratorio del gelato , etc. So when I ran across the Chinatown Ice Cream factory I knew I had to stop in.The amount of crazy flavors were overwhelming. I wanted to try everything!!! But since I didn't want to completely ruin my appetite for the day I limited myself to 2 scoops. I decided to go for the Black Sesame and the Egg Custard ice cream. OMG- this was so good!!!!! Black sesame ice cream has always been one of my favorites since I had it at Sakagura and Cha'an and this was just as good, if not better than the stuff I had there.The egg custard though really blew me away. Whereas the black sesame was kind of thick and dense, the custard was really light and smooth. It started melting almost instantly. It reminded me of when I was little and I would make stirred custard on the stove to put over fresh strawberries. It was awesome!So after I gorged myself on ice cream, we continued walking up Elizabeth Street to Malayasia Beef Jerky. As you enter the store, the strong aroma of smoked meat reminded me of being at the Big apple BBQ. The place is only about as big as our tiny living room so it can be quite overpowering, We were excited to try everything and got a 1/4 pound of the regular beef jerky, the sliced beef and the spicy pork. Wow! This beef jerky is about 10 times better than what we had been getting at New Beef King. It was so fresh and soft with an incredible smokey flavor. It literally tasted exactly like it smelled.Close up of the Jerky Mr. T and I devoured about 3 pieces each and were covered in spices but didn't care. It was so damn good.We decided to continue walking around a little more just to see what else was in the area. We were heading down Mott Street when I saw the sign for Saigon Bakery. I have always wanted to try a Banh Mi so even though I was literally bursting at the seams we headed in to get a sandwich.Mr. T was completely taken aback when we walked inside and he saw all the jewelry. You see, the Saigon Bakery is actually 2 things in one. Up front there is a jewelry store with earrings, necklaces, etc. When you walk to the back there is a small counter where you can order six different kinds of Banh Mi. Kind of carzy, huh!Since I had never had one before I decided to go the traditional route and order the Bahn Mi Saigon- which is pork.The picture came out really bad unfortunately but basically it's a big crusty roll stuffed with pork, pickled carrots, Sliced cucumber, radish, mayo, sriracha sauce and something else I couldn't decipher. It is also topped with a large amount of cilantro which we immediately had to take off due to Mr. T's allergy to the stuff.This sandwich was awesome. I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. For about $4 this thing will easily fill 2 people up for the day. The toasted bread was nice and fresh and all the ingredients just rocked together.After that Mr. T and I decided we couldn't fathom eating any more food and headed towards home. All in all a fantastic, and cheap, day of eatinghttp://www.chinatownicecreamfactory.com/

Mr. T's sister and her husband were going out of town the same weekend my parents were coming in. They offered their apartment to my parents for the weekend and my father couldn't have been happier. He's always loved the Upper West Side and it's more \"refined\" atmosphere.So Saturday morning I woke up and took the long trek from my apartment to meet my parents for brunch at Sarabeth's. As I walked up Amsterdam Avenue I could already see a crowd of people waiting on the sidewalk out front a block away. Luckily my parents had arrived and put their name down 20 minutes before. When I showed up it was only about a 5 minute wait till our table was ready.I was just going to get a coffee to drink, but it being Saturday brunch and all, I asked for a mimosa. Instead of orange juice though I got it with their special flower juice. This is a blend of orange, fresh pineapple, banana and pomegranate juice. The juice was very good but thick. They give you a small bottle of champagne and the fruit juice separately which was great so I could control my own juice to liquor ratio!Everything on the menu looked so good but I decided to go for the Popeye Eggs. This was scrambled eggs on English Muffins with black forest ham and sauteed spinach. The eggs were the best I have ever had. They didn't feel really fluffy when I cut into them but the taste was extremely light and buttery. The English Muffins were about twice as thick as your normal store bought ones. This dish could have easily fed two people and then some.The only thing on the plate I didn't like were the pickled tomatoes it came with on the side. Besides that everything else was stellar.My father decided to go for the pancakes.Wow..the pancakes were huge, soft rounds of goodness. The bananas seemed like they were caramelized a little which really brought out the sweetness and the pure maple syrup just sealed the deal.I would go back to Sarabeth's for brunch in a heartbeat, even if I had to wait an hour. http://www.sarabeths.com/

For my birthday dinner this year I really wanted to go all out and try one of the few 4 star restaurants in NYC. After a LOT of going back and forth I finally decided on Jean Georgeand I am so happy that I did!This will not be a long post and there are not many pictures because I decided that being my birthday, I would relax and just try to enjoy the evening, me & Mr. T. Cameras are great but sometimes you want the experience to be all your own- you know?I will say that everything about the meal was fantastic. The servers were always there filling water, wine and making sure everything was okay but without being intrusive.Our food was spectacular from start to finish and I couldn't have been happier.I actually only took 2 pictures that night- my first course and last.Here are my Blue Fin Tuna Ribbons that came with just the right spice to the ginger sauce and just the right amount of cooling avocado to make the dish silky and luxurious.The other highlight dishes of the night were my rack of lamb that was cooked to perfection with just a hint of mint sauce and Mr. T's turbot that came served table side with a fantastic château chalon sauce.The best for for me though, being the dessert freak I am, was the finish. We had to choose either a chocolate, strawberry or mixed berry dessert. Here's is my chocolate masterpiece:There are actually four different desserts there, each one seemingly becoming more delicious than the last. It was beautiful!I didn't think I could have another bite after this but then they brought out the petite fours and marshmallows followed by some exquisite chocolates with the check. I thought I had died and gone to heaven!So my birthday meal was complete success. Jean George is just one of those places that make you feel special the moment you step in the door. I couldn't have asked for a better birthday!

Mr T & I stumbled across this sushi place a little over a year ago and had a fantastic meal kind of on a whim. We were in the area with his sister and brother-in-law this week and decided to check back and see if our second meal would live up to the first one.When I got the menu I quickly noticed that the $50 tasting menu we had the first time had now raised in price to $55. This is not uncommon, especially since this place was relativity new when we first but I was a little surprised. Nonetheless, we all ordered it because I remember thinking we had gotten a great deal last time.Our waiter came over to get our drink menu and we ended up getting into quite a discussion with him about good beers to have with our meal. Being into beer as much as I am it was nice to have a waiter who understood that beer can match a dish just as well, if not better, than wine.We got our drinks and waited only about 5 minutes before our first dishes started to come out.The first course was a trio of mini appetizers.The first was an oyster that had an incredible ponzu jello sauce on top. I have never been a big fan of oysters but this one may have changed my view on the little suckers. It was really incredible. I only wish I had gotten my camera out before I gobbled it up- oops!The second was tuna tartar topped with a soy foam and caviar. This was alright but I'm honestly kind of sick of the whole tuna tartar thing. I feel like this item has been played out in every Japanese place.The third was a fantastic corn and crab salad that was perfectly refreshing dish for such a steamy summer night.The second course was four different kinds of new style sashimi. The new style sashimi is one of the reasons I love this place so much. It's pieces of sashimi that each have a different sauce to complement the fish. My favorite was the yellowtail with jalapeno and barbecue sauce.The third course was a hot entree from the kitchen. This was an Alaskan King crab cake. This actually sounded a lot better than it actually tasted. The dish was good but I think the great flavor of the King Crab was masked by the bread crumbs and spices. The last time our hot entree was their Rock Shrimp Tempura which I thought was better than Nobu's, so I was a little disappointed in this dish.The fourth course was the sushi platter with miso soup. The sushi was all very fresh and it was nice to see some different pieces of fish that you don't always see on a sushi platter such as the Uni and Unagi. Mr. T's brother-in-law is a huge Uni fan and ended up eating everyone's at the table! At the end of the meal you are offered a scoop of vanilla or chocolate Alphabet City ice cream topped with fresh strawberries.For $55 we all agreed this is still one of the best deals in the city. The fish is fresh and interesting, the space is cool and it just has a nice neighborhood vibe about it.On the way out the bartender even gave us a name of a couple new bars in the area that recently opened where we could score some good beers. All around just a great dinner. If you're in the area I highly recommend checking this place out.http://www.lemiusushi.com/

We had some friends come to visit last week and we ended up in Midtown doing some of the obligatory tourist things. We walked around Tiffany's and stopped by Central Park to enjoy the nice weather.After a few hours we decided we needed to stop and grab a drink. We were right near the Museum of Modern Art so we decided to stop in at the bar for a cocktail. We figured we could kill two birds with one stone- they could say they were at the museum (kind of!) and we could have a break from walking.Upon entering the Modern I loved the open and airy decor. There really isn't much as far as decoration is concerned is just very well....modern looking.We sat down and looked at the cocktail list and the Coming up Roses cocktail caught my eye. The cocktail was described as having Rose Petals, Lime, Rosewater, Bacardi razz and Champagne. Fantastic I thought.We ordered our drinks and as we talked the bartenders got to work in front of us. They brought out the beers and my friends drink and then began to work on my cocktail.Here's the thing. As my cocktail was being made the 2 bartenders began to get into quite a discussion about something going on at the restaurant. As they were talking the one bartender took the bottle of Bacardi Razz and literally filled the glass almost to the top with the liquor.When I tasted my cocktail it was so strong my mouth was on fire. Mr T tried it and summed it up perfectly \"It tastes like an old woman's perfume\".I usually would have sent it back but the staff was back again in an intense television discussion and I didn't feel like trying to get their attention again when I should be enjoying time with my out-of-town friends.So not everything was Rosy at the Modern for me at least....http://www.themodernnyc.com/

So we returned to Resto for dinner with friends on Thursday night. It was a lot more crowded than it was for brunch and we couldn't even get a seat at the bar. The tin ceilings make it quite loud and it was difficult to here everyone once we got seated. Our waiter ended up being the same guy we had at brunch and once again we had excellent service.They have such a fantastic Belgian beer list it was difficult to choose just one. I decided to have the Corsendonk Brown which was a good choice. It was really malty but surprisingly light for a 7.8% beer.For my appetizer I got the special Heirloom Tomato and Bacon salad which was the highlight of the meal. It was so fresh and tasty.Other appetizers were the deviled eggs, sausage special and double cooked pork. The sausage was nothing special but the pork was quite tasty. The deviled eggs on the other hand were the most fattening things I think I've ever eaten. Grease was literally dripping from the toast they were sitting on. I felt like I had just poured a tub of lard down my throat.Instead of a main course I decided to get two more appetizers. The first was the Lobster Croquette. These were alright. The green sauce it came with was interesting but nothing special. I honestly would not have remembered this dish if I hadn't take a picture. Nothing bad- just nothing to great either.The other appetizer I will always remember unfortunately- the lamb ribs.Here's the thing. a friend had ordered them as their appetizer and loved them. Full of meat and really tasty looking. Mine came and while they looked the same, all three ribs were fat. I mean ONLY fat- no meat in any! I was with Mr. T's work friends so I didn't send it back for fear of embarrassing him.I'm still unsure what I feel about Resto. It has great potential but the food is very heavy. I think I will be back for beers at the bar and brunch but that's probably about it.

So I had 2 wonderful friends visit me this weekend and we spent our Saturday night catching up over many great beers at Zum Schnieder and DBA. We woke up on Sunday at 1:00!! I haven't slept that late in ages! We were not feeling too hot to say the least and needed a good brunch to recover.We didn't want to travel far so I suggested just walking up to Penelope. As we got about a block away, we could already see the line of people waiting outside. We decided to make a detour and headed to Resto.We walked in and got a great table in the back. The place was full but not packed. We all felt like a little hair of the dog would make us feel better so we got some mimosas.My friend got a regular one with fresh squeezed orange juice. The acidity of OJ always bothers my stomach so I got one with pineapple juice. This was one of the best mimosas I've ever had.For my meal I decided to get the Egg White Frittata. This was the first fritatta I'd ever eaten. It was good but boring. It just needed something more. Eating a big thing of egg whites isn't too satisfying. If they had put some meat or cheese inside it would have been better.Mr. T opted for their burger which has gotten some high ratings from the food critics in NYC. At first glance the burger looked small and uninteresting. What it actually was so though was rich and decadent. The meat is composed of hanger steak, beef cheek and fatback. The result is something so intense in flavor that Mr. T couldn't even come close to finishing the burger. Our other entree I think was the overall winner- the Croque Madame. This came with Vermont ham and Gruyere cheese. It was tasty and filling. A perfect brunch item that I would go back for in a minute. I really liked Resto. We actually are meeting friends there for dinner on Thursday so we'll see how it goes. They have tons of Belgian beers I'm excited to try and the dessert looks amazing! http://www.restonyc.com/

L'Express has been on our restaurant to do list for about 6 years now. When Mr. T first came to the city to look for apartments the broker took him by this place. He enticed him to the neighborhood with the incentive of a 24 hour restaurant at all times. I guess he figured a young couple like us would be hitting up the bar scene right away, needing food at all hours of the night.Bless you broker, for believing that a junior software developer and a non-for-profit social worker could afford a night out on the town, much less have money for food afterwards!In fact, the largest expense our first year in the city was on a set of ping pong balls! We would take the train down to Kmart and pick up a couple cheap 12 packs of beer and then come back to our apartment and play beer pong. Our apartment had no furniture, so we would sit on the floor of our living room and bounce the ball back and forth trying to land it in a cup of beer.This was a great cheap way to pass the weekend until we discovered our superintendent lived below us. It seems he didn't appreciate the tap, tap, tapping sound coming from his ceiling every Friday night and our games soon ended.Now we are much older and have more money (or maybe just more credit cards?) and L'Express has become a reliable neighborhood joint for us. We didn't feel like going out so we decided to order a Croque Monsieur in.This sandwich is amazing. Look at all that cheese!!! The bread itself is so fresh I wouldn't be surprised if they made it daily. It's nice they give you a huge salad with the sandwich so you don't feel so bad about eating all that artery clogging cheese. This croque is one of the best in the city. If they put maybe one more slice of ham inside it would be perfect but other than that this is a great sandwich. If you're new to the city and broke- splurge the $10 for this sandwich. I'm sure it would taste great after a night of beer pong!

Since Mr. T's birthday fell on a Tuesday this year so we didn't get a chance to celebrate with his family until the weekend. First of all, Mr. T is pretty lucky as this would officially be his 3rd birthday dinner. My birthday is coming up in Septmeber so you'd better believe I've got 3 places picked out!Since we were having an early dinner we meet up at Landmarc in the Time Warner center at 4:00. The TWC is famous formany upscale resturants such as Per Se and Masa. Landmarc is one of the newest additions to the mall.Although most of the tables were filled we easily scored some seats at the bar. Landmarc is basically shaped like a rectangle with one side facing the mall and two sides with large windows that look out onto the streets of Manhattan.Unfortunately the tall buildings right next door blocked much of the sunlight and I found Landmarc to be a little too dark. I noticed our bartender seemed a little depressed and I wondered if it was because of the lack of sunlight on, what was a gorgeous bright summer day.That being said, the lack of light was my only small complaint, I really enjoyed everything else about the place. Directly behind the bar was the open kitchen which added a great vibe to the room. It was fun to sit and watch the food being cooked. The burgers they were making were enormous and smelled wonderful! Mr T's mom and I couldn't seem to stop staring at them and probably would have ordered one if we didn't have a huge dinner coming up.The best part of Landmarc had to be the wine though.Landmarc has an extensive wine list that includes both half and full bottles of wine at extremely reasonable prices. This is a great place to come with a group of friends and try out some different types of wines without breaking the bank.I was excited to see they had the Dashwood Sauvignon Blanche from New Zealand on the menu. I love this wine and at $14 for a half bottle it's a bargain! It really worked out to being about $4-$5 a glass! This was $4.00 cheaper than the wine we had the other night at a local pub(Jake's Saloon- don't ever go!) You won't find a better option in the area.Since we were so happy with prices here you would think we would have stayed for a couple of bottles of wine, right? Well.....Instead we thought- hey we just saved so much money, we can afford to splurge a little on a drink in the Mandarin Orientals bar next door! So we headed over.I was excited because I had never been inside the hotel. It was absolutely gorgeous. We took the elevator to the top floor and where the lobby is located. This is the view from the Lobby Lounge.Wow- It was stunning. Huge windows overlooking the park and Columbus circle. It was really spectacular. Views like these don't come cheap though. The drink menu was a tad more expensive than Landmarc! I decided to order some sort of Peach Martini and Mr. T's dad had a Rob Roy.Behold our (gasp) $17 cocktails!Yum! Just looking at the picture makes me want to go back and get one. It was a fantastic cocktail! There was definitely lots of alcohol inside but it didn't taste strong at all. If I was rich I would drink these babies all night! Maybe this is why Lindsay Lohan has so many problems.I wish I could say this was the most expensive cocktail I have ever had but alas, this is New York and there are more than a few spots that charge this much or more for a cocktail. We went to the Rose Bar at the Gramercy Park Hotel on Mother's Day and cocktails were $20 a piece! I remember the good old days going to their bar with my parents and getting a beer for $5. How things change...Anyway back to events at hand. Every table in the Lobby Lounge had a bowl of floating flowers on it that were absolutely beautiful.They also brought over some black olives for us to much on while we drank that came with some very spicy tortilla chips. Since I knew I wouldn't be able to afford coming back here for a while I decided to make the most of it and scoped the rest of the place out. Of course this means checking out the bathrooms. They did not disappoint! This is a picture of just the sinks. Everything inside was marble and so clean the tiles were literally gleaming. I had pictures of the rest of the bathroom but they seemed to have gone missing. If I can find them I will certainly post them here because these really were fantastic bathrooms. In the end, Mr T's parents ended up picking up the check which was incredibly generous! When I win the lottery or start rolling in the dough for my famous food blogging abilities I'll definitely be returning the favor! Note to self- buy more lotto tickets. After our cocktails we walked over for our dinner. Nobu 57 is the newest of the NYC Nobu restaurant's and the most impressive as far as space and decor are concerned. There were barrels of sake piled in the corners and bamboo covering various parts of the wall. Where the other Nobu restaurants go for a minimalistic approach, this place was going for fun and trendy. It definitely hit the mark. We decided to order a bunch of plates and share everything family style. We started out with Yellowtail sashimi with Jalapeno. The jalapeno gives just the right kick to the silky smooth taste of the sashimi. People always kind of knock Nobu for focusing too much on their hot dishes and not enough on their sushi and sashimi. After trying this dish I highly disagree because in my opinion it was flawless. Our second dish was the King Crab tempura \"Mazu\". This was probably one of my favorite dishes of the night. The crab was cooked with a very light batter and the ponzu sauce was great for dipping the creamy crab into.We followed up the crab with two orders of rock shrimp tempura with creamy spicy sauce. This was the only dish I was a little disappointed in. This used to be what I always ordered at the other Nobu's because of the creamy sauce. Somehow I thought this one fell a little flat and I'm not sure why. The shrimp were bigger than normal and the flavor seemed to be a little lacking It was still a good dish but not the best showing I've ever had. Then came the dish Nobu is probably the most famous for the Black Cod Miso. If you go to Nobu I highly suggest you try this dish. The fish falls apart as soon as you cut into it and it has a caramelized miso top that is one of the best sweet and savory taste combinations I've ever had.We finished up dinner by splitting some desserts of which my favorite was the Banana Caramel Soy Toban Yaki. This was bananas that had been caramelized in soy sauce and then topped with roasted candied pecans and Malaga ice cream. I would have gotten a picture but I couldn't put my spoon down long enough to grab a shot. Why do desserts have to be so good! No trip is complete without a quick stop to check out the bathroom. The bathroom was much like the restaurant. A little over the top as far as decor but nice. The only thing it was missing was the serene music of a babbling brook or ocean waves that the other Nobu's play in theirs. All in all, a fantastic meal! We decided to head out towards home and began walking east. Along the way we walked by the Peninsula Hotel and decided that the day would not be complete without one more stop of extravagance. So we went inside and took the elevator to the very top of the hotel to the Pentop bar.After a few moments we were able to snag a table outside on the terrace. They brought us over some honey roasted nut mix which of course I began to devour even though I could hardly walk a moment earlier because I was so full.We each had a drink and relaxed, taking in the view.The view here wasn't as nice as the Lobby Lounge (listen to me, acting snobby about places I can't even afford), but the warm summer air felt so nice on top of the roof. It was such a relaxing end to a thoroughly indulgent day. So Mr T's birthday extravaganza is finally over and it was an outstanding success. You only turn 30 once. Thank goodness or we'd all be in the pour house! What's on the horizon? Back to the basics: grilled cheese, hot dogs and Coors Light. http://www.landmarc-restaurant.com/twc/http://www.mandarinoriental.com/hotel/532000439http://www.myriadrestaurantgroup.com/nobu/index.html

I love trying out new beers and do so whenever I have the chance. Summer is quickly coming to a close so I'm trying to get in all the new fruit beers out there while I can. At Whole Foods the other day, I saw two I had never seen and decided I would do a beer boxing match.The Match: Southern Tier Brewing Co. Raspberry Wheat vs. Dogfish Head Festina PecheIn the left corner, weighing in with an alcohol % of 4.5, the Dogfish Head Festina Peche.The beer poured a cloudy orange color with a small head that quickly disappeared after about a minute. I went to have a whiff of this beer and it surprising had hardly any smell at all. Their was the slight nose of peach but nothing too strong. I had a sip and my mouth instantly puckered. This beer is has a very tart and sour taste to it unlike any fruit beer I have ever tried before.Next up, in the right corner weighing in at....hmmm...no idea. Nothing written on the label. Automatic deduction for inadequate beer information- The Southern Tier Raspberry Wheat Ale.This beer pours a nice light gold color, with the same dissipating head as the former. The smell of raspberries is quite strong but the taste is not overpowering. The raspberry flavor comes through but so does the wheat of the beer itself.And the winner is.....Hands down The Southern Tier Raspberry Wheat Beer. The sourness of the Dogfish was so much that I didn't even come close to finishing the beer. I was a little disappointed because I love Dogfish Head's other beers, but this one was just to much for me.The Southern Tier was also a little bit too fruity but I enjoyed its light body. A nice beer for drinking when it's 90 degrees outside and the AC is broken.Next match...The battle of the Belgians!!

I can't believe you preferred the Raspberry Wheat. It doesn't taste like anything. The Festina Peche is always perfect, never lacking in flavor, easily one of the best beers on the market, but sadly only available during the summer. I found your post while looking for information on pairing fruit and beer, if you were wondering.

I was grocery shopping at Whole Foods the other day and decided to swing by their beer section to see if they had anything new and interesting. As I was looking through the beers a man came out and started putting some bottles on the shelf that I had never seen before. As I walked over I noticed the big B on the label and realized it was the new Brooklyn beer I had hear about.Zum Schnieder had just hosted a party last week in celebration of this new beer. Apparently the Brewmaster of Schneider brewery and Brooklyn Brewmaster Garrett Oliver have been friends a long time and decided to make a beer together. I love almost all of the Schneider beers and Mr. T and I went to a beer class that was taught by Garrett Oliver and just loved him. So I was extremely excited when I saw the bottles and grabbed one right away.Work was tough this week so it wasn't until Friday night when I finally got to try it out.Upon pouring the beer I was a little put off by the color. It poured a murky orange brown and had a huge head on it. The foamy head was nice as it resembled most German beers I've had. The smell of the beer was very strong of bananas and cloves.Once I gave it a try I realized that it tasted just like it smelled. Bananas, cloves and pepper were very evident. It was interesting because it tasted like a wheat beer and an IPA in one. I'm not sure if I liked it or not. It was a little too hoppy for me. I think it would be better if it mellowed out a bit. I'm thinking about buying one and aging it a little to see if that smooths the taste out. It has an alcohol content of 8.2 and you really taste how strong the beer is. Overall I was pretty disappointed. I guess I'll just stick the my regular wheat beers for the rest of the summer.

I was craving some wings tonight because well... when am I not craving wings. I wasn't feeling like a regular Buffalo style wing so we decided to go for some Japanese.Tebaya is a tiny little place in the Flatiron district that specializes in Japanese finger food. They have a couple great items on their menu but are known most for their Teba Chicken Wings. They use the same recipe for these wings as the ones they sell at their store in Japan.As you can see from the picture, these aren't your average wings. They are fried twice in soy oil which removes almost all of the fat from the wing itself but keeps the juiciness of the chicken inside.Once the wings are fried they cover them in a Teba sauce which is basically a garlic sauce topped with toasted sesame seeds and black peppers. The final result is a wing with extra snappy skin, juicy meat and no visible chunks of fat.The best part about this place is the man who runs it. He is probably the friendliest guy to order from on the phone and our food always comes in less than 20 minutes. This is a great fast and cheap option if your in the area.http://www.goojapan.com/

To celebrate the actual day of Mr. T's birth we meet up with some friends for dinner at RUB. RUB is a BBQ joint that specializes in Kansas City style cue. One of our friends is from Kansas and swears these ribs are the real deal.RUB smokes their meat for hours on the grill and the wondeful smell fills the restaurant and spills out into the street. I secretly think they blow the smoke out onto the sidewalk so it consumes meat obsessed people like me. I've passed by before, and immediately visions of myself ordering every kind of meat imaginable: ribs, brisket, ends, chicken enter my head. Baked beans spilling onto my shirt, fingers covered in greasy, spicy, glorious goodness. And then,It's over. The smell has passed and I am in a sort of stupor as to what had just occured.But luckily, tonight I was not just passing by. I was going to eat. And I was going to eat a lot of meat!I was so excited to get my grub on as soon as we were inside I felt a little crazy because I knew how good it was going to be. My mouth was watering as soon as we stepped inside. It was then I noticed the Burnt Ends were on the chalkboard. I was so happy!! We've been here twice and they were out both times. I was finally going to get to try the ends!!The waitress came over to take our drink order and I got a Shiner Bock beer. There was a big to do when RUB got this beer at their restaurant. Apparently it's the only place in NY State that carries it. No one is even too sure how they get it shipped into the state. The BBQ Baron isn't telling his source either. So since I believe in trying just about anything once- I got one.It ended up being quite good. It poured a dark amber color but surprisingly didn't have much of a smell to it. It was a nice easy drinking bock though. I could see myself picking up a six pack if they ever start selling them in NY.So then the waitress came to take our order and a horrible thing happened. Waitress \"Hey guys just so you know we just ran out of the burnt ends dinner.\"Nooo!! I seriously felt my stomach let out a large mean growl of protest. Once again we had just missed the burnt ends. Sometimes life is just so unfair. So we decided instead to get the St. Louis rib platter of both short and long end beef ribs. The ribs were awesome! The short ribs were a little leaner and the long were a little more greasy. Both had the same hickory rub smoked into their skin. These are seriously great ribs. Other people got some brisket sandwiches and stuff. One looked really good that came with fried green tomatoes and bacon. Yum!!! I am going to try that next time I come.We were really full so decided to skip the deep fried oreos for dessert and just head to the bar next door for an after dinner beer! With tip for 5 people we ended up paying about $35 a person which is pretty good considering we each had at least 2 beers and there was plenty of food left over what with all the sides and such. I love RUB. But I also love Blue Smoke, Hill Country and Houston's. I am planning to try and eat at all of them in one week to do a more side by side comparison but for now lets just say any 'que is good 'que.http://rubbbq.net/

Mr. Trekker has been wanting to try out Morimoto since it opened over a year ago so I decided to take him out for his birthday dinner there. Since it was a special occasion we went all out and ordered the chef's omakase. I enjoy omakase because it takes the struggles of ordering off of oneself and you get to try a little of everything.It was a nine course tasting of which only a few of the pictures came out well. I'll only talk about some of the dishes we really enjoyed. The place itself is all white with track lighting on the walls. It was a sleek beautiful space but not so conducive to picture taking.The first course was Toro Tarter that came with creme fraiche, wasabi, rice balls, cilantro avocado and dashi-soy for dipping. It was topped with Osetra Cavier. This dish was only okay. It was a standard dish I would expect in any sushi joint. Nothing special.Our second dish was steamed scallops and mussels with white asparagus, tomatoes and micro greens in a light vinaigrette.This dish was fantastic! My second favorite of the night. The scallops melted away as I tried to pick them up and even the mussels (which I usually hate) were soft with a smokey flavor. Our next dish was a kumamoto oyster that came filled with foie gras and uni. Then the whole thing was topped off with teriyaki sauce. Okay, I hate foie gras and uni and don't really care for oysters. That being said though...this dish rocked! I have no idea why it was so good but all of the flavors just worked together. I actually finished the whole thing. Our next curse turned out to be sushi. Usually sushi comes at the very end of the meal instead of the middle so we thought that was a little odd. I was actually thinking they had messed up and we were going to be missing courses. I started to get really nervous but it turns out that's just the way they do things here.I was a little disappointed in the sushi. The fatty tuna was a little tough and the mackerel I just didn't care for at all. The other two were decent but nothing spectacular. I have no idea what they were because our server had such a thick accent it was impossible to understand him.After the sushi course they brought us a pot of tea and a green tea black sesame macaroon as a palate cleanser. The macaroon was hands down the best one I've ever had. It was really small-only about one bite. I could easily throw down about 20 of these- no joke. If they ever start selling these things by the pound I will have trouble fitting into my tiny apartment.Next came our two hot dishes. First up the lobster.The lobster was Mr. T's favorite dish of the night. It was half a lobster tail that had been roasted in a garham masala making it spicy. It came with a side of lemon creme fraiche that was great for dipping the lobster into and cooling it down a little.The last hot dish was my favorite of the night- the Wagyu beef filet. Unfortunately the picture came out too dark but the meat was amazing. It was cooked a perfect medium rare and was so tender it was like cutting into butter.For dessert we had some sort of graham flavored cake topped with peaches and a peach sorbet. It was refreshing after such a big meal but nothing fantastic. So that was our meal at Morimoto. Did I think it was good? Yes.Will I go back? Probably not.I have had much better Japanese food at Nobu, Le Miu and En Japanese Brasserie for less money. The bill here was pretty huge. I would say how much but I'm scared my father will read this and have a heart attack. So rather than send him to an early grave I'll just leave it at that.http://morimotonyc.com/

So in case you can't tell we've been on a big lobster roll kick lately. I know we have to stop, but Mr. T's brother and sister-in-law where visiting from Florida so it was a great excuse.We were meeting friends later in the East Village so The Mermaid Inn seemed like the most logical choice. We showed up at 6:00 and got a table right away in their back patio. The patio itself was small but nice. It did seem a little like we were sitting in the back of someone's house but in a good way.We started out with a bottle of the SOAVE 2005, La Cappuccina. This was an Italian white wine that was extremely crisp with lots of citrus. It was perfect for the humid, hot weather we were having.We were all starving so decided to skip out on appetizers and head straight for the entrees. Three of us ordered the lobster sandwich and one of us got the grilled Mahi Mahi.The lobster sandwich is exactly what it says- a sandwich. Instead of a hot dog bun it comes on a roll that's been grilled and coated with butter. The bun was good although I do prefer your more traditional roll. The lobster salad itself was great. It had less mayo and bigger chunks than Penelope's version. The fries were crisp and coated with Old bay seasoning which tasted great with the rich creamy texture of the lobster salad.Investigative reporting under the bun. I never got a picture of the Mahi Mahi but it looked fantastic It came with chive mashed potatoes that were bright green. I will definitely be coming back here to try that dish.Since they don't offer dessert here they give everyone chocolate pudding at the end for free. The pudding was good- nothing special but a nice touch I thought. It came with a fortune telling plastic fish. You place it in the palm of your hand and depending on what it does- that's your fortune. One curled up in a ball, one persons tail wiggled, one rolled over. Fun right? What did mine do? Nothing. Dead fish it said. I tried every one thinking mine might just be a dud, but as soon as it got in my hand it just laid there. Stupid fish.So the Mermaid Inn was nice. Again I still like Pearl & Mary's roll the best but this is again a nice, relaxed alternative.After dinner we went and had some beers at D.B.A. This place is known for having hundreds of hard to find beers that change on a daily basis. I've been here a bunch of times before and always really enjoyed it. Tonight however they seemed to be out of everything! I asked about seven different beers they had listed on the board and all were out. Why not erase them off the board then? I did finally have a new beer that I enjoyed- the Kelso Saison. It was quite sweet with lots of carbonation. I probably wouldn't buy any to have at home but like the wine, it was perfect for the hot weather. The Kelso brewery is in Brooklyn so I'll definitely keep my eye out for some more of their beers.http://themermaidnyc.com/http://drinkgoodstuff.com/

We wanted to grab a bite to eat the other night near home so we decided to try out Borough Food & Drink. We had been here for the opening party to try out some of their stuff which was pretty good. Since then it's gotten a lot of press for having an excellent Burger so we thought we'd give it a shot.It was about 6:00 on a Tuesday night and the entire place was filled. We were able to get the last table on the patio luckily and sat down right away. They started off by bringing over a free jar of pickled vegetables for us. I thought they were alright. I'm not really a fan of pickled veggies on their own. I need some sort of fatty meat to eat with them otherwise the taste is just too overpowering.We weren't super hungry so we decided to split an appetizer and a burger. We got the Guanciale & Ricotta flatbread. The base was charred nice and crispy and the ricotta cheese was melted into the meat and then topped with rosemary. The flatbread was a little too oily for me but other than that it was good.Next up was the burger which we had ordered medium rare. Unfortunately the picture didn't turn out to well with the sunlight streaming in but you can still see that it came clearly medium to well done. That being said I was really surprised how moist the burger still was.The juices were literally seeping out of the burger. It had cheddar cheese on top and a caper aioli on the bottom. The aioli gave the burger a nice flavor that I hadn't had before in a burger and the cheese was extremely fresh. I would like to try this again and see how it is medium rare. All in all good meal though.

So my oldest and dearest friends came to visit this weekend for some fun time in the city and a Yankees game. We woke up on Sunday after lots of day drinking at the game and needed a good brunch.Mr. T and I have been to Dos Caminos only once for dinner so I was a little apprehensive about bringing my friends here for brunch. It started off a little rough too.We were seated immediately and then waited for almost 20 minutes as people all around us, who had come in later, ordered their meals. We were extremely dehydrated and hadn't even been given water. I was starting to sweat out the little moisture I had inside when our waiter finally came over.After that hiccup it was smooth sailing. Our waters were filled immediately, our drinks were brought within moments and our food came out quickly.The special is any entree with a free brunch cocktail. A couple of us got your standard mimosas and a couple of us got their Prickley Pear Margarita.The margarita was really good !! I don't know if it was just the fact that we all were hung over and needed a little something to feel better or if was really just that awesome. It was a little too frozen when it first came but melted nicely.For my entree I strayed a little from your standard brunch fare and got the Mahi Mahi fish tacos. These came with a spicy coleslaw on the side and some chili, tomato and avocado crushed on top. It was really good. I don't like rice and beans so I didn't touch them. Two of my friends got the Breakfast Quesadilla. This thing was HUGE! Mr. Trekker joked that there was a dozen eggs in it but he probably wasn't far off. It was really tasty but it honestly could have used less of everything. There was so much egg and the pieces of bacon were enormous. It was hard to even taste the tortilla! Both of them only finished about a quarter of it. I would get it if we went back but definitely to split with someone else. My other friend got the Huevos En Cazuela. This was poached eggs in a tomato chipotle salsa. I didn't think I would like this when I tried it was it was also good. I wish I would have found out what kind of cheese was inside because it was really soft like a goat cheese but had a much lighter, less pungent taste.The only complaint I have besides the start of the meal was honestly the portions. There was just too much food! But hey, I guess that's not a bad thing. I had fish tacos for brunch and dinner!http://brguestrestaurants.com/

So we were so exhausted from cooking our tacos the night before we decided to order in from Rice.The first time we had Rice was when we went to visit Mr. Trekker's brother and sister-in-law in DUMBO and we fell in love. So we were psyched when they opened one near us. Unfortunately this one always seems to mess up our order somehow so we don't get it as much as we thought we would, but tonight we only ordered one thing so it came alright.We got an order of their Jerk Chicken Wings. As you'll notice these wings are much smaller than your regular Buffalo Wings and they're grilled not fried. They have a lot of Caribbean spices marinated on them and are topped with grated coconut.The result is really moist and tender chicken that almost falls apart as you pick it up. The grilling gives it a great smokey almost BBQ flavor. They are fantastic wings! If you get them definitely order a party pack because they are addicting. These were gone in about 5 minutes.http://riceny.com/

So we hardly ever eat in for two simple reasons:1. We aren't very good cooks2. We are extremely lazyTo be honest it's more of number 2. I think we could have the ability to be good cooks if we weren't so addicted to television.Anyway one of the things that has made cooking at home for us a lot easier was the opening of Trader Joes in Manhattan. I had always heard about this grocery store first for it's cheap wine but their prepared food has some great stuff.One new item we're loving is their Chipotle Lime Chicken Strips.These chicken strips just need to be heated in the microwave for 2 minutes and are ready to go. They have a great chipotle flavor that's smooth- not spicy. We've been making tacos with them for weeks now. Actually everything in the picture below for this meal we got from Trader Joe's.I honestly think the whole meal cost about $12 -$13. We used the left over tortillas to make wraps for lunch and used the left over lettuce and cheese as part of dinner another night. Pretty good deal right?All you do is heat the chicken and then throw everything except the lettuce in a shell and throw it on a Griddle. We use our Cuisinart Griddler that we just got and it's awesome. Look at the finished product. It's a mess of gooey, cheesy goodness. That takes about 2 minutes to put together. Ah...I love you Trader Joes!

So we met up with Mr. Trekkers folks this weekend since we had been visiting mine the week before. We started out by having a drink at The House. The House is a new place that recently opened in our neighborhood. It's actually a restored carriage house that is really beautiful. We had eaten here before and the food was nothing special but the bar is lovely so if you're in the area it's a great place to grab a glass of wine.After drinks we decided to head over to Gramercy Tavern for an early dinner. We got a great spot right at the corner of the bar so we could all talk easily. Gramercy Tavern is one of my top 5 favorite places in the city. I have been here many times both in the regular dining room and the tavern room and while both are great I enjoy the Tavern room the most. The big glass windows are great for people watching and something about the long wooden bar just makes you feel right at home. Plus they have an amazing vintage beer list that is unprecedented in the city.I wasn't feeling beer at the moment though so I opted for a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc and Mr. T got an Aventinus. As we perused the menu we snacked on their nut mix which has a spicy glaze on top. Since it was early we decided just to have a light meal. Mr. T's mom and I both liked the looks of the pulled pork sandwich so we decided to spilt it. I have split meals at the Gramercy Tavern bar a few times and its so nice. They always split it for you and bring it out on separate plates so there's no fussing around with cutting and passing food back and forth. The pulled pork was nice and juicy. It had just the right amount of greasiness. The pickled carrots and onions it came with were excellent although I shyed away from the jalapenos.Mr. T decided to get the soft shell crab appetizer which he said was excellent. It was actually a nice sized crab but all the greens it came with completely covered it in the picture.Gramercy Tavern does some of the best desserts in the city but we decided to over to Bar Stuzzichini since the parents had never been there before. We got an order of cannolis and the parents called it a night. We got a call from a friends that they were at the Borough Food & Drink bar so we stopped by on the way home. The place was hopping! Luckily we got a seat at the bar and intrigued by the name, I deicided to try the Southampton Secret Ale. The beer poured a deep copper and had a spicy molasses flavor to it. It was a little to hoppy for me so I probably wouldn't order it again but it was decent.I am always on the search for the best bathrooms in the city so I decided, why don't I start taking pictures of them! Borough's were nothing special but nice because there are about 5 single bathrooms. There's nothing better than a single bathroom! Anyway that was my Saturday!http://thehousenyc.com/http://gramercytavern.com/http://www.chinagrillmgt.com/

Bar Bill Tavern - These are real Buffalo Wings

So no trip to Buffalo is complete without the two things this place is known for: wings & Beef on weck.My favorite place for wings is the Bar Bill Tavern. I have been to this place over a hundred times in my life. The wings are always made extra crispy with a lot of meat and flavor. The service here is also great. The bartenders get to know your name and you'll see anyone from an elderly woman eating alone to families to guys just getting drunk. This food knows no boundaries.Now when people think of Buffalo wings they usually think of hot wings. At the Bar Bill they have extended to a bunch of different flavors than your usual hot, medium & mild. The first order we got was the Sicilian wings. These are wings covered in Italian dressing with Parmesan cheese grated on top. Unfortunately it was really dark in the bar and I had also had a couple of beers so the pictures are not the best but here are the Sicilian wings Sicilian wings close up- see all the cheese on top!Next up we got the medium wings and an order of beer fries. Don't the wings just look crispy! Medium is the way to go here. I usually order hot at other places but the hot here is REALLY HOT. If you don't want to be crying as your eating your wings go for the medium. The last order we got is my favorite kind the Honey Butter BBQ. This is the best sauce of all. The only thing that could make these wings better would be a little more sauce. Next time I think I'll ask for some extra sauce on the side. And lastly, the Beef on Weck. This is basically roast beef that has been cooked very slowly and comes on top of a Kaiser roll with salt on the top. The meat in these sandwiches is so moist the top and bottom of the bun almost get mushy because of all the juice that flows out of the beef. Again the picture does not do it justice. We ended up eating here three times during our trip but of course I only had my cell phone camera on me all three times. Next time I go back I will take some better pictures with a regular camera. Anyway if you're in Buffalo don't let anyone tell you any different- this is THE place to go for some wings.

So I've been hearing people in Buffalo talk about La Nova's pizza for years but had never tried it myself. Why?First of all I live in NYC where great pizza joints are on every block.Second of all it is in one of the worst areas of Buffalo. Honestly, it's kind of scary. Not the kind of place you want to be walking around at night.Anyway, while hanging out with friends this weekend La Nova's name came up on three different occasions followed by \"It's soo good! You have to try it!\" So we decided to take a drive and check it out. We got some pizza at the place itself and ordered some to go so my mom could also try it. Here's our take out box They offer your regular slice and a square slice so we decided to get a couple of each. The square slice was enormous! The thing about both of these slices we liked the most was the crust. The square slice has almost a bread stick crust with sesame seeds on top. It was really crunchy. The regular slice had a buttery crust with a little bit of crispy cheese baked in. We liked this version better.The pizza has a great sauce which is why I could see some people love it. It's also extremely greasy and cheesy which would make it great food after a night of beer drinking. That being said it was good pizza. Worth traveling out of your way for- definitely not. I have to say I have had better pizza elsewhere in Buffalo and certainly in NYC. But if you find yourself drunk in this area of Buffalo late at night, grab yourself a slice, enjoy it's greasiness......and then get the Hell out of there!

So my parents & brother have been raving about this new place that opened in East Aurora called Rick's on Main. I had heard so much about it I asked that we all meet there as soon as we got back from the airport for dinner.First of all the outdoor space is really nice. They have a huge wrap around porch that looks out onto Main street which in any other town might mean lots of noise. Luckily East Aurora is a quiet town so the view is nice and they had plenty of tables.Also the service was impeccable the entire night. Our waiter made sure our drinks were always full and accommodated all of our special requests.Everyone told me I had to get the crab cakes as my appetizer and man- they were fabulous! Look at these cakes!Just looking at the photo again makes my mouth water! The cakes sit atop a remoulade and sweet chili thai sauce. My Father & Brother are big fans of the sauce and I was as well. The 2 flavors went really well with the crab. But honestly I had a bite of just the crab cake alone and I have to say the cake itself is really just one of the best I have ever had. It's really hard to find a perfect crab cake where it's not too bready, rich or heavy. This cake was just light enough. Really delicious!For my main I got the Tuna special which was described as sashimi grade tuna served rare to medium rare with basmati rice and a vegetable julienne. Now for some reason I pictured thin slices of rare tuna atop some vegetables. When it came out I was a little disappointed to see an actual huge tuna steak cooked more medium than anything. The dish was very good though. It was way to much food and Mr. Trekker & I both left half of our plates but the flavors again blended well. I chose to swap out the rice for some sauteed greens.The tuna looks small in the picture but it took up half of the plate! One of the other specials of the night was the cornmeal encrusted halibut which was also excellentMy sister-in-law suggested the best dessert of the night which was their apple pie. This was covered in cinnamon crumbles and a light Carmel sauce. Yum!!!!! I was so full at this point but I just couldn't seem to stop eating it!Since it was such a nice summer night I decided to try out the seasonal beer they were offering the Black Dog Honey Raspberry Ale. This beer was really nice. The fruit flavor was light so it came through but wasn't overpowering. Really a great easy to drink summer ale.So I would say Rick's was one of the best dining experiences I have had in East Aurora in a long time. Possibly the best crab cakes I have ever had. We liked it so much we went back the next day again for an early dinner! The only thing I didn't get a picture of was their special summer salad my sister-in-law ordered. I think I was so into my food at that point that I just assumed I had taken a picture of it.It was greens with all sorts of raspberries, blueberries, honey roasted nuts and a couple of other things I just can't seem to remember. It was also excellent and one of the prettiest dishes of the night with all of the different colors (why didn't I get a picture!!!) Oh well- it's a great excuse to go back again! Just an excellent dinner with my favorite people- Thanks Dad!http://ricksonmain.com/

So we just came back from a trip to Buffalo to visit family and see some friends. We a fantastic yet exhausting visit so I'm not sure how much I will post tonight. All flights last night were cancelled due to bad thunder storms and we had to catch a very early plane this morning that was also delayed. So our usual 1 hour plane trip ended up taking us in total about 20 hours. I really need some sort of laser transporter.

So two Lobster Rolls in two days is pretty extravagant but we're celebrating our nations independence right? So we headed to our neighborhood place Penelope tonight. This place is so close to us but we've only been there 3 times. For some reason we always forget about it, which is too bad because the food is always great.Mr. Trekker got the lobster sandwich and I got the warm chicken meatballs arugula salad. Now in contrast to Ditch Plains this one was much more of a salad. The lobster was chopped fine with more mayonnaise and celery. Even thought there was less lobster I preferred this version. The lobster flavor actually came through and wasn't over powered by spices. Also it was only $17- a cool $8 cheaper than Ditch Plains. The french fries here are also great. Nice and crispy and seasoned with rosemary.My meal was also fantastic. I've had this before and it was just as good. The salad dressing has a great zingy taste and the warm chicken meatballs are just a perfect match for the somewhat bitter arugula. Penelope is just a nice place to relax and enjoy an evening. If your in the area stop by- you won't be disappointed.http://www.penelopenyc.com/

So we decided to have dinner at Ditch Plains to celebrate the 4th of July and was it ever good! First of all the space is nice. It has an open airy feeling about it with nice big booths to chill out in. We started with a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc and some clam strips to start. The clams were fried nicely with just enough crunch to them.For mains we got their signature dish which you won't find on the menu- the Ditch Dogs. Behold them in all their cheesy, greasy glory: Two hot dogs topped with mac & cheese and crispy french fries! Oh yes- it was as good as it looks. I would like to re-create this at home but that could be a dangerous endeavor. Sooo good!For our other dishes we got the special sandwich of the day the Shrimp Po' Boy: Then we got the lobster roll. This was good but probably one of my least favorite in NYC. It had a lot of spices in it. We were trying to figure out what they were, maybe celery root and paprika? Not sure but the spices over took the great taste of the lobster. The sweet potato chips were pretty good though. Better then I thought they would be.Then we also got a Caesar salad. Which was really tasty. Sorry the picture is so blurry. My camera kept heading towards the Ditch Dogs (was that my camera or my mouth... )To end they gave us a bunch of Salt Water Taffy with the check. I thought that was a nice touch. All in all a great meal. We will be back to try some of the other menu items that looked fantastic- especially their clam chowder- yum!http://www.ditch-plains.com/

If you have to go to Yankee Tavern- Get a Pastrami Sandwich

So we went to the Yankees game last night and needed a place to meet up for a few drinks and food before the game. If you've ever been to a Yankee game you know that for some reason every bar in the area has music blaring so loud you have to shout to be heard.We were looking for some place where we could actually hear ourselves talk and decided to go to the back part of Yankee Tavern. We ordered some beers and some food. We got the Pastrami sandwich, zucchini sticks and something that I think was called the Home Run Platter. This was basically a platter with a hamburger, hot dog, mozzarella sticks and buffalo wings. Now obviously we weren't expecting much. As you can see most of these foods are artery clogging fried delights conducive to beer drinking but alas even all of the oil couldn't save the meal.The zucchini sticks were limp, the buffalo wings were super salty and the mozzarella sticks were cold. The only dish that fared well was the pastrami sandwich. It was funny because when I walked over the check out the bathrooms later on I realized that about 50% of the people inside seemed to be eating some sort of sandwich. I guess they all knew what we didn't know.

So I went to Highline for lunch today. We walked in around 12:30 and were the only people in the place. Maybe it was because of the holiday tomorrow or maybe all of the construction going on outside, but we were shocked it was empty. We sat down and I ordered a Thai iced tea to drink. My drink was lovely when it came but it was way too sweet! I have enjoyed better ones at Spice. For my appetizer I got the Chicken & Shrimp Fritters. These were very good. Just the right crunchiness and had a great dipping sauce on the side. For my main I got the garlic and vegetables with beef. This was very good also. Your standard Thai dish in the city. I am not a huge eater for lunch so I thought the portion size was perfect. Someone else might find the size a little on the smaller side though.For $10 in the Meatpacking district I don't think it gets any cheaper.On my way home I was craving some sweets. I stopped in Chelsea Market for a free brownie sample from Fatwich, but that didn't satisfy me enough. I decided to walk up to Billy's bakery because I haven't been there in a while. I got a cupcake to eat on the way home and some cookies to go. The cupcake was good but the frosting was more sugary than I remember it being. I honestly ate about half and then couldn't get down any more.Once I got home I dived into the cookies. I got a peanut butter one and a molasses butterscotch cookie. The peanut butter cookie was fantastic. chewy in the middle and crisp on the outside. The molasses butterscotch was good but again a little too sugary for my tastes. I honestly had a little stomach ache afterwards. http://nychighline.com/http://billysbakerynyc.com/

So to start off my first ever blog I decided to begin with a salute to my hometown Buffalo. Although I moved to NYC about 6 years ago I still have a big spot in my heart for the place that fed me for so many years. Also I will probably post some pictures from when I go back of better wings but for now here are the original- Anchor Bar. The place that invented the Buffalo Wing. Not the best in Buffalo but the place is fun and it's got history. If you're in the area it's worth checking out.

Small Tasting Review of Borough Food & Drink

***CONTENT
So we attended the neighborhood party opening at Borough last night and it was lots of fun. Free food and drink? It doesn't get much better than that!First of all the space is much better than it used to be. Everything is wood paneled and they put a pool table in the back which is nice if you just want to chill and have some drinks with friends.If you don't already know, everything is from New York State including the beverages. They have a lot of great beers on tap from Ommegang to some harder to find beers like Mothers Milk Stout- both of which I love. They were giving out free wine and cocktails as well. I only had the chardonnay which was nice but a lot of people seemed to be enjoying their sweet apple martini.Okay onto the food.Unfortunately it got packed as the night went on so we couldn't get everything they were offering but here's some of what we sampled:Fried pickles- if you like fried pickles you'll enjoy these. Nice and crispy.Fried chicken- very good- came with a side of NY maple syrup for dipping.Jerk Chicken- my FAVORITE of the night hands down. Perfectly spiced and juicy.Cheeseburger- they were giving out slider sizes so I can't be completely objective on how it will taste as a solid burger but the way the juices held together and it was cooked just right makes me think it will be a success. Came with lettuce, tomato and mayo. I really think these could be a hit if they kept them just as sliders.BBLT sandwich- this was good, nothing special though. I would never order it as I've probably made myself one just as good.Bacon and Ricotta flat bread- this was alright, a little too oily for my tastes though.We also had their polish sausage and Cevape with beef sausages- both were awesome. I want to go back and try their sausage plate when they fully open.They also brought around some desserts- I tried the baklava and ice cream sundae. I found the baklava to be a little to heavy (not like baklava is meant to be a light dessert) but the flakes just weren't flaky enough for me. The sundae hit the spot though.So all in all I will surely be going back. I really am hoping this place makes it.

Have you ever been to a place where you feel you could just sit and linger at the bar all night and be perfectly content and relaxed? Up till now that spot was reserved for Gramercy Tavern but I have to say Bar Stuzzichini is up there.Stopped in for a drink on Saturday night around 7:00 and there were only 2 other people in there. I ordered a glass of Italian white wine. They give you a GREAT pour which is always nice. Mr. Trekker was excited because they had Saison dupont on tap.We didn't order anything to eat because we had a dinner scheduled afterwards but everything about the place made us wish we didn't have to leave. The bar itself is gorgeous and the dining room has beautiful red walls and pretty lights. They played Frank Sinatra the entire time we were there and the staff were warm and friendly. I was really surprised there were so few people there. Hopefully this place will catch on-I would hate to see it go. This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I will be going back soon to try out the food.

Weekend Review- Highlight Lure Burger

***CONTENT
This weekend was filled with lots of good fun food and drinks so I thought I would write a review. Friday a bunch of us met up at Zum Schneider around 5:30 and snagged a table. I got my usual potato pancakes. They are always so good! Honestly I think they are the best in the city- really crispy. And the salad that it comes with has a really tasty dressing. Unfortunately we enjoyed our time there a little too much with the big German beers and woke up on Saturday not feeling too good.We basically rested most of the day but decided we would go out for a good dinner. Mr Trekker was still recovering so he wanted only a quiet and relaxed place. I was craving a good burger and have heard that Lure Fish Bar's was good so we decided to go there.We showed up at 6:00 (we were in Florida last week and are still on that early dinner time it seems). The place only had two other groups eating so it was basically empty which was exactly what we were looking for being still a little beat up from the previous night. The decor itself was like being inside a cruise ship but it a polished sort of way. We got seated at one of the nice big booths and started with some cocktails. I got the Tangerine Dream and he got the Spiked Arnold Palmer. Both were terrific.We decided to start with the Lobster Croutons and to split the Lobster Roll and Lure Burger as our mains. The Lobster Croutons came and they were basically six stamp sized pieces of toast topped with a lobster salad. They were good but I wouldn't order them again. They were a little too buttery for me and for $14 kind of a weak portion.Our mains came and we were psyched. I got my burger and it just looked glorious. I looked over at Mr Trekker's lobster roll and was more than impressed. It was overflowing with meat. I was so glad we had decided to share! So the burger itself? Phenomenal. I don't know what they do but this is a seriously good burger. Nice char, perfectly cooked medium rare as I had requested and there was some kind of sauce on it that I couldn't place but it went really well. Not a Shake Shack Mayo sauce but almost more like BBQ. It also came with 2 onion rings which were the sweet red onions. I actually didn't care for them but Mr T loved them.The real surprise though was the lobster roll. It was up to par with Pearl and Mary's. The bun itself could have done with a little less butter, as the lobster croutons could have, but other than that it was fantastic. Both came with some nice crispy french fries which we honestly didn't eat much of because we were too focused on our mains.Service was impeccable the entire time. Our water glasses were always filled and our waiter was attentive and friendly. We even ended up getting into a discussion with him about the best burgers in the city! Everyone there was extremely nice without being intrusive. Both of us agreed, some of the best service we've had in the city.Mr T and I were too full for dessert although they had some that looked wonderful. Overall- a perfect meal. It was exactly what we were looking for. So good we are even thinking about going again for lunch on Friday! For 2 people including 2 bottles of water, 2 cocktails, a beer and a glass of wine it came to $120 plus tip. Not cheap but not overly expensive either. I highly recommend this to anyone.One weird thing though- by the time we were leaving the place was filling up and we counted 3 different people in there wearing baseball caps at their tables. Isn't that a little odd? Just something we found unusual and thought I would mention.Anyway we woke up Sunday and wanted bacon and eggs but didn't want to go far so we walked over to Choice Kitchen & Cocktails which is nearby. Our bacon and eggs were good, not great but it did the job. Definitely not a destination place by any means but a good neighborhood standby.All in all a great food weekend!http://www.zumschneider.com/http://www.lurefishbar.com/

My parents came to visit for the weekend, which is always the best excuse to eat out for every meal of the day!Thursday night we went to Alta and had a fantastic meal. We showed up right around 8:00 with no reservation and were seated immediately right near the fireplace on the first floor. We ordered too many things to write about but I'll give you the favorites of the table. Spinach salad with dried cherries was great- those 2 flavors go together so well together. Goat cheese w/ honey, confit of pork tenderloin, lamb meatballs and Moroccan spiced cashews (so good we ordered 2) were all fantastic. The 2 potato dishes, one with paprika and one with trout creme fraiche I wouldn't order again. Just not very tasty. Overall though a great meal. My only complaint was the pacing of the dishes. We got about 5 dishes at once literally 2 minutes after we had ordered. They kept coming in this sort of fashion. There was barely enough room on the table for them all. I wish they would maybe give you 2 at a time so you have a chance to taste them and talk about what you like.Friday my parents went to the Met so we grabbed a drink at Cafe Sabarsky nearby. Cute place, very nice decor and the piano was being played. I have to say I never felt comfortable though. I just felt it was really stuffy and that everyone inside was very well...snobby? I don't know. I am not in that neighborhood very often so I guess I'm not used to that type of crowd. My father raved about the desserts though so I was happy.We shot down to the village after that to Mary's Fish Camp. We got there about 7:30 and only had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. First of all, the service was fantastic! It's such a small and crowded place where it must be very difficult to work at since it's always so busy. But our waitress always had a smile and made sure we were taken care of. I had slipped her my credit card prior to the meal so my parents wouldn't pay and she was great about just slipping me the receipt to sign at the end and even told my parents they were so lucky to have such a great daughter! Okay, enough about me, onto the food.We started with the beet salad, conch fritters and steamers. The beet salad was a disappointment. Onion and mandarin oranges were mixed in with the beets and it just didn't work for me. The beets themselves were sort of bland and all I tasted honestly was the orange. The conch fritters were just alright. Again the flavor of the conch was overtaken by the corn and spices mixed in. Steamers were great.For mains my mom and I had the lobster rolls- fantastic! Identical to Pearl's but for some reason they just tasted better to me. Mr Trekker had the lobster pot pie, which he enjoyed, but it had very little lobster inside. He said he wouldn't order it again. My father had the scallops and loved everything about them. It came with some sort of beet rice. Here the flavor of the beets came out and worked really well with the scallops. For dessert we shared a hot fudge sundae and the banana pudding- both superb! I would definitely come back to Mary's again before Pearl. Overall I just found the atmosphere more comfortable and service and food a step above.Got up Saturday and went to brunch at Cafe Mozart with some other relatives. Can't comment on their dishes but my poached eggs in my country breakfast were perfect and the Crème Bruelle French toast was yummy. We had some desserts- black forest cake and peanut butter fudge cake. Both were decadent and delicious. Again we enjoyed the atmosphere but the service could have used a little work. An hour went by between getting our dessert and getting our bill. We kept trying to flag someone down but the servers seemed a little confused. It was busy though so I would come back again maybe on a less busy day.For dinner that night we went to a local fave of mine Giorgio's of Gramercy. For starters we had the fried calamari and vegetables. I have gotten this dish here before and it was great. This time though it tasted different. There was some sort of spice throughout everything that I couldn't recognize but it took over. Halfway through eating it Mr T stopped because the taste was getting to be too much for him. It wasn't a horrible dish; it just wasn't executed as well as it could have been.For my main I had the fillet Mignon, which was cooked to perfection. My mother had the chicken, which was moist and delicious. Other dishes of pork and lamb were loved by all. Such a relaxing, nice place that always seems to deliver without breaking the bank.For dessert we headed across the street to Metrocafe and had their chocolate cake. The place was packed! I was shocked at how many people were there! It's a good sign though since I love their cake and their beers on tap are always stellar.For brunch this morning we tried to get into Penelope but I couldn't even get through the door! So we decided to check out Petite Abeille instead. We had the waffles with berries, au Gruyere omelet and the coquette. Everything was great. The food came out quickly, our waitress was friendly and the creme brulee we had for dessert made for a great end. I will definitely be back to partake in their many Belgian beers, which at 11:00 this morning seemed a bit aggressive!http://altarestaurant.com/http://wallse.com/http://www.giorgiosofgramercy.com/http://www.petiteabeille.com/http://metrocafenyc.com/

So we had our wedding present dinner for our favorite couple at Cru this past Friday.The night itself didn't start out exactly perfect. I woke up on Friday morning with a horrible sore throat and cough. Luckily I was able to leave work a little early and come home and take a 2 hour nap before dinner which made me feel about 20 times better. We decided to meet at Olives for drinks to start. Mr Trekker and I arrived to see the crowd was about 3 people deep at the bar. The same was to be said for Candela's bar so we decided to go to the Belmont Lounge as it was right on the same block. When the other couple arrived they informed us that they had to wait a minute to come in because someone was pissing right outside the entrance. That's a lovely start to a special evening I thought!After a drink there we got a cab over to Cru. We got there right at 8:30 and only had to wait about 2 minutes to be seated. First of all, the space was just beautiful. I just loved how clean and elegant everything seemed. We had a great table away from the center of the room so we were very happy.Now I'm sorry to say I have no idea what the names of the wines we had were but they were all fantastic. The couple we were with are very into wines so they did all the choosing. The sommelier was very helpful and we started out with an excellent white wine.They started off by giving us 2 amuses before we even ordered our meal which was nice because we were taking our time deciding what to get. Our waiter was so helpful! Two of us are on the small side so he steered us away from the tasting menu which was very heavy on the rich foods. Thank goodness he did because I was so full at the end with just the 3 courses!To start the men had the seared toro, my sister-in-law had the scallops and I had the rock shrimp salad. The salad was fantastic. There was a horseradish sauce on top that was amazing! The toro was good- nothing special- but my sister-in-law said the scallops were the best she had ever had.For our main courses we had the short ribs, lobster and venison. I can't tell you how good all of these were. (It's so nice going to eat with people who like to share!) The venison was so tender is was literally falling apart and not gamey what so ever. The lobster was covered in some sauce that complemented it perfectly and the short ribs came with a sesame sauce. They were very rich but again incredibly tender. I have to say the best short ribs I had before this were at Eleven Madison and these blew those out of the park.For dessert we got a cheese plate, honey crisp apple beignet, passion fruit cheesecake and I got some sort of pumpkin pudding. I have to say mine was the best! So flavorful--the only thing I thought was weird was that it came with a raspberry sorbet that completely contrasted with the taste of everything else. So I just didn't eat it.As an extra we decided to order the white truffle ice cream since my boyfriend and I had never had truffles before. He absolutely loved it and I hated it! I guess that not a bad thing- my food tastes are expensive enough as they are! On the ice cream they wrote Congratulations for the newly wedded couple which was such a nice touch!After dinner, we ended up sitting at the bar for a couple of more drinks since we were so happy with the overall experience.So in the end we all agreed Cru was hands down the best meal any of us had ever had in the city. The service was impeccable, the decor was soothing and lovely, the wines were fantastic and the food was fabulous. If I could eat at Cru every weekend I would probably die at a young age but I would die very happy!http://www.cru-nyc.com/
