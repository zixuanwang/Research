Review Recap: Ippudo

BruniBetting was put to pasture just in time. Our once-fabled ability to foretell Frank Bruni's restaurant ratings has gone astray. For the second week in a row, the lame-duck critic has confounded us-this time with a one-star review of Ippudo. The review finds our critic \"Worshipping at the Altar of Ramen.\" At first, it reads distinctly like the two-star rave we were expecting: At Ippudo in the East Village, which is where many of the most devoted ramen fans practice their devotion, I would sometimes look up from my ramen and realize that I hadn't acknowledged my companions for several minutes, and had in fact forgotten that they were there. With ramen like Ippudo's at its finest, who needs conversation? For that matter, who needs company? Ippudo opened early last year, but seems to become even more popular and fashionable every month. Ippudo, Ippudo, Ippudo: lately, acquaintances mention it all the time, usually in order to crow that they've just been. It's an insider's favorite, enjoying its gastronome-darling moment. In the end, he has just enough complaints to take Ippudo into the Land of the One: Ippudo doesn't take reservations, and that's one of several annoyances. In the end there are challenges to the ramen bliss here. There are complications and compromises that you have to edit out of the experience... Pork is a useful compass for navigating Ippudo's menu, which goes beyond ramen to an array of small and medium-size plates. If a dish centers or pivots on pork - the meaty, fatty, glorious Samurai ribs, for example - consider it. If it doesn't, beware. There's remarkable unevenness here, exemplified by the shockingly fishy black cod I had one night... There's unevenness even to the ramen, in which the slices of pork can be tender or tough, and in which the noodles can be just a tad too soft. With the turnover and bustle at Ippudo, consistency is clearly a challenge. The crowd management could be better - warmer. During lunch on a recent day, nearly a dozen of us waited around the bar up front for an open table, but Ippudo hadn't bothered to deploy a single bartender or dispatch a single server to see if we wanted a drink or, say, a glass of water. Service on the whole varies, alternately relaxed and rushed, friendly and aloof. On the whole, though, this is one of those infrequent one-star reviews that is actually meant as a compliment. The trouble with Bruni is that, at least 2/3rds of the time, a star by itself is an insult. In Bruni's starry universe, it's tough to find the one-star reviews that are actually positive recommendations-like this one-because they get lost in a sea of mediocrity.

[Kreiger via Eater] Tomorrow, lame-duck Frank reviews Ippudo NY, the Japanese Ramen Noodle Brasserie. BruniBetting is defunct, but we offer our sense of what the departing critic will do. The Skinny: Peter Meehan reviewed Ippudo for the Times a scant thirteen months ago. He loved the place, a verdict repeated in most of the other reliable reviews we've found. We haven't been there ourselves, but the Internet consensus is that Ippudo is pretty damned good. That fact alone would seem to guarantee two stars. On top of that, it's hard to see any journalistic purpose in reviewing Ippudo again so soon, unless Bruni feels that it deserves another shout-out. Of course, shout-outs can be negative sometimes, but mediocre Asian restaurants are a dime a dozen. The only conceivable purpose of the review is to hand out another rave. We'll assume that outrageous, indefensible three-star reviews don't come very often, and as he did that last week, we aren't going to see another trifecta. Frank Bruni has a history of promoting $25 & Under Asian restaurants to two fine-dining stars. Sripraphai, Spicy & Tasty, and Momofuku Ssäm Bar have been among the beneficiaries (the latter since bumped up to three stars). Given his lame-duck status, we figure that Bruni just wants to have fun. He doesn't have to review Ippudo. We assume, therefore, that he wants to review Ippudo. The Prediction: We predict that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Ippudo.

***CONTENT
Last week, we returned to Secession to see how the ill-begotten restaurant was faring under four-star chef Christian Delouvrier. We found it much improved, but alas, mostly empty. Frank Bruni also circled back, finding the food better than it was, but marred by service gaffes. We often disagree with Bruni, but we believe him on matters like stale bread, absent servers, and wine served too warm. Today, the penny dropped: Secession has closed. It will be replaced \"by the end of the year\" (meaning sometime in 2010, if we're lucky) by a Japanese concept called Brushstroke, which David Bouley had intended to open across the street in the old Delphi space. That space, according to the Times, \"ran into structural and other problems.\"

There are three burgers at Bar Artisanal: Classic ($13), Lamb ($16), and Tuna ($18). We dropped in the other day for the Classic. The black angus beef had a nice beefy taste. The accompanying fries were perfect too. The meal was a carb overload, as the also came with excellent bread service, and a bucket (yeah, a bucket) of gougères were comped. The lamb burger comes with a got cheese center. That's the next thing to try. Bar Artisanal (268 West Broadway at Sixth Avenue, TriBeCa)

***CONTENT
The Monday Room is a wine bar/small-plates room adjoined to the NoLIta restaurant Public. It has its own website and is separately reservable, but you enter through the same door as Public, and the food is prepared in the Public kitchen, by the same chef. The space was used, at various times, as a gallery, as a retail shop, and as a private dining room. A shade over two years ago, it was converted permanently into a dining/bar room. The AvroKO decor features plush chairs, throw rugs, and dark wood paneling. It is normally a much quieter space than Public, or so we understand. Unfortunately, a large party who'd had far too much to drink was carrying on in one of the big booths. We thought they should have been asked to leave, but it's a tough call when a group is too loud, but hasn't actually broken any rules yet. The staff were clearly getting annoyed, but when we left the party was still there, and had just ordered another round. Fortunately, the food offered recompense in plenty. This comes as a surprise, as both of our visits to Public (1 2) left us underwhelmed. In fact, I will probably never eat there again, unless someone else insists. But in the Monday Room, chef Brad Farmerie hits one home run after another. If you didn't know otherwise, you would doubt it was the same guy. The menu, which changes frequently, consists entirely of small places ($6-19), which you're encouraged to share. We ordered five of these, which was about right. There wasn't a dud among them. Sea Trout ($11.50; above left) was lovely. It came with a \"three-slice pile-up\" (above right), an order of bread so addictive that it ought to be served on its own. Dashi Custerd ($9.50; above left) came topped with a salad of lobster, lime and caviar. We ordered two of these, as we were advised that it wasn't suitable for sharing. Besides, who would want to share such a sublime dish. Monday Meats ($15; above right) is a recent addition to the menu, including house-cured wild boar, a chicken mousse brûlee, and a chicken liver foie gras terrine, along with the usual accompaniments. Pan-seared foie gras ($19; above left) was an excellent preparation, with french toast, maple glaze, pineapple chutney, and a slice of crisp bacon. Grilled venison mini-burgers ($7; above right) had a wonderful funky taste that wasn't at all gamey, along with a tomato chili jam and shallot rings. The mostly-European wine list offers ample variety by the half-glass, glass, half-bottle, or bottle. We spent $48 total on two half-bottles (one Spanish, the other Italian), enjoying a flexibility not available at most places. Service was excellent, with fresh serving utensils brought for every course. All of the staff we interacted with were knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food and the wine. Their ordering advice can be trusted. We had heard that the Monday Room was better than Public, but we weren't prepared for just how much better it is. Actually, it is remarkable.

After a horrific beginning, there are signs that Secession may be turning into a good restaurant. [Update: So much for that. Less than a week after our visit, Secession has closed.] This is the place that replaced three-star Danube and promptly crapped out, earning zero stars in this blog and from Frank Bruni of the Times. We're seldom simpatico with Bruni, but we entirely agreed with him on everything at Secession-even the rude coat-check lady. How on earth did David Bouley believe he could serve a menu with 70 items and get even half of them right? A few months after Bruni's review, David Bouley wisely hired Christian Delouvrier to take over the kitchen at Secession. Delouvrier once earned three stars at Maurice in the Parker-Meridian Hotel, three stars at Les Celebrites in the Essex House, four stars at Lespinasse in the St. Regis, and three stars at Alain Ducasse, again in the Essex House. If it's classic French cuisine that you want, Delouvrier is your man. The menu at Secession has now been very wisely pared down to less than half its former girth. In our view, it could stand to be pared down even more, but it has taken a huge step in the right direction. We ordered two dishes that Delouvrier himself is responsible for, and we went home happy. A cold pea and mint soup ($9) was terrific. Duck confit ($21) was exactly what this classic dish should be, but they ought to jettison the cast-iron serving dish, which only gets in the way. The fries are perfect, but those closer to the bottom of the pan got soggy. It won't be easy to get the critics back. None of the patrons seemed to be under fifty. The server mentioned that Danyelle Freeman of the Daily News was in last week, but she already posted an irrelevant pre-Delouvrier rave and is unlikely to review it again so soon. Mimi Sheraton was in the house. She is precisely the demographic that this restaurant appeals to, but she doesn't have a reviewing platform these days. Secession is a lot better than it was, but getting the recognition it deserves won't be easy. Secession (30 Hudson Street at Duane Street, TriBeCa) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: ***Overall: *

Jean-Georges Vongerichten really, really, really wants you to visit Matsugen. The other day, Grub Street ran the feature where it asks a restauranteur to chronicle his eating habits for a week. Among other things, we learned that Jean-Georges Vongerichten always eats dinner at Matsugen on Sundays, but apparently he eats there Tuesdays as well. He does not mention JoJo, Vong, Mercer Kitchen, or Spice Market. Vongerichten spends most of his time at the flagship, but he's supposed to be there; and he visited Perry St, where he was testing new recipes. But Matsugen is apparently the only restaurant in his empire where he dines regularly for pleasure. Maybe it's because when we arrived at 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening, the staff outnumbered the customers. To be fair, it got a bit busier later on, but it never filled up. On a weekend, that cannot be an encouraging sign. We've written about Matsugen twice before (1, 2), so we'll go easy on the background. There's some intermittently compelling food here, and a good meal need not break the bank. Four appetizers (two more than we needed), a bowl of soba apiece and an inexpensive bottle of sake were just $125 before tax and tip. You can do even better if you have the multi-course $35 prix fixe, but we didn't go that route. Barachirashi, or raw fish over warm sushi rice ($12; above left) was the highlight of the evening-looking as good as it tasted. I was less impressed with Toro Tataki ($21; above right). When you're serving premium tuna, it shouldn't be drowning in gravy. Meatballs ($7; above left) were a bit dry on the outside, but luscious on the inside. Tempura vegetables ($12; above right) were forgettable. The Matsugen Special Soba ($16; above) comes with a blizzard of ingredients: scallion, bonito, yam, sesame, okra, wasabi, cucumber, myoga, shiso, egg, nori. It would be refreshing even without the thin, delicate soba noodles. Ordering at Matsugen is an exercise in frustration, as you never have a sense of how big the plates are, and the servers provide very little guidance-that's useful, at any rate. I've loved the soba dishes every time, but the appetizers aren't as consistently enjoyable. The space is sterile and charmless, and for the price I think there are more comfortable destinations where the food is equally or even more compelling.

Review Recap (lame duck edition): Minetta Tavern

***CONTENT
Well, blow me down. The day after we wrote that \"One or two stars are the only plausible outcomes here,\" Frank Bruni awarded three stars to Minetta Tavern: The minute you heard that Keith McNally was dusting off Minetta Tavern - that musty, sputtering Greenwich Village relic from the late 1930s - you probably figured he'd get the look and atmosphere right... But were you prepared for a côte de boeuf like Minetta's, a sublime hunk of glorious meat that you dream about hours later, pine for the next day and extol in a manner so rapturous and nonstop that friends begin to worry less about your cholesterol than about your sanity? And did you expect that Mr. McNally, with the chefs Riad Nasr and Lee Hanson, would come up with the best steakhouse in the city? We never saw this one coming, nor did over 500 Eater.com voters, 91.4% of whom believed, as we did, that two stars was the maximum for this place. Our experience here is limited to the $16 Minetta Burger (like us, Bruni prefers it to its $26 cousin), but this didn't strike us as a three-star restaurant. Indeed, Minetta Tavern serves a slimmed down version of the Balthazar menu, and no one has suggested that Balthazar is unfairly rated at two stars (Amanda Hesser, May 2004). We don't agree with Bruni every time, but all of his other three-star restaurants were, in a sense, predictable. They were types of restaurants where you knew this outcome was possible. This is the first one that just came out of nowhere. Indeed, even taken on its own terms, the review makes a poor case for three stars. Bruni concedes that \"little of the rest of Minetta's food rises all the way to the extraordinarily high level of the beef.\" What a bizarre way to begin the last three months of his tenure.

News of a Hot Dog, of all things, sent me back to Elettaria last week. According to the Feedbag, chef Akthar Nawab spent months perfecting it. Actually, there are two hot dogs on Elettaria's bar menu, either $2.50 or $4.50. The latter, which we ordered, resembles a hefty bratwurst sausage-house made, of course. We enjoyed the robust, spicy flavor of the hot dog and the warm, toasted bun, but they weren't made for each other. The bun needed to be about twice the size to wrap its way around the sausage. We did our best, but this beast would have been better with a knife and fork. It's a great hot dog, though, and a bargain at $4.50. If Nawab can just find the right bun, it would be perfect. The kitchen comped a crab cake (right), which wasn't anywhere near as memorable as the bratwurst. An order of meatballs ($5), served on a skewer, had a mild curry flavor, but they weren't tender enough. These items are served only at the bar, along with an alluring selection of cocktails. I've been meaning to go back for the Zombie, allegedly so potent that they won't serve you more than one. I was headed for a show, so I gave that one a pass.

Are you feeling withdrawal over the death-or at least, suspension-of Eater's BruniBetting, and the end of our weekly competition? Yeah, us too. As recompense, we launch \"Review Preview\" (pronounced \"REEview PREEview\"), in which we'll showcase the weekly Times review, either by Frank Bruni or his successor. This week's subject: Keith McNally's Minetta Tavern makeover, and Bruni's first review as a lame-duck critic. The Skinny: We're not sure how Keith McNally got to be so good at turning out one hit after another. Fine dining ain't his thing-his restaurants hover somewhere in the nether-regions between one and two stars. But somehow, wherever he lands, he attracts a gaggle of celebrities, often to neighborhoods not previously considered dining destinations. And his restaurants stay hot, years after he opened them. We've still never been to his flagship, Balthazar - the trouble of getting in just never seemed to be worth it. Our one visit to Pastis left us unimpressed. We walked by Schiller's Liquor Bar recently, and kept right on walking, deterred as we were by the ridiculous crowd. McNally has never had a failure in New York (at least that we're aware of), but his Italian restaurant, Morandi, has never caught on the way the other ones did. McNally is still smarting after Bruni slammed it with one star. He accused Bruni of hating women chefs, but he fired the chef, Jody Williams, anyway. At Minetta Tavern, McNally takes no chances. The restaurant has been in the heart of Greenwich Village since before most of us were born. Formerly an undistinguished formula Italian place, McNally acquired it, spruced up the decor, and installed the same kitchen team that runs Balthazar. McNally must be the only guy who could replace one formula restaurant with another, and still have a big hit. Service probably has a lot to do with it. We were impressed with the coddling we received when all we did was order a burger at the bar. The Prediction: One or two stars are the only plausible outcomes here. Most of the critics have been impressed with the Minetta Tavern reboot. Frank Bruni seldom goes against a solid consensus, so we assume he'll be impressed too. We predict that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Minetta Tavern.

Eater announced today that it is formally ending its famed BruniBetting feature, or as they put it, \"we've remanded BruniBetting to its creator, odds expert Ben Leventhal.\" We present the final standings below: Eater NYJ Total $128.50 $149.67 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - Won-Lost 58-26(69%) 60-24(71%) Our record was slightly better than Leventhal's. In all fairness, we had a significant advantage, as our bet was always placed with the knowledge of what Leventhal had already done. (That was because Leventhal announced the odds and Eater's own bet in the same post.) If Eater has dropped the feature in deference to Leventhal (who is no longer affiliated with the blog), it probably means we'll see a revised version of it somewhere else. When that happens, we'll reset the score to zero-zero, and start again. Looking forward to it, Ben!

Lunch at Jean Georges

***DATE

***CONTENT
Note: Click here and here for reviews of past meals at Jean Georges. For years, I've heard about the remarkable lunch menu at Jean Georges: any two courses, $28; additional courses, $14 each; desserts just $8 each. It also includes the same amuses-bouches and petits-fours served at dinner. Few luxury restaurants come close to offering that kind of deal at lunch. Le Bernardin, for instance, is $68. The Modern is $55. Eleven Madison Park recently started offering two courses for $28, but Jean Georges was doing it before there was any recession. And Jean Georges has four stars. For such a low price (the normal dinner menu is $98), you'd expect limited choices, but that's not the case. There are twenty-one options (just two carry supplements), and most are recognizable versions of those offered at dinner. The list isn't divided into the standard appetizers and entrees, just a long list: if you want two meat courses, you're welcome to have them. Even more remarkable, the prix fixe in the adjoining Nougatine, the casual front room, is $24.07, so the dining room is charging only a four-dollar premium for considerably more ambitious food. A friend and I had lunch there today. We ordered the standard two courses each and shared a third, bringing the savory total to $63. After a couple of glasses of wine, the bill was just $98, including tax. The trio of amuses-bouches was nearly identical to those my mother and I had at dinner last month: a disc of homemade mozzarella, a crab fritter in mushroom sauce, and an herbal chicken broth. After we tasted the crab fritter, my friend said, \"The wonderful thing about Jean Georges is that he never makes a mistake.\" Then we tried the chicken broth, which tasted like dishwater. A Warm Green Asparagus Salad was just fine, but overly simplistic. My friend's appetizer of Tuna Ribbons with avocado, spicy radish, and ginger marinade, seemed a lot more interesting. We shared the Foie Gras Brulee, a Jean Georges staple, which must be the best foie dish in the city. It has been perfect both times I've had it. For the main course, my friend had the same remarkable Goat Cheese Gnocchi with baby artichokes that I tried last month. He was equally impressed. I loved the Red Snapper crusted with seeds and nuts, and served in what appeared to be a stew of baby heirloom tomatoes. It used to be that Jean Georges was my least favorite of the four-star restaurants. More than the others, it seems more prone to the inevitable minor screw-up (in this case, the dishwater chicken broth). But I have to admit the place is growing on me. Vongerichten himself was in the house and came over to say hello. The dining room was full (as was adjoining Nougatine), which makes me wonder why the chef is quite so generous at lunchtime.

The Burger at Primehouse

The recession has forced us to abandon steakhouses-no small sacrifice, as ribeye steak is practically our favorite dish. We make an exception for burgers. With that as our mission, we revisited Primehouse New York last week. On our last visit, we noted that Primehouse has one of the most comfortable bar stools in the city, with a soft cushion for your derrière and firm, cushioned back. I know plenty of places where the dining room isn't as comfortable as the bar at Primehouse. In an era where $16 burgers are routine, the $12 charged at Primehouse must be considered a bargain. I can't remember the last time I had a burger that cheap at a fine-dining restaurant. Although it's the least expensive entree (available only at the bar), they serve it with a flourish and all the fixin's, marching to your table with the same wheeled cart they'd use if you'd ordered the $79 seafood platter. For $12, you're not getting a custom blend of organically-raised grass-fed Wagyu, but it's a respectable burger I'd happily eat again. My only complaint is that the patty needed to be a bit broader, with less of a \"dome\" on top. On a Tuesday evening, the dining room wasn't at all full, but the bar was doing a brisk business. Evidently others have figured out that it's the best way to enjoy Primehouse. Primehouse New York (381 Park Avenue South at 27th Street, Gramercy/Flatiron)

Does Bruni have another 4-star review in him?

Over at Eater.com, Ben Leventhal asks the existential question: The biggest question is, Will The Brunisimo inaugurate one more restaurant into the four star club before he leaves? He confirmed Daniel's four stars in January, but hasn't put a new restaurant into the club since Masa in late 2004. Frequent dining companions of his whisper about the man's quiet interest in finding one more perfect restaurant before he departs. And these critics, they like to leave a mark, which to me means we've got one more four star review coming if any restaurant even comes close to getting it done. We totally agree with Leventhal that Bruni must be itching to play king-maker one more time. Indeed, we've noted before, Bruni currently holds the record for the longest interval between new four-star reviews. Awarding four stars-not reaffirming, as he did with Daniel, but awarding-is a critic's signature moment, and he has kept his powder dry for the last 4½ years. We doubt, though, that Bruni will pull the trigger unless he's convinced. In a post late last year, he mentioned recent visits to Eleven Madison Park and Del Posto-clearly looking for an excuse to promote them to four stars, but finding both wanting. Here are the restaurants that Leventhal thinks could break the string, with Eater's trademark odds: Marea: 3-1Aureole: 10-1Del Posto: 18-1Blue Hill, Stone Barns: 19-1Babbo (Bruni's first review): 75-1Momofuku Ko: 298-1Le Cirque: 500-1Locanda Verde: 5,000-1 We do not think Marea is designed to compete with the likes of Le Bernardin and Jean Georges. In flusher times, Chris Cannon and Michael White would no doubt have liked to, but by all appearances it seems they (wisely) hedged their bets. The new Aureole, even if it ultimately gets four stars, is probably opening too late (not till June, by most reports). Del Posto needs to be crossed off the list for now, based on Bruni's year-end comments. Babbo? I doubt that even Mario Batali thinks it's a four-star restaurant. We certainly agree that Le Cirque is the longest of long-shots, and Locanda Verde is (by its creators' admission) intended to be a neighborhood place. In our view, that leaves only Momofuku Ko and Blue Hill Stone Barns as plausible candidates. We think BHSB is a near-perfect restaurant, but even if Bruni thinks that, would he award four stars to a restaurant that is not even in New York City? That leaves Momofuku Ko. Bruni has been curiously silent about the ambitious lunch menu that was launched after his original review. That lunch menu would certainly provide the excuse for a re-review, and if the inconsistencies he wrote about have been smoothed out, perhaps Ko would be the place. Given Bruni's long-standing shine for everything Chang, we have to think that Momofuku Ko is the best candidate. Edit to Add: I am not saying that I believe Momofuku Ko will be (or should be) upgraded to four stars. I am only saying that if Bruni files another four-star review, Ko is a more likely recipient than any other.

What about Corton? It could get a re-review in the next few months that give it a 4th star. I haven't been but the reviews have been very, very good. But I'm not sure they are aiming for 4.

Corton had its first review just six months ago, and I don’t think any restaurant has been promoted to four stars quite that quickly.More to the point, Corton simply isn’t operating (nor is it purporting to operate) at the level of the other four stars. It’s a wonderful place, and I love it, but there is a very clear difference.

Dear Bill, Today, you announced that Frank Bruni, the Times restaurant critic, will be leaving his post in August, when his memoir is published. I have to ask: Do you seriously believe that Frank Bruni was an \"inspired\" choice? I can only hope that, despite your praise for his \"ambitious feats of criticism,\" you recognize that the Bruni experiment was not altogether successful. Bruni, to be sure, is a very good writer (not quite \"exquisite\"), a top-notch journalist, and a smart guy. Like anyone with those attributes, he naturally had some successes. Over time, he nearly mastered the job. He also had a long, painful, unacknowledged apprenticeship, during which much of his criticism was just plain embarrassing. The fact is, the best critics are normally those who bring a lifetime of experience to the subject matter-something it was simply not possible for Frank Bruni to have had. That's not the only requirement, but it is an essential one. There is no substitute for it. When we read The New York Times, we expect not just exquisite writers, but writers who have deep background in the beat they are covering. Although Frank Bruni is a better writer than I am, I never thought that he knew more about restaurants than I did. That's because his background for the job was the same as mine: he had none. However, I am an amateur. Frank Bruni's work was marketed as a professional product, and it wasn't, because he lacked one crucial attribute: expertise. Of course, there were other problems with Frank's work. He consistently overrated Italian restaurants (the one cuisine in which he was arguably an expert). And you always got the sense that high-end restaurants-the kinds that get 3 and 4 stars-held little joy for him. Even when he rated them highly, these restaurants seldom brought out his passion the way a great pizzeria did. It's awfully telling that you cite his nationwide tour of fast-food restaurants as a highlight of his tenure. That piece is emblematic of everything that was wrong with Frank Bruni as a fine dining critic. So Bill, I wish you luck in your search for Frank Bruni's replacement. But this time, please choose someone with a solid track record in the field. Is that too much to ask? Very truly yours,Marc ShepherdNew York Journal

Last Saturday, Falai Panetteria helped turn a near disaster into one of the best casual meals we've had in quite a while. We had reservations elsewhere, but after our taxi driver took a wrong turn and got stuck in traffic he never should have been in, we were half-an-hour late. Just as he pulled up to the restaurant's front door, the host called to say that they wouldn't be able to accommodate us. There may be a recession going on, but it hasn't hit the Lower East Side. One restaurant after another was jammed-all except for poor THOR, which looked like it was ready to host a funeral. As we got to the corner of Rivington & Clinton, I saw Falai Panetteria with a couple of empty tables. I vaguely recalled that Falai was supposed to be good, so we walked in and were seated immediately. (Not that Falai Panetteria is doing badly: the remaining empty tables were taken within a few minutes.) It turns out I had my Falai properties confused. There's a fancy sit-down place down the street that got two stars from Frank Bruni in mid-2005. That's the one I remembered, but Falai Panetteria is the casual follow-up that earned a rave from Peter Meehan in $25 & Under the following year. Both Lower East Side restaurants, and a third that has since opened in SoHo, are the work of Iacopo Falai, a former pastry chef at Le Cirque 2000 who has graduated far beyond desserts. At Falai Panetteria, he can feed you all day long, from croissants and turnovers at breakfast, to sandwiches at lunch, to pastas and other hot entrees at dinner. It apparently does a lot of take-out business during the day, but there are also eight tables with space for around twenty diners. They take reservations, but it appeared to us that most of the clientele were walk-ins. The menu is a short document, with five salads ($9-13), six antipasti ($5.50-14), three soups ($6-8), four pastas ($12-14), and just four entrees ($11-15). The restaurant was BYO when Meehan reviewed it for the Times, but it now has a beer & wine license. We had an enjoyable Chianti for around $40. Of the pastas we tried, we liked best the squid ink tagliolini ($14; above right), with prawns, calamari, tomato sauce and red pepper. It had a strong, spicy flavor, without any of the ingredients overwhelming the others. Pappardelle ($12; above left) caught my eye because it was supposed to include Brussels sprouts (one of my favorite vegetables), but there was barely a hint of that ingredient, and the dish seemed to be missing something. For the entree, we both had the veal meatballs (above left). I'll allow myself the food-writer's sin of calling them ethereal, because Peeter Meehan did too. They were soft, tender and buttery. If there's a better meatball dish in town, we can't imagine it. And they're a whopping $11, up from $7 when Meehan reviewed them. Naturally, there's an abundant dessert menu, which we'd normally skip, but given Falai's reputation we had to have one. Tiramisu ($5; above right) was wonderful, especially at the price. For a restaurant this inexpensive, I cannot really complain about the service. There was a nice basket of bread and olive oil. Plates came out and were cleared at a reasonable pace. About the only solecism was the failure to replace silverware after the appetizers. The space is one of those priceless Lower East Side storefronts, with an old tile floor, pressed tin ceiling, and chandeliers that probably date from the Hoover administration. For what it is, Falai Panetteria is a gem. Now we need to schedule a visit to the flagship down the street.

I've been catching up on intriguing restaurants that have been open a while, that we missed during the opening review period. For all but the most compelling places, the New York media pays attention-if at all-for only the first few months. The critics then move onto the latest New Thing, and the vast majority of places will never be reviewed professionally again. Bar Stuzzichini is like that. In September 2007, Frank Bruni's awarded one star, pronouncing it a \"modestly, intermittently troubled\" restaurant, but \"an honorable effort worthy of note. Its dishes include more successes than failures.\" At age two, Bar Stuzzichini is surviving, if not quite thriving. At 6:30 p.m. on a Friday evening, we found the outdoor seating packed and most of the bar stools taken, but the large dining room only about 20% occupied. The food was all satisfying and worth a try if you're in the area, but otherwise not particularly memorable. The name refers to a broad selection of small plates that dominate the top half of the menu. (Bruni tells us that the Italian verb stuzzicare can mean \"to provke,\" \"to stimulate,\" or \"to tantalize.\") There are about two dozen of these. They're $4-10 à la carte, but most people seem to order platters of them. Any three are $18, a portion that is suitable for two to share. If you order a cocktail during happy hour, you get one of the stuzzichini for free; I tried the Baccalà Fritto or Fried Salt Cod (below left; normally $6), which was nicely done: the fish had a salty brine, the breading was light and crisp. After we sat down, we had the Salumi Tasting ($28; below right), an ample portion for two. All four meats were excellent (Pork Shoulder, Sweet & Spicy salami, and 18-month prosciutto). My girlfriend was especially fond of the pork shoulder, while I preferred the spicy salami. On the rest of the menu, salads are $8-9, pastas and soups $7-18, entrees $17-24, and side dishes $6-7. Neither of our main courses was as memorable as the salumi. Braciole del Pizzaiola, or braised short rib in tomato sauce ($22; below left), had a hearty flavor, but I wouldn't rush across town for it. Eggplant Parmigiana ($17; below right) was left in the broiler too long, and was a bit burnt. The wine list is priced in line with the food, with plenty of bottles below $50 (though you can spend more if you want to). We were so delighted with a 2004 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo Riserva ($42; photo above) that we went home and ordered three more bottles of it online. Service was efficient enough for this type of restaurant. It did not seem to be at all \"distracted or perfunctory,\" as Frank Bruni reported. We also liked the room and couldn't at all fathom Bruni's comparison to a \"Midtown mess hall.\" Actually, for a large space it is reasonably charming. If you're in the area, Bar Stuzzichini offers a refreshing and inexpensive diversion.

Note: Click here for a review of the burger at Bar Artisanal. Bar Artisanal is Chef Terrance Brennan's quickie replacement for the doomed Trigo, which sank like a stone after barely four months in business. What a difference the right concept makes! Trigo was always empty; Bar Artisanal, at least in its early days, is always full. This being a Brennan restaurant, cheese is naturally the focus. I dropped in on opening night for a glass of wine and four cheeses à la carte (left), telling the fromagier he could choose whatever he wanted, as long as they were soft and at least two were blue. Although the name is suggestive of Brennan's Artisanal Bistro in Murray Hill, the menu here is considerably different. Most of the selections are essentially \"tapas\" - about a dozen in a category called amuses-bouches ($4-15) and another dozen petits plats ($11-18). There are just five entrees ($16-20) and three kinds of burgers (classic, lamb, tuna; $13-18). Yet another menu category is devoted to pissaladières, or a kind of pizza from the south of France. There are seven of these ($11-15), several with unusual toppings, such as \"Duck\" (Gizzard, Confit, Egg, and Cracklings) and \"Bianca\" (Asparagus, Ramps, Bottarga). Brennan gets full credit for challenging his audience. He isn't serving duck gizzards, lamb neck, sea urchin custard, and smoked paprika popcorn because diners demanded them. And it appears the menu will change frequently. On the current menu, ramps figure in three different dishes, and they are in season for only a short time. Last week, I dropped in again for dinner with a colleague. The server encouraged us to order small plates to share-which we did. Naturally, cheese figures in many of the dishes. We started with a hunk of fresh burrata ($12; above left). Octopus ($12; above right), perfectly cooked, was complemented with smoked paprika. Skate ($12; above left) was spectacular. I am not sure what was in it, but it seemed to be stuffed with a spicy sausage of some kind (the menu said choucroute garni). Pork Belly ($12; above right) was so good we ordered a second helping. A minor complaint: if the plates are meant for sharing, why serve three pieces? As he does at his other restaurants, Brennan offers several pre-composed \"tasting flights\" of cheeses ($16), or you can choose your own from a long list. The one shown at the right is called \"Blue Notes\" (blue, stilton, gorgonzola). The wine list is priced in line with the menu, with plenty of reds below $50, and even a decent selection below $40. There have been some reports of slow service here. Our food came out quickly, but servers weren't always available when you wanted them, and a couple of times utensils didn't arrive with the food. Management recognizes me, so I suspect we got slightly better service than the average patron. There is much still to try here, but so far I am very impressed with Bar Artisanal. If the food program remains on track and the service glitches are smoothed out, this restaurant could have a happy future.

Rolling the Dice: Fishtail

***CONTENT
The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews David Burke's Upper East Side seafood shack, Fishtail. The Eater odds haven't been posted as of 6:05 p.m., but we're going to go ahead and record our bet anyway. Update: Well, it turns out that Eater never did post the odds. Lucky for us, as our prediction (below) was wrong, so we avoided losing $1 on our hypothetical bet. The Skinny: Fishtail had a rough early start. The original executive chef, Eric Hara, left in late February to take over the Oak Room. Dallas native John Tesar replaced him in March. We've heard nothing about the restaurant since then. The only major-media review, one star from Adam Platt, pre-dated Tesar's arrival. We liked Fishtail, rating it at 2½ stars. Like Platt, we visited while Hara was still there. Our only complaint was that the tables were packed uncomfortably close together. The fish, however, was impeccable. What we cannot assess is whether the kitchen is consistent, and whether it has improved or regressed since Tesar took over. There are a dozen reasons why a restaurant like Fishtail would not appeal to a nitwit like Platt, even if the fish were prepared perfectly. Bruni is a far more intelligent critic. Nevertheless, the vibe of an Upper East Side socialites' restaurant is not likely to appeal to him, and no doubt he will find some of Burke's compositions too cute for their own good. We're fans, but sometimes we feel that way ourselves. Our guess is that Bruni wouldn't be bothering to review this place so many months after the opening review cycle, unless he had something positive to say. To award one star would be an insult, and while Bruni has done that plenty of times (and will again), he's not likely to do it for a restaurant everyone had forgotten about. The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Fishtail.

White Slab Palace has been open since late February on the Lower East Side. The cuisine is vaguely Scandinavian, but the vibe is more like a \"bar that serves food\" than a true restaurant. The narrow space has a long, high counter with tall bar stools. The there are about a dozen low-slung wooden tables next to the tall windows facing out on Allen & Delancey Streets. A forthcoming expansion into the neighboring space promises a more formal dining room, but we decided not to wait for that. Alas, we should have waited, or better yet, skipped White Slab Palace altogether. This was one of the most disastrous meals we've had in a long time. Food took about 45 minutes to arrive. \"Sometimes, we need to give the kitchen a nasty stare,\" the server admitted. At last, our main courses were delivered, bypassing the appetizers entirely. We had both ordered the meatballs-just four smallish things the size of golf balls, dried out and over-cooked. No wonder they took 45 minutes. A moment later, a plate of deep-fried stuff arrived. We thought it might be an appetizer. Then we had a taste. It was a fish-like substance, apparently a herring, just as parched as the meatballs. There were other deep-fried fishy things on the plate, none of which we could stand after more than one bite. Our server circled back: \"You didn't order that, did you?\" Nope. We weren't sure what was happening next, but finally the appetizers came. An order of shrimp tasted like it had been swimming too long with the herring. We tasted one shrimp apiece and gave up. A hunk of lamb was so densely packed with gristle that my knife could not get through it. This was apparently a cheap cut that needed braising it hadn't gotten. That was the end of White Slab Palace for us. The server conceded that it was a rough night, but didn't offer to comp anything to make up for it. Food, beer and cocktails set us back $117, including tax and tip. Oh, and they don't take credit cards.

Mas was a restaurant we instantly liked when we first visited, a shade under three years ago. Despite our enthusiasm, I had no particular eagerness to return. The food is good, but not in a specific way that you can't get anywhere else. And Mas is hard to book, partly because it is not on OpenTable. Of course, its absence from OpenTable is for a reason: Mas is habitually full, even with an extra back room added in late 2007, which increased the size of the dining room from 40 to 55 seats. Last year, Mas got a rare gift: a second review from Frank Bruni, who upgraded it to the two stars it deserved in the first place. (His earlier one-star review was one of the more egregious errors of his first year on the job, though it doesn't seem to have hurt the restaurant.) Mas is still as lovely as we found it in December 2006. The seats and tables are comfortable, the warm faux farmhouse decor is inviting, the service is polished. If you notice such things, the china and stemware are some of the most elegant of any New York restaurant, including the four-stars. There's a recession going on, but you wouldn't know it at Mas. If ordered à la carte, the appetizers are $14-23, and the entrees $32-36. Those high prices apply to the wine list too, where you'll struggle to find a red under $60. The menu is awfully confusing. The front page offers a $68 four-course prix fixe with specific dishes listed. The server goes on to explain that those dishes are available à la carte as well, and anything on the carte can be substituted into the prix fixe at no extra charge. If that's the case, then why is the menu structured that way? As I heard the same lengthy explanation repeated at multiple tables, I wondered why they don't just do the obvious thing: print everything à la carte, with a note at the bottom: any four courses, $68. (A six-course tasting menu, with the courses not named, is $95.) We started with an amuse-bouche of smoked duck (above, right) that was more interesting to look at than taste. A White Asparagus Soup (above left) was just fine, but my girlfriend reported that a Roasted Beet and Goat Cheese salad was too salty. All three of us ordered the Long Island Duck Breast (above right). It was one of the more tender duck preparations I've had in a while, with a beautiful layer of fat below the skin. But accompaniments of sweet potato, bacon & leek gratin, with savoy cabbage in a bacon cream and beet sauce, sounded a lot more interesting than they were. My sense of Mas now is that it is a terrific place for a romantic dinner or a special occasion, and I would happily go there again with the right guests. The cuisine and wine list are solid, but arguably over-priced. For the food alone, Mas isn't quite exciting enough to win a place in the regular rotation.

Then again, I have never understood the excitement for Keith McNally's other restaurants-most of them formulaic French brasseries. He's got a good grasp on the format, but does this justify the long lines and impossible-to-get reservations? Even Bloomberg's Ryan Sutton had to admit defeat, conceding he hired a concierge service to get him into Minetta at a decent hour, after multiple failed attempts to get in on his own. Restaurant Girl didn't let on how she got in, but she does not dine anonymously, which perhaps is all we need to know. Last night, I decided to take a flyer on the bar at Minetta Tavern, figuring it was early enough (5:45 p.m.) that I would get a seat. Sure enough, there was exactly one stool free when I arrived. The staff were friendly and accommodating-well beyond my expectations. I was expecting \"attitude\" at the host stand, but there was none of it. Minetta Tavern shares its chefs with Balthazar, the McNally establishment to which it is most similar. The Minetta menu is slightly less expensive, and has slightly fewer offerings than Balthazar does. Most notably, it lacks Balth's humungous plateaux de fruits de mer ($65 & $110 respectively), and it offers burgers, which Balth does not. There are two burgers at Minetta Tavern, the Minetta Burger ($16) and the La Freida Black Label Burger ($26). Both Restaurant Girl and Bloomberg's Sutton thought the lower-priced option was better. We tried the purported Black Label product at City Burger a few months ago, and weren't impressed. Later on, La Freida explained that City Burger wasn't getting the real Black Label blend, which was available only at Minetta. We weren't going to fall for that trick again. It was the Minetta Burger for us. And I fine burger it was: thick, juicy, and flavorful. Oh, and they nailed the fries, too. It's not cheap, but this is a burger I could eat every week. I asked the kitchen to hold the caramelized onions that normally come with it. When the beef is this good, who needs onions? There's much more to Minetta Tavern, which I'll be back to sample another day. Yesterday belonged to the burger.

We returned to Benoit last Saturday-our third visit (past reviews here, here). The good news is that Benoit is doing well: it was as crowded as I've seen it since the opening weeks, this time last year. The bad news is that the service was slow, with long waits even for basic things, such as getting a wine list. To start, we shared the charcuterie platter with cornichons and Dijon mustard ($42; below). Though nominally a serving for two, our group of three was unable to polish it off. Only at Bar Boulud have we seen a charcuterie assortment this good, this varied. I'm hard pressed to say which is better. Unfortunately, that left us not very hungry for our main courses (not the restaurant's fault). My girlfriend had the Steak aus Poivres ($38) and my mother the trio of Colorado Lamb ($36). Both struck us as competently done without being, in any sense, special. The Braised Pork Shank ($21; above) was a fascinating dish, unlike anything I have ever seen. It was a hefty hunk of smoked ham, braised on the bone and flaked with a spicy mustard sauce. I am not a fan of smoked ham and probably wouldn't have ordered it if I had realized how it was prepared-the menu just said \"pork.\" However, the dish was beautifully prepared, and I cannot really fault anything except the description. Benoit is still uneven, but for its best items, the restaurant is well worth a return visit. The slow service dismayed us, but I am hoping we caught them on a bad night.

Note: Click here for a review of lunch at Jean Georges. Even four-star restaurants have to adapt. A couple of years ago, the dining room at Jean Georges got a make-over. I'm not the one to itemize all of the changes, as I visited the original space only once, but the space now seems brighter and yet more spare-a kind of Scandanavian economy that ensures no distractions from the food and the adjoining Central Park views. The current recession brought another change: a $58 four-course menu that is served from 5:30-6:00 p.m. and from 10:00-11:00 p.m. (At other times, the minimum entry point is $98 for four courses.) Those might not be ideal dining hours, but it's still the lowest available price point of any four-star restaurant, or indeed, of just about any luxury restaurant in the city. For that Jean Georges deserves to be applauded. It was the $58 menu that brought us into Jean Georges the other night. With a $74 burgundy added to the tab, we were still out of there for $205 before tip, making this one of the better meals we've had for the price in quite some time. The $58 menu offers no choices, except at dessert: you are going to get the three savory courses they've mapped out for you. However, it is not a bad selection at all. If I'd ordered these dishes at full price, I would not have been disappointed. We started with a trio of amuses-bouches (above left): a swirl of pickled rhubarb on a disc of mozarella, a peekytoe crab fritter in a light mushroom sauce, and an herbal chicken broth. The crab fritter was the best of these. The chicken broth seemed like a throw-away. The appetizer (above right) was classic Vongerichten: cubes of delicate hamachi paired with Japanese cucumber. The next two courses were superb, and at least to me, bracingly original. First was a goat cheese gnocchi with caramelized artichokes, rosemary and lemon zest (above left). I wrote in my notes: \"remarkable\". The last course was an arctic char (above right) with a rhubarb compote, ramp ravioli and olive oil foam. It had a sweet-tart contrast that Vongerichten is so well known for. The tart elements were slightly over-powering to my taste, but I give full credit to the ravioli and the fish itself, which was more tender than I thought possible. We had our choice of any dessert on the regular menu. I chose \"Caramel\" (above left), while my Mom chose \"Chocolate (above right). (\"Rhubarb\" and \"Apple\" were the other options.) It all seemed competent to me, but not as memorable as the savory courses. We concluded with the usual array of petits-four, including the house-made marshmallows (left). The service seemed more polished than it was on our last visit, but it surely helped that the dining room was not yet full. I still think that Jean Georges is a half-step behind the city's other four-star restaurants, but this was my best meal to date in any Vongerichten establishment. I should schedule another visit while it is still possible to eat here at bargain prices.

A couple of weeks ago, we headed down to the Peking Duck House for-well, you can probably guess. The ways of this restaurant are a bit mysterious. When I called for a reservation, they claimed not to take them for parties fewer than six, but plenty of two-tops seemed to be waltzing right in (past the long line) to pre-reserved tables. Our party of three waited at least half-an-hour to be seated at around 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening. When we left, less than 90 minutes later, the walk-in line was even longer. As I noted in a previous review, this restaurant is geared to turning tables with military precision, though the food they serve, by its nature, takes a while to eat. Most parties seemed to order the house special. For a fixed price of $36.50 per person, you get a whole Peking duck (as long as you have at least three people) and some number of additional appetizers and entrees, depending on party size. The amount of food is obscene: even with four people, instead of three, I doubt we could have finished it. After the appetizers (above), the duck (below) was presented tableside, then whisked away to be carved. There seems to be one chef who does nothing else. After the superb duck, the entrees (above) seemed almost superfluous. It would probably be better if they were served separately, but as the restaurant wants to turn tables, they were served at the same time as the duck, which made for an awfully crowded table. A dessert of fresh sliced fruit (left) went barely touched. If you can look past the factory atmosphere, the Peking Duck House remains an essential restaurant for its signature ingredient, which it prepares as well as anyone.

***CONTENT
We were half-right, half-wrong about Frank Bruni's double-review of La Fonda del Sol and Txikito. The latter restaurant got the expected singleton: Across many meals here I had wonderfully memorable food (suckling pig as fine as any in New York beyond Eleven Madison Park's); ridiculous food (a rib-eye so excessively fatty and undercooked it was almost inedible); food that fell somewhere in between (the crosscut spareribs, with too much bone and too little pork); and food that never tasted the same twice. The meatballs in a shellfish broth could be hard and dull or tender and nuanced. It depended on the night. Although the prices on individual items are low, the bill can climb surprisingly high, especially considering the plainness and tightness of the quarters. But to our surprise, La Fonda got the deuce. It's not that we doubted La Fonda deserved two stars (it clearly does), but that we didn't expect Bruni to see it that way. With two-star restaurants being a rarity these days, we had figured that any place he deemed worthy of the deuce would at least get the courtesy of having a review to itself. But Bruni's review patterns were made to be broken: Although the menu has weak spots, with a few too many dishes not from the heart but from a marketing plan, [Chef Josh DeChellis's] cooking here feels less forced and more exuberant than it did at any of the other restaurants where I tried it. More important, it reflects a steady, precise hand. A tried-and-true combination of octopus with potato seemed fresh again, because the kitchen got precisely the tenderness it wanted from the octopus and the firmness it sought in the potato, so that each was a textural mirror and mimic of the other. At lunchtime, when so many restaurants put on their B if not C games, La Fonda served me a fillet of wild striped bass so vividly white in color and melting in consistency it could have been a snowdrift. The fish got a thrillingly salty, nutty charge - and some nice crunch - from the pumpkinseeds scattered over it. We and Eater thought that Bruni would award a single star to both places. On our hypothetical one-dollar bets, we win $2 for Txikito and lose $1 on La Fonda, for a net gain of $1.

The Line: We missed BruniBetting last week with the flu, but for the record our bet would have been the same as Eater's: no stars for Charles. Oddly, we find ourselves nearly always in agreement with Eater these days. We realize that's boring, but there's no point in disagreeing for its own sake, especially where imaginary dough is on the line. Anyhow, back to business. Tomorrow, Frank gives us a Spanish twofer, taking a fly on La Fonda del Sol and Txikito. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): La Fonda del SolZero Stars: 10 - 1One Star: 3-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: 25-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1TxikitoZero Stars: 7-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1Three Stars: 500-1 Four Stars: 20,000-1 The Skinny: Eater gives a good explanation why both of these restaurants will get the singleton, but we have an even better one. In Bruniland, the line between two stars and one is the line between good and mediocre, between important and humdrum, between destination and also-ran. Though one star is supposed to mean \"good,\" in Bruni's world it almost never does. Two-star reviews have been extremely scarce this year. So we figure that if Bruni thought that either of these places merited the deuce, he would let it have a review all to itself. As best we can recall, Bruni has never awarded more than one star in a double review if the Times had never reviewed the restaurant before-as is the case with both of these establishments. For the record, we really liked La Fonda del Sol, but the other critics haven't been as wild for it as we were. The Bet: The year of the one-star restaurant continues. We are betting that Frank Bruni will award one star to both La Fonda del Sol and Txikito.

[Kreiger via Eater] Vinegar Hill is a tiny Brooklyn neighborhood, nestled between the Brooklyn Navy Yard to the north and DUMBO to the south. Like many recovering neighborhoods, there are lovely blocks and others that look like a disaster area. Then there's Hudson Avenue between Front and Water Streets, where you'll find elements of both side-by-side. As I was walking to Vinegar Hill House, I first encountered the dilapidated building on the left, below. I thought, \"Surely I must be in the wrong place.\" Next door, I found the restaurant, which occupies a former carriage house and movie set. It's a bit gussied up (though not much) since chef Jean Adamson (ex-Freemans) and her husband (who also live in the building) opened the place late last year. There's a lovely outdoor courtyard where they'll be serving food when weather permits. Though the walk to get here isn't pretty, diners have had no trouble finding the place. The 40-seat dining room was about 2/3rds full by the time I left at 7:00 p.m., and a party of 11, most wearing sport coats and nice dresses, was just arriving. Adamson keeps the menu simple, with a frequently changing list of about eight appetizers and five entrees, many of which exploit the large wood-burning oven that you can't help but notice in the open kitchen. The choices aren't adventurous, but there isn't a \"bail-out dish\" either-no burger, no strip steak. I especially liked the Wood Fired Tart ($9; above left) with mushrooms, crème fraîche and thyme. The same ingredients seemed to re-appear in a house-made Tagliatelle ($14; above right), which seemed more pedestrian, but perhaps I should have realized the similarity before I ordered. Service was friendly, and there seemed to be an ample number of staff for the small space. It does not strike me as a destination restaurant, but I'd be more than happy to return if I am in the neighborhood again.

Yesterday, Frank Bruni awarded one star to Co. We are still not sure what this review was doing in Bruni's territory. If ever there were an obvious $25 & Under candidate, this was it. Anyhow: Its sire and guiding spirit, Jim Lahey, hails from the breadmaking side of things. It's bread above all he knows and loves, and you may well have tasted the evidence of that if you've eaten out in New York over recent years. Many restaurants buy loaves, rolls, focaccia and such from Sullivan Street Bakery, his yeasty baby. At least they do if they're smart. ... ... ... But he could indeed improve upon his pizzas somewhat. Although the best of them are outstanding and all pack the pleasures of a serious crust with serious blisters - Mr. Lahey uses an oven that generates heat in excess of 900 degrees - he hasn't yet nailed the toppings. It's as if he's too focused on, and maybe too confident about, what lies beneath. A pizzaiolo-come-lately, he needs to sweat the cheese and the rest of it a little more. We and Eater both took the one-star bet, but it paid only even money, so we win just $1 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

I tried Tse Yang last week with a friend visiting from out of town. It's an opulent place that puts a fine-dining gloss on Chinese cuisine usually associated with take-out. It has been around for 20 years, along with a sister restaurant in Paris. All of the menu items are listed in two languages, French and English, an affectation that I suspect is mostly for show. Most of the online reviews emphasize that this place caters to expense accounts and well-heeled plutocrats. Soups and appetizers range from $6.50-28.00 (most over $15), entrees $19.50-55.00 (most over $25), vegetables, rice and noodles $12.00-19.50. It's a little odd to see items listed at $0.25 and $0.75 increments, at a place where the average check size is probably over $75 per head. There's a serious wine list (which we did not sample), and service is a big step up from the average Chinese restaurant. We ordered entrees to share, which were plated tableside. The servers are efficient, but they seemed bored-as you would expect at a place with laminated menus that probably haven't changed in decades, except to raise prices. We ordered quite modestly: a spring roll (left) plus shared orders of \"Your Favorite Tse Yang Chicken\" and \"Lemon Sweet-Sour Pork\" (right). There was nothing revelatory about either dish, but the flavor balances and freshness were well above what you'd get at take-out-as they ought to be. The final bill was $36 per person before tip. You can probably get food just as good or better in Chinatown for a much lower price, but the refined atmosphere at Tse Yang fits the bill for a quiet, relaxed meal.

During the recession, practically every new restaurant serves French-American bistro comfort food. And those that didn't before seem to be rapidly evolving towards that model. It's a cuisine we love as much as anyone, but we're getting a bit tired of it. So on Saturday we visited Dardanel, in the shadow of the Queensboro Bridge on Manhattan's far east side. It was a bit out of the way for us, but well worth it. The specialty here is Turkish seafood. The decor is full of nautical bric à brac, and the servers look like ships' pursors, but there's plenty for landlubbers too. Dardanel hasn't received much critical attention since it opened in November 2008, aside from the dependable Bob Lape of Crain's, who awarded two stars. But it's well worth a visit, especially if you're dining out on less money these days (as we are). Appetizers and entrees are just $5-12, entrees $16-24. The wine list has a lot of offbeat selections (Israel anyone? Georgian Republic?), along with more standard fare. Most bottles below $40. We chose a bottle of Rock Rabbit Sauvignon Blanc for just $25. An appetizer of Octopus Salad ($12; above left) was the only disappointing item we had. It tasted flat and under-seasoned; the octopus could as well have been chicken The kitchen redeemed itself with one of the daily specials, a Red Caviar Spread ($8; above center), which came with addictive home-made bread (above right). There are a good dozen meat and vegetarian entrees, but we continued with the seafood theme. Grilled Whole Bronzini ($21; above left) was as good a preparation of that fish as we've had anywhere. Mahi Mahi ($24; above right) had a beefy texture. I would have preferred it a bit more tender, but I loved the cream sauce underneath it. After dinner, the belly dancer arrived. We won't deceive you: she's not there every night. Actually, the owner said it was a first. As the photo shows (above right), we got a first-hand look. We know you expect hard-nosed investigative reporting from New York Journal, and we're determined to let you have it-raw and unvarnished. Dardanel is a fun little place that hasn't quite caught on yet. It was only about half full on a Saturday evening. Service was friendly, if a bit on the slow side, but we were in no hurry. Dinner for two, including tax but before tip, was just $101. Dardanel (1071 First Avenue between 58th & 59th Streets, Sutton Place) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Last weekend, my girlfriend and I visited the Wölffer Estate on Long Island, where she splurged on the Premier Cru Merlot, at $100/bottle. According to the winery, it is the first Long Island wine to retail above the century mark. At $12-16, Wölffer charges a good deal more for tastings than any other Long Island winery we've visited. They have some remarkable wines, but given the prices, I thought they ought to comp the tasting if you buy a few bottles (as we did). But I can't complain too much, as the wines we sampled were indeed well beyond anything we've seen on Long Island. I bought a couple of bottles too, though nothing approaching that $100 Merlot. Michelle's report is here.

***CONTENT
It's not easy for a restaurant to exceed expectations. Most new places are heavily over-promoted, establishing high hopes that few can hope to meet. Seäsonal Restaurant and Weinbar has the opposite problem. It has been open since December 2008, but among major publications only Crain's gave it a full review (two stars from Bob Lape). The Times gave it the Dining Briefs treatment (mostly favorable, from Julia Moskin). Seäsonal deserves far more attention than that. It serves modern Austrian cuisine, an under-represented genre in New York. With David Bouley's Danube now closed, Kurt Gutenbrunner's Wallse is the only restaurant even close to comparable. We gave Wallse three stars, and while we're not yet prepared to bestow the same laurels on Seäsonal, we were certainly impressed. The menu is mid-priced, with appetizers $9-18 (most $14 or less), entrees $21-32 (most $27 or less), side dishes $7, desserts $10. A seven-course tasting menu is $64. These prices are more than fair, given the quality of everything we tried. As you'd expect for a wine bar, there's an ample selection of wines by the glass. The bottle list is a bit more expensive than it ought to be, with few choices below $50. We settled on an Austrian Pinot Noir at $48, which was about the cheapest red wine available. The minimalist decor looked more Scandinavian than Austrian to us, but we found it quiet and comfortable. On a Wednesday evening, the space was less than half full. We started with a nice amuse-bouche of smoked duck (right). As I recall, there were two kinds of home-made bread, and two contrasting butters to go with it. Cheese Ravioli ($12; above left) defied the Austrian food cliche: they were light as a feather, complemented with smoked mushrooms, baby spinach, and a harvest corn sauce. My friend was equally pleased with the Foie Gras Terrine ($18; above right), with a lingonberry-mandarin confit and toasted brioche on the side. The entrees were terrific too: Pumpkin-Seed Crusted Black Sea Bass ($26; above left) with a butternut squash and black truffle sauce, and Duck Breast ($27; above right) with red cabbage and Schupfnudeln. The meal ended with a small plate of petits-fours. Service lived up to the quality of the food. The bar tab was transferred to our table without our having to ask. The restaurant's location, in the middle of a quiet midtown street, does not work to its advantage. People need to know it's there. I came in expecting a decent neighborhood place, but left with the idea that Seäsonal needs to be taken far more seriously.

Like many restaurants these days, Apiary had a troubled birth. It opened in August 2008 under Chef Neil Manacle, a Bobby Flay disciple. Adam Platt of New York awarded just one star, while the Times relegated it to Dining Briefs (a treatment accorded restaurants deemed not worth reviewing). In January 2009, the owners quietly replaced Manacle with Scott Bryan, the chef who earned three stars at Veritas. There was no splashy announcement. Florence Fabricant of the Times reported the news after Bryan had already been on the job for \"about a week.\" We decided to wait a few months to give Bryan time to install his own menu. It has been a tough couple of years for Bryan since he left Veritas (the reasons were never explained). He was named chef at two New York properties, 10 Downing and Lever House, backing out of both projects before cooking his first meal. In between, he consulted at the Falls Church, VA restaurant, 2491. He comes into Apiary with distinctly lower ambitions. The menu, with no entree above $27, is a far cry from the $85 prix fixe at Veritas. There is clearly some confusion about the concept. The sleek, high-end decor seems out of place in a neighborhood where most restaurants cater to NYU students and foodies who prefer to dine on bar stools (think Momofuku). The mid-priced menu doesn't pair well with a wine list where most reds are well above $100, and many are far above that. We had to wonder who would order a $950 Cabernet with such unassuming food. It is not unusual for appetizers to outshine entrees, but the magnitude of the difference was staggering. It was as if the main courses came from another kitchen. I started our meal assuming that I was going to give out at least two stars. I ended it wondering how I could justify even one. Hefty chunks of grilled octopus ($12; above left), served over white beans, had a luscious, smoky flavor. Warm Chevre cheese ($9; above right) was topped with greens and roasted beets. It was a less inventive dish, but beautifully done. The entrees were poor. Peking Duck Breast ($26; above left) and Grilled Hanger Steak ($27; above right) were both tough and cooked well beyond the medium rare we had requested. We couldn't detect any of the Peking spices alleged to adorn the duck, nor the green peppercorn sauce promised for the steak. Both were served atop a pedestrian vegetable puree-celery root for the duck, potatoes for the steak. We had no complaints with a side of Brussels Sprouts ($7; left). We also liked the bread service (homemade olive bread). We suspect that Bryan's kitchen is capable of doing far, far better than this. However, we can rate our meal based only on what we had, not on what might have been. Perhaps other reviewers will recommend Apiary. We cannot.

Agree that the entrees were uneven. We had the rabbit, which I thought was excellent, and a fish dish (forget what) which was just average.I remember liking the beer selection, and thinking that the server had a good understanding of the beers. Overall I liked it but do think that the weaker dishes should be improved upon.

Today, Frank Bruni bestowed one star on Macao Trading Co., once again cementing the perception that the rating means \"mediocre,\" not \"good,\" as the Times claims: One of my companions put it best. \"This...is a deeply silly restaurant.\" That's what makes it sort of fun, and that's what keeps it from being anything more than that. In the right mood, with the right stretch of the menu, lubricated by the right cocktails, and with the right tolerance for ear-decimating decibels, you can definitely enjoy Macao, in a minor way.... I think fewer New Yorkers these days are looking for restaurants that \"ooze sex and decadence,\" which is how the publicist explained the aim behind the erotica. But if New Yorkers are looking for croquettes that do that, Macao's their place. We and Eater both took the one-star bet, winning $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Macao Trading Co., the new Sino-Portuguese cocktail bazaar in West TriBeCa. The Eater odds are not yet posted as of 5:23 p.m., but we're going to go ahead and bet anyway. ETA: The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 4 - 1 One Star: 3 - 1 √√ Two Stars: 15 - 1 Three Stars: 10,000 Four Stars: 250,000 - 1 The Skinny: Bruni waited a while to review this place, which has been open since late November. If his reaction was anything like ours, when we visited in mid-December, then Macao Trading Co. is a mortal lock for one star. There were too many things wrong with it to justify two stars, but a David Waltuck menu and a strong cocktail program will keep it out of goose-egg territory. We don't entirely rule out a repeat of the Double Crown Affair-a similar restaurant that inexplicably got the deuce-but one star seems like a safer bet. The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award one star to Macao Trading Co.

***CONTENT
When Blue Smoke opened in early 2002, it was an odd diversion for the restauranteur Danny Meyer, who was better known for a string of insanely popular three-star restaurants, such as Union Square Cafe, Gramercy Tavern, Eleven Madison Park, and Tabla. (He has since added The Modern and Shake Shack to his brood.) As Eric Asimov noted in the Times, \"if anybody was going to give New York great barbecue, the thinking went, it would be Mr. Meyer.\" But Blue Smoke delivered an uneven performance, and Asimov (then writing as the paper's main critic) awarded just one star. The NYC barbecue landscape has changed considerably since 2002. Righteous Urban Barbecue (\"RUB\") and Hill Country have come along, both run by folks to whom barbecue is a religion, not just a sidelight. With those and several other standouts now available, Blue Smoke is just one of many NYC restaurants offering what purports to be authentic barbecue. Those other places don't have the Danny Meyer service model; most of them don't even take reservations. Blue Smoke did, and when I called to say I was running a late, the staff offered to \"make a note of it for the maitre d'.\" My bar tab was transferred to my table without my even asking for it, and the host seated me before my girlfriend had arrived. That kind of service puts many higher-end restaurants to shame, and you certainly wouldn't find it in any other barbecue place. But while we appreciated the fine service, the barbecue at Blue Smoke wasn't as good as RUB, Hill Country, or even Stephen Hanson's Wildwood Barbecue, all located nearby. On top of that, Blue Smoke was absolutely crushed on a Friday evening. While it isn't Danny Meyer's fault that his restaurant is insanely popular, the crowds detracted somewhat from whatever charms Blue Smoke would otherwise have. We had the Rib Sampler for Two ($35.95), which featured two Texas-style beef ribs, four Memphis baby back ribs, and four Kansas City spareribs. It is a pity that you cannot mix and match proteins and preparation methods. The dry-rub beef ribs were the most enjoyable, but they didn't have as much meat on them as I would have liked. The spare ribs were the meatiest, but they were slathered in a a \"KC Sauce\" that was over-powering. The baby backs had the saucing right, but they were too lean for our taste. The ribs are served à la carte, so I would definitely recommend ordering a couple of sides (they range from $3.95-7.95). Roasted Cauliflower Gratin ($4.95; above left) was too dry and had no perceptible cheese content. Macaroni & Cheese ($7.95; above right), the most expensive of the sides, was just fine. We didn't drink much, as we were driving out to Eastern Long Island after our meal, but there is an impressive list of beers, bourbons, house cocktails and other spirits. In this respect, Blue Smoke has other barbecue places beat. There is much more to the menu at Blue Smoke, including a long list of appetizers and salads, more than a dozen more side dishes, and standard entrees, along with several more barbecue specialities. You can probably put together a good meal here, but we left with the distinct impression that it is not worth the trouble.

***CONTENT
Absinthe Wine Bar opened in late January in the East Village, on a stretch of First Avenue that has become a dining Mecca over the last few years. It isn't as splashy as some of its neighborhood peers, but we loved the quiet, civilized atmosphere, and the food is very good indeed, especially given the low price point. Chef Nelson German's cuisine is French-Mediterranean, with couscous and chickpeas figuring in several dishes, along with many French bistro standards. Snack plates are $3 apiece, appetizers $7-9 and entrees $11-16. Wines by the glass are $7-15, and most wines by the bottle are between $25-55. The decor is described as \"a synthesis of vintage Paris and contemporary New York, with a stop in Tunisia on the way.\" A mural of Toulouse-Lautrec paintings and Tunisian fabrics dominate the small dining room. The space seats 50 between the tables and the bar, and there will be an outdoor garden when the whether gets warmer. \"Absinthe Wine Bar\" was probably not the best choice for a name. Although Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec invented an absinthe-based cocktail called the Earthquake (or Tremblement de Terre), neither it, nor indeed any Absinthe at all is served here. It is, at least, a wine bar, though with a more ambitious menu than you'll find at many places of that description. Management should try to find a way to make their narrow storefront (a former deli) more conspicuous. If you were not looking for Absinthe Wine Bar, you could easily walk right by without realizing it is is there. We started with a couple of snacks (both $3). Tomato Basil Croutons (above left) had a bright, lively flavor; I would have called them crostini. Crispy chick peas (above right) could become addictive. We loved both appetizers. Absinthe Shrimp \"Flambee\" ($9; above left) was a simple pleasure, with fennel, garlic, white wine, and sweet butter. Here too, perhaps another name would be better. With \"flambee\" in the title, we expected something flashy, perhaps at tableside, but the flame stayed in the kitchen. Spinach Meatballs ($7; above right) were much heartier, but just as effective. Both entrees were generous portions at $16. Chargrilled Steak (above left) would have been ample on its own, but it also came with short rib confit. The fries were perfect, but the steak was a bit tough. We didn't expect dry aged prime, but it occurred to us that perhaps the kitchen would be better off serving hanger or skirt steak at this price. We found no fault at all with a Trio of Lamb (above right), which came with two juicy chops, shoulder confit, and two spicy merguez sausages. Most restaurants would charge $10 more for this dish, and even then it would be a bargain. In the interest of full disclosure, we dined here at a publicist's invitation and did not pay for our meal. I can safely say that we are always happy to enjoy solid, inexpensive comfort food in a quiet, charming atmosphere. And that is exactly what Absinthe Wine Bar has to offer.

***CONTENT
Today, Frank Bruni gave three stars to the new Bouley, confirming what most other critics have said: it's better than the old one, but not quite four-star material. [T]he new Bouley is a labor of obvious and obsessive love, its decor preferable to that of the old Bouley, whose purplish pink color scheme and candied gloss always left me feeling that I was supping inside a gigantic magenta gumdrop... . In an era when the trend in restaurants is toward sleek minimalism, Bouley is a thrilling blast from the gaudy past, a reminder of how much pleasure can be had just from being tucked into such opulent chambers and attended with such formal manners. The servers are punctilious. Numerous, too. While a three-course dinner here will set you back at least $75, not counting tax, tip or drinks, you'll never wonder where that money is going. Only Daniel - which, interestingly, also spruced itself up recently, just in time for the recession - and Per Se give you quite the same feeling of giddy privilege... . A meal at Bouley has many such peaks, but it has valleys, too, and now as in 2004, when I gave the restaurant three stars, its cooking over all isn't on par with Daniel's or Per Se's. The food can be uneven, and too often engenders appreciation more than ardor. You regard rather than devour it. We and Eater both took the one-star bet, winning $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the latest reboot of Bouley, the TriBeCa standout and former four-star-club member. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 15,000-1One Star: 2,000-1 Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: 3-1 √√Four Stars: 20-1 The Background: Bouley is a restaurant with a track record, now in its third TriBeCa location. After leaving Montrachet (where he had earned three stars from Bryan Miller in June 1985), chef David Bouley struck out on his own, in the space that is now Scalini Fedeli. It was a rocky opening, with Miller awarding two stars in November 1987. By August 1990, Bouley had his act together, and Miller awarded four stars. The restaurant closed in 1996, as the chef announced big plans (with then-partner Warner LeRoy) for half-a-dozen establishments. The first of these, Bouley Bakery-a slimmed-down version of the original restaurant-opened with an enthusiastic three stars from Ruth Reichl in December 1997. The flagship was supposed to re-appear somewhere else, grander than ever, but the chef split with LeRoy, and most of the dream was temporarily shelved. Instead, Bouley upgraded the bakery space, which William Grimes hailed with four stars in September 1999. (The word \"Bakery\" was dropped from the name later on, with no other changes to the concept that I'm aware of.) By June 2004, Frank Bruni concluded that Bouley had lost its luster, quickly demoting it to three stars in the first month of his tenure as restaurant critic: I had the sense of being at a party to which I had come too late, or at which I had stayed too long. Of watching the awkward ebb of the excitement rather than the jolt itself. The electricity had dimmed, the crowd seemingly changed and the polish worn off. It was not one of Bruni's better reviews, including unsubstantiated allegations of nefarious doings in the post-9/11 era, but I think he got the rating right. Among my multiple visits to Bouley, all of them after the Bruni review, I was always happy, but not quite persuaded that it was a four-star restaurant. Last year, the chef finally started making good on the plans first announced in 1996. I won't rehash the details (see prior posts 1, 2), but he has something like seven TriBeCa projects either operating or under construction, including a lavish reboot of the original Bouley, in a space that makes a French château look humble. It's that restaurant that Frank Bruni reviews tomorrow. The Skinny: It has been 221 weeks since Frank Bruni gave four stars to a restaurant that did not have them already-the longest such drought in Times history. (His four-star review for the remodeled Daniel two months ago doesn't count, as it re-affirmed the existing rating.) Bouley is the first restaurant in quite some time that is a serious threat to break the string. The recession has curbed my dining habits, so I've not yet been to the new Bouley, except once briefly, for a cocktail. But my sense is that when a four-star restaurant comes along, critics and foodies start screaming from the rafters, \"You have got to eat here.\" There have been no such screams for the new Bouley. Nearly every review I've read suggests that the move across the street is an improvement, but with significant qualifications. Bouley (the chef) is said to be in the kitchen most nights. Nevertheless, I have to wonder how it could have his full attention, given the number of projects he is trying to manage at once. It is hard enough to launch a four-star restaurant when it's your only pursuit, much less when it's one of seven. Other four-star chefs have branched out, but not at the same time as their new flagship restaurant was in its teething stages. During Bruni's tenure, there have been only two restaurants awarded four stars that didn't have them already, Per Se and Masa. I cannot imagine Bruni saying that Bouley is as good as those two stand-outs. In late 2008, Corton received one of the most enthusiastic three-star reviews of Bruni's tenure. I cannot imagine Bruni saying that Bouley is better than Corton. In short, my guess is that Bruni will note an improvement, but that he is not quite ready to award four stars. The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award three stars to the new Bouley.

Yesterday, Frank Bruni dropped a star on the underwhelming Kefi. No review better demonstrates the debasement of the New York Times star system. One star is supposed to mean \"good,\" but in Frank's hands it usually means \"mediocre\": A friend and frequent dining companion often complains of palate fatigue, that deadening of all response when too many of a restaurant's dishes have too little nuance and a surfeit of the same bold - even bullying - notes. During some meals at Kefi, a madly popular Greek restaurant on the Upper West Side, what I experienced was more like palate mononucleosis... . The all-Greek wine list is as price-sensitive as the food, and the atmosphere is pleasant, if Greek-restaurant predictable: a white-and-blue color scheme, decorative ceramics, that sort of thing. Try not to sit at a table by the bar, where the human traffic is most snarled. And know that the scale and manner of the cooking Mr. Psilakis is doing here differ from what he's done elsewhere around town - or what he did at the original Kefi. There, many of the same dishes were executed with more precision and restraint. It was a lesser stage, but it was a greater one.ed to mean \"good,\" but Bruni constantly gives it out to mediocre places: We and Eater both took the one-star bet, winning $4 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Kefi, the new Michael Psilakis/Donatella Arpaia Greek dining barn on the Upper West Side. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 20-1One Star: 4-1 √√Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 55-1 Four Stars: 50,000-1 The Skinny: Frank Bruni clearly has a hard-on for this place. For a guy who has never taken much to blogging, his breathless panting over the new Kefi has been remarkable. And he really loves Michael Psilakis, having given him two stars on four occasions (Onera, Dona, Anthos, and Mia Dona). We are on vacation this week, so we are too lazy to insert links to those reviews, so you'll have to google them yourself. Anyhow, you can bet that Bruni walked into Kefi wanting desperately to love it. Nevertheless, we agree with Eater that to the extent there are \"rules\" for getting two stars, Kefi breaks an awful lot of them. Bruni has been less inclined to follow those unwritten rules than his predecessors, but he tends to break them for earnest \"family\" places, not for the kind of assembly-line food served at Kefi. I would add that we hated Kefi, though that is not influencing our judgment one bit. Eater mentions the Ssäm Bar exception, where there are currently three NYT stars, despite a zero-star atmosphere and one-star service. Despite our occasional carping, we do know Ssäm Bar. Ssäm Bar is a friend of ours. Kefi, you are no Ssäm Bar. We suspect, or at least hope, that Bruni will recognize that Kefi is not going to feature the kind of constant innovation that could justify a two or three-star rating for a path-breaking restaurant like Ssäm Bar. The two just aren't comparable. The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Kefi.

Yesterday, a bored and sloppy Frank Bruni awarded the expected two stars to 10 Downing. We don't object to the rating. But why did he wait till the 21st paragraph of the review to talk about the food the restaurant is now serving? And why devote the first three paragraphs to innuendo about legal charges that were never proven and subsequently dropped? Is that what Times readers interested in the restaurant needed to know? What about this: \"Mr. Neroni, by many reports, wasn't the owners' first choice to run the kitchen ... ?\" Who exactly reported that? This is The New York Times. Either cite a legitimate source, or don't print the rumor. The review is slapdash in other ways. There are three one-sentence paragraphs that begin with the word \"And.\" You'd think the guy would know how to write a proper paragraph by now. The restaurant is no doubt happy with its two stars, while disgusted with the way they were presented. We and Eater both took the two-star odds, and earn $4 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Jason Neroni's comeback at 10 Downing. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 8-1One Star: 3-1Two Stars: 4-1 √√Three Stars: 55-1 Four Stars: 20,000-1 The Skinny: The range of outcomes here is bounded by Bruni's past reviews of Neroni's work: two stars at 71 Clinton, a singleton at the short-lived Porchetta. We found 10 Downing promising when we visited in mid-December. We weren't quite ready to buy into two stars, but we certainly thought it could be headed in that direction. The restaurant has been open for four months. That's longer than Bruni normally waits. We're guessing he was on the fence between one and two stars, and wanted to see how Neroni's performance here would mature. The Bet: This has been the year of the one-star restaurant. We think Bruni has been itching to find a place to get excited about. Perhaps 10 Downing is that place. We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to 10 Downing.

La Fonda del Sol

***CONTENT
La Fonda del Sol was one of the iconic NYC destination restaurants of the 1960s, often mentioned in the same breath as The Four Seasons (which is still around) and Forum of the Twelve Caesars (which isn't). The restaurant closed in the early 1970s. Fans still mourn the loss of Alexander Girard's striking design (see this fansite). Now Patina Restaurant Group, which owns the rights (inherited from the old Restaurant Associates) wants to re-capture the magic. A new Fonda del Sol opened six weeks ago in the Met Life Building. Except for the name, it has little to do with its predecessor. Adam Tihany's design could be just as opulent as Girard's, but it's his own, not a re-do. The menu, under Josh DeChellis, is Spanish, rather than Latin American. The new Fonda was conceived before the recession. It is one of the most luxurious openings we've seen in quite a while. The large bi-level space offers a casual tapas restaurant facing Vanderbilt Avenue and an elegant formal dining room. The tapas space was totally empty on Saturday evening, except for a couple of people drinking at the bar. The location doesn't lend itself to weekend walk-ins, but the staff claim they've been doing well on weekdays, with Grand Central just a half-step away. The dining room looked to be about 80% full at 9:00 p.m. Reviewers will obsess over the clash between the luxurious space and the tanking economy. Gael Greene is the only active critic who dined at the old Fonda, and she's smitten once again. In the Daily News, Restaurant Girl awarded four out of five stars. Those are the kinds of reviews La Fonda del Sol will need, as it is on the expensive side and could have trouble attracting a crowd without good word of mouth. We liked nearly everything we had. The amuse-bouche (top left) was a thin slice of cured ham with a daikon radish. We then tried three tapas: the Potted Duckling and Pork ($11; above right), Tuna Tacos ($9.50; below left) and Veal Terrine Croquettas ($9; below right). The potted duckling, resembling a pâte, was luxuriously rich; the tuna tacos with avocado and jalapeno pickled onion packed a flavor punch. The croquettas, however, were rather forgettable. Suckling Pig ($28) was a masterpiece, with a constellation of unmentionable pig parts rolled up and covered in pig skin, served with smoked dates, almonds, and charred brussels sprouts. We loved a side dish of spicy potatoes ($9; right), but a server ought to have told us that the pig already came with brussels sprouts, as we certainly didn't need a separate side order of it ($7). The after-dinner petits-fours were as impressive as nearly any restaurant we've been to in New York, especially as the entire box was left at our table (many places ask you to choose, then take the box away). We were obviously not going to finish anywhere near all of that, but it was an impressive selection. The only real disappointment was the bread service. What is the point of offering two different kinds of rolls, when both are rock-hard? Our server was a bit wet behind the ears. When I asked for a wine list, she said, \"You mean, by the bottle?\" Hmm...what else would it be? The list could use a few more options below $50. I found an acceptable Spanish red at $38, but it didn't have much company. With judicious ordering, we managed to keep the bill to $143 before tax and tip. That's not bad at all for a restaurant as elegant as this one. This is a restaurant we'll be rooting for.

***CONTENT
The restaurant Savoy, in SoHo, has been running a cassoulet festival in February and March, with different versions of the classic dish on the menu, depending on which week you visit. We liked Savoy when we visited in late 2006, but it never advanced on my \"revisit\" list. You know the drill: so many restaurants, so little time. Chef Peter Hoffman's version of the haute barnyard theme, new as it was when he inaugurated it nearly twenty years ago, has since then been replicated at dozens of other restaurants. Few have done it so well. Some restaurants get you back by lowering their prices. Savoy did it by putting cassoulet on the menu. Next Saturday, March 14, they're even offering a cassoulet tasting festival for $55, with different versions of the dish offered by six restaurants. (A portion of the proceeds will go to charity.) We weren't up for quite that much cassoulet, but we were impressed with the sample we tasted last Friday evening. The appetizers were examples of the simple, seasonlly-driven cuisine Savoy has specialized in. A large hunk of Crispy Pork Belly Confit ($14; above left) came with a poached apple, carrot puree, and cider jelly. A Beet Consommee ($10; above right) kept company with goat cheese dumplings and baby leeks. The cassoulet ($32) was cooked in the dining room fireplace. It can be made with a variety of ingredients, though beans are a constant. This version had goose confit, braised pork, house bacon, and Toulouse sausage. Among its many merits, it was one of the few cassoulets I've had that didn't take 20 minutes to cool off to an edible temperature. The room is one of the city's unheralded romantic spots, and service is spot-on. The space was nearly empty when we arrived at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday evening, but just about full when we left over two hours later. I don't know how many of the patrons were there, as we were, expressly for the cassoulet, but it certainly seemed popular.

Is this the year of the one-star restaurant? Frank Bruni has reviewed nine new restaurants so far this year, and only one, The John Dory, got two stars. None received three or four, except the re-reviewed Daniel. This is the critic who once gave the deuce so often that Eater's Ben Leventhal dubbed him \"Frankie two-stars.\" Here's the list of Bruni's reviews this year-all one star, except for Daniel and The John Dory: Rouge Tomate (January 7)The West Branch & Bar Bao (January 14)Daniel (January 21)Cabrito (January 28)The Oak Room (February 4)The John Dory (February 11)Shang (February 18)Buttermilk Channel (February 25)L'Artusi (March 4)

Thats because he likes brand names. The two with more then one star are somewhat household names.The rest aren't as well known so theres no reason to get carried away. He will save the higher ratings for the big boys.
Marc Shepherd

Sorry, but that is simply untrue. Bruni has delivered scathing reviews to plenty of “brand name” restaurants, and he has delivered raves to many quaint, independent places. You could accuse Bruni of many things, but an attachment to brand names is not one of them. If anything, I think he holds them to a higher standard.

The real problem here is that the liberal distribution of one-star reviews makes it very difficult to turn the reviews into usable information. For example the idea that Rouge Tomate (a surprisingly good and fairly unique restaurant) is on the same level as Cabrito (pretty mediocre, and not even the best faux-Mexican in its zip code) is laughable. If he's going to be stingy with the stars, he's going to need to start awarding half-stars or something...
Marc Shepherd
2009-03-05 00:00:00
@lpshanet, the problem you’re referring to existed even before Frank got stingy. In 2006, he gave two stars in consecutive reviews to The Little Owl and Le Cirque. Obviously those two places are in no sense comparable. The two stars for L.O. were meant as a compliment, while those for Le Cirque were meant as an insult. The owners of L.O. went out and celebrated; those of Le Cirque were reduced to tears.The same thing is going on with his Rouge Tomate review. He didn’t like the place, so he gave it one star, instead of the two or three stars that the chef and owners were probably gunning for. Reviews like that can be found throughout Bruni’s tenure (and his predecessors too), where a low rating is used as an insult, whereas for other restaurants the identical rating is a compliment. It is a flaw of the system.

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni \"awarded\" - we use the term loosely - one star to L'Artusi, a restaurant that no doubt considered itself worthy of two: At L'Artusi, named for a renowned Italian cookbook writer, Mr. Thompson and his business partner, Joe Campanale, have moved well beyond the bruschetta. They have gone not only bigger - with nearly 115 seats, L'Artusi is more than twice the size of dell'Anima - but also bolder, and the uneven results are a lesson in overextension. If they turned a more skeptical eye to some of Mr. Thompson's inventions, edited the menu to about two-thirds its current length and focused harder on the execution of what remained, they'd have an excellent restaurant. As it is, they have a fitfully enjoyable one. We and Eater both took the one-star odds, and earn $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

***CONTENT
If the owners of Greenwich Grill had asked my advice about their two-headed restaurant concept, I probably would have said, \"Don't bother.\" The main dining room offers a mash-up of \"Californian, Italian, and traditional French cuisines\" refocused through a Japanese lens. You would guess none of this from the name, nor would you likely stumble upon the lightly-trafficked block on which it resides. And if you did walk by, you'd never guess there is a sushi bar downstairs. Improbably enough, Greenwich Grill is actually worthwhile. A salad of 18-month cured Prosciutto di San Daniele ($12) was cloaked with parmesan and paired with beefy slices of bufola mozzarella. A lunch-sized portion of tilefish ($18) was beautifully done. Blueberry cobbler ($8) took fifteen minutes to cook, but paid off handsomely. I tried the downstairs sushi bar, Sushi Azabu, several months ago. There is a variety of prix fixe offerings. I had the humblest of these, which set me back all of $50, including tax and tip. At that price, I was obviously not getting their most expensive stuff, but it all seemed carefully prepared. The majority of the patrons that night were Japanese-speaking, so somehow they had found this weirdly inaccessible place. I was a bit worried when a colleague and I walked in at noon for lunch today, and we had the place to ourselves. By the time we left, they had filled all of six tables. Whatever business they have is due to word of mouth, as critics paid very little attention when it opened last year. Time Out New York awarded four of six stars to the dining room and five of six to the sushi bar. Frank Bruni in the Times was less impressed, awarding just one of four to the sushi bar and ignoring the dining room entirely. Despite the odd collision of cuisines and concepts, the owners are Japanese, and this is their first New York restaurant. Perhaps this is why they had the folly to try something so strange, which nevertheless is surprisingly enjoyable. It is a quiet, comfortable place, and service is first-rate.

5 Napkin Burger is part of the same chain that owns a clutch of mediocre casual French restaurants, such as Nice Matin, Cafe d'Alsace, and so forth. Apparently the menu at Nice Matin offers a \"5 napkin burger\" that was so popular they decided it deserved its own restaurant. My advice? Don't bother. My son and I both had the namesake 5 Napkin Burger ($14.95) on Saturday evening. It was over-cooked, too greasy, and overwhelmed by the taste of caramelized onions. It oozed enough grease to make the poor bun wilt under the pressure. The space is the size of a small barn, but the decor isn't bad, featuring white tile walls and a collection of antique scales hung along the back of the room. There are over fifty beers on tap, but the rest of the menu is a mash-up of sushi and miscellaneous comfort food. Service is designed to get customers in and out in a hurry. We waited around 20 minutes for a table at 6:30 p.m. on a Saturday evening. I am not sure why it is so busy. In a neighborhood that has a dozen restaurants on every block, it's hard to see the point of this place. 5 Napkin Burger (630 Ninth Avenue between 44th & 45th Streets, Hell's Kitchen)

As time allows, I've been eating my way through the city's iconic burgers. On Friday, it was The Spotted Pig's turn. No less an authority than Citysearch's Mr. Cutlets ranks it fourth-not bad in a town where there's a burger on every street corner. I eat at the Pig only when I can arrive between 5:00 and 5:30 p.m., when dinner service begins. Any later than that, and you're looking at a long wait. The service puts many two-star restaurants to shame, from the friendly hostess that found a bar stool for me when it appeared there were none, to another hostess that offered without prompting to transfer the bar tab to my table. But let's move onto that burger ($17), a hefty monster with a gorgesous beefy taste and a crisp, charred bun. One could argue that the roquefort cheese overpowers the meat (that's Cutlets' position), though I would probably order it again as-is. The shoestring fries that come with it are insubstantial. The burger seems to be the most popular item at the Spotted Pig. I had a great view of the kitchen, and it looked like about 60% of all orders coming out were burgers. I now see why. It is truly a masterpiece of burger science. The Spotted Pig (314 W. 11 Street at Greenwich Street, West Village)

I visited Olana again the other night with a friend who was known to the house (earlier report here). We were fed what amounted to two full dinners, of which half was comped. I loved the wild mushroom salad and sausage-wrapped veal. Among pastas, there was one that incorporated chocolate that was fantastic. Less impressive were ricotta meatballs, which were too tough. Among the three desserts we tried, a carrot cake took the palm. Olana is now a year old. It has survived, despite not receiving a full review from the Times. The front dining room was close to full at prime time on a Thursday evening, and the rear dining room was closed for a private party. That's not bad for an off-the-radar restaurant in a location without much foot traffic, where all of the entrees are above $25. If you want a less expensive option, a $35 prix fixe will be offered for the rest of the year. Service glitches that we noted on an earlier visit are no longer an issue, although the sound system was a trifle too loud. The menu skews Italian, and has nothing to do with the Upstate New York estate for which the restaurant is named. That's no reason to avoid Olana, which offers a comfortable, refined dining experience that is welcome in this neck of the woods.

Top Chef Season 5 Finale

***CONTENT
I haven't blogged Top Chef during the season, as there seem to be enough people who chronicle every episode. Now that the season is over, I thought I'd share a few thoughts. Almost everyone agrees that Hosea Rosenberg is an extremely underwhelming winner. His food never seemed electrifying, but it was always \"good enough.\" Until the final episode, he had no wins after the first half of the season. In 3 of the last 6 episodes before the finale, he was in the bottom three for the elimination challenge, but survived because someone else was always worse. That's the rub in Top Chef. Until the last episode, you don't need to be good; you only need to avoid being worst. Even Hosea admits that Stefan Richter was the best chef of the season, but Stefan didn't deliver when it counted. In 3 of the last 4 episodes before the finale, he was in the bottom three. You got the distinct feeling that he was coasting, and Colicchio figured that out too. Not much gets by Tom Colicchio. Carla Hall was clearly a fan favorite, but I always thought that she was in over her head. She showed her lack of self-confidence by allowing her sous-chef to alter significantly two of the dishes, both of which turned out poorly. Neither Hosea nor Stefan acted as though they considered her a threat. As Tom Colicchio has endlessly stated, there is no cumulative scoring on Top Chef. You could win 5 challenges in a row, but if you are the worst on any given day, you're going home. Under that rule, Hosea simply had to win. It was abundantly clear that he cooked the best meal in the final challenge. Obviously I didn't taste the food, but I noted that the editors weren't even able make it seem close. Going into the final commercial break, it was just overwhelmingly obvious that Hosea had won. I really don't see how cumulative scoring can work in a finale. You could have a season where one contestant has built up such a huge lead that the finale is essentially meaningless. I do think that they should use cumulative scoring earlier in the season, so that obviously superior chefs aren't sent home for one mistake. Some of this season's challenges seemed unusually contrived. Especially in the finale, the chefs ought to be allowed to \"do their thing.\" Why were Stefan and Hosea fighting over a limited supply of caviar? Give them a budget and let them go shopping, as they did in earlier episodes. And why the artificial 2-hour prep limit and the extra surprise tossed in on the final day? If the goal is really to identify the top chef, then the producers should get out of their way, and let them cook the way they want to cook. So Hosea is this season's winner. He says he wants to open a restaurant, although the $100,000 prize is probably only 10% of the nest-egg he'd need. I suspect that some of the more glamorous contestants will be able to milk more out of their Top Chef appearances than Hosea will.

As expected, Frank Bruni awarded one star to Buttermilk Channel today, finding it... a restaurant of real standards, noteworthy ambition and uncommon slavishness to trends.

Unfortunately: Although one in three dishes widely misses its mark and the restaurant's reach frequently exceeds its grasp, there's the possibility of a terrific meal. There's the probability of a pleasant one. Among the charcuterie items, a few \"are like earnest but clumsy culinary-school first attempts.\" And how, exactly, would Frank know that? No matter.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni rides the subway to Brooklyn for a review of Buttermilk Channel. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 15-1One Star: EVEN √√Two Stars: 7-1Three Stars: 144-1 Four Stars: 20,736-1 The Skinny: We haven't paid any attention to Buttermilk Channel, but we subscribe to the theory that two-star restaurants don't hide in plain sight. The very obscurity of this place makes us doubtful that we'll see two stars tomorrow. For those looking for contrary evidence, Restaurant Girl's improbable three-star review gives cold comfort. The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Buttermilk Channel.

I stopped by the Raines Law Room the other night. This is the new Flatiron speakeasy-themed cocktail lounge that can't buy any love, because speakeasies are just so last year. Or so the cocktailians say. My own theory is that the theme is outdated only when the customers stop visiting, and Raines doesn't have that problem. They were already about half-full at 6:00 p.m. on Friday night, and pretty close to fully committed an hour later. The speakeasy motif is everywhere you look. The storefront (a former antique store) is unlabeled, and there's no phone number nor reservations taken. You ring a doorbell to gain admission. (If they're full, the host takes your cellphone number, and you cool your heels somewhere else till he calls.) The \"bar\" is an upscale kitchen counter-as if this were somebody's basement, and the \"lounge\" their living room. The main room is a plush, pretty space. As I was alone, the host gave me the option of \"visiting the kitchen,\" without mentioning there was nowhere to sit. No matter. I chatted up the bartenders and had a couple of cocktails ($13 ea.), rye and bourbon based, with balanced, forward flavors. Some of the modern cocktail ritual is just a gimmick (hand-crushing the ice-can anyone really tell?), but they're doing a good job here. The place could use some food. The only option offered is a $15 plate of miscellaneous munchies (cheese, sliced meat, olives). They ought to be able to improve on that. Oh, and in case you didn't know, \"Raines Law\" refers not to a school for attorneys, but to an 1896 prohibition-like law that restricted alcohol sales in New York. So drink up and enjoy. Raines Law Room (48 W. 17th St. between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Flatiron District)

La Focaccia is one of the seemingly infinite number of neighborhood restaurants that inhabit West Village street corners. It would be a full-time job to sample them all, but La Focaccia caught our eye, thanks to a wood-burning oven, clearly visible from ceiling-height picture windows facing on West Fourth and Bank Streets. The place has rustic Northern Italian charm, with tile tabletops and a pressed tin ceiling, but tables are cramped tightly, and a room full of hard surfaces amplifies the din. There's a steady trail of walk-ins, ensuring that no table goes unoccupied for long. Oddly enough, the bread did not seem to be focaccia-it was thicker than it should be. However, it was soft and served warm, which was good enough. Portions are on the hearty side. When the server brought two large bowls of gnocchi with pesto sauce ($16; right), we were sure she had misunderstood our request for a single order to split, not two separate orders. Our fears proved unfounded when the bill arrived, and we were charged for just one order of gnocchi. And it was a perfectly respectable gnocchi that I would be happy to eat again. (The photo was snapped after I'd already eaten half of it.) Among the entrees, the mixed grill for two ($58) is the choice for those who are indecisive. It's a massive portion of lamb, chicken, sausage, steak, and vegetables, which we could not finish. We puzzled at the logic of including three lamb chops on a plate designed to be share by two people, especially as the lamb was easily the best of the bunch, with the sausage a close second. The chicken was forgettable, the steak and vegetables pedestrian. The wine list has plenty of choices if you're on a budget. A 2003 Salice Salentino at $30 was just fine for our purposes. The unevenness of the food, coupled with the loud surroundings, did not leave us with any urge to return.

I had the $35 prix fixe on Thursday, a follow-up to the pre-theater supper we enjoyed there the week before. (I gave much more background in my earlier post.) I can't stress enough how solid this place is. They're not doing anything complicated, but what they do is executed perfectly. I had the wood-roasted oysters, the rotisserie chicken, and the ginger bread pudding. The chef-owner, Waldy Malouf, thinks of the little things, like serving warm milk with coffee.

Hardly a day goes by without another dozen restaurants practically giving their food away - anything to get customers to part with increasingly scarce cash. But the recession has not yet arrived at BLT Market, Laurent Tourondel's haute barnyard on Central Park South. I reserved a table for an informal meal with friends visiting from out of town, but my heart sank when I looked at the online menu. The place is more expensive than ever. If they've made any compromise for tough times, I sure-as-hell can't see it. Appetizers are $14-19, entrees $26-45 (the majority over $35), side dishes $8-12, desserts $9-12. None of the entrees come with vegetables, so for a three-course meal you could easily spend $70 per head before tax and tip. You'll likely go north of $100 if you drink wine, as the expensive list has few options below $70 per bottle. It tops out with an 1870 Château-Lafite-Rothschild at the odd price of $11,111. You do, at least, get some nice extras, starting with the excellent \"pigs in a blanket\" amuse (right) and the terrific warm bread stuffed with spinach. I wonder, though, why they haven't come up with any other amuses: I've had the same one twice previously. The novelty this time was a serving of warm, cream-filled doughnut holes after dinner. Both savory courses were faultless: a Chestnut Apple Celery Root Soup with Mushroom Toast ($16; above left) and Roasted Halibut ($27; above right). There is no mystery about why BLT Market is so expensive: the dining room was full on a Wednesday evening. The chef de cuisine these days is Ed Cotton, formerly of the Michelin-starred Veritas. His work here has flown beneath the radar, as the original reviews pre-dated his arrival, and I don't believe any of the critics have been back. The Times never reviewed the place at all, an omission that ought to be rectified. I think there are better options for your money, but if you happen to dine at BLT Market you won't feel cheated. Everything is well executed, the service is excellent, and the faux barnyard decor is easy on the eyes, if not especially original.

[Kreiger via Eater] At the risk of repeating myself, casual French cuisine seems to be making a comeback. It is all the more remarkable, given that most of the city's critics don't give a damn (\"French = boring\"). This week's exhibit: Almond, which opened about four months ago, cloned from a popular Hamptons restaurant. It occupies the cursed space that has been home to three Jeffrey Chodorow failures (Rocco's, Brasserio Caviar & Banana, and Borough Food & Drink). Chodorow still owns the space, but as far as we can tell, he has no other role in this new venture. As long as he stays away, Almond should have a chance. The critics have mostly ignored Almond, as you'd expect for any French brasserie that doesn't have a well known chef (such as Ducasse, Bouley, or Boulud). Bob Lape awarded two stars in Crain's, while Frank Bruni relegated it to Dining Briefs. I was smitten the moment I arrived, and the hostesses offered to seat me, although I was twenty minutes early. It so happened there were plenty of empty tables, but in a Chodorow-run restaurant that would not stop them from shooing you to the bar, which at 7:40 p.m. was completely full. Later on, the restaurant filled up too-not completely, but better than most places we've visited lately. The menu consists of French brasserie standards at recession prices, with starters $9-14 and entrees $15-29 (most $18-24). There's a broad selection of side dishes ($7). Burgers and sandwiches are $15. Both appetizers were wonderful: Duck Confit with creamy lentils and banyuls vinegar ($12; above left) and Salt Cod Croquettes with saffron aioli ($10; above right). Aged New York Strip ($29; above left) was one of the better non-steakhouse steaks we've had in quite some time, and the fries were perfect. Daube of Lamb Belly ($23; above right) was competent comfort food; it tasted better than it looked. The space is not especially charming or memorable, and it gets loud when full, but service was just fine. The wine list has plenty of decent choices below $50, including the 2005 Languedoc we had for $38.

We didn't get a chance to post our BruniBet this week. The Eater odds weren't yet announced when I left work, and when I got home Frank's one-spot for Shang was already posted-much earlier in the evening than usual. For what it's worth, I had planned to make the same one-star bet that Eater did, not because I agree with it, but because it was the safest guess. Bruni is a follower, and when the critics before him weigh in with a collective \"MEH,\" he usually does too. Indeed, for the first time I can remember, he came out and admitted that he read his fellow-critics' reviews before writing his own: The dining room is relatively understated, apart from a cluster of circular orange banquettes and a few peachish lighting fixtures so oddly shaped and unusually textured that my fellow critics have outdone themselves with metaphors, which I'd be a fool to try to improve upon. \"Papier-mâche breasts\" are what came to one reviewer's mind. \"Rumpled old stockings\" popped into another's. Split the difference and you've got the picture. [See photo above.] We liked Shang a lot better than Frank did, but I certainly think it was churlish to blame the restaurant for a staircase and a bar that it does not control. Doesn't Frank realize this is a hotel?

[Krieger via Eater] Note: Well, that was fast. Less than three months in, Trigo closed. Its replacement is Bar Artisanal, a branch of Chef Terrance Brennan's cheese-happy restaurant franchise. The instant we walked into Trigo, we knew that it was planned before the recession. It's a cavernous space, decked out in medieval gloom, with towering ceilings and wooden arches. It's termed a Mediterranean brasserie, with the food seeming more Italian than anything else. The chef, Michael Garrett, has stints at Aquavit and Merkato 55 on his C.V. The menu has a bunch of categories, and the server tried to steer us into a four-course meal. We were having none of that. Three small starters and an entree apiece was more than enough. House-cured gravlax ($11; above left) was too small a portion to make an impression. Wild Boar prosciutto ($9; above right) was perfectly fine. The star of the appetizers, though, was a Lamb Tart ($14; above right), made in the restaurant's wood-burning oven. If you visit Trigo, go straight for anything that comes out of that oven. We concluded with two pasta entrees, Lobster Parpadelle ($26; above left) and Linguine with Clams ($23; above right), both of which struck us as hearty nourishment but not food worth going out of the way for. I can't find serious fault with anything Trigo served, but it was unexciting (except for the lamb tart). With a $32 bottle of wine, the total came to $115 before tax and tip, a bit more than I care to pay for food this boring. The space was never more than half full, but by the time we left the hard surfaces made it loud indeed.

Valentine's Day at Corton

***CONTENT
The restaurant industry calls major holidays \"amateur night.\" Valentine's Day, Mother's Day and New Year's Eve are the biggest culprits. Restaurants are overrun with customers who don't eat out a lot. Many places charge outsized prices for less-interesting versions of their normal menus-because they can get away with it, because it's easier, or because they figure that customers want \"safe\" food. If you dine out all year long, choosing a restaurant on \"amateur night\" is a challenge. I've had some good luck, but I've also been burned. I'll accept a price premium, but I don't want to pay twice as much for food half as good as usual. We guessed that Paul Liebrandt, the chef at Corton, wouldn't be capable of serving boring Valentine's Day food. The tasting menu price was jacked up to $205 (it's $120 normally), but at least Liebrandt didn't compromise. If anything, the food seems to have improved since our last visit. With three stars from Frank Bruni in the bag, maybe he feels like he can let his creative side roam free again. I didn't want to disrupt a relaxing evening with photos. You can see the menu on the right (click for a larger image). The Sweetbread and White Chocolate Palette were spectacular, the Turbot and Pheasant very good. An amuse that I can only call \"foie gras soup\" was outstanding. For the rest, I'll let the printed menu speak for itself. Liebrandt's platings occasionally get too cute, with daubs of sauce no larger than a nickel that you can barely taste, but that's more an observation than a drawback. My eyes landed on a $60 Ladoix burgundy, and sommelier Elizabeth Harcourt's eyes lit up-one of her favorites, she said. After we ordered it, we understood why. My only complaints are picky, but given Corton's aspirations I'll state them anyway. The timing of the courses was a bit lumpy, with the first few coming out too quickly, and then some awfully long pauses later on. We didn't mind the pauses, but the earlier courses needed better spacing. And some of the runners need a brush-up on their mechanics: plates should be served and cleared from the side, not across the table. One server refilled my wine glass before my girlfriend's. For the record, Drew Nieporent was in the house, seating customers and busing tables. I had wondered if he would still be working the floor after the review cycle was over, but for now, he is. He told us that he turned away 300 covers, which I could well believe. Corton is one of the few high-end places that does not seem to have seriously suffered in the recession. Getting three stars from every critic in town will do that. Based on this meal, I would say Corton is still getting better. Given how good it was already, that is a high compliment indeed.

Not a week goes by without further retrenchment in the restaurant industry. Even Tom Colicchio's sainted Craft empire is hunkering down for a long recession. This week, the front room at Craftsteak rebranded itself \"Halfsteak,\" where every dish is under $15. I've visited Craftsteak three times (1, 2, 3), but I've been wholly satisfied only once. To be fair, the first two visits were early on, before Colicchio fired the executive chef and bought new broiling equipment. But I continue to read mixed reports, suggesting a visit to Craftsteak is very much a crapshoot. It's a tough value proposition for a place where almost all steaks are above $50. I'm not visiting many steakhouses these days. Even if I was, I'd have to think twice before returning to Crafsteak. But the sub-$15 menu at Halfsteak has my attention. This is a place where one doesn't mind just \"dropping in.\" Halfsteak occupies the casual front dining room at Craftsteak. Everything is priced at odd multiples of a half-dollar. Snacks are $6½, salads $7½, small plates $9½, sandwiches $11½, \"one-pots\" $13½, desserts $4½, and the namesake halfsteak with fries is $14½. [Click on the menu for a larger image.] The concept extends to cocktails ($7½), half pints of beer ($3½) and wines by the glass ($10½). Even the notoriously exorbitant wine list has been dialed down. There are twenty bottles on offer, all $55 or less (most under $50). The beers are thoughtful choices from small, artisanal producers; not Budweiser and Schlitz. Craftsteak's chef de cuisine is Shane McBride. As he did at his short-lived midtown chophouse 7Square, he isn't afraid to challenge his audience. I am quite sure that fried tripe is not on this menu because there was overwhelming demand for it. Likewise brisket with sauerkraut or a duck confit omelet. I wasn't too hungry, so I ordered just two snacks ($6.50 ea.), the Smoked Chicken Wings with White BBQ Sauce (above left) and the Lamb Spare Ribs with Cucumber Raita (above right). The wings were wonderful, perfectly seasoned and slightly spicy. Where on earth did that white barbecue sauce come from? The lamb ribs were slightly dry and not quite warm enough. Total bill with two half-pints of beer: $20. The restaurant's two-star service model hasn't changed. I almost laughed when I asked for a wet-nap to wash my hands after all that finger food, and they brought out a hot towel. Both the main dining room and the front room were doing a respectable business, but neither was full between 7 and 8pm on a Thursday evening. The current recession has taken its sad toll on many restaurants, but among those that remain open there are many good deals to be had. Halfsteak is one of the best around. \"Halfsteak\" (85 Tenth Avenue at 15th Street, Far West Chelsea)

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Beacon. Beacon, a midtown steakhouse, was completely off my radar until eGullet's \"Fat Guy\" raved about the tasting menu served on Thursday nights. It's currently $98 for 12 courses, including winees. That would be a remarkable value even if a few of the courses were duds-not that they are. Subsequent reports bore out Fat Guy's recommendation (Frank Bruni reviewed it late last year), but it was impossible to get in (only 6 seats, only on Thursdays), and I don't usually fancy such a heavy meal on a weeknight. From the beginning, Beacon was more than just an average steakhouse. In the Times, William Grimes awarded two stars in 1999: \"Organized around an open kitchen and a huge wood-burning oven, it delivers uncomplicated, big-flavored food, emphasizing fresh, seasonal ingredients. That's all, and that's enough.\" Like many restaurants, Beacon has felt the bite of the recession. The $35 \"Restaurant Week\" menu has been extended at least until the end of February, and perhaps indefinitely. Deals abound, such as a $44 pp. family style meal on Sunday evenings, with bottles of wine under $35, and no corkage if you bring your own. The normal menu features dry-aged Niman Ranch steaks, but there's a wide variety of other choices, most of them revolving around the wood-burning oven. The chef/owner, Waldy Malouf, has a lot of seats to fill. On a recent Tuesday evening, the vast tri-level space was perhaps 60% occupied, which is better than many restaurants, but probably not good enough, given midtown rents. I also suspect that many patrons are doing as we did, and ordering at the bottom end of the menu. A mixed green salad with herb vinaigrette and goat cheese (below left) was all you could ask of a $13 salad. The burger and fries ($21; below right) were terrific. It's Niman Ranch beef and tastes dry-aged. I couldn't help but compare it to the over-hyped LaFreida Black Label blend served at City Burger. The Beacon burger is $5 more than the City Burger product. But City Burger is a fast-food joint with styrofoam containers, plastic trays, and minimal counter seating. Beacon is a full-service restaurant, with waiters, white tablecloths, cloth napkins, silverware, three kinds of homemade bread, etc. On top of that, their burger was better (thicker, juicier, tastier) than the one Mr. Cutlets has been shilling at City Burger, and their fries were better too. It was about as impressive as a salad, burger, and fries can be. Beacon (25 W. 56th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)

The Payoff: The John Dory

***CONTENT
Today, Frank Bruni awarded two stars to the John Dory, in a surprisingly muted review: [Ken] Friedman is credited as the decorator, and it's as if he went on eBay, typed in \"fish decor\" and bought and made use of everything that popped up. It's all very \"Finding Nemo,\" or maybe losing Nemo, because the impact of this visual chaos - ratcheted up by an open kitchen that is a distraction too many - can be to give you a maritime migraine and tug your focus from the edible fish that are the purpose and point of the project. Nemo gets lost in another sense as well. In Ms. Bloomfield's laudable determination not to treat seafood as lean and pristine cuisine, she sometimes goes too far, for example dousing the restaurant's namesake dish, a whole roasted John Dory for two, with not just a salty salsa verde but also an audaciously generous measure of butter and other pan juices. Although gorgeously cooked, the fish becomes almost incidental. Dungeness crab, meanwhile, is bombarded by a black pepper sauce. There were more complaints than he usually incorporates in a two-star review, unless it's a three-star aspirant gone bad. I suppose it means that Bruni seriously considered awarding three stars, and felt obligated to give the reasons why not. We thought the John Dory was very obviously a two-star place from the get-go, but we hear Chef April Bloomfield was disappointed. The trouble is that when Bruni gives three stars to marginal places, every chef thinks it can happen to them, even though their restaurant lacks most of the amenities a three-star place should have. The John Dory is a two-star restaurant-in the good sense-and has nothing to be ashamed of: Ms. Bloomfield's revel in richness and big flavors pays off. Two in particular stand out: this restaurant's answers to the gnudi that Ms. Bloomfield made famous at the Spotted Pig. Only they're more adventurous, and possibly even more enjoyable. One of them, an appetizer labeled an oyster pan roast, is essentially a thick, garlicky, intense bisque in which several of the plumpest, most tender oysters imaginable loll. But even that's not the whole of it. With the bisque comes crostini covered in overlapping petals of a pale orange puree of uni, butter and salt. If Poseidon had a preferred canape, this would be it. The other marquee dish, an entree, involves several large, seared bulbs of squid that are stuffed, as the menu promises, with chorizo. But once again the menu is indulging in understatement.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni goes swimming at the John Dory, the new Ken Friedman/April Bloomfield seafood place. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 25-1One Star: 6-1Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 5-1 √√Four Stars: 250-1 The Skinny: A bad review (zero or one) would be a big surprise here. Ken Friedman knows how to run a restaurant, April Bloomfield can most assurely cook, and reports have been fairly positive-including ours. But three stars? Hoo boy, that's stretching it, even by Bruni's loose standards. Bruni has given the trifecta to some dubious restaurants, but we don't see here the level of execution we observed at Dovetail, Matsugen, or BLT Fish in its early days-all three-star laureates that should have received two. Our bets lately have not been very reliable, but we're going with the safer choice. The Bet: We predict that Frank Bruni will award an enthuisastic two stars to the John Dory.

Centro Vinoteca

***CONTENT
[Kalina via Eater] Centro Vinoteca is one of those restaurants that raises immediate suspicion, with its achingly long 18-month gestation and a game of musical chefs before it served its first meal in the summer of 2007. Frank Bruni's middling one-star review did nothing to pique my curiosity. Last fall, founding chef Anne Burrell-she of the blonde spikey hair, perhaps best known as Mario Batali's sidekick on Iron Chef-left the restaurant. Apparently all of her TV gigs were interfering with more important matters-like, you know, cooking. No successor was announced, but the owners quietly passed the baton to sous chef Leah Cohen (left), whom they knew - although we did not - was about to appear as a \"cheftestant\" on Season 5 of Bravo's Top Chef. Cohen has had an eventful season on the show. As of this writing, she has made it to the final five, out of an original cast of seventeen. She is not a bad chef, but she will probably be remembered for getting caught on camera playing tonsil hockey with a fellow cheftestant. Most observers expect her to be sent home well before the finale, as she has barely scraped by in the last several challenges. Of course, the episodes we watch now were taped months ago. As of today, Cohen is chef de cuisine at Centro Vinoteca, and the restaurant's website doesn't fail to remind you. I don't know how many people visit the restaurant to see her-as if you could actually \"see\" anything-but they are milking it for all it's worth. We paid a visit on Saturday evening. Okay, I'll admit it: I wanted to see what Cohen's food was like, apart from the contrived and time constrained challenges imposed on TV. Whether due to Cohen's minor celebrity turn or other reasons, the restaurant was as crowded as any we have been in lately. It is a noisy, cramped space, and not especially pleasant. (An upstairs dining room appears to be a bit more civilized.) For a casual Italian joint, prices here are a tad on the high side, with antipasti $10-16, primi $14-18, and secondi $22-36. The menu appears to be changing regularly. Many of the items mentioned in the Bruni review have been replaced. Both pastas were very strong: a kabocha squash ravioli with walnuts ($14; above left) and a squid ink tagliatelle with baby squid, shrimp and cockles ($18; above right). But both pastas got cold too quickly, as the plates had not been pre-warmed. Sausage-Stuffed Baby Chicken ($22; above left) suffered from a lack of balance between its two main ingredients. There was about a millimeter of chicken wrapped around far too much of the sausage. It was tender and nicely complemented by a bed of creamy polenta and mushrooms, but the sausage was too powerful a presence. Ribeye Steak ($36; above right) is a bail-out dish in many restaurants. It was beautifully done here, but my girlfriend said that the potato prosciutto fontina cake underneath it was inedible. If Centro Vinoteca offered a more quieter atmosphere, I might consider returning to try more of the pastas. They weren't good enough to compensate for the loud, cramped atmosphere and the uneven entrees.

What is it with classic French brasseries these days? In the last year, they've been sprouting up all over town, admittedly with mixed success. Just when Adam Platt was ready to dance on the grave of French cuisine, it has returned with a vengeance. So now comes Perle, deep in the Financial District, on the same row of Colonial-era townhouses as Fraunces Tavern. It sports one of the glitziest websites we've seen in a while and a bi-level renovation that cannot have come cheap. The upstairs looks like a Paris transplant, while the bustling wine bar and \"boudoir\" (a private party room) downstairs have a more \"clubby\" vibe. There's nothing original on the menu, but everything we tasted was executed flawlessly, from Poulpes [octopus] Provençale ($11; above left) to a Terrine de Canard ($11; above center and right). Likewise a humble but thoroughly addictive Bœef Bourguignon ($19; above left) and a tender Magret de Canard ($23; above right). Service was just fine for this type of restaurant. Butter was too cold, but everything else was as it should be. A vegetable side dish went forgotten. We were not charged, but given the large portion sizes it was just as well. An after-dinner drink was comped. At first, I feared the downstairs wine bar was doing better business than the dining room, but our reservation was early. By the time we left (around 8:20 p.m.) the dining room was about 2/3rds full. A place like this will need word-of-mouth, because it isn't quite important enough to be a dining destination, and most of the critics are likely to ignore it-not that they should, but it's the cold reality. If you like French classics, you'll probably love Perle. Perle (62 Pearl Street near Broad Street, Financial District) Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

Today, Frank Bruni gives the Oak Room a one-star spanking from which it may not recover, finding that \"there were letdowns, huge and many\": I had meals stippled with disappointment. More than a few dishes were clumsily executed or vacuously luxurious. Seldom have I had so many black truffle shavings thrown at me to so little effect. The prices aren't crazy in the context of such truffling and trappings; in fact, they're reportedly 25 percent lower than they were slated to be back in the early fall, before the economy deteriorated further. But they remain steep enough - $34 for cod, $44 for a double-cut pork chop - to build expectations for meals more seamless than the ones I had... . [F]or anyone seeking relatively firm assurance that a serious tab will mean serious pleasure, the Oak Room won't do. It's more looker than performer. Make no mistake: the Oak Room was designed for three stars; to receive only one is a serious setback. Among new restaurants reviewed during Frank Bruni's tenure, only V Steakhouse and the Russian Tea Room stand out as comparable smackdowns. The former is now closed; the latter fired its chef not long after the review. I haven't dined at the Oak Room, so I can only say that if Bruni had the meals he described, a one-star rating may be too generous-an insult to the many restaurants where one star actually means what it is supposed to mean: \"good\". In the wagering department, we have not been doing well since our BruniBetting feature resumed. We've been losing lately far more often than we've been winning. But this week, Eater was wrong too, so we both lose a dollar on our hypothetical bets.

Mister Cutlets, among others, have been giving lots of love to the La Frieda Black Label Burger. Cutlets calls it the \"Bentley of Beef.\" According to A Hamburger Today: \"The Black Label blend is aimed at high-end restaurants and features an intoxicating mix of skirt, brisket, short rib, and a secret cut that is actually dry aged! It has an extremely generous 70/30 meat-to-fat ratio, making for an ethereally succulent burger.\" It is most curious that a secret blend allegedly aimed at high-end restaurants is available only at the lowest-end restaurant, City Burger in midtown. It's a slip of a space with less ambiance (though better service) than the average McDonald's. The only seating is at either of two narrow counters, one of which is along the glass wall. I kept on my winter coat, and I was still freezing. This Bentley of Burgers comes in a styrofoam box. I've nothing against styrofoam at fast food restaurants, but I struggle to comprehend why this ultra-secret, heavily hyped blend is served nowhere else. Anyhow, it is a very good burger, a bit on the small side, with a hint of dry-aged flavor and a foie gras-like richness. The bun that City Burger uses doesn't quite stand up to such a juicy piece of meat (more photos here and here). The Black Label Burger sells for $12.99, twice the cost of the regular burger. With french fries ($2.75) and a diet soda ($1.95), the bill came to $19.17. And just one word of caution: City Burger is closed on weekends-as I found out to my dismay when I stopped by on Saturday evening. City Burger (1410 Broadway near 39th Street, West Midtown)

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the legendary Oak Room at The Plaza, recently under new management with a Michelin-lauded chef, Joel Antunes. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 20-1One Star: 6-1Two Stars: 3-1 √√Three Stars: 4-1 Four Stars: 25-1 The Skinny: The poor Oak Room had the misfortune to open right into the headwind of the worst recession in a generation. The price of dinner here is more than a car payment. The cuisine is luxe Continental-always a tough sell in New York, even in the best of times. Pro reviewers to date all give Chef Antunes his due, but none of them are shouting from the rooftops, \"You must eat here!\" - the way they did at Corton, for example. This isn't a style of dining that has ever floated Frank Bruni's boat, and we suspect he'll find the high price point off-putting, unless everything served was absolutely perfect. We agree with Eater that the odds between two and three stars are nearly in equipoise, and any other outcome would be surprising. Given Bruni's track record, we agree that two stars is the slightly more probable outcome. The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will most likely award two stars to the Oak Room.

I am late to the Redhead party. There's a discussion thread on mouthfuls that is now up to 48 pages-more than almost any other restaurant in the city. I remember thinking, \"What could the fuss be about?\" In mid-2008, it got the Dining Briefs treatment from Pete Wells of the Times, even though it was then serving dinner only one night a week. The fuss is about good southern-fried comfort food priced so low that it's one of the best deals in town. In late 2008, the Redhead opened for full-time dinner service. With most appetizers $12 or less and most entrees $20 or less, you can put together a respectable meal for well under $50 per head, including alcohol. I started with the excellent Grilled Kreutzer Sausage ($8), which comes with a mid-sized warm pretzel that I found almost superfluous. The acclaimed Buttermilk Fried Chicken ($17) has a nice side salad decked with walnuts and the best cornbread I have ever tasted. Counting the pretzel, the cornbread, and a dinner roll, it was a carby meal indeed. A free chocolate oatmeal cookie came with the bill, but I set it aside after one bite. The setting is a dimly-lit pub. I didn't try any of the house cocktails, but a decent Côtes du Rhone was just $8 a glass. Service was much more attentive and friendly than you'd expect in such a place. I was seated immediately at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday evening. I wanted to linger, but by 7:20 p.m. the bar was packed. Though no one asked me to leave, it seemed unfair to monopolize a table when others were at the bar waiting. So I left. This is one of many East Village places that I would gladly patronize all the time, if only it were on my commuting path home. Perhaps it's time I rethought my travel pattern. After all, it isn't that much of a detour to hop an L train to First Avenue, where the Redhead is only a block away.

What do you get when a former Babbo sommelier (Joey Campanale) and a former Del Posto and Le Bernerdin chef (Gabe Thompson) open a casual Italian joint at neighborhood prices? You get dell'Anima, one of those instantly popular, crazily-crowded places, that you figure you'll never get into. Strangely enough, I got in last night-a bail-out choice when Corner Bistro was too crowded. Reservations at dell'Anima (which means \"of the soul\") are tough to come by, but there was one lonely bar stool free, and I grabbed it. The space is casual and cramped. In an early visit shortly after dell'Anima opened in late 2007, Frank Bruni found the food pleasant but unadventurous, and the service was too slow. He did not bother filing a full review, but it scarcely mattered: dell'Anima was a hit, and its owners now have a follow-up at nearby L'Artusi. The menu (click on image for a larger version), which changes daily, is in the standard four-part format, with antipasti e insalate ($11-16), primi ($16-18), secondi ($20-28) and contorni ($7). There's an odd mix of English and Italian: \"PORK CHOP, ribolata refrito, pear mostarda\" is a typical dish. In case you were wondering, pasta fatta in casa. I wanted to eat simply, so I started with the Endive ($12; above left) with anchovy citronette and pecorino. Flavors were bright and forward. Trofie ($16; above right) was unexplained, but I rolled the dice anyway. Short pasta noodles, slightly thicker than spaghetti, came in a spicy blend with bacon, tomato, shallots, and rosemary. I didn't check out the full wine list, but the selections by the glass were ample, and not just generic choices either. A 1999 Satta Vermentino was just $12 per glass. Service was attentive and brisk-an improvement from some of the early reports. I overheard the bartender offering to transfer a tab to a diner's table, something the customer had not even asked for. At most places in dell'Anima's price range, exactly the opposite happens. As I was leaving, the hostesses made a point of thanking me for the visit, a nice touch often lacking in places like dell'Anima that clearly do not need my business. dell'Anima (38 Eighth Avenue at Jane Street, West Village) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Today, as we half-expected, Frank Bruni files a largely redundant one-star review of Cabrito: Visited on its best nights and judged by its best dishes, Cabrito is the Mexican restaurant so many of us dreamed about for so long ... . Much of the time, that is. There's a qualification in the first sentence up top and a digression right here because Cabrito is afflicted by an inconsistency that's puzzling, even maddening, in the sense that you don't want anything challenging the exhilaration you can so easily and rightly feel about this special place. There are dishes that don't seem, by nature, to rise to the caliber of others, and dishes that aren't dependable from one visit to the next. In the wagering department, we took a literal \"roll of the dice\" on two stars, and lose a dollar on our hypothetical bet, while Eater wins $2.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Cabrito, the West Village Mexican place helmed by Fatty Crab alumnus David Schuttenberg. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 4-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1Three Stars: 500-1 Four Stars: 20,000-1 The Skinny: When we heard about this review, our initial reaction was, \"Why bother?\" It seemed like an obvious one-star place, which in Timesspeak usually means \"uneven.\" Julia Moskin more-or-less delivered that verdict in a May 2008 Dining Brief. Why give it more ink, just to deliver the same message a mere eight months later? The only other clue comes in Frank Bruni's year-end retrospective, in which he says that Cabrito's \"best dishes - including the carnitas with salsa verde and the roasted poblano peppers in cream - match those at just about any Mexican restaurant in New York.\" If he thinks Cabrito is a category-killer, it just might be enough to push it over the edge to two stars, provided there aren't too many duds on the menu. To be sure, the Eater odds accurately reflect the probabilities, but we think two stars are definitely in play here. This review will almost certainly be an \"enthusiastic one\" or a \"two with caveats.\" He has more often done the latter than the former. The Bet: Our record when we literally \"roll the dice\" has been mixed, to say the least. Nevertheless, we'll go out on a limb and predict two stars for Cabrito.

Bar Breton opened about six weeks ago in the Flatiron District. It's the casual sibling to Fleur de Sel, Cyril Renaud's Michelin-starred place nearby. Like many restaurants named \"Bar X\" these days (Bar Boulud, Bar Blanc, etc., etc.), there is a bar, but it's beside the point. The menu offers a mix of French brasserie standards along with savory crepes known as galettes. There are four of these ($12-18), along with small plates called niacs ($8-12), soups & salads ($10-14), mains ($16-26), sides ($5) and desserts ($6-8). The niacs and galettes are in varying sizes. Some of the niacs are just nibbles, and others are full-blown appetizers. Some of the galettes are appetizers, and others can stand in for main courses. There's a potential for confusion, but our server's guidance was spot-on. The whole menu fits on a page, and except for the burger, it stays true to Chef Renaud's Brittany roots. It is also terrific food at a budget price. Our bill for two, including a bottle of wine for $32, came in below $100 (before tip). That isn't easily done these days. There is a $35 \"restaurant week\" menu, which I believe will be available at least through the end of February. You get four courses for that price, which is a great deal, though we chose to spend less than that by getting two courses each à la carte. To start, we had the Salt Baked Potato with braised oxtail ($12; above left) and the Suckling Pig & Foie Gras Terrine ($11; above right). Both came from the niacs section of the menu. I loved the Braised Lamb Shank galette with roasted winter vegetables ($18; below left). My girlfriend had the burger ($16; below right). I didn't try it, but I did try the fries, which were perfect. Our theory is that no brasserie has any business serving fries unless it can nail them. Bar Breton did. I have only one minor complaint. The back of the long, narrow space is separated from the kitchen by two swinging doors that let in a lot of bright light. It slightly mars the ambiance of what would otherwise be a nice room. Obviously it is a casual room, but a sturdier partition could have blocked out the kitchen light. On a Friday night, the space was close to full by 8:00 p.m., which is always encouraging for a new restaurant. Service was fine, including a nice basket of fresh bread. In a tough economic climate for restaurants, this is one that deserves to succeed.

Do not bother. The service is so blatently selective and horrible. Waiters pay attention to table with parties of 3 or more while Single Serving was left waiting 15 minutes before the waiter came to me, another 10 minutes to receive my Ice Tea which came warm with a lemon with brown lemon rind, thrown in the glass. Okay now we are at the 25 minute mark. Having ordered the Salad from the menu, you would think this would be easy enough. But know another 20 minutes and still no salad. I asked for the manager, who arrived and did nothing. Just looked at me and walked away when I explained I had now been waiting for 45 minutes and had not received my salad.On the way out, I asked the front desk area for the owners name and one person almost gave it to me unti the manager came up (real nasty) and blocked the conversation. He asked the bartender how long and he told him 40 minutes and he just smirked and said well I am not going to do nothing. Don't bother, wish I could tell you about the food but I never received any.

Today, Frank Bruni re-affirms four stars for Daniel. A new Adam Tihany decor sealed the deal: Daniel was always fancy; now it's genuinely gorgeous, too. And that's almost reason enough to reaffirm the four stars the restaurant was awarded by William Grimes in The New York Times in 2001. But the contemporary French menu and the service make their own contributions, usually measuring up to the extremely high standards the restaurant has established. All in all Daniel remains one of New York's most sumptuous dining experiences. And while it yields fewer transcendent moments than its four-star brethren and falls prey to more inconsistency, it has a distinctive and important niche in that brood, a special reason to be treasured. Among the handful of elegant restaurants that maintain the rituals once synonymous with superior cuisine and cling to an haute French style, Daniel is the most straightforward, the one with the fewest tics or tweaks. It's the truest link to the past. The review invites at least two meta-critical questions. First, should a restaurant that is \"prey to...inconsistency\" be rewarded with four stars? And second, is this consistent with what Bruni has done in the past? To the first, there is no clear answer. I gave Daniel four stars myself, so I certainly cannot disagree with Bruni's conclusion. Even at the highest level, in a forced ranking some restaurant would be the least wonderful four-star place, just as some restaurant would be at the top of the three-star heap. Bruni has put Daniel on the better side of that line, and I won't argue with him. But if Bruni's oeuvre has a consistent theme, it's that classic luxury doesn't matter. Even when luxurious places got good reviews, one always sensed that Bruni would rather be elsewhere-that he believed fine dining was only for old fogies. In almost five years on the job, I cannot think of another review in which he actually celebrated luxury as something worthwhile, as he does here: In fact there are moments during a meal at Daniel when you may well wonder why it isn't more expensive, given how much staff is required for service like this...how much plotting goes into the ceremony. At restaurants considered much less exclusive, you could spend only $30 less on a similar amount of food, and you wouldn't get anything approaching Daniel's bells and whistles. These flourishes make you feel that you've slipped into a monarch's robes, if only for a night, and turn an evening into an event. Take note of the dotted circles, a visual motif woven into the restaurant's new design. They're on the welcome mat outside. And on the carpeting inside. And on the china, the cotton damask napkins and even the plush, thick paper hand towels in the restrooms... It's for coddling this thorough that lovers of fine dining turn to restaurants like Daniel, which safeguards a graciousness that deserves to survive any change in fashions and fortunes. Where did this Frank Bruni come from? Eater correctly predicted that Bruni would award four stars to Daniel, and wins $2 on a hypothetical one dollar bet. We thought that Bruni would demote Daniel to three stars, and lose a dollar.

By coincidence, I dined at Babbo and Felidia on consecutive evenings last week. The two restaurants are related, as Felidia is owned by Lidia Bastianich, while her son Joe is a partner in Babbo. We had the pasta tasting menu at Babbo, and as I noted in my blog post, the savory courses ended in a whimper. There's no reason why a progression of five pastas can't all be terrific, but in this case there was a failure of imagination at the end of the sequence-nothing bad, but too bland. And the bread service was disappointing, with neither butter nor olive oil in sight. At Felidia, we had the five-course market tasting menu (~$75)-one of several multi-course fixed menus the restaurant offers. I wasn't taking notes that evening, but we started with an excellent beef carpaccio; then a salad-like substance that was the only dud; then an excellent quinoa risotto and an even better duo of squab. I wouldn't rush back for the bread service, but with several spreads in lieu of butter, it was at least acceptable. The wine list has moderated a bit since my last visit. There are plenty of budget-busting bottles, if you want them, but I had no trouble finding reasonable options under $50. Service was excellent, but for one serious faux pas at the end. Our server said, \"We need the table for another party, but please feel free to have a drink at the bar.\" I don't think any three-star restaurant has ever asked me to vacate a table, and I don't believe we lingered longer than one normally would at this type of restaurant. But if they're going to invite you for a drink, they should at least follow through. Instead, we were left to fend for ourselves, and when we got downstairs the bar was packed three deep. It was obvious that the offer of a drink was only a ploy to turn the table. I am glad that Felidia is not struggling for customers, but this should have been handled better.

Taken to Felidia by a co worker last week, hadn't been before and was totally blown away. Our server recommended the beet risotto which was out of this world. Wine list matched with fantastic selections and we didn't have to spend a fortune. I will definitely go back.

The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews one of the few remaining grandes dames of French cuisine, Daniel. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 500-1One Star: 499-1Two Stars: 498-1Three Stars: 4-1 Four Stars: 2-1 √√ The Skinny: Daniel currently carries four New York Times stars, courtesy of Mr. William Grimes. It is the last remaining four-star restaurant that Bruni has never reviewed. He has, however, written obliquely about the restaurant on several occasions, and it has never been positive. Here he is in December 2004: I dropped by Cafe Boulud the other night. I went because I had recently visited the chef Daniel Boulud's other two Manhattan restaurants but not this one, which happens to be many of my acquaintances' hands-down favorite of the three. I can see why. It doesn't have the starched self-consciousness of Daniel or the cheeky swagger of DB Bistro Moderne. And then in August 2007: Under Mr. Carmellini Cafe Boulud had thrived: for many diners, it was the most consistently enjoyable of the restaurants owned by Daniel Boulud, more relaxed than Daniel, less scattershot than DB Bistro Moderne. And here he was in October 2007, commenting on the Michelin Guide's two-star rating for Daniel in relation to the three stars given to Jean Georges: Putting the restaurant Jean Georges ahead of Daniel - giving it three stars to Daniel's two - is a more defensible judgment call, consistent with the appetites and appraisals of many of the city's most discerning diners. In all of these comments, Bruni's enthusiasm falls well short of the rapture one expects at a four-star restaurant. Unless Bruni has been wowed lately to a degree he wasn't before, I cannot see how Daniel can remain a four-star restaurant. Bruni's well known abhorrence of classic French luxury dining is another factor not in Daniel's favor. We've long believed that Daniel's days in the four-star club were numbered, as soon as Bruni could find a replacement. There are currently just five such restaurants, and that total has remained remarkably stable over the years. When Bruni demoted Alain Ducasse and Bouley from four stars to three, other restaurants replaced them. What would be Daniel's replacement? I had once thought that either Eleven Madison Park or Del Posto could be the lucky winner, but in a blog post on New Year's Eve, Bruni strongly suggested that neither one was ready. Among Bruni's known favorites, that leaves only Momofuku Ko as a potential promotion candidate-a review that would put Bruni on the map like no other. Among traditional restaurants, the newly relocated Bouley is the best candidate, though we don't see it happening. We don't discount entirely the possibility of four stars tomorrow: Boulud could have upped his game since Bruni's earlier visits, or maybe the Brunz just feels itchy because he hasn't given four stars to anybody in almost two years. But given Bruni's long-standing disdain, both for Daniel itself and the style of dining it stands for, we just don't see it. The Bet: We believe that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Daniel.

The pasta tasting menu at Babbo has been on my \"to do\" list for several years. I finally got around to it on Friday. (A copy of the menu is below; click for a larger image.) Everything was very good, but the savory courses ended with a whimper. The last two - \"Domingo's Pyramids\" (pyramid-shaped pasta pillows with braised beef), and Pappardelle Bolognese - were items any decent cook could make at home. Babbo prepared them perfectly, but the degree of difficulty seemed low. Among the earlier courses, my favorite was a ravioli (called Casunzei) filled with layers of beets and goat cheese. I also loved a black tagliatelle with parsnips and pancetta. The three dessert courses were fine, but again, two of the three were not especially complex. The bread service was peculiar, in that it came with neither butter nor olive oil, nor indeed anything but the bread itself (served cold). The omission was clearly not an accident, as we noticed complaints about it at other tables. I have no complaint with the price: $69 for eight courses (five pastas, three desserts) is an outrageously good deal. I even found a good wine for just $34, a level seldom seen these days in practically any restaurant, much less one of Babbo's quality. Babbo remains one of the city's toughest reservations to get. The reservation line opens at 10:00 a.m. for one month out, and the line is usually busy for hours. By the time you get through, they're usually sold out, or close to it. The best they could offer on a Friday evening was 5:45 p.m. On past visits (here, here) I've dined at the bar (or the Enoteca, as they call it). Indeed, no one at Babbo seems to use the bar for its usual purpose-pre or post-dinner drinks. By the time I arrived at around 5:30, every stool was taken, and place settings laid for dinner. I was therefore dismayed that the staff would not seat me in the dining room until my girlfriend arrived, as there is literally nowhere to wait. By the time we left, the scrum around the host stand was nearly impassable. We felt sorry for the people who were actually trying to eat in that space. Once we were finally seated, Babbo offered a much more refined experience. There are a lot of very good things on the menu, but on the whole I am not sure it's worth the trouble.

There's only been one visit each so it doesn't mean much, but I would say that while the very best thing I had at either place was a squid linguine with salami at Babbo, the mean quality of my prix fixe at Convivio was of similar (if not higher) quality, and of course at a lower price and with much less trouble getting a reservation...

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Benoit. After mostly horrendous reviews at Benoit, Alain Ducasse demoted executive chef Sebastien Rondier to chef de cuisine late last year. His new boss is Pierre Schaedelin, formerly of Le Cirque, who had been Martha Stewart's personal chef for the last two years. We liked Benoit (earlier review here), but the negative critical reaction was unmistakable. A friend and I had dinner at Benoit the other night, my first visit since Schaedelin's arrival. In a brief interview for TONY last week, Schaedelin spoke about some of the new menu items. One of them is a choucroute garnie ($32), a weekly special served on Thursdays. It's an enormous plate of sumptuous sausages and cured meats served over sauerkraut. We skipped appetizers, and I still did not finish it. My friend had the Cassoulet ($26), which she graded B+. A cheese plate ($17) was also quite good. Business was slow. When we left at around 7:40 p.m., there were still tons of empty tables. Service was attentive, and managers came by several times to ask if we were enjoying ourselves-a trend I've observed at numerous restaurants lately. If they're looking to make improvements, transferring bar tabs to the table would help. I asked, but the bartender shrugged: \"It's too late. I already entered it in my system.\" The menu has changed considerably, and it is no longer presented inside a picture frame that takes up half the table. We didn't have French Fries this time, but I noted that they're no longer served \"L'Ami Louis style.\" Given the disaster they were before, it has to be an improvement. It's still early in Schaedelin's tenure, but I like what I see so far. Benoit deserves more attention than it is getting.

I dropped in at Center Cut a couple of weeks ago for a pre-show dinner. I wasn't feeling very hungry, so I ordered the $39 prix fixe. You choose four dishes, served in pairs on rectangular plates that look like two normal dinner plates fused together. An heirloom tomato and mozzarella salad was very good, but so-called five-alarm chili tasted about three alarms less bold than it should be. Despite the standard advice about non-steak entrees at steakhouses, I ordered shrimp scampi, which turned out to be excellent. But a side dish of Balsamic Caramelized Cippolini Onions misfired: I gave up after a few cloying bites. The prix fixe comes with a cookie plate as a standard dessert. The cookies looked terrific, but I was full and didn't try them. The bread service is wonderful-a fluffy roll the size of a large brick, served hot. The rest of the service was also very good-a significant improvement over my last visit. The only Chodorow Moment® was the attempt to upsell a Wagyu steak for $10 more. There have been some menu tweaks. The \"Flintstone Ribs\" I had last time are no longer available. So too the Glazed Korean Short Ribs that Gael Greene had. Those, unfortunately, were two of the more interesting items on the original menu. Business was much more brisk than I expected. Center Cut isn't selling out, but I suspect they're more than covering the rent. Center Cut (44.

Eater.com reports that Fiamma, Stephen Hanson's acclaimed SoHo Italian spot, has closed. Two thoughts immediately spring to mind. Number one, this is the first \"recession-related\" closure that I'm actually sad about. I never got around to dining at Fiamma, but it was obviously a first-class place. The other closures I've seen lately were marginal restaurants that most people won't miss. They were either not very good, not very important, or both. Bear in mind that the restaurant industry always has a high failure rate. Many of these places would have failed anyway-though perhaps not as soon. Number two, Fiamma was part of a large empire: Stephen Hanson's B. R. Guest, with almost twenty restaurants under its wing (before today). In theory, Hanson might have had the resources to subsidize losses at his most acclaimed restaurant with revenues from some of the others. To know whether that made sense, we'd need to know his overall financial picture, but you've got to figure it was considered. The point is that many restaurants at Fiamma's level aren't part of a big conglomerate. If revenues are down, the owner has nowhere else to go. If Fiamma couldn't make it, then what about everyone else?

***CONTENT
Today, Frank Bruni delivers identical one-star verdicts on BarBao and The West Branch: Both the West Branch, a mostly Mediterranean brasserie, and BarBao, which interprets Vietnamese cuisine, deserve to make it. While their kitchens aren't consistent enough or their menus quite original enough to brand them destination restaurants, they have real talent in their DNA and bring serious food to a patch of Manhattan that, for all its recent strides, could still use more of it. This was one of Bruni's better reviews. The text was consistent with the rating, and the rating was consistent with the general buzz about these places, and in the case of BarBao, with my own observations. And he resisted the temptation to give two stars to The West Branch merely because it is inexpensive. Bruni liked BarBao a tad better than The West Branch. Yet, he thinks we may be heading into a burgers-'n'-fries era, which could work to the latter restaurant's favor. He found The West Branch consistently full, but BarBao always had empty tables (as it did when we visited). However, it could be less about the recession, and more about the fact that Tom Valenti is already well known in the neighborhood, thanks to Ouest, his other restaurant nearby. We went home quite unsure about our hypothetical wager with Eater.com, given that either one of these places could have earned two stars. But our sense was that if either place had struck Bruni as a destination restaurant (which is essentially what two stars means), he would have granted it the courtesy of its own review. As we correctly predicted one star for both restaurants, we win $5 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater was correct for BarBao (winning $2), but not The West Branch (losing $1), for a net of $1.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week. The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni has a two-fer, with Michael Bao Huynh's BarBao and Tom Valenti's The West Branch going under the microscope. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): BarBaoZero Stars: 6-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1Three Stars: 35-1Four Stars: 35,000-1West BranchZero Stars: 7-1 One Star: 3-1Two Stars: 2-1 √√Three Stars: 5-1Four Stars: 20,000-1 The Skinny: Bruni's double reviews usually have a theme. Here, it is geography: both places are on Bruni's beloved Upper West Side, where a deuce is always in play. You wonder, though, why a new two-star restaurant would be relegated to sharing a review, when trivial one-star places have so often been given reviews to themselves. Frank Bruni has reviewed Michael Bao Huynh twice, awarding one star at Bao 111 and two at Mai House. When we visited, we found BarBao a touch less exciting-less polished-than Mai House. We haven't made it to The West Branch yet, but reviews have generally been positive. It's a less ambitious version of Valenti's other restaurant, Ouest, but as Eater notes, Bruni could give bonus points for serving pretty good grub at recession-friendly prices. The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award one star apiece to BarBao and The West Branch.

[Horine via Eater] It's a coincidence that we dined at Rouge Tomate just days after Frank Bruni's one-star review came out-we made our reservation weeks ago. I went in suspecting that Bruni had been too stingy. I went out convinced he was too generous. Rouge Tomate is a health lecture disguised as a restaurant. Its \"mission\" is to provide \"a harmonious alignment of balanced cuisine, well-being, and social and environmental consciousness.\" It adheres to the principles of Sanitas Per Escam (S.P.E.), a Latin phrase meaning \"Health Through Food.\" Perhaps a better principle would be, \"Avoid restaurants with mission statements.\" There's a serious chef: Jeremy Bearman, who has worked for Joel Robuchon and Daniel Boulud. You almost get the sense that if he could toss the S.P.E. rule book, Bearman could rustle up a a memorable meal. But almost nothing we had at Rouge Tomate tasted very good. With the exception of one dish, it was all very bland and forgettable. And it doesn't come cheap. Although a $72 prix fixe was wisely jettisoned in the restaurant's early days, dinner for two still set us back almost $175 (before tip), including cocktails ($12 each) and a $42 bottle of wine. The bread service (above left) was typical of the many culinary blunders at Rouge Tomate. The bread itself was wonderful, but pureed spinach was a poor stand-in for butter. We love spinach-truly, we do-but in this role it was miscast. The trio of amuses bouches (above right) were a mixed bag. Pureed beet leaves were awful. A beet gelee tinged with horseradish was arguably too intense, but at least it had flavor. A \"beet tartare\" had very little flavor at all. Market Potato and Farm Egg (above left; $15) got a boost from a poached egg, but the potato hash and a streak of \"foraged mushrooms\" contributed no excitement on their own. The mushrooms were a more welcome presence in a faux risotto with barley, winter truffles, parmesan, and a Maderia wine reduction (above right; $19). This was the only really enjoyable dish we tasted at Rouge Tomate. In the Daily News, Restaurant Girl gave Rouge Tomate an improbable four out of five stars. Among her standout dishes was the Rabbit Fleischnacke (above left; $27), a concoction of minced rabbit, chestnut pasta, apple and celery root. But we discerned no flavor at all in the rabbit, while the poor chestnuts proved a poor substitute for flour in pasta. Duck (above right; $28) was competently prepared, and served in an ample portion. It came on a bed of root vegetables and barley with all the flavor cooked out of them. The stunning bi-level decor makes an instant impression, but after a while it seemed as soulless and sterile as the food. We were at the far end of the dining room, cut off from whatever warmth the space might have had. Another couple seated near us had to ask twice to be moved. We couldn't imagine why the staff hesitated, since there were plenty of empty tables to choose from at 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening. With that curious exception, the service was excellent, to the point of suffocation. We appreciate being asked if we're enjoying ourselves, but various servers and managers must have asked the question eight or ten times. Eagerness to please is not the problem at Rouge Tomate. The \"mission\" is. Rouge Tomate (10 East 60th Street between Fifth & Madison Avenues, Upper East Side) Food: FairService: Very GoodAmbiance: SterileOverall: Disappointing

I dropped by Terroir the other night to taste the pork blade steak that Frank Bruni has been raving about. He rated it one of the top ten dishes of 2008. He's right-up to a point. The steak, just $17, is a pig shoulder, cut thin, broiled on high heat, and lightly seasoned. Unlike Bruni, I saw no need to dump arugula and parmesan on top. The intense porky flavor never wore out on me, even though consuming this beast is a major project. The server's suggested wine pairing, a 2005 Merlot from Shinn Estate Vinyards on Long Island ($11.50/gl.), was as provocative as it was successful. My last visit to Terroir was on opening night, in March 2008. Since then, the wine list has expanded, and it's full of sommelier Paul Grieco's signature wit. If you're alone, it can take the place of a dinner companion. The only trouble with Terroir is getting in. When I arrived at about 7:00 p.m. on a Friday night, I snagged the last stool available at the bar. By the time I left, the server was quoting about 15-20 minute waits for parties of two. Although the space is perpetually full, the servers provide plenty of attention. Most people seemed to be there to drink. The chef, who occupies a cramped corner in the back of the restaurant, wasn't working up much of a sweat. But everything she was asked to produce looked wonderful. There's a lot of Terroir left to try. Terroir (413 E. 12th Street east of First Avenue, East Village) Food: *Wine: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

The Payoff: Rouge Tomate

Today, Frank Bruni damns Rouge Tomate with faint praise, awarding one-star: ...for all its glimmer and good intentions, Rouge Tomate falters somewhat. While about a quarter of the dishes are knockouts, at least as many are overly calculated and fastidious, suggesting there's such a thing as too much balance. The review is fair enough on its own terms, given that Bruni wasn't going to fall in love with this type of food, no matter how well it was done. However, one comment seemed off-key: There's a super-deluxe grandness to its setting that suddenly seems dated in the extreme, a vestige of headier, more hedonistic times. It had a fin de siècle feel... Of course, Bruni knows that the over-the-top decor was planned in better times. He also knows that most recessions last no more than a year or two, after which Rouge Tomate could be suddenly ahead of its time. Perhaps this recession will be worse-nobody really knows-but it's no reason to be condemning excellence. As we noted yesterday, there were ample reasons for believing Frank Bruni would not love this place, along with ample others for believing-as Eater and I both did-that he would grant a second star. The uncertainty was reflected in the odds, wherein any outcome from zero to two stars was reasonably likely. That doesn't happen very often. We and Eater both lose $1 on our hypothetical bets.

***CONTENT
The Rusty Knot is a bar no one would have noticed, if it didn't have Ken Friedman (The Spotted Pig, The John Dory) and Taavo Somer (Freemans) as co-owners. It is carefully gussied up to look like a dive bar, which is exactly the point. You would think, \"this has been here forever,\" unless you knew that it opened last year. The still-evolving menu isn't long, but what they serve is cheap, and mostly successful. Restaurant industry types show up here, as they do at the Pig, Momofuku, etc., because pretty damned good comfort food is served without much pretense. As for critical opinion, Sarah DiGregorio of the Village Voice hated it, but a delighted Frank Bruni in the Times was \"too content to care.\" Bruni's view, in this case, is closer to the consensus. The location isn't ideal: cold, inhospitable West Street, a very long walk from mass transit. But if you manage to get there early enough, there are priceless views of sunset over the Hudson River, and you avoid the crowds. If you prefer dining late, the kitchen is open till 3:00 a.m. Oddly enough, there are three Michelin-starred restaurants less than five minutes away: Perry St., Wallse, and the Spotted Pig. Which just goes to show that West Street is a lot more hospitable than it used to be. The Pretzel Dog ($4; above left) comes freshly baked. It's not noticeably better than Auntie Anne's, except for Gray Poupon on the side and handi-wipes to wash your hands afterwards. Potato Wedges ($8; above right) are dipped in thyme, oregono, rosemary, paprika and chives, with a house made sour cream on the side. For bar food, it's a pretty memorable dish. To go with that, I had a couple of beers I'd never heard of: Red Stripe and Abita Light, both in bottles, and both $6. It's not your average dive bar.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week. The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Rouge Tomate. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 3-1 One Star: 4-1Two Stars: 3-1 √√Three Stars: 60-1 Four Stars: 20,000-1 The Skinny: This week's Eater odds reflect real uncertainty about this restaurant. In many ways, it's not the kind of place you'd expect Bruni to love. Rouge Tomate is like an upscale health spa. It serves the nutritionally balanced meals your mother always told you to eat. There's no evidence that Bruni likes this type of food. This is the guy who once ate two porterhouses in one evening. It's also a Belgian import, and Bruni doesn't love Northern European food. Lastly, it's on the expensive side, and Bruni tends to weigh price heavily in his star calculations. Yet, anything lower than two stars would be an insult for this glitzy place. Bruni doesn't mind delivering a smackdown, but he doesn't usually choose targets that most of the other critics ignored. The only MSM review to date is four stars from Restaurant Girl, and while I don't think RG is a good index to Bruni's thinking, it shows there's at least one person who likes the food-even if it's a bit too preachy for its own good. In hiis new year's post, Bruni lamented \"how under-served and shortchanged the Upper East Side is.\" When he wrote that, he probably knew that Rouge Tomate would be his first review of 2009. Now that Bruni finally has a chance to review a restaurant on the UES-something he has rarely done-it's hard to imagine that he would say, \"Don't bother.\" The Bet: Will Bruni come to praise Caesar Salad or to bury it? We agree with Eater that Bruni will award two stars to Rouge Tomate.

[Kreiger via Eater] Note: Effective March 10, 2009, Executive Chef Eric Hara left Fishtail and its sister restaurant, David Burke Townhouse, to take over at the Oak Room at the Plaza. John Tesar is his replacement. We're in a seafood moment, or maybe it's just a coincidence. Over the last month, we have compelling new entries at the opposite ends of town, The John Dory in Southwest Chelsea and Fishtail on the Upper East Side. They're stylistic opposites too: an edgy downtown vibe at one, old-money splendor at the other. Both places work more fish art into their decor than I ever believed possible. I expect Fishtail to face a lot of skepticism among the Internet chattering class, many of whom believe the civilized world ends at 59th Street. But Fishtail in its early days is a surprisingly good restaurant. Ignore, if you must, the Park Avenue ladies and their face lifts. Focus instead on the bounty of fish, impeccably prepared. The ringmaster here is David Burke. No mere chef, the owner (says his website) is \"blurring the lines between chef, artist, entrepreneur and inventor.\" Most conglomerate chefs at least adopt the pretense of dressing the part, even if you know they won't be there after the review cycle is over. Burke doesn't even bother. He was there on a Saturday night working the room, dressed in civvies. I had my doubts about Fishtail. I paid three visits to his other Upper East Side restaurant, David Burke Townhouse (formerly David Burke & Donatella). Each time, I liked it a bit less than before. Many of Burke's clever ideas looked interesting on paper, but didn't quite work on the plate. And he's spread awfully thin, lending his name to dubious enterprises like the laughable Hawaiian Tropic Zone. At Fishtail, Burke and his culinary wit are on full display, but in the dishes we tried, practically all of it worked. Go ahead and serve a Rice Krispy Crabcake or Lobster Dumplings, but they'd better be good. And they were. The menu features raw bar standards, small plates ($11-14), soups, salads & appetizers ($11-18), simple and whole fish à la carte ($21 & up, up, up), composed plates ($29-40) and side dishes ($6.50). You can spend a bundle, but with judicious ordering can have an excellent meal for around $50-60 a head (before wine). Even the more expensive items seem reasonably priced for this kind of restaurant (e.g., Dover Sole, $40). A couple of items on our bill were were a bit lower than the amounts shown online, which suggests the menu is being adjusted to reality. Nevertheless, this is a luxury restaurant, and the service has most of the flourishes you'd expect at such a place. As mentioned, Rice Krispy Crab Cakes ($15; above left) and Lobster Dumplings ($12; above right) were excellent. Both dishes had examples of Burke's wit-the clever glass serving plate used for the crab cakes, the little tiny tails poking out of the dumplings. You can't eat humor, but I'd gladly order these dishes again. A whole Branzino ($27; above left) and a whole Red Snapper ($33; above right) were both prepared perfectly. In each case, the whole fish was presented in a skillet and then filleted at a serving station. Both were listed as portions for one, but the Snapper could easily have been for two. There are sauces and garnishes for the whole fish, in a menu category called \"Top Hats\"-complement to Tails, get it? These are $7.50 apiece and ample enough to share, but I wouldn't bother. A Gnocchi & Wild Mushroom sauce added nothing to these already excellent fish, and it was served slightly lukewarm. Several of the whole fish are priced \"by the pound,\" a practice that can only lead to confusion. That Snapper, for instance, was $22/lb., but the menu stipulated it was 1½ pounds. So why not be done with it, and just put $33 on the menu? The Branzino, on the other hand, was listed at its correct price of $27. French fries ($6.50; above left) were served in a miniature frying basket with homemade mayo. The first batch was cold and soggy. After we complained, they brought up another batch moments later, which was perfect. Cauliflower Brûlee ($6.50; above center) didn't need a do-over: it came in a sizzling hot cast-iron dish, and was terrific. The wine service, already very good, still needs some tweaks. A server offered to send over a sommelier before we'd even seen menus. The wine list, printed in 8-point type, is practically unreadable. What could they have been thinking? After I'd squinted my way through it, I found a great Crozes Hermitage ($50; above right). It would have been harder to find a bargain among the reds. There are some compelling verticals with real age on them, but at prices well above our budget. The \"petits-fours\" (right) were little daubs of sorbet inside a candy wrapper, served on ice. It was the only time in the meal when the \"chef-inventor\" got too cute for his own good. Aside from that, service was impressive, with plenty of staff in ties and vests scurrying efficiently. There were warm baguettes at the beginning of the meal, though two people shouldn't be asked to share one butter knife. The restaurant is set up on two floors of a townhouse, with the bar and the kitchen downstairs, and two dining rooms up above. Food runners will get plenty of exercise shuttling food upstairs, and as noted, a couple of items came out not quite warm enough. The space is lovely, if you don't mind bright red. It is not quite as cramped as David Burke Townhouse, but you still get a sense that there isn't an inch to spare. Our two-top was just six inches away from the next one. David Burke seems to have a built-in Upper East Side fan club. His earlier restaurant is perpetually packed, and his clientele seems to have followed him over to Fishtail. If I have a concern, it's whether Burke and executive chef Eric Hara can keep up the quality after Burke moves onto other projects. But for a one-month-old restaurant, Fishtail is impressive. I hope it will stay that way. Fishtail (135 E. 62nd Street between Park & Lexington Avenues, Upper East Side) Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: **Overall: **½

New York is often unkind to imported chefs. New York's Adam Platt, the city's most clueless critic, once declared, \"If I were them, and I had a successful restaurant elsewhere, I would not come.\" True enough, there have been some well publicized flops, especially where the itinerant chef is not in permanent residence: Lonesome Dove, anyone? Alain Ducasse has failed twice here, and at two current restaurants (Adour and Benoit) he has brought in new chefs after less than a year in business. Yet, had Thomas Keller and Joel Robuchon followed Platt's advice, we would not have the exquisite Per Se or the sublime L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. Still, these are tough waters to navigate. So it took a dash of audacity for Susur Lee to close his internationally acclaimed Toronto restaurant, Susur, and open Shang on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Like those other chefs, Lee won't be here full time (he still has another restaurant in Toronto), though he is a partner at Shang and presumably has a lot riding on its success. In Toronto, Lee was best known for his \"reverse degustation\" tasting menu, which \"began with robust, heavier dishes and grew progressively lighter as the evening went on.\" At Shang, he wisely chooses not to demand that kind of commitment. He offers instead an à la carte menu of tasting plates, most of them (except the soups) suitable for sharing. The menu has 35 items in various categories, priced $3-29, but most are from $13-20. The \"small plates\" format is notoriously prone to upselling and over-ordering, but the server's recommendation of four to six dishes for two people was exactly right-we settled on five, plus a half-order of bread, for a total of $88.50, which is remarkable for food this good. Shang avoids other pitfalls often encountered at this type of restaurant. Sometimes, plates advertised for sharing are actually difficult to share-e.g., three sliders for two people. Here, every dish was evenly divisible by two. (One eGullet poster, though, was annoyed when Shang served six lamb chops for a party of seven. A server ought to have noticed that.) The other pitfall is timing. At some restaurants, the plates come out in crashing waves, drowning you in food you're not yet ready to eat. You often wonder if the kitchen's convenience has trumped the diner's. Here too, the staff got it just right. We started with a salad-the immense Singapore Slaw ($16; right)-then two appetizers, and finally two main courses, all paced appropriately. The service impressed us in other ways. Our first half-bottle of wine was slow to arrive. That shouldn't happen, but the server handled it the right way: by telling the kitchen to slow down, so that we wouldn't be drinking water with our appetizers. We asked for an order of the Whole Wheat Manto Bread ($3; left). Without prompting, the server offered to cut it down to a half-order, as a full portion is more than two people would normally eat. We certainly had no way of knowing this, and many servers wouldn't be alert enough (or honest enough) to point it out. That Singapore Slaw comes in a volcano shape (there's a photo on Gael Greene's blog) before a server tosses its 19 ingredients tableside. I won't try to describe the blizzard of flavors; you have to try it. The menu describes it as a portion for two, though four could easily share it. The Mantou Bread is roasted to order, and the server warned it wouldn't come out for about 20 minutes. It's absolutely wonderful, but given that it's only 37½ cents a slice, I wonder why the restaurant doesn't just send out an order at the front end of every meal? Chef Lee's cuisine has been described as Chinese fusion. Everything we tasted was ablaze in flavor and impeccably prepared. Most of it you would find in no other restaurant. Vegetable Potato Dumplings ($13; above left) wore a crusty cloak-yes, there are four individual dumplings on that plate. Lobster and Shrimp Croquettes ($18; above right) were in a delicate puffy jacket, each resting on a slow-cooked wedge of daikon. Mongolian Lamb Chops ($20; above left) were as tender and flavorful as I've experienced in any restaurant lately, along with glazed bananas and a chili mint sauce. A cold carrot cardamom chutney would have been better omitted. A Young Garlic Chicken ($20; above right) yielded six pieces of plump meat, cooked perfectly. I was pleased to see an ample selection of half-bottles of wine, an option far more restaurants should offer. It gave us the chance to sample two halves for a total of $41, less than we normally pay for a full bottle. (Now that I look back on it, I think they charged us less for the wine than the prices listed.) Though Shang is a casual restaurant, the service team would be at home in a more formal setting. Fresh plates and silverware, and extra serving utensils, are provided for each course. Chopsticks are enamel, rather than the disposable wood most places use. Even the starched white napkins are delivered with a flourish. Some glitches still need to be worked out. The large bar area was practically deserted. Yet, when I asked for a cocktail list, the inattentive and seemingly bored bartender gave me the bottle service list instead, which listed only two cocktails. Only when we got to the table did we realize the restaurant offers a dozen others. Our bar tab was not transferrable to the dining room. The dining room itself was about 25 percent full when we arrived at 7:00 p.m. on a Friday evening, and about 75 percent full when we left. That's probably not as good as they'd like, though not bad in a neighborhood that doesn't come alive till late. Shang is located in a luxury boutique hotel, the Thompson LES. The space is as gorgeous as it is comfortable. If you've been around a while, you have to pinch yourself before you believe you're at the formerly desolate corner of Houston and Allen Streets. The restaurant's advertised address-a separate entrance on Orchard Street-is not yet open. You get there via the hotel entrance on Allen Street. No restaurant opening today can be assured of success, but if Chef Lee keeps his eye on the kitchen, Shang should do very well indeed.

New Year's Eve at Tailor

***CONTENT
Those who spend New Year's Eve in restaurants, rather than at parties or bars, face a dilemma. Most places charge crazily-inflated prices for dumbed-down versions of their regular menus. I don't mind paying a little extra, but I want to at least enjoy the food. Three years ago, we were appalled by what Picholine passed off as dinner for $400 a person. We vowed never again to patronize a luxury restaurant on the last night of the year. I have two criteria for a New Year's Eve restaurant. First, the price needs to be reasonably close to what you'd pay on any other night. And second, the chef needs to be serving the same kind of food he normally serves. WD~50 passed the test two years ago, so I decided on Tailor-in many ways a similar restaurant. A nine-course tasting menu was $100 a person (it's normally $90 for seven courses). Wine pairings were $45 (normally $35). And chef Sam Mason, one of the city's enfants terribles of molecular gastronomy, wasn't about to start serving catering-hall food. (Someone at Tailor can't count. Though described as a \"7 course tasting menu,\" nine courses were listed, and nine were served. Click on the image for a larger version.) I've written about Tailor in earlier reviews (here, here). The restaurant had a nearly disastrous opening in late 2007 and took a critical beating. Mason continued to fine-tune the menu, and a popular downstairs bar brought in plenty of customers. I've no idea how the 60-seat dining room does on a typical night, but it was full for New Year's Eve. Mason is a cross between a classically-trained chef and a mad chemist. He tosses ingredients together in wild combinations. Some of his experiments end in disaster, but everything he serves is perfectly cooked and beautifully plated. Even where we thought he failed (in two of the nine dishes), the technical quality was first-rate. Mason's avant garde plates aren't for everyone. It's not hearty comfort food; that's for sure. Although Tailor has improved since Frank Bruni awarded one star in late 2007, I am still not sure the Times critic would be a fan. At WD~50, Wylie Dufresne had to rein in his wilder flights of fancy before getting an upgrade to three stars. Mason just does what he wants, sometimes with reckless disregard for common sense. I didn't use the flash last night (though I probably could have gotten away with it), and the low-light dining room is not camera friendly. I'm including the photos anyway, though they're not as good as I'd like. 1. An oyster (above left) was paired beautifully with kiwi and Thai peppers. 2. Rye-Cured Char (above center), served warm, was balanced by a cool dill cream and slivers of radish. 3. Tiny cubes of warm tongue (above right) shared a plate with beets, pistachio and horseradish. 4. A deconstructed \"Baked Potato\" (above left) misfired. A crisp curly french fry was positioned like a toast rack for a bacon chip sliced as thin as a human hair, a potato chip, and I believe a parsnip chip. These little chips were lovely, but the potato itself needed more help. A schmear of sour cream underneath it was almost undetectable. 5. \"Bouillabaisse\" (above center) was another deconstructed classic, but it worked. I think there were five or six different kinds of seafood in it (char, monkfish, razor clam, etc.), along with a small cube of French toast. There was nothing complicated about it, but every piece of fish was cooked perfectly. 6. Waylon Braised Brisket (above right) with sweet potato and cranberry was probably the evening's straightforward dish, but no less successful for it. 7. A small, delicate sphere of Foie Gras (above left) was decorated with dulce de leche, apple and cashews. 8. Brown Butter Cake (above center) was not so much deconstructed as detonated. Instead of a cake, we got a pile of crumbs with a bitter squash sorbet and a so-called \"maple caviar.\" 9. Hazelnut Parfait (above right) ended the evening on a strong note. For a final surprise-a play on the traditional petits-fours-we had a chocolate truffle filled with cotton candy. The wine pairings were pedestrian, as they often are. Of the seven glasses served, the two most successful weren't wine: a champagne-and-gin cocktail called a \"French 75,\" served with the oyster; and a nut brown ale served with the \"Baked Potato.\" The others were generic and mostly forgettable. Several of the wines were served long before the food they were meant to pair with, and the \"Bouillabaisse\" was served with no wine at all. Aside from that, service was very good. I loved the bread service, with two different fresh breads and soft butter. Servers did a good job of explaining Mason's unorthodox creations. Plates and glasses were promptly cleared. There were some long pauses between courses, which I assume was by design, as the ninth plate came out a shade before midnight. In all, the meal lasted just over 2½ hours. The tasting menu format works to Mason's benefit. Some of his crazier ideas are fun when they last for just a few bites, but they might not sustain interest when served in larger portions. Over a nine-course menu, you won't mind if a few courses aren't successful. In a standard three-course meal, even one dud is unacceptable, and there's a decent chance of that happening, especially as it's hard to guess what you're getting from the printed descriptions. We find Tailor unique and indispensable. If you have your doubts, the regular menu offers several ways to sample Mason's cuisine without committing to a full meal. For instance, a three-course dessert tasting, which two can easily share, is just $28. Pair it with Eben Freeman's excellent cocktails, and you've got avant-garde cuisine on a recession budget.

A. J. Maxwell's Steakhouse arrived during the steakhouse glut of 2006, when new entries in the genre were opening every other week. Critics ignored the place, as there was no celebrity or concept to distinguish it from all of the others. The location has a bit of history. In the 1960s and '70s, it housed Forum of the 12 Caesars, where waiters donned togas, and praetorian helmets served as ice buckets. Elaborate faux Roman mosaics, which more recent restaurants had covered over, were rediscovered during the renovation. At A. J. Maxwell's, you can see them again, in all their glory. A few months ago, we dropped in for a pre-theater meal. It's an attractive, comfortable space, and service is better than in most classic steakhouses. The menu is expensive, even by steakhouse standards, no doubt reflecting midtown rents. There are nearly a dozen seafood and fish entrees, and they don't seem to be afterthoughts, unlike, say, the salmon at Peter Luger. Thick-cut Canadian Bacon in the Peter Luger mold ($3.50; above left) was just fine. Dry-aged ribeye wasn't bad, but at $47 it needed to be terrific. I suspect it was USDA choice (the default assumption when \"prime\" isn't stated), as I didn't feel or taste the marbling a first-class ribeye ought to have. A. J. Maxwell's offers a civilized midtown meal, but steak conoisseurs won't be putting it on their regular rotation. A. J.

We had an excellent meal at Eleven Madison Park in early August. I didn't note every dish, and it's obviously too late to remember them all, so I'll keep this brief. This is a controversial restaurant. In May of this year, Danyelle Freeman gave it five stars in the Daily News (the only restaurant so honored during her brief tenure there). And Frank Bruni said that the new restaurant Corton \"joins the constantly improving Eleven Madison Park as a restaurant hovering just below the very summit of fine dining in New York.\" If Bruni promotes any restaurant to four stars in 2009, as I believe he is itching to do, I have to think EMP is one of the few real candidates. But Eleven Madison Park has no Michelin stars, probably the most glaring omission from the French guide's otherwise very sensible advice. Michelin skeptics cite the snub as evidence that the guide should be disregarded. Still, it's a fact that this restaurant lacks the near-universal acclaim of, say, Le Bernardin or Jean Georges. Even Bruni, in a year-end blog post, noted that he had an uneven meal there in the fall. Public adoration seems to be undimmed. Eleven Madison is one of the few restaurants that has continued to raise prices, and get away with it. The prix fixe is now $88 for three courses, and the two tasting menus are now $125 and $175, the latter being one of the most expensive of its kind in the city. You can count us as fans of Eleven Madison Park. After three visits, we have never yet been disappointed. In August, we had the prix fixe. I was especially eager to try the duck for two. It was wonderful, but I do prefer to have it carved tableside, as they did at Le Perigord. When they whisk it away to the kitchen, the plates that come back never quite seem to add up to a whole bird. As our meal was five months ago, I'll let the photos speak for themselves.

The Year in Bruni

***CONTENT
Another year of Frank Bruni's Times restaurant reviews has come and gone. It could be his last, as he's rumored to be stepping down next year to write his memoirs. As of June 2009, he'll reach his 5-year anniversary, a point when a critic might want to move on. For the second consecutive year, no restaurants earned 4 stars. Corton was the year's best new restaurant, but I suspect even Drew Nieporent (owner) and Paul Liebrandt (chef) would tell you they were not aiming for 4 stars. Bruni gave it 3 stars, which was the correct rating. Momofuku Ko was the only other conceivable candidate, but Bruni made a compelling argument for awarding three. In case you're wondering, it has now been 209 weeks since Bruni elevated a restaurant to 4 stars (Masa on December 29, 2004). That's by far the longest such gap in New York Times history. There have been a couple of 4-star re-reviews since then, but no new members of the club. Daniel is the only remaining 4-star restaurant that Bruni has not reviewed, and it's fairly apparent he does not love the place. I suspect he is itching to find another 4-star restaurant, after which Daniel will be promptly demoted. I don't know of any new restaurants coming along that are 4-star candidates, so Bruni will need to promote somebody. At the 3-star level, there were happy pills in the water at Times HQ. Bruni doled out eleven 3-star reviews in 2008. He has given just 33 of them in 4½ years, so it is remarkable that a third of them came in 2009. Bruni's smackdowns are the stuff of legend, but he did not demote any 3-star places this year, and there was not a single new restaurant that was clearly aiming for a 3-star review that failed to get it. To some extent, we are seeing the effects of Bruni's grade inflation. At least three of Bruni's 3-star awards seemed awfully dubious to me (Dovetail, Matsugen, and Momofuku Ssäm Bar), and I have my doubts about one other (Scarpetta). But even if you subtract a star from those reviews, it was still a very good year for new restaurants. Bruni continued his pattern of awarding two stars to very marginal candidates, such as Double Crown, Bar Q, Bar Blanc, Bar Milano, Mia Dona, Market Table, Perbacco and Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill. This, in turn, put pressure on him to elevate borderline places to 3 stars. It should be obvious that if Momofuku Ko is a 3-star restaurant, the less ambitious Ssäm Bar is no better than two. Yet, when he awards 2 stars to Double Crown the preceding week, all Ssäm Bar's 3-star review means is \"better than Double Crown.\" That is not a tough bar to clear. Bruni's obvious bias in favor of Italian restaurants continued. About 20% of his reviews were Italian (broadly construed), and he gave those restaurants 2 or 3 stars 60 percent of the time. Even his 1-star Italian reviews were generally enthusiastic, which is not always the case with Bruni. In other genres, there were missed opportunities. Allegretti and Eighty One, to which he gave 2 stars each, were better than several of his 3-star places. Eighty One was probably the most unjustly treated, given the 3-stars awarded to the inferior Dovetail nearby. Persimmon and Elettaria deserved better than the 1 star Bruni gave them. For the first time that I can recall, Bruni visited a French restaurant by choice. He awarded 1 star to La Sirène, which was a perfectly reasonable rating. Had it been Italian, it would have received two. Every year, Bruni picks a couple of places no one writes about any more, just to point out that they're not as good as they were. This year's victims were Mesa Grill (1 star) and Michael's (no stars). Among new restaurants, Ago and Secession received his most entertaining and richly deserved takedowns, both receiving no stars. A number of Frank's reviews were about a 'scene', conveying practically no important culinary content. Among these were Kurve, Delicatessen, Chop Suey, Elizabeth, and Second Avenue Deli. It seems almost a travesty when Elizabeth is allotted the same number of column-inches as Corton. If it was worth writing about at all, couldn't it have shared the review with some other place? Bruni doled out several well deserved promotions, including WD~50 (2 to 3), Le Cirque (2 to 3) and Mas (1 to 2). But the largest errors of his tenure-The Modern, Gilt, and Gordon Ramsay-remain uncorrected, with all three restaurants still undeservedly mired in Bruni's two-star scrum. Despite some mistakes, Bruni did not commit as many howlers in 2008 as he did in past years. For the most part, where there was excellence he found it. Where restaurants let us down, he called them on it. As Bruni notes in his year-end retrospective, most of the important restaurants that opened in 2008 were planned in much happier times. That means that we won't be seeing anywhere near as many ambitious restaurants in 2009. Bruni will be spending his time in more casual places, which is probably the way he likes it.

[Savory Cities] BarBao is the latest production of Vietnamese chef Michael Bao Huynh. He has made the rounds, to put it charitably, but he is a partner here, so perhaps he'll finally stay put. I loved his cooking at Mai House, and there is certainly no doubt about his talent. The space that was formerly Rain has been gutted and beautifully renovated. There's a large bar, a spacious dining room, yet another bar, and a quiet space in the back with seating so comfortable that you'll want to take it home with you. The major critics haven't made it here yet, but Cuozzo in the Post, DiGregorio in the Village Voice, and Gael Greene at Insatiable all liked it. Andrea Strong had a muted reaction by her standards, though she found the decor-get this!-sexy. I'll alert the media. Instead of appetizers and entrees, the menu offers \"Small Plates\" ($8-14) and \"Big Plates\" ($16-27), all served family style. The plates of whatever size are designed for sharing, which is the way to go. The cuisine, though nominally Vietnamese, is very liberally interpreted. Most reviewers have mentioned the Daikon Duck Hash ($14; above left). The concept is beguiling: what's not to love about duck fat and a fried egg? But we found the duck fat cloying, and the few slices of real duck meat seemed too skimpy. An Octopus special ($14; above right) was the star of the evening. Mashima Sirloin ($24; above left) got a mixed reaction. I considered it a success, but my girlfriend found the meat a bit too tough. The accompanying salad, to our surprise, was served cold (by design). Lemongrass Guinea Hen ($17; above right), another special, was terrific. It had enough red pepper for a three-alarm fire, but we were also impressed by the tenderness of the meat. Had the server told us that the Guinea Hen came with rice, we probably wouldn't have ordered a side of Duck Fried Rice ($9; below left). Still, it was very good fried rice, and had more duck in it than the Daikon Duck Hash we had earlier. The wine list isn't lengthy, but we were pleased with a 2000 Valdrinal Tempranillo, which at $44 was one of the better wine deals we've seen this year. Like most restaurants these days, BarBao needs to work hard for its customers' affections. It was about half full on a Friday night, which probably covered the rent, but isn't good enough to stay in business. Service was attentive, if perhaps a bit ingratiating, and there must have been three or four manager types who kept dropping by, along with the chef himself, to make sure we were enjoying ourselves-which we were. The two best items we had were specials, which tells me that chef Huynh is still experimenting, and that return visits will be rewarded with new things to try. The food wasn't perfect, but much of it was very good, and the bill for two was a very reasonable $120 before tax and tip.

When is the Wine List Fairly Priced?

***CONTENT
I've developed a theory that helps me decide if a wine list is fairly priced: The bottom of the list should have a good selection at the price of the average meal. I don't much care about the top of the list. If a pizzeria wants to serve $1,000 wines, that's fine with me. The top can go as high as the restaurant thinks it can get away with. But if the average meal is a $15 pizza and a $5 scoop of ice cream, then the cheapest wine shouldn't be $60. At Corton in TriBeCa, the cheapest meal is $76 prix fixe, but the wine list has two full pages of bottles under $50, and even quite a few under $40. You can also spend thousands, but the ample selection below $50 makes Corton's wine list not just fairly priced, but generously priced. The other night, we had dinner at Belcourt in the East Village. We loved Belcourt overall, but I found the high-priced wine list irritating. Obviously a casual neighborhood bistro isn't going to have the same wine list as Corton, but the wines Belcourt did have were nearly all above $50. There might have been a token red or two slightly below that figure; as I recall, they were very young wines that I wouldn't drink even at retail prices, much less with a restaurant markup. At Belcourt, the average appetizer is around $10, and the average entree is about $21. It should have a half-dozen to a dozen real choices below $50. So that's the rule I use: the heart of the bottom end of the wine list should equal the price of a typical meal for one. That means there should be real choice at that level, not just a token, and not an obscure grape or region that is out of character for the restaurant. The upshot is that a party of 2 can have a decent meal where the food is 2/3rds of the cost, and the wine is 1/3rd. That seems fair to me.

not sure I agree.. 'fairly priced', to me, depends on the mark-up from the wine's whole-sale price. my rule of thumb is twice retail = fairly priced, at least in new York.
Marc Shepherd

I was referring to price range rather than markup. I agree that 2× retail is fair, in a way. But another measure is whether the amount the restaurant forces you to spend on wine is commensurate with the food bill. I mean, that $250 bottle might be a steal, but you still need to spend $250 to get it.

The industry rule of thumb is 2.8X wholesale cost. At the low end it is as high as 4X.

I had an errand to run near Herald Square yesterday. Keens Steakhouse is the only decent restaurant nearby, so I dropped in for a light supper. A bit before 6:00 p.m., they were already nearly full, which is remarkable for a restaurant this enormous that is not in the theater district. Had I arrived just a few minutes later, I would have had to wait for a table. There's a casual \"pub\" at Keens that doesn't take reservations. You can order from the over-priced dining room menu, but the pub also has its own menu that, if not cheap, is at least reasonable. I've written about Keens a number of times, so I'll get right to the beef. Prime Rib Hash ($16.50; left) caught my eye. It's basically a play on corned beef hash, with diced prime rib as the main ingredient, and a fried egg replacing the usual gravy. In the interest of science, I had to try it. The verdict? It's pretty good, though surely not meant to be dinner on its own. Four people could share it as an appetizer. It's that big. So naturally, I ate the whole thing myself (and nothing else). For its steaks, Keens charges premium prices for a second-tier product. The decor is one-of-a-kind, but you always have the feeling that the staff is thinking about the next thousand customers. They do have a few dishes no one else is serving, especially the incomparable mutton chop, to which I can now add the Prime Rib Hash.

I used to work at Keen's back in the day and imagine the place hasn't changed much. It once was located in the Herald Square theater district, which has now all disappeared except for this landmark restaurant. I just posted on it myself a few weeks ago:http://www.ctcottageindustries.com/2008/11/keens-chop-house-nyc.htmlI've got some great photos of the decor!

[Metromix] Note: As of March 2009, chef Matthew Hamilton left Belcourt to join Choice Markets in Brooklyn. Hamilton is staying at Belcourt after all, after the owners made him a partner. Frankly, even without the incentive, it was hard for us to see how Choice Markets would be a step up. Matthew Hamilton is a chef you want to root for. His two previous gigs fell apart for reasons not his fault. At Uovo, he couldn't get a liquor license. At Pair of 8's, he arrived too late to save a restaurant already on life support. Things are going better at Belcourt, where he's into his second year and appears to have a solid East Village neighborhood following, supplemented by a few folks like me who are curious enough to make the trek. He's got a lovely space, with spectacular picture windows looking out on East 4th Street and Second Avenue. A striking old-fashioned bar, distressed mirrors, a pressed tin ceiling and an antique tile floor suggest the kind of unfancy bistro you dream about but seldom find any more. Belcourt stayed off most of the critics' radar. In the Times, Frank Bruni gave it the Dining Briefs treatment, noting that \"this charming, happy restaurant...wants to hit your comfort-food sensors.\" That's accurate. The menu notes with laconic modesty, \"Everything that can be made in house, is.\" That includes a variety of sausages, cured meats and pâtes. There's also the usual comment about local organic farmers and organically-raised meats, which is a fixture on menus all over town. We assume bread (served in a bucket) is home-made, along with the butter, which was soft the way we like it. A selection of the house charcuterie ($16; above right) was more than ample for two to share as an appetizer. Prices are gentle on the pocketbook, with soups and salads at $7-9, starters $8-15, mains $12-24, and sides $5-6. The pork chop ($24; above left) was as large as a truncheon and very good too, but the vegetables underneath it seemed dull and over-salted. My girlfriend thought the burger (above right) was one of the best she's had in a long time. The bun, naturally, is house-made. It's a bargain at $12 (cheese and onions $2 extra apiece), and the fries that come along with it are perfect. The wine list is too expensive, with no reds I could trust below $50. I don't care how high the list goes, but a restaurant at Belcourt's overall price level needs to go a lot lower. The food at Belcourt is very well made, service in hearty portions and at low prices. I can't quite call it destination cuisine, but it's a place I'm glad to have around. Our dinner here was one of the more enjoyable inexpensive meals we've had in a while. \"This,\" my girlfriend said, \"is what Secession should have been.\" Belcourt (84 E. 4th Street at Second Avenue, East Village) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Owning the city's most popular Italian restaurants wasn't good enough for Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich. So five years ago, they branched out into Spanish cuisine. Sure enough, they mastered that too. Pig's Feet Croquetas with Cranberries ($15)Casa Mono was an instant hit, winning two stars from Marian Burros in the Times and a 25 food rating on Zagat, the highest of any Spanish restaurant in the city. It has taken me a while to get here because the place is always packed at the times I want to eat. Finally, I landed a Friday night 7:00 p.m. reservation. Our dinner was almost scuppered when my girlfriend got stuck on a train. The hostess wouldn't seat an incomplete party, and there is no waiting space inside this cramped restaurant: nada. She not-so-gently suggested that I mosey over to Bar Jamón, the wine bar next door, \"and we'll call when your party arrives.\" But I'd already spent an hour at Bar Jamón and knew there was no space there either. So I shuffled my feet at the doorway, checking my watch. Sepia a la Plancha with Salsa Verde ($15)My girlfriend arrived at 7:19 p.m., four minutes too late, according to the hostess. \"I can offer you a table until 8:30 or seats at the bar without a time limit.\" We took the bar seats, which may be the best way to experience Casa Mono. Watching the open kitchen just a few feet away is a pleasure in itself: it runs like clockwork in an insanely small space. You get to see a much wider variety of the gorgeous plates coming out, and the craftsmanship that goes into them. Skirt Steak with Onion Mermelada ($16)There are some cuisines that, inexplicably, seem to be found only in casual settings (at least in New York), and Spanish is one of them. Alex Urena tried to serve three-star food at Urena, but it never caught on, and he had to dial it down a notch, renaming the place Pamplona. Batali and Bastianich, blessed with a keener sense of the culinary moment, made Casa Mono casual from the beginning, and never looked back. Fried Cauliflower ($9)The wine list, though, is a serious document. If there were a four-star Spanish restaurant, it could have the same list without changing a thing. You'll find large-format bottles with four-digit prices, but also real value below $50. There was a slight hiccup when I ordered a 2004 at $45, and the server returned with an '05, apparently not realizing the difference. Fear not, said the hastily summoned sommelier: the 2005's are just as good, and according to some connoisseurs, maybe better. Confit Goat with Saffron Honey ($19)On the all-tapas menu, you'll pay anywhere from $5-25 a plate, with most in the teens. A selection of six plates plus a shared dessert brought our food tab to $102. You could probably get by with a little less than that, but not by much. Batali has never worried about challenging the diner. You'll find pig's feet, lamb's tongue, rabbit loin, cock's combs, bone marrow, sweetbreads, duck hearts, and tripe. But you'll also find safe choices like mussels, skirt steak, and lamb. Pork Belly Fabada with Horseradish ($19)We saw a lot of skirt steak going onto the griddle, but not one order of tripe. Even Marian Burros declined to try it. A fried cheese made of calves head and feet has been dropped since Burros visited, showing that even offal has its limits. I'm not going to comment on most of the dishes individually, but they were all terrific, except for over-cooked pork belly. The photos don't do the food justice, but they were the best I could manage in a low-light setting where flash wasn't appropriate. Mono Sundae ($9) Desserts are sometimes a throwaway at this kind of restaurant, but we adored the Mono Sundae, a plum brandy ice cream with arrope and almonds. We observed other diners in phases of rapture over their desserts, so this is apparently not the only great one. The food at Casa Mono arguably deserves a better setting. It is cramped and rushed. Although we sat at the bar, even the tables seemed small and tightly packed. I'm not the type to spend hundreds of dollars on a bottle of wine, but even if I were, this isn't the place where I'd choose to do it. But for five years diners have either forgiven the setting or perhaps even embraced it. Food this good can make up for many an inconvenience.

Bar Jamón - literally \"Ham Bar\" - is the front end of the Batali-Bastianich Spanish double-header, the other being the restaurant next door, Casa Mono. The two share a wine list and prep space, and some guides describe them as one restaurant. Even the owners have trouble deciding: some of their literature lists the two places separately, but they share a common website. Anyhow, it's a tiny space that holds about 25 people, including those standing at the bar, where there are no stools. There are light tapas, generally in the $7-11 range, along with the crazily expensive Spanish hams that give the place its name. These set you back $15 or $30 a portion. The star is the 24-page all-Spanish wine list, probably the best of its kind in New York. It's hard for me to believe that anyone would plunk down $1,950 for a magnum of 1989 Vega Sicilia and then drink it on bar stools. But if you want it, Bar Jamón has got it. Even for more modest budgets, Bar Jamón has plenty to choose from, with bottles as low as $30. Like all of the Mario Batali-Joe Bastianich restaurants, wine by the glass is served in a quartino or, in Spanish, a cuarto, which is good for about a glass and a half. In that context, the $12-25 price range is fair, and I was happy with both that I tried - the 2005 Mustiguillo ($15) and the 2006 Jimenez-Landi ($17). As we had reservations at Casa Mono afterwards, I didn't order any food, and the staff didn't try to sell me any. The munchies here aren't expensive, but unless you order some, you aren't going to get anything extra-not even so much as a bowl of nuts. It appeared that about half the patrons ordered food, and half didn't. Bar Jamón serves as Casa Mono's \"waiting room,\" though it's too successful for its own good. By 6:00 p.m. on a snowy Friday evening, Bar Jamón was nearly full. I didn't mind standing at the bar and admiring the bottles perched there. If you want a seat, expect to wait.

[Horine via Eater] Most restaurants want to be found. Macao Trading Co. takes the opposite approach. It's on a crazily obscure block in TriBeCa, without so much as a sign to let you know it's there. The door looks like a service entrance. Even if you're looking for Macao Trading Co., you're liable to miss it-as I did the first time. If you just happen to be walking by, you'll keep on walking. That's not stopping people from patronizing Macao Trading Co., which was doing a brisk bar business even at 6:00 p.m. last night. They serve food and drinks until 4:00 a.m. in an allegedly \"semi-private lounge\" downstairs called the Opium Den. There's a built-in clientele, thanks to the same owners' acclaimed cocktail bar cum restaurant, Employees Only, another peculiar place that makes virtue out of the perception of inaccessibility. The story is completely different at the perpetually-empty Dennis Foy next door, as it was at Foy's short-lived predecessor, Lo Scalco, which not even a star from the Michelin Guide could rescue. There aren't any \"bad blocks\" in Manhattan, but some are bad for certain types of restaurants. In this place, Macao Trading Co. fits right in. The restaurant is named for Macao, a former Portuguese colony on the Chinese mainland. The decor is tricked out like the 19th-century trading warehouse of our dreams. If Disney had a Macao ride, it would look like this. The spectacular back-lit bar is the visual highlight, and it's the culinary highlight too. The cocktail list is impressive; the food feels like snacks that are meant to dilute the alcohol. David Waltuck of Chanterelle is responsible for the fusion menu. Many dishes are shown in pairs, where you can choose either the Portuguese or the Chinese version of the same ingredient, such as meatballs, prawns, or ribs. Each table is set with a knife and fork, and chopsticks. There are appetizers and entrees, but the menu seems to be evolving more towards small plates and snacks. The server steered me in that direction, suggesting I order two of the small plates. That wasn't quite enough for a meal, so I later ordered a third, followed by dessert. Mackerel Escabeche ($8; above left) was like a deconstructed ceviche, served cold. It tasted fresh and mildly tart, but slightly bland. Portuguese lamb balls filled with cheese ($8; above right) were tender, but overpowered by a flood of tomato sauce. The identical green-flecked leaves seem to be the default seasoning for both dishes. Mushroom croquettes ($12; above left) benefited from a generous helping of truffle oil, but I thought the barren plate needed something to dip them in. Fried milk ($7; above right) was one dish that didn't need any more help. A dusting of cinammon and a light honey citrus salad on the side worked perfectly together. The cocktails are impressive, though expensive at $14 apiece. I'll leave it to the cocktail specialists to describe them. The wine list seems to be an afterthought. There was just one token red available by the glass, and they served it in a water glass. Service was attentive, though I was there quite early and had their mostly undivided attention. I especially appreciated the server's modest ordering advice, as restaurants that specialize in small plates usually try to sell you more than you need. All four of the items I tried struck me as enjoyable complements to the cocktail menu, but I wouldn't come here for the food alone. Macao Trading Co.

Update: Scorecard added to bottom of post... Today, as expected, Frank Bruni laid a goose-egg on David Bouley's TriBeCa Titanic, Secession: Menus this epic and indefinable can certainly work, as long as the majority of dishes are appealing in and of themselves. But when as many are as unremarkable or off key as they were at Secession the production comes across as slapdash, undisciplined... Not much of what emerged from Secession's seemingly overburdened kitchen rose far above mediocrity. And there were instances of outright sloppiness. Bruni's review exactly channels our own experience, from the cold terrines down to the grumpy coat-check woman. (Yes, she was rude to us too.) How hard is it to find someone to check coats with a smile? Where does Secession go from here? I think Bouley needs to ditch about three-fourths of the menu, hire a new chef de cuisine, and find a new drill sergeant to run the front-of-house. Thanks to this week's rather generous odds, we and Eater both win $5 on our hypothetical $1 bets.

Note: Devin Tavern closed in January 2009. This time, it's for real. I felt guilty. Eater.com announced that Devin Tavern, a resident of its Deathwatch hospice had expired. I wrote an obituary that was premature. Yesterday, Eater walked the story back. Devin Tavern is still open. I figured the least I could do was have dinner there. The restaurant has re-invented itself multiple times, in an effort-so far apparently fruitless-to win a steady following. I visited Devin Tavern v1.0 about two years ago. I liked the rustic menu, but Frank Bruni wrote it off after one blog post. Most of the major critics didn't review it. I think they're on their third chef now. The server wasn't sure of his name, but she said it's the same chef as nearby Dylan Prime, which has the same owners. I don't know if the restaurant will survive, but its website is overdue for an overhaul. Its \"press\" section has links to stories about a chef who is no longer there. Its online menu shows a number of items that are no longer offered. I had my heart set on the House Made Bacons, which have been dropped. The current menu doesn't blaze any culinary trails, but the kitchen did a solid job with Steak Frites ($24), a slightly chewy but expertly prepared hanger steak that I was happy to finish, with an excellent Hollandaise sauce on the side and good crisp fries. Cocktails are superb, all of which are \"made with house-made syrups, liqueurs & fresh juice,\" a bargain at $12 each. The bread service was excellent, too. The space is enormous, with several spacious dining rooms. They've probably never been full here, but last night they had a large private party and a solid bar crowd. Seating is comfortable, and the rustic chic decor is easy on the eyes. Service was very good, as it ought to be when there aren't many customers to keep track of.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week. By popular demand-okay, two or three folks asked for it-Rolling the Dice has returned for the first time since July. The Line: Tomorrow, we have a doozy, as Frank Bruni tackles the TriBeCa trainwreck, David Bouley's Secession. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 5-1 √√ One Star: 3-1Two Stars: 6-1Three Stars: 60-1Four Stars: 20,000-1 The Skinny: We didn't like Secession, and we don't know anyone who did. Eater already gave ample reasons for predicting the goose-egg, which we'll amplify. Steve Cuozzo liked it, and Cuozzo is practically the anti-Bruni. Bruni doesn't like phoned-in restaurants with consulting chefs on the roster and more than 70 items on the menu. He's not especially fond of French cuisine, which this mostly is. He takes offense at over-priced mediocrity, and faux luxury. Alain Ducasse's Benoit managed to eke out an unenthusiastic one-star review. But Benoit, uneven though it is, at least feels authentic. Secession feels fake, and it will take a lot more than just modest tweaks to fix it. You get the sense that Bouley needs a wake-up call. Our man Bruni is the man to deliver it. The Bet: For the return of \"Rolling the Dice,\" we thought hard about bucking the Eater prediction. The trouble is, we just can't make the one-star case. We're not saying it can't happen, but we don't see it. We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award no stars to Secession.

According to Grub Street, the former Grayz space will re-open in January as \"Atria.\" [Update: Atria closed in April 2009 after four short months in existence.] That's better than \"Gneiss,\" the last name these geniuses came up with, which lasted all of two weeks. But still, if you're going to walk back a dumb-ass idea, is \"Atria\" the best you can do? It's rather generic, and says nothing about the identity of Chef Martin Brock's cuisine. At least we know that \"Atria\" will have an atrium-surely an indispensable reason for dining there.

We commented last week on a trio of restaurant closings first reported on Eater.com. It turns out that one out of three was completely wrong, and another was incomplete. Devin Tavern has not closed. [Update: Now it has.] And Archipelago plans to \"relaunch soon with an exciting new menu designed for today's more budget-conscious restaurant-goers.\" At least Eater.com was right about Greenwich Burger: I checked it myself, and the \"For Rent\" signs are unmistakable. We'll give Eater.com a generous 1¾ out of 3 score. Archipelago is technically closed at the moment, whatever their plans may be. We've seen plenty of \"temporary\" closings that turned out to be permanent. Actually, they usually do.

[Kreiger via Eater] If you're an ethical food blogger-don't snicker, that's not an oxymoron-what do you do when a restaurant in its first week is a disaster? Do you assume the problems will eventually be worked out? Or do you call it like it is? As of today, the new Kefi is a disaster-a blunder by two smart people who should have known better. The question is, how much can they improve? We figure that Michael Psilakis and Donatella Arpaia-chef and restauranteur respectively-will do their best to get it right. Yet, much of what is wrong stems from a misguided concept that is not easily fixed. Let's be blunt: this is their third restaurant together, and more are coming. Psilakis and Arpaia were both in the house on Saturday night, but that won't last long. After the critics have come through, they'll both be spending their time elsewhere. In at least 10 visits to her various restaurants, this is the first time I've ever seen Arpaia. And in my experience, her restaurants do not improve with time. She has too many of them, along with other projects, to give the loving attention they need, and apparently she cannot find, or has not found, the right staff to manage them in her stead. Here's the background: Psilakis opened Onera on the Upper West Side, a Greek take on haute cuisine that critics liked, but wasn't suited to the neighborhood. He turned it into an inexpensive casual place called Kefi, which didn't take reservations or even credit cards. Meanwhile, the haute Greek idea was reborn as Anthos in a fancier midtown location, earning a Michelin star in its first year. Those aren't the only restaurants Psilakis and Arpaia have been involved in, or rumored to be working on, but we'll leave the history lesson there. Kefi was a big hit. We were impressed. So were the critics. Peter Meehan filed a rave in $25 & Under. There was lots of love on the BruniBlog. But Kefi had a problem: it had only 70 seats, and waits to get in were interminable. So Psilakis and Arpaia decided to move several blocks away, where they could triple the space, and where they could finally accept reservations and credit cards. I appreciate that Psilakis and Arpaia hated turning customers away. Yet, there was a grave risk that, in moving to a space 200% larger, the concept would lose its charm. That is exactly what has happened: stadium dining at its worst. The new Kefi feels like a theater district barn, geared to churn out hundreds of meals at a breakneck pace. The only difference is that Kefi doesn't slow down at 8:00. There are four rooms on two levels, each with its own design personality. (In this, it resembles Mia Dona, another Psilakis/Arpaia property.) This choice was supposed to \"keep Kefi's intimate appeal,\" but it doesn't work that way. The host station is inexplicably near the back of the first floor, so you have to navigate the clotted bar just to ask for your table. This unfortunate intersection is adjacent to the kitchen, so runners with food and busboys with dirty dishes have to fight their way through the same space where diners not yet seated are forced to congregate. Staff and customers must also share a narrow winding staircase that leads to two downstairs dining rooms, and also to the restrooms. Anyone who works here will get plenty of exercise. This restaurant really needed a dumbwaiter. Our adventure did not start well: they had lost our reservation. \"We'll accommodate you,\" our hostess generously offered, after conferring with Ms. Arpaia. A better response might have been, \"We apologize for misplacing your reservation.\" I know that customers are sometimes mistaken or even deceitful about bookings they claim to have made, but a new and obviously disorganized restaurant might want to consider giving the benefit of the doubt. Kefi was packed when we arrived, and it was packed when we left. It had the usual problems of a restaurant suddenly serving triple the number of guests. Runners were frequently confused about where to deliver food. This happened not just at our table, but everywhere. Most dishes came out not quite warm enough. This, too, happened repeatedly. Kefi is tightly packed, so it was not difficult to overhear the complaints. Plates were dropped off without silverware. Appetizer plates were cleared while leaving dirty silverware behind. House-made sausage ($7.50; above left) was the best thing we had: tender, a bit spicy, and served at the right temperature. Greek salad ($6.50; above right) was pedestrian. Meatballs ($6.25; above right) had potential, but they were served lukewarm. For the main course, I ordered the braised lamb shank ($15.95), as I had done at the former location. The plating last time (above left) is more careful, with the bed of orzo covering the plate and flecks of green on the shank itself. The version of it served on Saturday (above right) was a much lazier try, with the food carelessly dumped on the plate. The lamb shank itself was just fine, but with sufficient brazing any meat naturally would be. Moussaka ($11.95; above left) and Creamed Spinach ($5.50; above right) were both average. Neither one was served quite warm enough. Dessert was alleged to be Sesame Sorbet ($3.95; above left), though it sure tasted like ice cream to us. Whatever it was, it was too tart. If there's a bright spot at Kefi, it's the all-Greek wine list. There are tasting notes for each bottle, which is thoughtful of them, as these appellations will be utterly unfamiliar to most diners. Many bottles are very reasonably priced For $48 I was pleased with the 2001 Grande Reserve Naoussa Boutari (above right). If it were French, restaurants would sell it for twice as much. Prices remain the saving grace at Kefi. We had three appetizers, two entrees, a side dish and a bottle of wine for just $105.60, before tax and tip. That's a bargain by today's standards, though it is still no excuse for serving lukewarm food in a charmless atmosphere. The new place still has Kefi's name, but none of its appeal, other than low prices. Ms. Arpaia came downstairs multiple times during our visit. But we never noticed her stopping at any table to ask how it was going. \"She doesn't look happy,\" my girlfriend said. We passed her coming down as we were leaving. You'd think she might have said, \"Thanks for coming.\" Naturally, she did not. Perhaps Psilakis and Arpaia will be able to whip this place into shape, but I doubt it. They have too many other projects, and too many of the problems are design flaws that are virtually impossible to fix. Even if they ace it, this place cannot duplicate the original Kefi's charms. They should not have sullied its good name. I am not going to pronounce Kefi a failure after just six nights of service. This chef and this owner have earned the right to prove they can do better. They have their work cut out for them.

If you want to know when a restaurant will open, just double the estimate. When they plan to open in a month, it'll take two. When they say six months, it'll be a year. Even openings less than a week away are seldom a sure thing. Then there's 10 Downing, which finally opened in the West Village on November 12, after more delays than almost any restaurant in memory. In the Times' fall preview, on September 2, Florence Fabricant reported that the restaurant would be opening \"Next Wednesday.\" But that wasn't the first such promise: 10 Downing had the dubious distinction of appearing in the fall preview two years running. As early as August 2007, the chef-then projected to be Scott Bryan, formerly of three-star Veritas-sat for an interview with Food & Wine, and described his plans with some specificity. Exasperated by the delays, Bryan left the project. By December, Jason Neroni had replaced him, with Katy Sparks \"consulting.\" We'll skip the chronicle of the restaurant's many postponements. Suffice it to say that dates were announced and retracted many times over the past year, before the place finally opened last month. We had some healthy skepticism about Neroni. Since winning two stars from Frank Bruni at 71 Clinton-a restaurant I didn't love-he has bounced around from project to project, including the disastrous Porchetta in Brooklyn. But he is still a bona fide talent, so why on earth does he need a superfluous \"consultant\" at his elbow, especially the peripatetic and overrated Katy Sparks? The concept left me wondering whether 10 Downing would be a mindless clone of six dozen other places. A breathless Andrea Strong announced that Neroni would \"create a collaborative, market-driven menu that will draw upon the goods at the Union Square, and Sixth Avenue farmer's markets.\" Wow! Who'd have dreamt it? Well, after all that, 10 Downing has arrived, and my verdict is a cautious endorsement. If Neroni stays put, this could become a very good restaurant. My girlfriend and I both started with the Duck Meatball Cassoulet ($12; left), and it was terrific. The meatballs were tender and full of flavor. The beans were hearty and well seasoned. This dish wasn't on the opening menu, so I gather Neroni is adding things regularly, as a purportedly market-driven chef should be. While I was waiting at the bar, Neroni brought out a pile of spoons and a container of sauce, which he asked all the servers to try so that they could describe it to their customers. Neither of the entrees impressed us as much. Chicken ($23; above left) and Atlantic Cod ($25; above right) were solid, but unelectrifying choices. That chicken, by the way, was originally offered for two, at $43, but as of last Friday it was available as a hearty portion for one. 10 Dowining is priced a tad below other restaurants in its peer group. The highest entree is $28, the highest appetizer $14 (with many just $9). I found a very respectable red wine for $40. The total bill was just $115 before tax and tip, which is extremely reasonable for food of this quality. The space is smartly decorated, with a wall of glass doors looking out over Sixth Avenue. When the weather improves, there will be a large outdoor cafe. The medium-sized dining room is comfortable, but it can get a bit loud. Service was generally up to par, though a bit less attentive after the place filled up. I loved the warm bread rolls. It's hard to forecast the trajectory of a new restaurant, but 10 Downing is already respectable, and if Neroni keeps re-inventing and refining his menu, it could turn out to be a lot of fun. 10 Downing (10 Downing Street at Sixth Avenue, West Village) Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

***CONTENT
When I walked by Bouley Upstairs a couple of weeks ago, I saw a space transformed. The former bakery has high-tailed it across the street, and in its place are about half-a-dozen tables, generously spaced, with crisp tablecloths and wine glasses. The formerly rag-tag place has turned into a real restaurant. The name \"Bouley Upstairs,\" which was formerly \"Upstairs at Bouley Bakery,\" will probably be the answer to a trivia question someday. The restaurant is now both upstairs and downstairs. The added space allows more room to breathe, though the staff told me the second floor is still a tight fit. The menu seems to be broader than it was, with some classics kept around and seasonal specials. I am not quite sure how they manage it with such a small kitchen, but I suspect there are sometimes long waits for food. The Japanese offerings have been expanded considerably, to the point that Upstairs is practically two restaurants in one. There are now several prix fixe options on the Japanese side of the menu, ranging from $35 to $85, along with a substantial à la carte list. I've started a new project: sampling the upscale burgers that are popping up all over town. Last night, I decided to try Bouley's ($15 with cheese), which has been on the menu from the beginning. Alas, this wasn't one of the better ones. An English muffin should not stand in for a bun, and the taste of red onions overpowered the meat. It's a messy burger to eat, though that's not necessarily a flaw. When I got home, my suit jacket went onto the dry cleaning pile. The $10 glass of red wine I had was pretty good, though I've forgotten what it was. The wine list overall seemed to lack the inexpensive bottles that a restaurant in Upstairs' price range ought to have. When the entrees top out at $21, the wine list shouldn't be almost all above $50. I am not sure if this is destination dining or a good neighborhood cafeteria, but based on past meals (here, here) I'll assume it's still a 1½-star restaurant. Upstairs has a stratospheric 25 food rating on Zagat. At the very least, it's a lot more comfortable to graze here than it was before, and the service last night was much improved compared to my previous visits.

Grim Reaper: Devin Tavern, Archipelago, Greenwich Burger

***CONTENT
Update: Devin Tavern actually did not close at the time of this story, but it finally did about a month later. Archipelago claims it will re-open. Yesterday, Eater.com reported three restaurant closures downtown: Devin Tavern, Archipelago, and Greenwich Steak & Burger. I have strong opinions about these restaurants, as all three are within walking distance of my office. It's easy to blame these failures on the economy, but that would mask the real story. Even in a booming economy, restaurants fail all the time. If there were no recession, perhaps one or two of these places would have hung on a while longer, and perhaps ultimately survived. Still, you can't ignore management mistakes that led to their demise. When I visited Devin Tavern on a weekday evening two years ago, there was no recession, but even then the large space was nowhere close to full. They fired the chef the following spring. An Eater Deathwatch came in June of last year, when the place was still not packing them in. I liked the place, but it never caught on with the neighborhood crowd-recession or not. Archipelago was simply awful. Most of this town's critics didn't review it, which I assume was an act of kindness. I am not a believer in cursed restaurant spaces, but Hudson Square is not a neighborhood that attracts much foot traffic. People have to want to go there, and Archipelago didn't give them a reason. Neither did the previous occupant, Dani. The failure of Greenwich Steak & Burger is harder to explain, as it was comparatively inexpensive, and I thought the food was at least decent. But in a restaurant-rich neighborhood, perhaps \"decent\" wasn't good enough. In the first few months after I posted my review, it got a very high number of search-engine hits (by my standards), so apparently people were interested in the place, but it never caught on. We're going to see more failures after the New Year. The economy naturally has something to do with it, but you need to look beneath the surface to see why. Every failure is its own story, and usually conceptual mistakes or poor execution are at least partly to blame.

Archipeligo could have saved what must have been a significant amount of money by just asking me or anyone else in the neighborhood if they thought it would work.Can a restaurant work in that location? Maybe - if they have good food at good prices and a \"friendly\" menu, and offer an attractive lunch menu. Can a fancy restaurant with an extremely upscale menu that offers what they think is a deal with a $25 lunch special survive there? Not in 100 years - and everyone I know could have told them that 4 months ago.

A Chef's Plea for Half-Stars at the Times
***AUTHOR
Marc Shepherd

***CONTENT
Frank Bruni delivered a shock this week - deliberately, I am sure - by awarding three stars to Corton just seven days after awarding three stars to Momofuku Ssäm Bar. Three-star reviews are pretty rare. There have been just 32 of them in Bruni's 4½ years on the job. So to give out two of them in a row is unusual. He has never done that before. Now, the Ssäm Bar review was totally discretionary. No particular event compelled him to write it. By doing so when he knew Corton was coming the following Wednesday, he was clearly trying to make a meta-statement about the very different paths to excellence that these two restaurants have followed. But the Ssäm Bar review upsets many in the industry, not just because David Chang is ridiculously over-exposed, but because it makes nonsense of the rating system. The same chef's Momofuku Ko, which is clearly more ambitious and accomplished by any measure, also carries three stars from Frank Bruni. What is the point of a rating system, if it fails to distinguish different levels of excellence and accomplishment? Over at the Feedbag, an anonymous chef suggests that the Times should add half-stars to its system, to better distinguish between different levels: The grading of restaurants lately does not make sense. How can a restaurant as refined as Eleven Madison Park, Picholine and Corton fit on the same level as restaurants as casual as A Voce, Scarpetta and the very baffling Momofuku Ssam? I am not saying they aren't all great restaurants in their own right, but they are not equals. By installing a half star, one could differentiate between them. In my opinion, Blue Hill, Scarpetta and Craft should be 3 stars, Corton, Picholine, and Eleven Madison, 3 and a half, and Momofuku Ssam, 2 and a half. By grouping all of these establishments under the same 3 stars, they are misleading patrons. Isn't that supposed to be the idea of these reviews? By awarding three stars to restaurants so disparate, they're making the Times review system meaningless, and that hurts everybody. We agree that half-stars allow the critic to discriminate better between different types of restaurants. That's why reviews published on this blog use half-stars. But ultimately, whether your rating system has 4 grading levels or 100, it can be no better than the person assigning them. I have no idea what ratings Bruni would have given out if his system allowed for half-stars. However, it is poor judgment that has created this mess in the first place, and poor judgment is not rectified by adding levels to the system. Bruni seems to be applying a bizarre \"quality divided by price\" formula to assign stars. On that line of reasoning, Ko and Ssäm Bar are rated identically, for although Ko is better, it also costs more. In his defense, Bruni can point out that the Times rating system expressly states that prices are \"taken into consideration,\" though no past critic has done it quite the way he does. The same perverted logic allows Bruni to justify awarding three stars to the Bar Room at the Modern, when the obviously superior dining room at the same establishment has just two. We strongly suspect that if the Times had half-stars in its rating system, Bruni would nevertheless have made the same error. Our own view is that ratings should reflect excellence, period. The fact that excellence costs more is utterly irrelevant to the rating. It may be that some diners either cannot afford the best restaurants, or that they prefer to spend their time and money in other ways. But if Momofuku Ssäm Bar is inferior to Momofuku Ko-as it clearly is-the fact that one is cheaper does not make them equal.

I don't think the lack of half-stars have anything to do with it. It's precisely what you said - Quality vs. cost (or perhaps, expectations). I think it's natural to rate things this way. I might tell a friend that a little noodle place in Chinatown was \"amazing\" but that I was disappointed in Masa or Per Se.Yelp reviews reflect this as well.I think the solution is to have two ratings - one on a cost basis and one on a pure quality basis.The problem with this, of course, is if any restaurant where you're spending over, say, $100, could ever have a 3 or 4 star rating relative to cost. Maybe not, and maybe that's ok.

Flatbush Farm is yet another entry in the farm-to-table movement, an idea that wasn't exactly new when the restaurant opened in Park Slope in 2006. This haute barnyard sure is dark-not quite like the photo above, but close. Those with middle-aged eyes might struggle to read the menu. That menu features modestly priced starters at $7-14, mains mostly $16-22, bar snacks $6-12, and desserts $7-8. Dry-aged steak for two is an incongruous $70. The server recited a long list of specials-enough of them that it was hard to keep track of the choices. Reprinting the menu daily would reinforce the restaurant's greenmarket cred. and would make ordering easier. Crispy Pig's Head (above left) was one of those daily specials. According to the server, \"It's great. Just forget about how they made it.\" That was pretty good advice. Little balls of slightly gooey pig flesh were coated in spicy breadcrumbs and deep fried. I would order it again any day. A pork terrine (above right) with quail eggs wasn't bad either, but it was a touch on the cool side, as if it had sat in the fridge too long. The Roasted Pork Chop (above left) was tender, with a nice smoky char on the outside. My girlfriend had asked for a substitution in lieu of sweet potatoes. The kitchen forgot (or hadn't been told), and the dish had to be re-plated. Her vegetables were fine, but mine weren't warm enough. There were other service glitches too. A perfunctory bread service came with a vat of herb butter that looked good, but turned out to be hard as a rock. We asked for tap water. The server pointed at a bottle already on the table, and said, \"There you go.\" But she didn't pour it, and it wasn't cold. I asked for a bottle of 2004 Cabernet, but the server apparently did not notice that she had returned with a 2006. When I pointed it out, she had to consult with a manger before replying, \"The wine list is out of date. Our current vintage is 2006.\" Anyhow, I rejected that and requested a 2003 Tempranillo (above right) at the same price, $38. The mistakes seemed mostly forgivable at this restaurant's price point. But they were enough to put Flatbush Farm at a disadvantage when compared to Manhattan restaurants offering similar fare with greater polish.

Frank Bruni, Failed Food Blogger

***CONTENT
Frank Bruni's New York Times blog, Diner's Journal, has been with us a bit less than three years. It is a failure. In February 2006, his inaugural post promised: I spend an insane, glorious amount of time in restaurants. And of course I see and taste more than I get to recount within the confines of weekly Dining section reviews, each based on multiple visits to a given restaurant, each boiled down to about 1,000 words from hours and hours of observation and tens of thousands of calories. This new blog is an attempt to capture and share more of my notes from the field. To provide, in something closer to real time, a sense of what's being served in the city's newest, oldest, most delightful and most frustrating restaurants and of how those restaurants are serving it. To flag trends and, less often and more selectively, flog underachievers. To report moments of real significance and incidents that just happened to be interesting. To keep a journal, and to keep the tone of that journal light, casual, accessible. Just as the \"Diner's Journal\" in the Friday newspaper did, this \"Diner's Journal\" on the web will offer quick, early peeks at restaurants that have just opened but aren't yet ready to be reviewed. In the spirit of that weekly feature, it will also present critical perspectives on restaurants that probably won't be reviewed, given the limitations of space in the newspaper and the limits of those restaurants' charms. But it will be more frequent and more flexible. I'll post new entries several times a week. What is the reality? Bruni seldom uses the blog to write about food. In the last six months, there have been just nine posts about food. I'm being generous by including his Nov. 24 post about Waterfront Ale House, which is mainly about his craving for chicken wings. If Frank was auditioning for the \"$25 & Under\" job, let me be the first to congratulate him: he passed. The promises to \"share more notes from the field\" in \"something close to real time,\" to \"flag trends,\" \"report moments of real significance,\" \"flog underachievers,\" and offer \"early peeks,\" have largely not been kept. Bruni does post a couple of times a week, on average, but usually not about food. He writes about Top Chef, getting reservations at inaccessible spots, allegations of poor service, Chef Q&A's, industry news, and so forth. But he seldom writes about the thing he presumably spends most of his time on: restaurant meals. Bruni has vitiated the whole point of having a blog-the ability to report in real time, rather than saving up his thoughts for one big weekly review. What's more, the restaurants he reviews are just a small fraction of his meals out. The typical review requires three visits to the restaurant, but he probably dines out 10 times a week. That means about 70% of his meals aren't explicitly reported on. Now, if the Times is willing to pay Bruni to report on just 30% of his meals, that's their business, not mine. But if the reason for starting the blog was to provide \"more frequent and more flexible\" coverage of restaurants, then he ought to do it. More importantly, isn't the Times overdue for a re-think of the long-form review? With only one review per week, many very good restaurants go years without any comment from the Paper of Record. Bruni's crazily premature re-review of Momofuku Ssäm Bar last week-even though the restaurant's many charms are basically the same as they were two years ago-deprived plenty of more worthy places that haven't been reviewed in years, or perhaps not at all, a chance at exposure. Yet, in the review, Bruni said: In the last year and a half, I've found myself returning to Ssam again and again...because eating at Ssam feels so unencumbered, honest and joyful, and because I can't stop reflecting on the daring and importance of Mr. Chang's work there. If Bruni had used his blog to report on even a fraction of those visits-and as far as I can recall, he never did-then perhaps the newspaper review last week could have been used to direct attention to someone other than the ridiculously over-exposed Mr. Chang. The Times should overhaul its reviewing system, so that ratings and recommendations can evolve gradually as the critic makes his rounds over the course of his tenure. There are plenty of restaurants that Bruni has visited but never reviewed, because he hasn't paid the minimum of three visits that the paper requires. But a running journal of those visits could, over time, provide valuable perspective-perhaps even more so than the Wednesday reviews, which offer, at best, point-in-time snapshots. As print reviews continue their slide into irrelevance, Bruni or his successor ought to consider how his online journal could become the primary medium for reporting on restaurants, instead of the very distant afterthought it is today.

Five years ago, The Spotted Pig was an overnight sensation in the West Village. If chef April Bloomfield and her partner Ken Friedman had followed the usual path, by now there'd be Pig clones all over town, and a couple more in Vegas and Atlantic City. But Bloomfield stayed focused on the Pig, which earned an improbable Michelin star and has held onto it for four years running. Nothing lasts forever: Bloomfield and Friedman now have their second restaurant, The John Dory, which opened two weeks ago in Southwest Chelsea, on the same block as Del Posto and Craftsteak. (Del Posto's Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich are investors in both the Spotted Pig and the John Dory.) Friedman has an eye for witty design. At the Spotted Pig, the theme is \"pig art.\" Here, it's \"fish art,\" and he arrays it even more deftly than at the earlier restaurant, from fish lures embedded in a countertop, to fish tiles in the floor. A large tropical fish tank stands sentry over the bar. There are just two small dining rooms. The first one, with about eight tables, rests on a narrow elevated platform and offers a terrific view of the open kitchen. The second one is in a side room with a view of the fish tank. There is ample counter seating facing the kitchen. Bloomfield has wisely kept the opening menu short and focused, with just seven appetizers ($14-20) and eight entrees ($24-35). There's also a few raw bar choices and five crudi ($16-20). Side dishes ($8-10) are excellent, as they are at the Spotted Pig. It was obvious that many of the patrons were friends of the management, but Bloomfield never once left the kitchen to schmooze (she left that to Friedman). We saw one critic in the house (GQ's Alan Richman), and the staff seemed to think Frank Bruni was coming too, but we didn't spot him. We started with a cute amuse-bouche of arctic char pâte (above right) with chips for spreading. There should probably be a bit more, as it disappeared rather quickly. Sardines \"A La Plancha\" (above left; $18) had a nice cruncy texture and were nicely seasoned with almonds, raisins and paprika. My girlfriend pronounced the Fish Soup (above right; $16) a success. There is, of course, John Dory on the menu. On some nights, they seem to offer it for one, but when we visited it was available only for two ($50). Instead, I had the Whole Grilled Sea Bream (above left; $26), which was presented tableside and then filleted. This was a lovely preparation, with a rosemary-anchovy pesto on the skin. Pan-Roasted Cod (above right; $28) was just as good. Sweet Potatoes (above left; $8) were dusted with bone marrow and served in hefty beefsteak slices. Our second side dish was much delayed, but I give the server credit for how she handled it. Instead of just leaving us staring at dirty dishes, she cleared the table and re-set it with fresh plates and flatware. Jensen's Temptation (above right; $10) works perfectly well as a separate course, though it clearly wasn't intended that way. It's a Swedish preparation of scallopped potatoes, with onions, heavy cream, and an anchovy crust. As we were leaving, it dawned on me that the coat-check attendant hadn't given me a ticket. Despite that, she seemed to know who I was, and had my coat ready for me. It was just one of many points, both little and great, that made me feel like these people know how to run a restaurant. My girlfriend had the same thought: \"They're going to do just fine.\" The John Dory (85 Tenth Avenue between 15th & 16th Streets, Chelsea) Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

David Bouley's growing empire fascinates me. What is it like to build seven restaurants at once? Not seven clones, but seven one-of-a-kind places? One of the seven, Secession, is an early failure. It got zero stars from Adam Platt this week. If it gets much better than a weak singleton from Frank Bruni, I'll be surprised. I walked by the others last night for a brief look-in. Here's a report: Bouley Bakery. The bakery has now moved into the old Bouley restaurant. It's a work in progress, with signs of unfinished construction. David Bouley himself was wandering around inside. They're selling baked goods and soups, in what appears to be a makeshift space. My understanding is that there will eventually be a wine bar in here, but that part isn't ready yet. Upstairs. With the bakery gone, Upstairs has the whole building to itself. I saw four lovely tables on the ground floor with - gasp! - white tablecloths and formal glassware. It actually looks like a pleasant place to dine, certainly not the case when I visited three years ago, and promptly crossed it off my list. There is no longer a menu posted outside, but a sign on the door announces various prix fixe sushi specials, presumably still available on the second floor. Bouley Restaurant. This is now open in the old Mohawk Atelier building, on a scale of unprecedented luxury. There's a private dining room on the lower level with a separate entrance. The kitchen features panoramic windows facing the street. If you can't afford to eat at Bouley, you can press your nose to the glass and watch him (or more likely, his minions) cook for those who can. It's a gutsy move-a new take on the idea of an \"open kitchen.\" There's no menu posted, at the restaurant or online. I'm in no rush to visit until I read a few more reports, but I may stop in for a drink sometime soon.

It was the day after Thanksgiving, and we wanted something casual. I decided on Mr. Jones, the new Yakitori restaurant on the northern edge of the East Village. If Jones doesn't sound familiar, you haven't missed anything: he's fictitious. What he has to do with Yakitori, or Japanese food served on skewers, utterly eludes me. Restaurant Girl nailed the decor: George Jetson's bachelor pad. Someone dropped major coin to build it, but the design betrays some indecision about the mission. The inconspicuous exterior looks like a garage door. Inside, it looks more like a party lounge than a restaurant, with its tightly-packed tiny tables and low-slung chairs. \"Japanese\" isn't exactly what comes to mind. I've been to a few Yakitori restaurants in Tokyo. They look nothing like this. Neither do the staff: our server was a busty Brazilian girl, dressed in a low-cut frock. The manager looked like the Russian mafia. The chef, Bryan Emperor, isn't Japanese either, but he has some serious cred., with stints at Nobu, Megu, Bouley, and kaiseki restaurant in Japan. His job is more boring than a Maytag repair man's: we found his restaurant almost totally empty. I hope for his sake that the day after Thanksgiving was atypical. You can have some fun here. The cocktails are a diverse lot, many of them classics,and well made. Most of the food follows the food-on-skewers theme, though with some ingredients I've never seen in Japan, like pork belly, foie gras, and chicken wings. There are some misfires, but most of what we tried was enjoyable. We spent just $114 for two before tax & tip, and that included two cocktails apiece. At that price, one is loath to complain. Nevertheless, several dishes came out not quite warm enough-an odd mistake, given that we had the place to ourselves. The small-plates format encourages communal ordering, though some items weren't well designed for it (e.g., why three meatballs?), and when we asked for plates to divide our food, the little dishes they produced were only slightly larger than a cigar box. Like most small-plate restaurants, the kitchen tosses out the food at whatever pace and in whatever order suits the chef. Sometimes you have nothing, and at other times you have two plates at once. They were also out of several things, on a small menu of about 35 appetizer-sized items in various categories (chicken, beef, rice, soup...), most of them $10 or less. With some help from our server, we chose eight items to share, which proved to be about right. They were all $5-9 apiece except for the Kobe meatballs, which were $12. The menu has been changing. Those meatballs were originally listed at $16, and some other items shown on the bill don't agree with the online version. Berkshire Black Hog Belly ($5; above left) is usually a safe bet, but this skewer was lukewarm and adorned with not much more than a bit of sea salt. Tori Tatsuta Age ($9; above right), or Japanese style chicken wings, were a hit, with a generous allotment of six to the portion. Chicken is probably the most authentic of Mr. Jones's Yakitori ingredients. Naturally, it is \"Organic Free Range Chicken,\" but when it's drowning in spicy Yuzu sauce ($7; above left), I doubt its pedigree matters very much. It was actually one of the better items on the menu, in an unsubtle way. I liked the Kobe Meatballs stuffed with foie gras ($12; above right), though as noted above, it wasn't easy to divide 3 meatballs among two people. Wagyu Short Ribs ($8; above left) were tender, and the kitchen wisely went easy on the sauce, letting the superior beef speak for itself. The next item was a bowl of mushrooms and rice ($9; above right) that I don't recognize in the online menu. The mushrooms were a tad under-cooked. Vegetable tempura ($8; above left) was perfectly done: six pieces in a light and greaseless tempura batter. Calamari tempura ($8; above right) suffered from an excess of sauce. Any calamari beneath all that batter was undetectable. There are some slips-ups on the menu at Mr. Jones and some faulty execution in the kitchen, but we enjoyed most of what we tried. With most of the items priced under $10, you don't feel cheated if one or two of them are less than satisfying. For a diverting bit of fun, Mr. Jones is worth a visit.

End of Dayz for Grayz

***CONTENT
Crain's reports today what many had already guessed: Grayz will close at the end of the year. Kunz was pushed out of the restaurant six months ago, and it made no sense to continue operating a place named for a guy who's no longer there. On our last visit, we found Grayz less than half full. There was some terrific food, but the whole misguided concept was designed for an economic climate that no longer exists. The owners will re-open as \"Gneiss\" (\"nice\") in the same space, with Kunz's former chef de cuisine, Martin Brock, still in place. We don't have much hope for this reincarnation, starting with one of the dumbest names we've seen. The story of Grayz is that of one fumble after another. These owners still don't know how to run a restaurant. Along with the doomed Cafe Gray, this is Kunz's second failure this year. We strenuously disagree with Cutlets, who exonerates Kunz in both of these failures: While technically true, neither Cafe Gray nor Grayz was really Kunz's restaurant. The first was a gilded deathtrap, that not even Fernand Point himself could have broken out of, and Grayz, with its strange corporate concept, was a similarly Sisyphean struggle. Cafe Gray was Kunz's concept. He is as accountable for the failure as anybody. (We're not sure if \"gilded deathtrap\" accurately describes Cafe Gray in any case; Cutlets, the ultimate cheeseburger guy, is probably not the one to understand such places.) Kunz was very much the minority partner in Grayz, but in signing up for the concept, he must take some knocks for its demise. Kunz is one of this town's best chefs, but he has turned out to be a terrible business man. Both Grayz and Cafe Gray suffered from conceptual flaws that Kunz either failed to see or couldn't correct. Kunz needs a backer with better business instincts-a Drew Nieporent or a Danny Meyer-so that he can concentrate on the one thing he does well, which is to cook.

***CONTENT
When I reviewed Savoy two years ago, I noted my amazement that chef-owner Peter Hoffman had remained satisfied with just one restaurant after sixteen years in business. These days, any reasonably successful chef feels the itch to open a second place, and soon after, a third. Sure enough, a year later came Back Forty, a more casual restaurant than Savoy, but in the same haute barnyard style that Hoffman made popular before everyone was doing it. Actually, the decor feels a bit like a gussied-up barnyard, with hefty wooden tables and farm implements hanging from the walls. In the Times, Peter Meehan reviewed Back Forty a year ago today, finding it inconsistent but promising. Reviews turn up regularly on the food boards, suggesting that this restaurant is pulling in much more than just the East Village neighborhood crowd. Then again, these days practically any good East Village restaurant can consider itself a destination. The menu is extremely inexpensive for a restaurant of this quality, with starters $4-10, entrees $10-20, sides $3-7, and desserts $7-8. Most of the wines are under $50 per bottle, with ample choices below $40. A quartino of the house red was just $5. I had come for the burger, which I knew would be quite filling, so I ordered just a small appetizer for my son and me to share, the Pork Jowl Nuggets ($4; below left). Had the server told us that it came with just three extremely small \"nuggets,\" we would have ordered a second starter. They were extremely good, with just a touch of spice supplied by Jalapeno jam, but after we divided the middle nugget in two, all we had were two tiny bites apiece. We debated whether to order something else, but we figured our burgers would be quickly on the way. Alas, we waited quite a while for them. At another table that was seated after us, their burgers came before ours did. (The burger seems to be a popular choice; we saw quite a few of them come out.) This being an haute barnyard, Back Forty doesn't serve merely a burger, but a Grass Fed Burger (above right). It's $11 on its own, $2 for cheese (only Farmhouse Cheddar is offered), another $2 for Heritage Bacon (which we skipped), and another $2 for Rosemary Fries on the side. Meehan at the Times felt that the grass-fed beef \"lacks something,\" but we thought it was pretty damned good, with a delicious buttery softness, although a tad too small for the bun. The fries were terrific, too. My son, who isn't easily pleased, thought this was a restaurant he'd happily come back to. Avenue B is a considerable distance out of the way, so I probably won't be returning quite as often as Back Forty deserves. There's a whole pig roast on Monday evening, and I'd certainly love to come back for that. Back Forty (190 Avenue B at 12th Street, East Village) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Ah, Bobo...poor Bobo...the restaurant that could never catch a break. When last we saw our poor suffering hero, Bobo was on its second chef, soon to be deposed for a third chef. Alas, that wasn't good enough to impress New York's Adam Platt or Frank Bruni of the Times, both of whom awarded one star, finding the food too uneven to earn two. For our part, we are still betting that Bobo will succeed. The new chef, Patrick Connolly, comes with a successful stint at Boston's Radius to his credit. We still love the space, the prices are reasonable for the neighborhood, and the service is better than you find at many restaurants in its peer group. There are some conceits that a cynical reviewer would call precious, but we still want to give Bobo a big hug. Many restaurants are serving gourmet burgers these days, and one day I decided on impulse to give Bobo's a try. I hadn't written down the address, and I very nearly couldn't find the place. The graphic on Bobo's website, shown above, seems to be making a joke about the restaurant's secluded and unlabeled location in an old townhouse on W. 10th Street. In the casual downstairs bar, old albums are the theme. The bar menu is pasted onto the center label of an old 33rpm record, and the wine list is pasted inside a double-album cover. (You can also order the main restaurant menu downstairs.) Even though I was only having a burger, there was a full bread service with soft butter. The wine I ordered was a very reasonable tempranillo at $10 a glass, and the server offered a taste before I committed to it. These are small points, but plenty of more expensive restuarants get them wrong. What about that burger? Owner Carlos Suarez described it on Eater.com: The development/thinking on the Bobo burger is all about simplicity, though. Its five key ingredients: a potato roll, gruyere cheese, crispy fried leeks above the meat, house-pickled leeks underneath, and the meat. There's a spice to the meat-it just has a slightly different flavor profile. Plus, we're doing a finer grind on the beef than you usually see. We did 20 dif variations-added pork, pancetta, guanciale, toyed with an egg, different rolls-and this was the one most well received. It's straightforward, not trying to add unnecessary expenses. All familiar flavors. I am so sure that a burger served with leeks is \"straightforward.\" It worked, though if we're being picky, the bun didn't quite stand up to the gooey mess inside it. The fries, spiced with salt, pepper, corn starch and chives, were surprisingly good, and I finished them all. The bar was doing good business at around 6:30 p.m. on a Thursday evening, though it was not full. Bobo remains a fun place, and I suspect we'll be back.

Le Bernardin

I hit a milestone this year. No, it's not my 48th birthday. It's that I've now visited every one of the city's four-star restaurants at least once. Of the five restaurants currently holding that distinction, Le Bernardin is the one to which I'm most eager to return. It's not that Le Bernardin is the best of the bunch-though it very well may be-but that it's the most versatile. I loved my meals at Per Se and Masa, but both are crazily expensive, and their long tasting menus don't change much. Daniel and Jean Georges are both excellent, but neither one impressed me quite as much as Le Bernardin. On top of that, there are enough menu options to dine frequently at Le Bernardin without repeating anything. Based on the sustained quality of the Chef's Tasting Menu we had, it appears you can't go wrong here. If I could afford it, we'd be here once a month. Le Bernardin is the oldest of New York's top-rated restaurants, having won four stars from Bryan Miller of the Times in March 1986, when it was less than three months old. It was a near-clone of a Paris restaurant run by chef Gilbert Le Coze and his sister, Maguy, who watched over the front-of-house. They closed their Paris restaurant in December 1986 to focus on New York full-time. Bryan Miller awarded four stars yet again in February 1989. (In those days, the Times re-reviewed major restaurants far more quickly than it does today.) Gilbert Le Coze died in July 1994 of a sudden heart attack. He was only 49, but a youngster named Eric Ripert, then 29, had already been in charge of the kitchen for over three years. Times critic Ruth Reichl took another look in April 1995, finding Le Bernardin still worthy of four stars. The paper's most recent review came from Frank Bruni in March 2005. You guessed it: four stars. How has Le Bernardin remained on top of its game for more than two decades? Few restaurants in its class would have survived the death of the original chef, and most seem to rest on their laurels after a while. Even fans of Jean Georges admit that the menu has hardly changed in ten years. But Vongerichten now leads a worldwide empire of almost twenty restaurants. Eric Ripert has taken on the occasional consulting gig, but Le Bernardin has his nearly undivided attention. And he is still innovating. As Bruni noted, \"Asian accents are scattered throughout a menu that bears scant resemblance to the one in 1995.\" In a recent Feedbag post, Ripert noted that the staff have meetings every week to try new recipes, and \"Maybe one in three dishes makes it onto Le Bernardin's menu-if that.\" Grub Street published a list of the maître d's 129 Cardinal Sins for Waiters, an admirable opus that every new employee at Le Bernardin must study, and that ought to be mandatory reading at most other restaurants. The atmosphere is lovely, but it certainly isn't as romantic or as picturesque as the city's other four-star restaurants. Frank Bruni exaggerated when he compared the dining room to \"a first-class airport lounge.\" I wonder what airports Bruni's been visiting; I've never seen one like this. But the space certainly lacks the serenity of other restaurants in its class. On the Le Bernardin website, the background sound is the hubbub of diners chattering-accurate enough, but an odd choice. (I don't like restaurant websites with a sound track anyway, but if you're going to have one, why that?) The format here is a four-course prix fixe at $109, nearly all seafood. The savory courses are in three groups: Almost Raw, Barely Touched and Lightly Cooked, with about a dozen choices for each. There's also, \"upon request,\" squab, lamb, Kobe beef ($150 supp.) or pasta. It's hard to imagine that anyone would come here for the steak, but Ripert told Grub Street that he sells 50 orders of it a night-an astonishing total at a seafood restaurant. There are two tasting menus: seven courses for $135 or eight more luxurious ones for $185. As it was my birthday, we had the latter, along with wine pairings for an additional $140 per person. The wines were certainly very good, but in terms of real value you could probably do better by the bottle or half-bottle. The amuse-bouche (left) was a mushroom soup of startling clarity, with hunks of succulent lobster at the bottom of the cup. The bread service was excellent, with several house-made varieties. The first course was a remarkable thinly-pounded salmon carpaccio with a dollop of caviar tucked inside, all perched on a wafer-thin toasted brioche (above left). You don't get much closer to perfection. Seared Japanese blue fin tuna (said to be the world's first of the species that's \"sustainably raised\") was beautifully balanced with parmesan crisp, sun-dried tomato, and black olive oil (above right). The fireworks continued as the kitchen somehow managed to fill sauteed calamari with sweet prawns and shiitake mushrooms (above left). Lobster was paired with asparagus a hollandaise-like sauce (above right). As an aside, this was one of the few dishes that prominently featured a vegetable. Most of Ripert's dishes put vegetables, if he uses them at all, far into the background. The closest thing to a letdown was the Escolar, or white tuna, poached in extra virgin olive oil with sea beans and potato crisps (above left). It had a flat, bland taste. But crispy black bass (above right) was excellent, as was the surprisingly good parsnip custard that came with it (below left). Who knew parsnips could be so good? Each dessert seems to revolve around a simple idea, beautifully executed. I loved the roasted fig with goat cheese parfait, hazelnut, red wine caramel, and bacon ice cream (above right). A chocolate ganache (above left) brought approving nods from across the table, but I'm not fond of chocolate, so I asked for a substitute. They gave me a choice of anything on the dessert menu, and I chose the carrot cake (above right), which I'd be happy to have any day. You can't read it in the photo, but that's \"Happy Birthday\" written in chocolate in front of the tiny cake (below left). We concluded with the usual petits-fours (below right). Service was first-rate: If any of the maître d's cardinal sins was violated, we didn't notice it. There are more romantic settings in New York, but everything on the plate was extraordinary.

[Horine via Eater] Note: Click here for a more recent review of Center Cut. In the increasingly compelling Lincoln Center pre-theater market, the latest entry is Jeffrey Chodorow's new steakhouse, Center Cut. With 27 restaurants to his name-I think that's the correct count, unless another has opened or closed in the last 15 minutes-Chodorow doesn't linger over his projects. He's had some hits (Asia de Cuba), which are enough to subsidize his many failures. Center Cut is in the Empire Hotel, directly across the street from Lincoln Center. You'd think it's the perfect location for a restaurant, but many have come and gone over the 27 years I've been watching. Center Cut ought to make it. Steakhouses seldom fail in New York, and this one pushes plenty of populist buttons. The space is lovely, albeit over-built. The menu is straightforward. It's neither as silly as Chodorow's now-closed Wild Salmon, nor as cynical as his still-open, but deathwatched, Kobe Club. This is, of course, a Chodorow production, so you should expect to be mildly annoyed. They wouldn't transfer our bar tab to our table. Although the restaurant was almost empty, they seated us right next to another party. The hostess supplied menus, \"And your server will be able to give you a wine list.\" We waited a while, and no server appeared, but fortunately the table next to us had a wine list they no longer needed. I guess there was a good reason, after all, for seating us so close together. The server finally arrived, with Jeffrey Chodorow's patented Treatise on Upselling firmly in tow. There are a baker's dozen signature cocktails, many of them with operatic names (\"The Tristan,\" \"The Isolde\"). When you see that they're $14-17, perhaps you're not surprised that management is pushing them hard. I think we were asked three times if we'd like to order one. Classic cocktails, such as a Tom Collins or a Side Car, are a few dollars cheaper. Like most of Chodorow's places, the menu offers a lot to ponder. For starters, there are eight appetizers ($12-19), five soups ($13-15), and six salads ($9-15), plus a raw bar. For the main course, there are sixteen composed dishes in various categories ($29-41, not counting lobster, for which no price is listed) and six \"center cuts,\" served à la carte ($35-41 for one, $59-78 for two). For steak, the filet seems to be the best option: you can have it four different ways. There is no porterhouse, though there's a T-bone for two ($56). There are six available steak sauces and ten sides ($7 each). On top of that, there's a $39 pre- or post-theater prix fixe, served from 5-7 p.m., or after 10 p.m. The restaurant's mantra is, \"Where Style & Sustainability Meet.\" On the wine list, purveyors are marked with little logos if they're \"Organic,\" \"Sustainable,\" or \"Biodynamic.\" If you don't know what those terms mean, don't worry: there's a little essay that explains it. The steaks, from Brandt Beef, are alleged to be \"natural, humanely-raised, antibiotic and hormone free.\" Perhaps I spoke too soon when I said the concept was free of sillyness or cynicism. Bread service was terrific-a hot Parker House roll (above)-though the butter needed to be softer. I started with the Slow Roasted Berkshire Bacon ($12; above left), which would have been fine enough on its own, and didn't need a bed of bitter-tasting \"beer roasted onions.\" A Caesar Salad ($13; above right) was over-dressed. The menu warns that its \"Flintstone\" Brandt Beef Ribs ($32; above left) are \"for two or one 'really hungry person'.\" That warning is accurate. The foreshortening of the photo doesn't do justice to the amount of food you get. Two could easily share this dish, especially if you also order sides. According to the server, the BBQ sauce is a hand-me-down from chef Bradley Day's family. If so, the Day household was probably a pretty good place to eat. Both the sauce and the meat were done perfectly. My girlfriend found the prime rib ($35; above right) a bit too salty and not flavorful enough, though I had no objection to the small piece of it that I tasted. Both side dishes, Potatoes Dophinoise (above left) and Roasted Corn & Manchego Gratin (above center) were excellent. It was good to see compelling options beyond the usual steakhouse classics. Eggplant Fries don't float my boat, but the Wild Mushroom Strudel is one to try next time. The wine list is almost all young (2004 or later), and there aren't many bargains. Except for Beaujolais, nearly all the red bottles are above $65. If three-star restaurants like Cafe Boulud and Corton can offer a whole page of wines under $60, surely other places can too. I ordered a 2006 Brouilly at $40, mainly because we were going to the opera and I knew we weren't going to finish it. With most reds by the glass priced at $14 or higher (and I wouldn't have ordered the ones that weren't), it seemed like the way to go. For a nearly-empty restaurant, service ought to have been a bit more attentive. A manager buzzed around the few occupied tables, correcting the staff's many oversights. The server was a decent enough fellow when you had his attention. There were hits and misses here, but it looks like one can put together a respectable meal at Center Cut. Most steaks are priced below $40, and there are even some entrees in the high $20s. Those prices aren't low enough to qualify as bargains, but they are below a number of other steakhouses that have opened in recent years. The bill mounts quickly if you order wine and side dishes, but you can still put together a decent meal here for less than the average Manhattan steakhouse. Service was uneven, and I'd like to think it will get better with time, except that this is a Jeffrey Chodorow restaurant, and some of the glitches seem to be in China Grill Management's corporate DNA. I'd certainly like to see more people in the cavernous dining room, lest this restaurant suffer the fate of so many others in the Empire Hotel. Center Cut (44.

I compared the wine list of Corton & Center Cut and found the following. Corton does have a page of $65 and under wines, but They only have a total of 21 reds under $65. Center Cut has 17, not much of difference and they shouldn't have been knocked for it. Another thing, they are a new restaurant and being in the business, I understand that it is hard to obtain older vintages unless you want shell out some extra dough, which would place those wines over your $65 mark. You mention them lacking older vintages, (2004), well 20% of their list is under 2004. My question to you is did you look any farther then the 1st page of reds or did you stop a the Pinot Noir/ Gamay Noir page, too bad for you. I asked the sommelier to recommend something under $60 and he brought me, arguably, one of the best Dolcetto I have ever had! I understand the need to bag on El Chode, but you should really get some of your facts straight.

Thanks for the comments. A few points....Since Center Cut operates at a much lower price point overall, I would expect it to have many more of the inexpensive wines than Corton, not the other way around. In truth, I was being pretty generous in setting the bar at $60.Yes, I did read the entire wine list. I never said that it doesn’t have some good wines. Although I often spend more, on this particular day I did not want to exceed $50. At a restaurant in Center Cut’s price range, that ought to be easier to do than it is at Corton or Café Boulud.I do put a high priority on “getting my facts straight,” but I am still not clear which of my facts you disagree with. All I did was point out that the lower end of Center Cut’s wine list is not consistent with the overall price level of the restaurant, which you have not refuted.

[Kreiger via Eater] Note: Click here for a review of Corton on Valentine's Day 2009. Dinner at the new restaurant Corton is like a double homecoming. It marks the return of chef Paul Liebrandt, last seen in New York during a brief, controversial tenure at Gilt. And it marks the return of the iconic space once the home of Montrachet, now almost unrecognizable after a stunning make-over. Liebrandt has made waves wherever he cooked, but mainly he is known for acclaimed cuisine in restaurants that didn't last very long. His last restaurant, Gilt, has survived-perhaps even thrived-but Liebrandt himself was forced out after disappointing reviews, including just two stars from Frank Bruni at a place clearly designed for three, or even four. I'm one of many who thought Bruni really missed the boat, but his reviews, not mine, are the ones that count. Montrachet was the place that put chef David Bouley and restauranteur Drew Nieporent on the map in TriBeCa. Bouley left to start his own place, but Montrachet remained a successful three-star restaurant under a long line of chefs. The Times demoted it to two stars in 2004, and it finally closed in 2006 after an impressive 21-year run. At Corton, which opened about a month ago, the foodies are once again rapturous over Paul Liebrandt's cooking. He has toned down his act a bit. The three-course prix fixe at Liebrandt's Gilt was $92, and many dishes carried high supplements. The wine list there included Screaming Eagle at $1,000 a glass. Gilt, indeed, was an appropriate name. At Corton, the three-course prix fixe is $77, and the wine list is priced for a recession. No one would call Corton inexpensive, but it is priced like a restaurant that wants to earn its laurels, rather than one that presumes they are inevitable. Since Montrachet, Drew Nieporent has opened one successful restaurant after another, including Tribeca Grill and the Nobu chain. The man knows how to open restaurants, and he is taking Corton very seriously. He was working the floor on a Saturday night, acting as maitre d' and even busing tables. Originally, I was offered an 8:45 p.m. reservation, which was a bit later than I wanted. When Nieporent had a cancellation, he called me personally that evening to say we could come in early. The cuisine at Corton is still recognizably Liebrandt's-especially his love of beets-but it's a far cry from the Gilt days. This is still luxury cuisine, but he's not packing two dozen ingredients to the square inch, as he did before. If you're familiar with his wilder self, it's impossible to eat at Corton without hoping that the unrestrained Liebrandt will make a comeback. But if Corton is a success, there will be time for that later on. You get a sense for the more laid-back Liebrandt with the amuses-bouches, which are simple and effective (above). The bread service came with two contrasting butters, but the baguettes weren't as soft as I'd like. For the starter, I ordered the Veal Sweetbreads (above left). You can't see it in a photo, but there's a poached egg under there too. After you puncture it, the egg yolk and the sweetbreads combine to pack a terrific flavor punch. Foie Gras (above right) was wrapped in a hibiscus-beet gelee-a typical Liebrandt dish, perfectly executed. Squab (above left) came wrapped in smoked bacon with a chestnut crème and a milk foam. This was a beautiful dish, though I can also imagine that a certain critic might complain about the hockey puck-sized fillets on the plate. The preparation was first-rate, but some might prefer to see visual evidence that this actually came from a bird. The Filet of Black Angus Beef (above right) was the rare example of beef in a non-steakhouse restaurant that is actually worthwhile, even though the prepration seems comparatively simple. Yes, there are beets on that plate too, with an Oxtail confit. Robert Truitt's desserts are wonderful. I'm afraid I didn't take note of the palate cleanser (above left). We had the 'Crème Cake' with amaretto, orange, and vanilla-tamarind (above right) and the cheese selection (below right), and the meal concluded with an impressive selection of petits-fours. The legendary Montrachet wine list, sadly, was auctioned off a couple of years ago, and sommelier Elizabeth Harcourt had to start from scratch. Its current incarnation certainly can't match the old one, but there are some impressive bargains here. Two full pages headed \"French Country Wines\" feature bottles between $30-60, including plenty, both white and red, below $45. That is practically unheard of these days, especially in a restaurant at this price range. At $75 and under, you'll have plenty of options. Indeed, though I told her I was willing to spend that much, she recommended a 2006 Lirac at just $50. That is the largest gap I can remember between my budget and a sommelier's suggestion. It shows that Corton is serious about earning repeat business with a wine program that doesn't break the bank. The in-house wine list is only 15 pages, with an additional 25 pages' worth on a \"reserve list\" that is kept offsite, and can only be ordered in advance. Almost all of those wines are priced above what I would spend, even on a special occasion, but keeping them offsite limits diners' flexibility and eliminates the possibility of an impulse buy. Service was polished and confident: you wouldn't think this restaurant is just a month old. The early part of the meal was a bit rushed. We ordered champagne to begin, and we thought we were sending obvious cues that we didn't want to order food instantly. The staff seemed, if anything, a bit nervous that we would feel offended if we were just left alone for a while. The restaurant was about 80% full-not bad, but probably not where they want to be on a Saturday night. Liebrandt is a first-class talent, in in Drew Nieporent he has a partner who knows how to steer a restaurant through a recession. Let's hope they get the recognition they deserve.

The English chef Fergus Henderson is in town this weekend, giving New Yorkers a chance to sample his renowned \"nose to tail\" cooking. He's working tonight at The Spotted Pig (menu here), and tomorrow at Momofuku Noodle Bar (menu here). I dropped in on the Pig earlier this evening. I was fearful of an intolerable wait, but I was there at 5:00, they opened the kitchen at 5:30, and I was seated at 6:00. (I drank a couple of beers in the meantime.) The man at the table next to mine, who seemed to be a Fergus groupie, said that last year's wait was much worse. For those into celebrity spotting, I saw Anne Burrell and Tom Colicchio. I've no eye for that kind of thing, so I probably missed a dozen others. The menu included such Henderson specialties as Roasted Bone Marrow, Ox Tongue, Devilled Kidney on Toast, and Deep Fried Rabbit. All of those looked interesting, but I started with the Pressed Pig's Ears ($16; above left)- basically a terrine, fatty and gelatinous. Fat, indeed, was the order of the day. Pot-Roast Bacon, Trotter & Prune ($28; above right) was also a plate full of fat, which is not a bad thing, but one must accept it for what it is. I wasn't quite as enthusiastic about a side of Roasted Parsnips in Duck Fat ($7; above left), which seemed too slimy; or a slice of Walnut, Chocolate & Amaretto cake ($8; above right), which was too dry. In fairness, the latter is a standard Spotted Pig dessert, and had nothing to do with Henderson's presence. This was my second visit to the Spotted Pig (earlier report here). For a place that's a gussied-up pub, the service is impressive. The server was well schooled about the unusual, one-time-only menu. Amidst a crush of humanity, they were still willing to transfer my bar tab to the table, and my napkin was refolded each time I got up to visit the washroom. The special menu's signature item was a Half Pig's Head for 2, for $55 (above). The man next to me ordered this all for himself, as his companion was having none of it. As he dug in, he said to her, \"I'll let you know when I get to the meat; so far, it's all skin and fat.\" By the time I left, he had dismembered most of the head, but skin and fat were all he found. I must say, it looked pretty good, but not to the point that I'd eat one all by myself. Was it a revelation? No. But it was fun to try a couple of things that no one else in town is serving. The couple next to me was planning to follow Fergus to Momofuku Noodle Bar tomorrow night. I don't think I can ingest that much fat two nights in a row.

Inside Park at St. Barts wins this season's award for the oddest restaurant location: the former chapter house of the landmarked neo-Byzantine St. Bartholomew's Church on Park Avenue. Folks, you must visit this restaurant. It is crazily good. Oh, and the space is gorgeous too. Former Savoy sous chef Matthew Weingarten serves a locavore, greenmarket-driven menu. That's hardly an original idea, but everything is beautifully done. My face lit up when fresh bread, soft herb butter and a bowl of pickled vegetables arrived at the table. When they get the butter right, you're usually in for a good evening. The menu offers a selection of 14 \"simple plates\" from $4.50-8, or you can get any three for $18: things like beets and poppy cream, smoked beef tongue, smoked black cod, torched mackerel and quince. We gave those a pass, but they look promising if you're just there to nosh. Conventional appetizers are in the $10-16 range, entrees $26-32, side dishes $7. Smoked Country Sausage ($12; above left) with heirloom apples and cabbage was one of the more enjoyable home-made sausage dishes we've had this season. Crispy Breast of Lamb ($16; above right) was a clever starter, with the lamb lightly fried with a black walnut chutney. You don't see Walleye Pike ($28; above left) on many menus. It was perfect here-the skin crisp, the flesh tender and moist. The vegetables were first-rate as well, with creamed cauliflower, raddicchio, caper and egg. Chicken ($26; above right) was also faultless, the kind you wish you could have every day. The accompaniments here were roasted artichoke, farro and marjoram. We don't normally order dessert, but we had to try the Lavender Goat Cheese Souffle ($14; above left), which was as good as it sounds. The meal ended with small petits-fours. Service was faultless. For a six-week-old restaurant, Inside Park seems to be running about as smoothly as could be. Unfortunately, it looks like this restaurant could be in for a tough time. On a Friday evening, it appeared to be no more than 10% full. The neighborhood isn't known for nightlife, so it will need strong word-of-mouth to attract diners to a destination they wouldn't normally seek. We can only hope they'll succeed. This is one of the best mid-priced restaurants we've visited in quite some time.

Picholine is 15 years old, and to \"celebrate\" they were offering a $50 gift card via the website. That's a nice chunk of change, even for a restaurant this expensive. And I suppose the offer (which is no longer available) shows that it's getting harder to find customers in these recession-challenged times. Sure enough, when my mom and I dropped in for a pre-opera meal, Picholine was as quiet as I've ever seen it-not deserted, but nowhere near full. Apparently, chef-owner Terrance Brennan is not yet tempted to lower his prices. Since our last visit, earlier this year, the three-course prix fixe has risen from $85 to $92, while the tasting menu has risen from $110 to $125. A game tasting menu, offered only in the fall, is $145. I wouldn't mind giving that a try at some point, but this wasn't the night for it. The mauve decor made a better impression than it did last time; perhaps it's more successful in the front room than in the rear. Just about everything about the service and ambiance seemed pitch-perfect, though it helped that the restaurant was less crowded than I've seen it before. My mom couldn't get over how many servers and runners were buzzing around. A quartet of amuses-bouches was more impressive than the trio we were offered last time. I didn't note them all, but the one on the right (above) was a tempura mushroom on a skewer. A Tuna Cru \"Napoleon\" (above left) with olive oil ice cream was just fine, but unmemorable. My mom had the Sea Urchin Panna Cotta (above right), which is one of the best things on the menu. The server recited a choice of four Scottish game birds-partridge, grouse, quail and Mallard duck. (He did not mention the $8 supplement.) I had the duck, which was really terrific-tender and gamey, along with a crunchy leg confit. My mom had a fish, which I believe was the John Dory (above right). From the small taste I had, it seemed pedestrian. My mom didn't use that word, but she agreed the duck was better. The palate cleansers were served in an odd order. As I was having the cheese course, but my mom was not, hers came before the dessert (above left), but mine came after it. Anyhow, the cheese cart (above right) is always the highlight of a meal at Picholine. I told the fromagier that I wanted three cheeses with sharp tastes, soft to medium in texture, and at least one blue cheese. And that's exactly what he gave me (above left). My mom's dessert was a chocolate something-or-other (above right). My palate cleanser (above left) came after the cheese course, and that was followed by petits-fours, which we did not touch (above right). They sent us home with a complimentary bottle of olive oil, which I do not recall from previous visits. The wine list here is wonderful, though it seemed shorter than I remembered it. Anyhow, I found a perfectly drinkable Guigal Côtes du Rhone for $45. After you figure in the $50 gift card, it basically means we had a great dinner at Picholine and drank for free. Not bad.

I always book French restaurants when my mother is in town. Last weekend, we looked in on Le Perigord, one of the city's few remaining grandes dames of classic French cuisine. My last visit was over a Memorial Day weekend, when I found it a bit deserted and dowdy, though still worthy and essential. This time, on a more typical Friday night, we found business a bit more brisk-though it was not full. And the decor doesn't seem quite as dowdy as it did last time. Actually, it doesn't seem that way at all, though they're long overdue to fix a tiny hole in the ceiling, which as I recall was there last time too. At a restaurant this old, strengths and weaknesses aren't likely to change rapidly. The bread service remains unimpressive, and it comes with cold, hard butter-just like last time. The menu is a $65 prix fixe-just like last time. The menu doesn't change much, nor does it need to, but there are seasonal specials. My girlfriend ordered the cold hors d'oeuvres (above left), which for most people would be a meal in itself. I loved the vegetable tart (above right) in a tangy butter sauce. My mom had the oysters (below left). My mom and my girlfriend both chose the roasted duck. The kitchen will serve a portion for one, but when it's ordered for two, they present the whole bird and carve it tableside (above right & below left). I had the elk (above right), an off-menu special, which was excellent. It had a wonderful gamey flavor, though the accompanying rib was a bit tough. The desserts we chose were fairly simple, but no less effective for that: a blueberry cream tart or the same in raspberry, both with a large dollop of fresh cream. Most critics in town don't give credit for classics done well, as if it requires no particular talent to execute the same recipes for decades. Yet, over and over again we see new restaurants serving the old favorites, and falling flat on their faces. Just because it's classic doesn't make it easy. Le Perigord continues to get it right, and for that it gets three stars. Now, if only they'd do something about that cold butter.

***CONTENT
Brasserie Cognac is one of several classic French restaurants that have opened in the last year. I am not quite sure where the idea comes from. I haven't seen any great demand for the genre, and the city's major critics routinely remind us that no one wants it. Still, it persists, and I'm one of those who hopes it always will. I had high hopes for Brasserie Cognac based on a promising early visit six months ago. Last weekend, I went back with the whole family. The restaurant isn't exactly drawing crowds. It was practically empty at 6:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening-not a great sign for a place that ought to be pulling in pre-theater diners. Alas, I can't say the pre-theater folk are missing much. Brasserie Cognac does a few things well, but it's too inconsistent. Those of us who favor classic French cuisine can do better elsewhere. A tomato tart with goat cheese (above left) was the best thing we had, with a crisp, thin crust like pizza. My girlfriend and my son both had the French onion soup (above right), which came out not quite warm enough. For the main course, my son and my girlfriend both had the Blanquette de Veau, or veal stew (above left). Like the onion soup, it came out cold, and had to be sent back. Pot-au-feu, or beef with vegetables, was the daily special (above right). The beef was tender and rare inside, but there was a certain laziness about both this and the Blanquette de Veau. Both dishes seemed dull. The broths and vegetables had a cafeteria quality to them. My mom had the Moules Frittes (mussels with fries), and the kitchen at least got that right. The bread service was mediocre, with butter so hard it was practically unspreadable. Brasserie Cognac undermines itself in other ways. The space is gorgeous, clearly the result of a not inconsiderable investment. Why, then, do they play generic pop elevator music out of the loudspeakers? If they're trying to create the feeling of an authentic French brasserie, why not take it seriously? There's a wide range of prices, but there are plenty of appetizers and salads under $15, entrees under $30, and wine bottles under $50-though, of course, you can spend more. If the food were more reliable, Brasserie Cognac could easily be a go-to place for the neigborhood. My girlfriend had a good summary of the meal: \"You know, these dishes may be classics, but it's still hard to get them right.\" Brasserie Cognac (1740 Broadway at 55th Street, West Midtown) Food: UnevenService: Would be fine, if only the food were warm enoughAmbiance: Nice looking, but no buzz; needs a new soundtrackOverall: Satisfactory (no stars)

Dovetail opened last year to rapturous reviews. When we visited in March, I couldn't quite decide if it deserved all those laurels. I gave it 2½ stars, half-a-star lower than the major critics did. We were back this evening for Dovetail's \"Sunday Suppa,\" a three-course meal for just $38. If the food were as good as the critics say, this would be one of the best deals in town. Unfortunately, I had the same reaction as last time: excellent appetizers let down by disappointing entrees. Pastry chef Vera Tong's wonderful desserts offered partial redemption. I also have the same reaction to the atmosphere. At times, Dovetail acts like it wants to be a three-star restaurant, but it doesn't carry out the act thoroughly or consistently enough to deserve it. I was also dismayed to find almost no red wines below $50-and those I did find were both young and obscure. I settled on a 2005 bottle of the seldom-seen Irouleguy appellation from the south of France, at $49, which they then proceeded to charge at $51 (they corrected the bill when I pointed this out). This is definitely a wine list that has not caught up to the recession. Dovetail is still doing brisk business, but it's not as busy as it was six months ago. I was able to reserve a 6:30 p.m. table just a few days in advance. Still, you can't just walk in at prime time. When we left, at around 8:30 p.m., they had just turned a party away. The meal started well. The amuse-bouche (above) was a sliver of smoked salmon wrapped around a horseradish filling. The bread service was the same terrific cornbread that Dovetail has been serving since the beginning. All three appetizers were first-rate: an Asparagus Veloute with cream and bacon (above left), Mushroom Risotto (above center), and Sweetbreads (above right). Among the entrees, Lamb Meatloaf (above left) was the least objectionable, but it was a bit dry. Loin of Pork (above center), served off the bone, was too tough. Prime Rib (above right) had to be sent back, as it was too rare. It came back rubbery; adding insult to injury, it carried a $12 supplement. We had no complaint about the desseerts-a French Toast-like confection (above left) with enough butter and cream to be a meal in itself, Carrot Cake (above right) and sorbet (not pictured). The level of accomplishment in the appetizers and desserts makes us wonder how the entrees could be as off-key as they were, but we've been underwhelmed by them twice, so we're bound to conclude it's a chronic problem. The kitchen probably turns out some great main courses (the talent is obviously there), but it hasn't happened on either of our visits.

Update: A commenter (below) says that the prix fixe was for two days only, and that the original menu has returned. We have not been by to see if this is so. Besides that, \"Restaurant Week\" specials typically do not supersede the entire menu of the restaurant. * * * In my review of David Bouley's new restaurant Secession, I suggested that \"about half this menu needs to be jettisoned.\" Bouley has done a lot more: he has thrown out practically all of it. As of last night, Secession is serving a $45 prix fixe. I walked by the restaurant this afternoon and had a look. There are now just 7 appetizers, 6 entrees (all served with a pot of Tuscan fries for the table) and 4 desserts. That compares to last week's menu, which had more than 25 appetizers and 25 entrees. I didn't note every item on the new menu, but the available entrees include chicken, Wiener Scnitzel, and Spaghetti Carbonara. The long charcuterie menu has been reduced to just one pâte. The menu is headed, \"A Preview in Collaboration with Zagat.\" You can't make this stuff up. I don't suggest for a second that my review had anything to do with it, but there are enough terrible ones out there that Bouley clearly needed to do something-fast. With this more limited menu, he can now focus on the basics, as he should have done in the first place. Calling it \"a preview\" keeps the critics out,\" or at least might persuade them to be gentle.

As was suggested on MF, the Zagat collaboration menu was planned in advance, originally under the reservation code \"Zagat Presents\" or something of the sort. So, you can't really fault them for that offering in itself.Now that they've scrapped, for now, the entire a la carte menu, however, well that's much more interesting. We'll see if it comes back after this promotional period with Zagat is over.

Bouley's new restaurant called Secession featured a two day promotional menu called \"A Preview in Collaboration with Zagat.\" The items were pre-fix for the event, much like what establishments do during \"Restaurant Week\". The menu is currently back to it's original format and will be adjusted for seasonal ingredients.

Note: Bloomingdale Road has closed, after four months in business and mostly mediocre reviews. Correction: The Timesreports that the restaurant remains open with a limited menu, but Chef Ed Witt has left, and the owner is trying to renegotiate the lease. Coda: After failing to negotiate a more favorable lease, Bloomingdale Road closed on Saturday, February 7. Bloomingdale Road opened about a month ago on the Upper West Side in the former Aix Brasserie space. Chef Ed Witt was last seen at Varietal, where he was roundly panned by most critics, and was fired shortly after a devastating review from Frank Bruni in the Times. At Bloomingdale Road, Witt abandons some of the more absurd flights of fancy that doomed Varietal. This is still a thinking-man's menu, but with a comfort food soul that goes right for the gut. Among our two appetizers and two entrees there wasn't a single disappointment, or anything remotely close to it. I am not ready to call this destination cuisine, but if you're in the neighborhood this has got to be one of the better options. So far, the neighborhood agrees. The large, tri-level space is doing a brisk business. The vibe is casual (but check out the funky chandeliers), and the menu is sensibly priced for a recession economy. There are snacks ($5-9), Soups & Salads ($7-17), Small Plates & Sandwiches ($10-16), Pastas ($17-19), Mains ($18-24) and Sides ($5-8). There's an ample selection of 23 wines by the glass, and the there are plenty of decent bottles under $50, including the Rhone blend we had for $42. The menu says that items are designed to be shared, though it's not clear which selections that applies to. My pork chop, for instance, didn't seem to be any more obviously shareable than any other pork chop I've seen. Gael Greene's review mentioned that several of the supposedly shareable items come in threes, which is not a wise strategy, as most tables have even numbers of customers. Shareable dishes should come in twos or fours; never threes. For a large, fairly new casual restaurant, service was attentive and impressive. A manager was making the rounds, and it appeared he stopped at just about every table to ask how things were going. Meals start with a delicious Parker House roll, with soft creamy butter. The roll is cooked in a tin can, which the server delivers to your table and turns upside down. I must admit the roll's phallic shape didn't occur to me at the time, but it was rather apparent when I looked at the photo the next morning. We started with two items from the \"Small Plates\" section of the menu. The terrific House Made Sausage ($10; above left) is made with smoked pork and jalapeno, topped with cheddar, white beans & chips. We also loved the Duck Confit Parfait ($14; above right), served in a glass jar with brandied cherries poured in at tableside. This is a larger portion than it appears in the photo. It came with three slices of round toast for spreading; we asked for three more, and they came quickly. For the size of the portion, they should just send out six pieces of toast with every order. There was nothing fancy in either of our entrees, but both were done just right, and this is no small accomplishment in a kitchen turning out as much food as this one. I could find no fault in the Chicken ($22; above left) or the Pork Chop ($24; above right), with cheese grits and caramelized apples. One never knows what the future will hold, but if Ed Witt can keep the kitchen operating at this level, Bloomingdale Road should be an Upper West Side hit.

***CONTENT
Note: Secession has closed. It will be replaced with a Japanese concept called Brushstroke, supposedly by the end of 2009 (but don't hold your breath). David Bouley has been a busy guy. He has something like seven restaurant projects going right now. We're not talking about seven stable, business-as-usual restaurants, but seven in a state of flux. And we're not talking about seven clones, but seven very different concepts. The obvious question is whether he can keep so many balls in the air, or if some of them-indeed, perhaps all-are going to land with an embarrassing thud. So far, we have the answer for one of these: Secession, which just opened, replacing Danube. THUD. There is plenty of time to right the ship, but Secession needs a lot of work. With his next project, the new flagship Bouley, set to open next week, when will he have time to fix Secession, which right now is beyond mediocre? It is not merely flawed execution-though there is plenty of that-but an absurd concept. The menu has practically as many options as a diner. It is more than any restaurant could expect to do well. And as one food board participant noted, they are almost sure to be always running out of things. If there's to be any semblence of consistency, about half this menu needs to be jettisoned. Perhaps they are heading in that direction. Last night, there were marginally fewer items offered than on the menu that I posted a couple of weeks ago. But it is still far too much, with something like 25 entrees and an equal number of appetizers in multiple categories. I mean, spaghetti carbonara and shrimp kebabs? They seem to be just phoned in. The menu, printed on a huge broadsheet, is also unwieldy to handle at the small tables. The prices, at least, aren't exorbitant. Almost all of the appetizers are below $15, and most of the entrees are $25 or less. Steaks range from $21 (skirt steak) to $32 (sirloin), but if they're aged prime, as the menu says, that's a pretty good deal. Nearly all of the wines are below $100, with many good choices below $50. The brasserie menu and befuddled service are at war with the surroundings. Danube's faux Klimt interior has been retained, which was a wise move, as this is still one of the most gorgeous rooms in town. It still feels like it should be a three-star restaurant, though it most certainly isn't. Chairs and banquettes are comfortable, but our table wobbled. About halfway through, the server came by and stuck a piece of cardboard under one of the legs. The charcuterie section of the menu offers nine homemade terrines, pâtes and boudins (sausages), all $11. We ordered two of those, and then waited. And waited. It made no sense, as these items are obviously pre-made. There was bread service, but it was stale. This was hard to figure, as the bread just next door, at Bouley, has always been excellent. The boudin noir, or blood sausage (above left), comes with six different garnishes, but this isn't clear on the menu, and our server was at a loss to explain it. Apparently they were out of one garnish, and had substituted another. Or something. For all that, it was pretty good. The Terrine du Chef (above right) had a flat, dull taste, and came out too cold, as if it had been in the fridge all day. The accompanying bread was again stale. One of the more unusual menu items is Baby Goat; they were out of it, but didn't bother to tell us this when the menus were handed out. I was offered Baby Lamb instead ($25; above left). It was presented in a cast-iron skillet, but I thought they'd serve it out onto a plate. Instead, they just left it for me to eat directly from the skillet, which was a bit wobbly. The kitchen did a respectable job with the lamb, but the potatoes underneath it were greasy and stuck to the pan. I had asked the server to recommend a side dish. He suggested the mac 'n' cheese, or technically \"Grandmother's Pasta and Cheesse Gratin\" ($9; above center). Perhaps a better name is \"supermarket pasta elbows.\" They were too watery and not cheesy enough. My girlfriend had the Skirt Steak ($21; above right). Apparently it was supposed to come with sauce, but the server forgot it; we did too, till we re-checked the menu afterwards. The steak itself was tender and nicely seasoned, but the accompanying schmear of what looked like mashed potatoes wasn't any good at all. It also came with fries, which were soggy and limp. A runner asked what was wrong with them, and we told him. \"I'll tell the manager,\" he said. Instead, our waiter came back and said, \"Sorry about the fries.\" At another table, the fries weren't delivered till after everyone had finished their entrees. Earlier in the evening, we'd had drinks at the bar, which they offered to transfer to our dinner tab. When the bill arrived, they weren't on it. I'd like to think they were making up for the fries, but I doubt it. Surely, in that case, a manager would have come over and said something. I think they're just discombobulated. We pointed out the apparent error. The server just said, \"Forget about it.\" The dinner crowd was an eclectic mix. For the first part of the evening, the average age of the room was definitely over 50, but it got younger as time went on. The staff can't decide what atmosphere they want in the dining room. Lighting levels were adjusted three times during the course of our meal. The full menu is also available at the bar. It has several comfortable tables, and a number of people seemed to be dining there by choice. It was standing-room-only by the time we left. The dining room was never full, though it got close by the time we left, a bit after 8:00 p.m. Curiously, we were seated right next to a party of six, even though the restaurant was nearly empty when we arrived. About half-way through our meal, another party of two was seated right next to us, though there were a good dozen other two-tops with no one else around. Spreading people out when the dining room is empty is a pretty basic service concept, not yet mastered here. There's no reason Secession couldn't be a great restaurant, but it isn't right now. Too many basic things misfire. The staff is too confused. David Bouley needs to cut down the menu to about half of its currrent length, and the front-of-house needs a serious kick in the shins. If there's any silver lining, it's that the prices are low, and that encourages a re-visit. If I hear that things have improved, I'll drop by again one evening and dine at the bar.

I dropped into Bar Boulud last night for a pre-opera snack. The tables were all full at around 7:00 p.m., but there were a few seats available at the communal table (far left in the above photo).The menu offered at the communal table seems to be abbreviated, but I quickly settled on one of the warm charcuterie specialties, the Saucisse Fumée Façon \"Morteau\" ($16), or smoked cumin-spiced sausage on a lentil stew. For what it was, this dish was about perfect. I could eat like this every day.As I observed last time, service here is helter-skelter. Servers do a first-class job when you have their attention, but getting it isn't so easy, as there aren't enough of them to go around, especially in the frantic pre-theater hour.But the kitchen still seems to have its act together, which is more than you can say for many a Lincoln Center restaurant. Despite its faults, we are lucky to have Bar Boulud in our midst.Bar Boulud (1900 Broadway near 63rd Street, Upper West Side)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

For years, I've been reading about the \"other\" Little Italy on Arthur Avenue, in the Bronx. It's supposed to be less of a tourist trap. The food is supposed to be better. Last weekend, with my son in town, we visited the legendary Roberto. The restaurant has been in a lovely townhouse on Crescent Street, just steps away from the main drag on Arthur Avenue, since 1989, when it was Tony & Roberto's. In 1993, Times critic Molly O'Neil awarded one star. A few years later, brother Tony went back to Salerno, leaving Roberto Paciullo in charge by himself—still stopping by every table to ask how your meal was. From most parts of the city, it is not especially easy to get here by mass transit. Fortunately, we live close by the George Washington Bridge Bus Terminal in Washington Heights, where you can catch the Bx36 bus to the corner of Bathgate Avenue and E. 180th Street. That still leaves you about eight blocks away, and you'd best have a map with you unless you already know the area. The closest subway stop, 182nd–183rd Streets on the D line, leaves you with a good 15–20 minutes' walk. Roberto does not take reservations except for large parties, and if you arrive at prime times you have a long wait ahead. We got there around 5:30 p.m. on a Saturday, and it was already nearly full. The hostess said she could seat us downstairs, which didn't sound so good, but was actually a blessing. We were in a small, quiet room with about 6 tables, dominated by a long wine wall with hundreds of rare bottles, mostly magnums and double-magnums. Two hours later, when we left, the main dining room upstairs was noisier than a train statin at rush hour. The menu is long, and on top of it the server recited a dozen or more specials. Naturally, by the time he'd finished his lecture we'd forgotten at least half of them. We got the sense that large portions were coming, so we settled on one antipasto, two pastas and two entrées to share amongst three people. That turned out to be about right. We started with a good spicy Cotechino ($14), or Italian pork sausage, with spinach and cannellini beans. Both of our pastas were specials. There were tender Agnolotti ($21) filled with goat cheese and braised short rib; and Fettuccini with a short rib ragoût ($25). I don't think we actually meant to order short rib twice, but that's what happens when recited specials go whizzing by too fast. My son made short work of Pollo Affumi ($21), or chicken with prosciutto and mozzarella, while we shared a tender Lamb Shank Ossobucco ($26). None of the savory courses came out quite warm enough. Dishes weren't heated before the food was plated, and they cooled a bit on the way from kitchen to table. The captain served us family-style, but anything left cooled quickly, since the original plates weren't warm. Silverware was not replaced after our first course, but it was after our second. Dessert was, I believe, a terrific almond cake with cinammon ice cream, which the three of us shared. (It's the only food photo I took that is worth publishing.) The wine list doesn't seem to have any bargains, but we got a perfectly respectable 2003 Villa Puccini Chianti Riserva for $44. I have no idea if we got the best, the worst, or the average performance for this restaurant. With such a sprawling menu and 240 covers a night, it's inevitable there will be highs and lows. Everything was solid here, but the food was somewhat let down by the service. Still, it was a fun evening, and we'll probably try it again sometime.

Note: Click here for a review of FergusStock at The Spotted Pig. Click here for a review of the famous burger. The Spotted Pig has been packing in West Village diners more-or-less continuously since it opened 4½ years ago. The tiny gastropub doesn't take reservations, and waits of an hour or more are legion. I generally avoid such places, so the Spotted Pig and I were making do without each other till last Friday. That day, I realized that if I left work at 5:00 p.m. and headed straight for the Pig, I'd be there when they opened, and would probably get a seat. It worked...and the food was good enough that I just mighty try it again. And again. The English chef, April Bloomfield, has stints at London's River Cafe and Berkeley's Chez Panisse on her C.V. It was enough to impress Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich and Ken Freeman (who are all investors). It was enough to impress Eric Asimov of the Times, who delivered a rave in $25 & Under. And it was enough to impress the Michelin inspectors, who gave the Pig a star, which it has held four years in a row. Frank Bruni awarded one star in 2006, though in his four-star system that isn't quite as much of a compliment. Regardless of the merits, read the Asimov and Bruni pieces, and it's as clear as can be which one should be reviewing restaurants, and which one is an imitator. Mind you, I think one star (in Timesspeak) is about right for this place-but not when you've awarded two to so many other mediocre ones, as Bruni has done. But let's get back to the Spotted Pig, where eclectic European comfort food comes in four sizes: bar snacks ($3-7.50), appetizers ($14-18), entrees ($17-32) and side dishes ($7-10). If you're a vegetarian, a plate of five sides is $24. Except for the acclaimed roquefort cheeseburger ($17; the most popular dish), the entrees are all $25 and higher, and there are three that sell for $32. At these prices, one might resent the loud and crowded pub space, seating on backless stools, and a no-reservations policy. But for almost five years now, the verdict of the dining public is that it's worth it. Sheep's Milk Ricotta Gnudi with Brown Butter & Sage ($15) have been on the menu from the beginning, and one can see why. They're soft, delicate, rich, and just heavenly: surely one of the top ten appetizers in town. I got a little more adventurous for the entree: Lamb Crepinette with lamb kidneys and black-eyed peas ($29). Braised lamb shoulder was stuffed in a sausage casing, covered in diced kidneys and a heavy, dark sauce. The kidney taste was a bit overpowering, but the tender shoulder had a bright, strong flavor. Service was impressive for a place that was so busy. The server had a lot of tables to cover, but she never lost track of me. The entree took about 45 minutes to come out, but she comped a glass of wine and a serving of olives & almonds as partial recompense. I wasn't in any hurry, and didn't mind. The menu is reprinted daily and changes frequently: there were five specials written on the board, including that crepinette. Perhaps I was one of the first to try it, which could explain the long delay. There probably aren't many customers demanding lamb kidney. I might not order it again, but it wasn't bad, and I give Bloomfield credit for venturing beyond the obvious. Bloomfield has every right to be distracted: her seafood restaurant, The John Dory, originally scheduled for the spring, remains under construction, with a promised October opening very much in doubt. But Bloomfield was in the Spotted Pig on Friday night, running the kitchen as she's done for the last five years. It is very much a contradiction, with the food a level or two above the pub surroundings in which it is served.

It looks like the soap opera at Mai House is over. Eater has the news today that David Lee, a former sous chef at Bar Room at the Modern, will be behind the stoves. We were big fans of Mai House under founding chef Michael Bao Huynh. Top Chef's Spike Mendelsohn replaced him, and Top Chef's Lisa Hernandes replaced Spike. Neither one figured to be a permanent figure, and owner Drew Nieporent wasn't going to let the place drift for long. Lee comes in with serious cred. He plans \"serious menu changes,\" with about half the dishes to be replaced by sometime in November. We'll give Lee a few weeks to get out the kinks before dropping in for a look-see.

My 13-year-old son travels to see me two weekends a month. All U.S. airlines will accept unaccompanied minors—that is, children traveling alone—starting at the age of 5. However, the rules and fees keep changing to parents' detriment. It used to be that children 12 and over could travel on most airlines \"as adults,\" without payment of a fee. You would normally be charged $50 each way for children under 12, though JetBlue, the airline we used most often, charged nothing extra. A few years ago, JetBlue started charging $25 each way; then, they raised it to $50, and later to $75. I couldn't wait for my son to turn 12. Just as he did, they raised the cutoff age to 13. And just as he turned 13, they raised it to 14. Many airlines have now raised the cutoff age to 15, and some are charging as much as $100 each way, which practically doubles the cost of the ticket. You might have understood the change if it had happened after 9/11, but for several years after that the normal cutoff age remained at 12. I have to think that the airlines are changing because they need the money, not out of any newly-discovered concern for children's safety. Now, I don't really mind when airlines charge extra for things that actually have value. It may be inconvenient that the second suitcase that used to travel free, now entails an excess baggage fee. And it may seem nitpicky that many airlines now charge for meals and snacks that used to be free. But food and luggage really do cost money. The costs may be egregious in relation to what you get, but at least there's a connection. But the airlines don't do anything for unaccompanied minors traveling on nonstop flights. Basically, they provide an escort up and down the jetway—which they also do for wheelchair passengers, without charging extra—and that's it. They don't have any extra staff at the gate or on the plane. The don't do anything to earn their fee. As I paid Delta airlines $100 one-way for my frequent-flying son to be walked down the jetway, there was one word that came to mind: Theft. The airlines have now been reduced to stealing from their customers. How sad.

The Greek tragedy that is Country continues. Geoffrey Zakarian ran his top-tier three-star restaurant into the ground. The gorgeous upstairs dining room is now closed indefinitely, supposedly to re-open as Country Steak sometime next year. Don't all yawn at once. The downstairs cafe is now in the hands of Blake Joyal, who replaced Willis Loughhead, who replaced Doug Psaltis. A friend was staying in the area, and I was curious to see what has become of the cafe, so I made a reservation. I wasn't pleased with the cafe the first time I visited, but that was nearly three years ago, and Country was a very different place. Today, it feels like a hotel lounge-which it basically is. \"A lot's changed,\" said a sullen bartender. He didn't sound pleased. I was surprised to find that the menu is reprinted daily, which suggests that Chef Joyal isn't just phoning it in. The menu might not be adventurous, but at least it isn't cast in stone. There are nine appetizers ($11-18), ten entrees ($18-39) and five sides ($8-9): a reasonable compass that a good kitchen should be able to manage. Except for the dry-aged sirloin ($39), entrees are all in the mid-twenties or lower. The Cafe at Country was never the most comfortable place to eat, but it is not doing much business, so you'll get a good table. The bartender clearly preferred to be somewhere else, but at the table our server was friendly and efficient. A warm mixed bean salad ($14; above left) was respectable, but I didn't detect much of the cured pork belly that was supposed to be lurking under those green leaves. Brased shortribs ($26; above right) were acceptable, but not as tender as they should be. I didn't note my companions' entrees, but both of them raved about an onion soup appetizer ($14). As of now, the Cafe at Country is serving above-average hotel food, but it's a far cry from what this wonderful restaurant was once capable of.

Secession opened this week. It's the successor to the late lamented Danube, David Bouley's tribute to Austrian cuisine that closed two months ago. The faux Klimmt décor survives, and it gives the restaurant its name. You might think that \"secession\" refers to the American Civil War, but it's actually an Austrian art movement, of which Klimmt was a part. The cuisine here is mostly that of a French brasserie, with a nod to Austria (Wiener Schnitzel remains from the Danube days), and another nod to Italy via consulting chef Cesare Casella. It says on the door, \"Breakfast Lunch Dinner.\" (You can only barely see that in the photo on the left.) Breakfast and lunch haven't started yet. I worry about the sprawling menu, which seems to offer a bit of everything. The charcuterie could be impressive, but it's not available till October 13th. As one poster noted on Mouthfuls, \"they offer six different preparations of boudin noir alone. How much boudin noir are they planning to sell?\" Our reservation is a week from Friday. In the meantime, we offer you the menu (click on the image for a larger version):

was there last thursday, 9 october. terrific food--true mark of a bouley restaurant. the mussel broth was sublime. my steak came with a truly marvelous poivre sauce. wine was reasonable priced. service, however, left much to be desired. waitstaff, while amiable, was borderline three stooges.

Note: Archipelago closed in December 2008 after about two months in business. Either the space or the food was doomed. Take your pick. The owners claim they will be re-opening with \"an exciting new menu.\" We'll see about that. I'm not a believer in \"cursed\" restaurant spaces, but the new restaurant Archipelago threatens to challenge that view. It occupies the space that was formerly home to the doomed Dani, a pretty good Italian place that couldn't attract diners to the cavernous gloom of Hudson Square, the dead patch of land west of Varick Street between Houston and Canal Streets. It's not that a serious restaurant couldn't draw people to this neighborhood. But it would need to be serving \"destination cuisine\" - the kind of food people go out of their way for. Archipelago tries to make the case for Japanese-French fusion cuisine, but it fails. The chef here is Hisanobu Osaka, who was the sous chef at Morimoto. With such a pedigree, who'd have thought the food would be so awful? Maybe we just missed the boat, but this was the most mediocre meal we've had in quite some time-a real disaster at the price. Can an Eater Deathwatch be far off? The menu is divided into three sections, not counting dessert: starters ($12-18), mains ($20-32) and shokuji-rice dishes-to conclude ($10). The server advised ordering one of each. This is wise, in that the mains are practically appetizer-sized; but also unwise, as you'll probably be wishing you were somewhere else by the time the last course arrives. Many of the items have French-sounding names but Japanese-sounding ingredients, such as Côte de Boeuf with Yuzu Foam or Carre d'Agneau with Japanese eggplant. Despite occasional nods to France, the \"feel\" of the restaurant is mostly Japanese, and a majority of the patrons seemed to be Asians. Cannelloni ($14; above left) sounded better than it turned out. Cold crabmeat was plated lazily between two cold sheets of cauliflower pasta, with a bland avocado puree on the side and a bizarre crabmeat mini-sandwich at the top of the plate. Crevettes et Canard ($13; above right) offered poached shrimp and smoked duck, both of which tasted like they'd been in the fridge for a week. A dish called Sake ($20; above left) is pan-seared salmon with a tasty tomato and lemon confit under the skin. This was the only dish we had all evening that we liked. It was actually a respectable hunk of fish, skillfully prepared, albeit looking a little lonely on the plate. Côte de Boeuf ($32; above right) may look impressive with yuzu foam on the top, but under the foam were just a few wan slices of cold beef that tasted like the London Broil they serve at a Bar Mitzvah. Risotto ($10: above left) was alleged to contain toro, but it tasted merely like slightly over-cooked rice. But that was a gourmet experience compared with Oshi Zushi, or \"pressed sushi\" ($10; above right), which seemed to be a salmon paste slathered onto hunks of chalky rice. At least the sake was comparatively inexpensive. Bottles of Tamano Hikiri were $30 apiece, and after two of them the food here almost seemed decent. I say \"almost.\" Dinner for two was $172 including tax, but before tip. The space has been lightly redone since the Dani days. It is rather sterile and charmless. The restaurant was only about 3/4 full at prime time on a Saturday evening, which does not bode well for its success. Despite the rather low degree of difficulty in the dishes we tried, the food took a long time to come out. It wasn't worth the wait.

Wow, I was looking forward to this place too. I can't believe how bad some of that looks - the duck and Oshi Zushi in particular.Thanks for sparing us the agony.One note though - \"sake\" actually means salmon in Japanese. And also, what we call sake is usually referred to as Nihonshu in Japan.

***CONTENT
The 2009 Michelin restaurant ratings for New York were announced this morning, with an early sneak peak available from Eater. (See also: press release.) Obvious winners are Masa (promoted to three stars); Gilt (promoted to two); and both Adour and Momofuku Ko (awarded two right out of the gate). Four restaurants got one star in their first year of consideration: Allen & Delancey, Eighty One, Insieme, and Kyo Ya. The latter restaurant was ignored by most critics, including Frank Bruni, but the Michelin folks found it somehow. The other promotions to one star were Alto (which got a new chef) and Public. We've never been impressed at Public, and we're not aware of any intervening event that would have justified a re-evaluation. Fiamma re-gained the star it formerly had, which was taken away last year after a chef change. Restaurants losing their stars include: A Voce (departed chef), Babbo (no obvious reason), Bouley (relocating), Cafe Gray (closed), Country (closed), Danube (closed), Devi (no obvious reason), Kurumazushi (no obvious reason) and Vong (long overdue). Eleven Madison Park remains the most obviously star-worthy restaurant that does not have one. Jewel Bako remains the most obvious candidate for demotion, but the Michelin inspectors seem to like it. The full four-year history of the NYC Michelin ratings is presented below. Promotions are shown in green, demotions in red, ineligible restaurants (closed or opened too late in the year) in gray. A demoted restaurant that still has a star is shown in yellow (that has only happened once).

So only once has a restaurant gone from 3 stars to 2, or from 2 to 1? Wow...
Marc Shepherd
2008-10-06 00:00:00
I suppose there are two reasons for that. The Michelin folks put a lot more scrutiny into the two and three-star places, so it's a status that is less likely to be awarded in borderline cases. Also, those places tend to be a lot more sensitive to their Michelin ratings, and place a high priority on maintaining them.

The ommissions of EMP and Aquavit make Michelin look ridiculous, but I am impressed that they had the good sense and nerve to cut Babbo.

There is no conceivable list of 42 starred restaurants that wouldn’t have some choices that some people find “ridiculous.” Everyone you ask has their own view about which omission (or which inclusion) invalidates the list. But everyone you ask says something different.

The Marshall Stack is a sophisticated Lower East Side bar, named for a brand of guitar amplifier. Hung behind the bar is a photo of The Who's Keith Townshend smashing his guitar on a Marshall Stack. The barely-labeled space is unfancy, but the bartender knows his beers. I counted 42 in all, including 20 on tap. There's even a Sixpoint Craft Obama ale, made in Brooklyn, NY. Who knew there was an Obama tribute beer? I was there early, before the kitchen staff arrived, so I didn't sample any of the food. I was headed off to dinner anyway. But the Marshall Stack is certainly worth another visit. The Marshall Stack (66 Rivington Street at Allen Street, Lower East Side)

***CONTENT
Little Giant is a happy comfort-food place. It was an instant sensation when it opened four years ago on the Lower East Side, and it has more-or-less stayed that way. I've been meaning to visit for a long time, but whenever I called for a reservation it always seemed to be full. Frank Bruni awarded one star in early 2005, in a mostly favorable review that was as much about the owners' iPod playlist as it was about the food. One star would be a compliment, if Bruni hadn't awarded two stars to so many uninspiring places. The restaurant has a corner lot in an early 1900s tenemant building. The owners, Julie Taras Wallach and Tasha Garcia Gibson, did the renovation themselves. It has an understated homespun charm. There are 35 seats in the dining room, 5 at the bar. Space is always at a premium in these small spaces not originally designed as restaurants. But Little Giant seems less self-consciously crowded than other restaurants of its ilk, like the Little Owl and Prune. It wears the space well. The owners accurately describe their cuisine as \"refined comfort food,\" using the usual modern buzzwords: \"Seasonal American\" and \"creatively celebrates local farmers and small, artisanal producers.\" Oh, and \"We bicycle to greenmarkets.\" It may sound a little hackneyed, but they do live up to it. The menu features half-a-dozen appetizers ($7–14) and an equal number of entrées ($17–27). Side dishes are $4–8. I was tempted by the \"world-famous\" buttermilk-chive biscuit with honey butter ($4), but the free bread service, with soft, rich butter on the side, offered all the carbs I needed. I loved a simple salid of warm figs, nuts and prosciutto ($15; above left). Chicken liver mousse ($13; above right) was soft and creamy, the liver taste balanced by other ingredients—probably about a half-pound of butter. \"Swine of the Week\" ($25; above left) is a recurring menu item: always pork, but the preparation varies. The offering when we visited was braised pork butt off the bone with barbecue sauce, baked beans and cole slaw. I found this dish successful (though it is hard for braised pork to fail), but my girlfriend found it a bit dry. We agreed that the cole slaw was too bitter. A terrific side dish of mac & cheese ($7; above right) was enormous. It could have been dinner all by itself. It was the best mac & cheese I've tasted in a long time, with a crisp crust and gooey cheddar filling. Frank Bruni's review complained about long waits for food, but that didn't happen to us. However, our reservation was at 6:30 p.m., which is a very early hour in this neighborhood. Most of the tables were empty when we arrived, but most were full (as was the bar) by the time we left, at around 8:00. The owners announced recently that they've signed a lease in Chelsea at Ninth Avenue and 19th Street, for a space that is double the size. The new restaurant, planned for an early 2009 opening, will be called the Tipsy Parson and will feature southern-style comfort food. They'll have a twofold challenge. The first is to ensure that their charming concept maintains its allure when it plays on a bigger stage. And the second is to ensure that Little Giant doesn't lose its edge once it is no longer the owners' only property.

***CONTENT
It has been a while since our last episode of Revolving Door—our periodic coverage of restaurant closings and chef departures. At Fresh, former owner Eric Tevrow was found guilty of tax evasion in December 2007. In July, the new owners hired chef Michael Ferraro, replacing former chef Kento Komoto, who returned to Japan. Just two months later, Ferraro was out, and the restaurant was shuttered. It will become a Puerto Rican restaurant called Sazon, a sister to the uptown Sofrito on 57th & 1st. We liked Fresh, but it never seemed to be full when it needed to be. Sheridan Square bit the dust. The cursed restaurant took forever to open. Gary Robins, the original chef, left after less than two months. His replacement, Franklin Becker, tried gamely to rescue the place, but it finally succumbed after its owners had lost $4 million. We had good first impressions, but it's a bad sign when the chef is gone after six weeks. Some food board participants found the location problematic, but with tons of successful restaurants within a five-block radius, we find it remarkable that the right chef with the right menu couldn't make it here. Django, the midtown 300-seater, closed quietly. Was anyone paying attention? We liked our meal there (way back when), but not enough to consider visiting again. I guess we weren't the only ones.

***CONTENT
For almost five years, I've been wondering...watching...waiting. Masa was there, beckoning, but I knew the expense was staggering—more than most Americans pay for rent. Last week, finally, I decided it was time. The restaurant is named for Masa Takayama, who five years ago closed his famed Los Angeles sushi temple, Ginza Sushiko, and joined Thomas Keller to anchor the Time-Warner Center's \"Restaurant Collection.\" Masa and Keller's Per Se lived up to the hype, with eight New York Times stars and five Michelin stars between them. Other restauranteurs at the venue weren't so lucky (Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Gray Kunz), or failed to open at all (Charlie Trotter). The format here is a three-hour omakase—meaning you're in the chef's hands. The cost? It was $300 when Amanda Hesser reviewed it for the Times in 2004, had risen to $350 six months later, when Frank Bruni awarded four stars, and is now $450—assuming you don't order the Kobe beef, which carries a $100 supplement (we took a pass). Even with a modest alcohol order, dinner for two, including the automatic 20% service charge, was $1,285, including tax. The cost of high-end sushi is surreal. The most exclusive imported fish is expensive no matter where you have it. The omakase at Kurumazushi, which I reviewed two weeks ago, was about the same price, but a lot of the items seemed similar to one another. What is astonishing at Masa is the sheer variety. At Kurumazushi, though, we were served massive chunks of fatty tuna. Masa slices the rare fish into thin slivers. There are just 26 seats—10 at the sushi bar (made from a single slab of hinoki wood) and 16 at the tables. We chose the bar—always a better experience at a sushi restaurant—and were fortunate enough to be at Chef Takayama's station. There were two other sushi chefs at the counter; and behind them, two more preparing hot dishes on a grill. When we arrived, Chef Takayama was in the midst of dismembering a hunk of toro that must have weighed thirty pounds. With a knife sharp enough to shave a mosquito, he patiently peeled apart layer after layer of flesh, separated by thin cartilage membranes. The amount of waste was considerable, though the parts not fit to be served as sushi disappeared into the kitchen, aparently to be used for some other purpose. Masa is camera-shy, and we didn't want to encumber our meal with note-taking. As we reconstructed the meal afterwards, we counted at least 25 items, and it may even have been a bit more than that. There were about a half-dozen appetizers, followed by wave upon wave of sushi. The appetizers were all wonderful, but perhaps the most startling was cold sea bass with chrysanthemum—we actually ate the flower along with the fish. Another winner was a diced fish still in its own skin, with vegetables and spices: \"Eat it all,\" Takayama advised. The other appetizers included a crab salad, toro with caviar, truffle risotto with sea urchin, and miso soup. A list of the sushi courses is practicaly a Who's Who of the sea: toro, fluke, mackerel, clam, octopus, scallop, eel, shrimp, sea urchin, squid, herring—and for several of these, more than one kind. Most of the time, Takayama molds a small wedge of rice, applies a dab of wasabi, lays a slice of fish on top, paints it with soy sauce, then places it on your plate, or if it is too delicate, hands it to you directly. Occasionally, he varies that pattern. One piece came wrapped in a cucumber skin, another in a shiso leaf. One course was a shitake mushroom; another was white truffle. A few items came from the hot station: the chef seared one piece of fish with a hot poker before serving it. Late in the meal, Takayama produced a carcass that looked like it could be a baby lamb's rib cage. He scraped off some meat and served it to us: \"Tuna bone,\" he said. Dessert was a simple bowl of grapefruit granité, which seemed like an anti-climax to the sushi theatrics. Wine (nearly all white) is served by the bottle, sake by the carafe. Compared to the price of the food, it was pretty reasonable. Three different sakes—admittedly, some of the lower priced ones—were only $101 total, which isn't bad when the food was $900. The service team operates quietly and efficiently, setting and clearing so smoothly that you almost don't realize they're there. Serving pieces (different for each course) are practically works of art in themselves. Masa is clearly not a populist experience. At its extravagant price, it clearly cannot be. Yet, even in these tough economic times the restaurant appeared to be doing strong business—though it was not full. We could never be regulars here, but for one night we were happy to invest in Masa's one-of-a-kind splendor. I can't compare it to anything in Japan, but here in New York, Masa is without peer.

I just returned from Japan and I will say that Masa and Urasawa (LA) compare very well to high-end sushi in Japan. The fish in Japan is a level higher but, considering the geographic limitations, these two places are very similar to the Japanese experience.

The 20% service charge does not get distributed to the wait staff. Masa keeps it himself.

Masa is worth the price so long as you can afford to drop $1200+ for a meal for two. Fortunately, NYC is one of the few places on Earth that (still) has a critical mass of people willing to spend that kind of money on an eating experience. Indeed, it is an eating experience. And, indeed, it is worth it (\"worth\" being a relative value/term).If you want an experience that approaches Masa (something of a distant second), I would suggest Sushi Yasuda.

The 2009 New York Michelin ratings announcement are a week or two away. Let the speculation commence! The table below shows the ratings awarded for the last three years. A gray box means the restaurant was not open, or was not open long enough to be rated. A red box means the restaurant was demoted from one star to zero. A green box means the restaurant was promoted or newly starred. A yellow box means the restaurant was demoted, but still retained at least one star.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Matsugen. Last week, a colleague invited me to Matsugen, which I reviewed previously in July. Since then, Matsugen received three stars from Frank Bruni, a judgment that seemed then, and still seems, overly generous. Mind you, Matsugen is a very good restaurant. As Bruni notes, it doesn't pander to Western sensibilities-unlike some of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's other Asian restaurants. But the awful ambiance and an uneven menu are serious drawbacks. My colleague, who has sampled a good cross-section of New York's better restaurants, said, \"I'm finding it hard to believe this got three stars.\" We planned to share two or three appetizers and then finish with soba. One of our choices was the Crab and Japanese Mushroom with Rice in an earthenware pot. The server warned that this is made from scratch and would take 45 minutes. She advised us to order a plate of mixed pickles as a stop-gap. Despite her advice, the pickles came first-and it was altogether too much food. Just like gullible tourists, we had been \"upsold.\" Anyhow, the plate of mixed pickles (above left) was very good, but entirely unnecessary. My colleague was eager to try the pork belly (above right), which had a faint barbecue taste. It was great, but even for two people it was a very large portion, given that pork belly is almost pure fat. Salmon belly (above left) is a recent addition to the menu. Despite the name, the dish seemed to be indistinguishable from any other grilled salmon you've ever tasted, but it was a bit too greasy. Crabs, mushrooms and rice in an earthenware pot (above right) had a strong, earthy flavor, though after a 45-minute wait I expected more of a payoff. These are all large dishes, and we were full at this point. We had over-ordered. But soba was coming. We probably would have enjoyed it more if we had ordered half the number of appetizers. I had the Duck Soup with Inaka noodles (above left). These were the coarsest noodles available, the same as I had last time. Cold noodles with warm duck soup didn't float my boat; your mileage may vary. The duck seemed over-cooked and flavorless. I believe my colleage had the Kitchen Sink soba-no, they don't really call it that-but it was chock full of just about every ingredient they offer, with a fried egg on top. He said it was good, but he left an awful lot of it unfinished, citing a full stomach. I left Matsugen less impressed than last time. I have to add that the menu is a long one, and I am sure there are many gems here. But even with the servers' patient explanations, it is a lot to navigate, and the format lends itself to over-ordering.

The fall slate of restaurant openings is understandably timid. With the economy in the tank, restauranteurs are falling back on familiar formulae, and the trappings of fine dining have fallen by the wayside. How refreshing it is, then, to come across Allegretti, a new restaurant that-gasp!-has white tablecloths, servers who wear ties, an elegant atmosphere, and entrees that threaten (but don't yet touch) the $40 mark. Has anyone told them we're in a recession? The chef here is Alain Allegretti, who trained under Alain Ducasse and worked at Le Cirque 2000 and Atelier. He hails from Nice, but the culinary sensibility is Italian. Prices are on the high side, with appetizers $12-20, soups $10-11, pastas $16-20, entrees $25-38 (most in the $30s), and side dishes $6-8. Fortunately, Allegretti is a startlingly good restaurant-one that I hope will be successful enough to encourage others to take similar chances. We need more restaurants like this. The amuse-bouche was a lentil soup that was a bit too salty. Three warm breads were offered. We both chose the olive bread, which was studded with olives and came with a very yellow soft butter. I loved the Perugina Sausage ($14; above left), which had a nice tangy taste, complemented by sweet pepers and an onion ragôut. My girlfriend was rapturous over the Heirloom Tomatoes ($19; above right), with a soft lump of burrata cheese. Both entrees were served with a gravy applied tableside. The menu didn't specify how the skin was treated on Duck Magret ($34; above left), but it seemed to be a kind of panko crust. The portion was ample, and the duck beautifully prepared. My girlfriend found Noix of Colorado Lamb ($32; above right) a tad too salty, but the dish was well conceived, with spinach ricotta gnocchi, prosciutto, fava beans, tomato confit, and fennel gratine. There was a slightly heavy hand with the salt shaker, but we think every dish here could be a winner (several are already) after the kitchen settles down. Servers here were a bit over-eager: it seemed that hardly thirty seconds after the dessert menus were deposited, someone was back to ask us what we wanted. It was one of several times when we wished they'd just let us relax. (The restaurant, though doing well, was not full, so I don't think they were trying to rush us out the door.) However, I prefer attentive service to the alternative, and I assume they'll get more polished with time. On the whole, Allegretti strikes us as the most exciting fine dining restaurant to have opened in quite some time. In an era when most restaurants are stripping away the trappings of good service, Allegretti feels like a breath of fresh air.

What is New York's best sushi restaurant? The debate usually comes down to Sushi Yasuda and Kurumazushi. An eGullet thread comparing the two is six years old, and still running, without a clear consensus. I had a terrific omakase at Yasuda two years ago, but I was still itching to try Kuruma on the right occasion. A friend of mine who loves sushi had just celebrated a birthday, so I thought the time had come. The fish here is obviously very good, but the overall experience wasn't as enjoyable as Yasuda. I will probably return to Yasuda at some point, but I can't imagine going back to Kurumazushi, unless someone else is paying. I didn't bring a camera or take notes, but our meal was quite similar to those many others have written about. We loved the fatty tuna, served in ample portions-how could you not?-and a few other things. Other courses started tasting the same after a while. If the fish here was better than Yasuda, it was too subtle for my friend and me to perceive. The Yasuda omakase actually seemed to have more variety.Then, there is the small matter of price. Except it's not so small a matter. I was prepared for the omakase to cost somewhere around $150-200 a head. We weren't shown a menu or asked about our budget, so I just figured it would be in that general range. Silly me. The bill arrived, and it was $1,005 for two. Back out the sales tax and subtract the sake ($150), and it appears we were charged $387 apiece for the food. That sake, by the way, wasn't a splurge either, by this restaurant's standards. I believe I saw only one bottle less than the $150 I spent.A thousand bucks is awful lot to charge somebody without giving any kind of notice of what you're in for. As best I can recall, it's the most I have ever paid for a meal for two. Even on a straight-up basis, I think I liked Yasuda a little more. When you consider that the bill for one at Yasuda was just $107 two years ago, it's not hard to decide which is better. I do a lot of research before choosing a restaurant-especially when I'm visiting for an occasion. My research obviously wasn't good enough this time. Since I posted on this meal at eGullet, a few folks have mentioned that, indeed, if you say \"omakase\" and nothing more, two people are liable to spend a thousand bucks, or something thereabouts. I simply had no idea that this was their default offering. I cannot be the first person to have gone home feeling cheated. The restaurant is on the second floor of an office building. The interior is spare and not especially luxurious. I like Yasuda's blonde wood better. Service was attentive, as it damned well ought to have been, but nothing more that I would expect at sushi places charging a quarter of the price.

Our weekly BruniBetting contest with Eater has been on hiatus for the past couple of months. That included a couple of weeks when we were on vacation, and another few when Eater posted its predictions too late in the day for us to respond. (Is that a conscious strategy on Eater's part?) Five weeks ago, Bruni awarded one star to Persimmon. We were a touch more impressed here, awarding two, but we probably would have agreed with the Eater assessment that one star was more likely. Four weeks ago, Bruni awarded three stars to Matsugen. We were quite a bit less impressed, awarding two for the food, but deducting a half-star for ambiance. Eater made its most reckless bet ever, putting its dollar on four stars at 9–1 odds, while conceding that three stars was the more likely outcome. We would certainly not have taken the four-star bet. Knowing that Bruni actually awards bonus stars to restaurants without tablecloths, we probably would have taken the three-star bet. Three weeks ago, Bruni awarded two stars to Perbacco. Eater, overriding his own odds for the second straight week, bet on two stars at 4–1 odds, while admitting that one star was the more likely outcome. We're not sure how we would have bet, but Eater's logic was compelling: \"The Bruni loves Italian food and loves putting a legitimate sleeper on the map,\" and \"The other thing that's in play this week is the Little Owl Theorem, which gets very small restaurants with moderate price, earnest service and overachieving food two stars.\" We have no personal experience here, but our sense is that Bruni, as is his wont, rated, the unassuming neighborhood one star too high. Two weeks ago, for the second time this year, Bruni took the week off. Last week, Bruni couldn't find a real restaurant to review, so he awarded one star to the NoLIta train wreck, Elizabeth. We awarded one star too, but that was probably generous, and it was before they fired the chef. Bruni doesn't normally pull marginal candidates out of the woodwork only to destroy them, so we would have agreed with Eater that one star was the only possible bet. Finally, we come to this week's review, arguably another wasted slot: no stars for Michael's. No one that pays the slightest attention to the food scene has paid attention to Michael's since the Clinton administration, but it actually had two stars at one time. We'll allow Bruni one diversion per year to slay a celebrity icon past its prime. Eater took the one-star bet, but I suspect we would have put our buck on zero.

***CONTENT
Prune has been on my go-to list for a long while, but I was finally prompted to go when I saw Chef Gabrielle Hamilton defeat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America. The fact she was on the show at all was a tribute to what she had achieved in her hole-in-the-wall East Village restaurant, making a destination out of what looks like a casual neighborhood place.Eric Asimov gave it a rave in $25 & Under (back when that column reviewed real restaurants). Three years ago, Frank Bruni updated that assessment, awarding one star. I often don't agree with Bruni's one-star reviews — too often, he uses it as an insult. But with Prune he got it right. One star is supposed to mean \"good,\" and that's what Prune is.Prune is in a tiny slip of a space in the East Village. Into it, Hamilton squeezes more seats than you'll find in restaurant's twice the size. Reaching your table may require the agility of an Olympic gymnast. At one table, diners had to climb through the French doors to reach their seats.The drawbacks, such as they are, aren't much of a deterrent. Throughout August, we've found many popular restaurants with tables to spare. Not at Prune. Every table was taken, and there were always at least a few folks waiting outside. Walk-ins were turned away.The décor is shabby-chic, with butcher paper standing in for tablecloths. In lieu of bread, you get a small bowl of surprisingly addictive dried chickpeas. With appetizers $8–14, entrées $18–26 and side dishes $7–9, one might expect a bit more comfort. A party entered dressed in dresses and suits, obviously expecting a different type of restaurant. They were visibly distressed to find such a bare-bones place. But most of the clientele were dressed casually, as you'd expect at any of the raft of East Village destinations that have sprouted in the last decade. There is a separate bar menu with \"snacks\" ($5–8) that can also be ordered appetizers. I ordered the Lamb Sausages ($8; above left). They tasted great, but would more accurately be called meatballs. Michelle had the fried squash blossoms, an off-menu special ($9; above right), which we were surprised to find still in season. I never really paid much attention to squash blossoms until this year, when they seem to appear everywhere—and Prune's preparation was as compelling as any.Suckling pig ($24) was another off-menu special. There was apparently a spice rub, giving the braised pig a fiery kick. There's not a lot of complexity here, but the dish delivered as comfort food usually does.Prune is fun. You'll eat well here without breaking the bank, but I didn't find the kind of innovative cuisine that Gabrielle Hamilton used to defeat Bobby Flay on Iron Chef America. If I lived or worked nearby, I'd be an enthusiastic regular—if I could get in.Prune (54 E. 1st Street between First & Second Avenues, East Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: minimalOverall: *

Note: Bobby Hellen is the new executive chef at Resto. He was apparently there when we paid our visit, but management took a while to officially put him in charge. Resto has been on my to-do list for over a year, since Frank Bruni awarded an unlikely two stars in May 2007. Back then, the restaurant didn't take reservations, and there were reports of waits up to an hour at prime times. Sorry Charlie, but I don't like to eat that way. Time is too precious to squander an hour of it just waiting to eat. So Resto went on the back burner. After the hubbub died down, Resto got wise, and put itself on OpenTable, so people can actually plan to eat at a particular time, rather than just hoping. Perhaps the bloom has withered a bit. We found it nearly empty at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday evening, albeit in August. It got busier as the evening went on, but at no point did it appear to be full. Resto today doesn't quite seem to merit the laurels Frank Bruni bestowed on it. However, that was when Ryan Skeen was chef; he has since moved onto Irving Mill. Perhaps I visited Resto too late. The cuisine here is Belgian, a genre not well represented in Manhattan (Markt comes to mind), though it shares much in common with rustic French. The selection of 70 beers is admirable, if not overwhelming. The wine list isn't long, and neither is the seasonal menu. There are five appetizers ($9-13), five kinds of house-made charcuterie ($9), four seasonal entrees ($16-28), four classic entrees ($15-24), and four side dishes ($6-8). In the context of these modest prices, a six-week-aged prime ribeye for two at $140 seems incongruous. So does an $85 tasting menu. We were curious, but gave both a pass. Lamb Niçoise ($9), a home-made lamb sausage, had a nice spicy kick. My girlfriend loved the Crispy Pig's Ear Salad ($12). Loaded with greens, beans, chicory and a soft egg on top, it could easily serve as an entree. And yes, those really are pigs' ears, fried crisp and scattered about the bowl like croutons. I couldn't exactly say the entrees misfired, but they were pedestrian. Wild Striped Bass ($28) was chewy and overwhelmed with red peppers. Steak Frites ($24) featured hanger steak, nicely done, but the fries were mushy. The decor is plain and bare-bones, but service was prompt and friendly. We had many questions about the menu, and the server provided helpful advice with much enthusiasm.

Le Gavroche

***CONTENT
For the second major meal of our London trip, we chose the two-star Le Gavroche. This restaurant opened in 1967 in Sloane Street, moving in 1981 to its current quarters in Upper Brook Street, just steps away from Hyde Park, where it earned its third Michelin star, the first U.K. restaurant to be so honored. The founding chef, Michel Roux, left to take over The Waterside Inn in Bray, which I reviewed two years ago. His son, Michel Roux Jr., took over as chef de cuisine. Michelin docked a star, leaving Le Gavroche with two. The Waterside Inn is the prettier location, but we found the cuisine here more impressive. This was probably our best meal since the late lamented Alain Ducasse at the Essex House. The restaurant is on the lower level of an elegant Georgian townhouse, with a hotel occupying the upper levels. The Roux family once owned the hotel too, but it is now independent. The dining room walls are deep green, the banquettes plush. Ducks and roosters dominate the décor, along with orchids. The restaurant is named for the little urchin in Victor Hugo's Les Misérables. That little figure appears everywhere at Le Gavroche, including the handles of all the flatware, many of the serving pieces, the door to the kitchen, and probably other places I failed to notice. Prices can only be described as staggering. The Menu Exceptionnel (a long tasting menu) was £95 (around $190) per person. I didn't take note of individual prices, except to note that many entrées were upwards of $70 or $80 apiece (and some more than that), with many appetizers in the $40 to $60 range. As we noted the night before, in relation to what we were already bound to spend anyway, the tasting menu seemed to be a bargain. so we chose that once again. Once again, we avoided ordering until we had settled on a wine. And once again, the staff acted as if this was an unusual procedure, though we didn't get the snooty reaction we had at Hibiscus. Here the choice was more difficult, as the wine list is a large volume. I noted that the largest section was the French Bordeaux, so I asked the sommelier for a Bordeaux under £60. You can imagine my surprise when he recommended a 1997 St. Julien at just £48. He decanted it with much ceremony, holding a candle up to the bottle to check for sediment. (In the U.S., Bern's Steakhouse is the only restaurant where I have observed that procedure.) I apologize in advance for the poor quality of the photos. The ambient lighting here was low, and we didn't feel it was appropriate to use the flash. It went off once by accident; it will probably be pretty obvious which photo that was. The canapés (above left) were smoked duck and foie gras. I liked the duck a bit better, but they were both excellent. The bread service offered two contrasting butters (salted, not) and multiple breads, but none of them were memorable. We then moved on to our eight-course menu, a copy of which was on the table, a method I like much better than long explanations delivered at the table. 1) Lobster Salad with Mango, Avocado, Basil and Lime (above right), stuffed in an endive leaf. 2) Langoustine and Snails (above left) in a light Hollandaise sauce, flavored with Basque pepper and parsley. As Michelle noted, though the menu did not, there was about half a pound of butter in this dish. It was intensely creamy, but the combination worked beautifully. 3) Seared Sea Bass (above right) on a soft polenta, roast pepper coulis, olive and garlic croutons. Michelle called it \"one of the prettiest fish presentations I've seen,\" and \"just amazing.\" The intense olive and pepper taste worked well with the perfectly prepared fish. 4) Hot Foie Gras and Crispy Pancake of Duck (above left) flavored with cinnamon. This was perhaps the best foie gras dish ever: amazing. The seared foie reduced to liquid almost instantly, but it seemed neither fatty nor heavy. It was a fairly large serving, too. The duck pancake was the pancake I want for breakfast every day. 5) Roasted Rack of Welsh Lamb (above right), courgette flower fritter and tarragon jus. The rack of lamb was carved and plated tableside. It was soft as butter, and the deep-fried squash blossom also perfect. 6) Next came the cheese course. There was a large selection, from which we each chose five, and portions were generous. I didn't note the individual cheeses, but we wanted sharp, intense-tasting ones, and we got them. 7) Ouefs à la Neige, or Soft Caramel-covered Meringue, Vanilla Cream and Poached Strawberries (above left). The flavors were intense and clear. 8) Bitter Chocolate and Coffee-Layered Sponge Cake and Chocolate Sorbet (above right). I'm not a chocolate guy, but Michelle pronounced it a success. I liked the coffee flavor. (Sorry for the awful photo.) One of the petits-fours plates is shown above; there were others, but the photo isn't presentable. The restaurant was about 85% full on a Saturday in mid-August, and we were gratified to find that the average age of the clientele seemed to be under 45. The New York media repeatedly inform us that \"young people\" aren't interested in composed formal meals of the kind Le Gavroche offers. Whether it's even true in New York is debatable, but it certainly doesn't seem to be true in London. Service was superb; I can't really find any fault with it. Nor with the food, which was at the highest level we've experienced. Le Gavroche (43 Upper Brook Street, London) Food: ****Service: ****Ambiance: ****Overall: ****

On a recent trip to London, my girlfriend and I wanted to try a couple of Michelin-starred restaurants. Full disclosure is due: both of our first choices were fully booked, but we landed on two very good alternatives, starting with Hibiscus. The chef, Claude Bosi, was born in Lyon and trained in France, but his cuisine relies heavily on locally-sourced ingredients. If you'd told me he was English, I would have believed it. The restaurant opened in Shropshire in 2000, winning a Michelin star in 2001 and a second star in 2004. Eager to play on the big stage, he moved the restaurant to London in 2007, and the Michelin folks knocked him back down to one star. The menu is £60 for a three-course prix-fixe or £75 for the nine-course tasting menu. We thought that £15 was a modest premium to pay for a much broader sample of Chef Bosi's cuisine, so we went with that. We began with a bowl of warm, slightly salty gougères. The bread didn't especially impress me, but we loved the soft Welsh cow's-milk butter. It had an unusually high fat content, which imparted a yellow color, and was also a bit more salty than most butters. 1) The amuse-bouche was a Chilled Cucumber & Pineapple Soda (above left) with smoked olive oil and black pepper. This was very clever dish, slightly chunky, but with the consistency of soda. 2) Ravioli of Spring Onion & Cinnamon (above right) with meadowsweet flower, roast onion, and Granny Smith apple. This was a delicate dish, in which the ingredients worked perfectly together. The roasted onions were formed into little pellets that seemed solid, but melted instantly at the touch. 3) Tartare of Line-caught Cornish Mackerel (above left) with English strawberries & celery, wasabi & honey dressing. There was a lot on the plate, but this dish was extremely mild, and could almost have used a bit more punch. I couldn't really detect much of the wasabi. 4) Roast Cornish Lobster cooked in Brown Butter (above right) with green bean and lemongrass puree, Cavaillon melon. This had the \"oomph\" that the previous dish lacked. Michelle's comment was, \"This was really very nice.\" 5) Roast Monkfish (above left), Mona Lisa gnocchi, summer truffle, sage & onion puree, mead sauce. This had a nice savory, healthy flavor. 6) Lightly Oak-smoked Lamb Sweetbreads (above right) with fresh goat cheese, tamarillow powder, and lettuce veloute. The sweetbreads had a terrific smokey flavor, and everything on the plate worked well together. To me, this was the most remarkable dish of the evening. 7) Roast Goosnargh Duck (above left), cherries scented with lapsang Souchong, barbecued almond butter, and cauliflower four ways (purple cauliflower couscous, white cauliflower puree, and roasted cauliflower × 2). The duck was flavorful but a little too tough. 8) SweetTomato Skin (above right) with vanilla & frozen raspberries, held together with gelatin. Michelle said, \"It's so light, it's like eating a cloud.\" The tomato taste was in the background, while the raspberries were wonderful. 9 ) English Pea & American Mint Tart (above left), sheep's milk whey & coconut sorbet. Michelle called this \"the oddest thing I've ever tasted,\" and \"very strange.\" I found it bizarre. That didn't stop us from finishing the whole thing, but we felt that a tart made of peas misfired. At the end of a long meal, one wants a real dessert, not an appetizer masquerading as dessert. The petits-fours (above right) were just fine. Service was generally good, with many sauces applied at table-side, but some dishes weren't cleared quite as promptly as they should be, and the staff were occasionally frazzled. We had trouble understanding the explanations of quite a few of the dishes. We got a printed menu at the end, but it would have been a lot easier had this been left on the table. The server seemed offended when I said I wanted to make a wine selection before we ordered. I don't know if our habits are unusual, but I've found that if you don't choose the wine before placing the food order, you're liable to be eating the first couple of courses with only water to drink. I haven't noted the bottle we chose, except that we paid £43 for it (a reasonable price by London standards). The list was not an especially long one. After I narrowed down the choice to two bottles, the sommelier made a very good recommendation and decanted the wine without being asked to do so. We were gratified to note that the restaurant was full in mid-August, with a mixed demographic of young people and jeans, old folks in suits, and everything in between. The clientele did not seem to be tourists. The tables are not overly cramped, but the noise level was on the loud side after the space filled up. The decor is a mediation on taupe and pine, but bright orange charger plates (pictured at the top of this post) give the room a dash of color. Chef Bosi dares to challenge his audience on occasion. There were a couple of misfires, but on the whole this was a happy experience. Hibiscus (29 Maddox Street, London) Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: **½Overall: **½

This week, Frank Bruni reviews Scott Conant's greatest hits, finding their current home at Scarpetta worth a three very generous stars: \"Spaghetti, tomato and basil.\" That's all it says. That's pretty much what it is. But however Mr. Conant is choosing and cooking the Roma tomatoes with which he sauces his house-made spaghetti, he's getting a roundness of flavor and nuance of sweetness that amount to pure Mediterranean bliss... More than that, it underscored the wisdom of his work at Scarpetta: he's getting back to the tomato. I mean that not literally but figuratively, in the sense that Mr. Conant, whose cooking took a precious turn when he opened the restaurant Alto in 2005, is mining a more straightforward, soulful vein. Here's a reminder: The Bruni didn't like Alto, finding it \"haute and cold.\" He awarded just two stars, which was an insult to a restaurant clearly designed for three. After Conant left, Bruni re-reviewed Alto and gave it the three stars it had deserved in the first place. Critics love to be vindicated. At Scarpetta, Conant has abandoned his excellent work at Alto, so Bruni says, \"I told you so.\" Ironically, I am fairly certain that the owners of Scarpetta weren't gunning for three stars. They'll happily take them, but I'm sure a two-star verdict wouldn't have carried anything like the disappointment it did at Alto. Scarpetta is a decent enough place, but it is well below any of the other Italian places that have won three stars from Bruni. Give full credit to Eater, who correctly forecasted that Bruni's Italian grading curve would be on full display this week. Eater wins $4 on a hypothetical one-dollar bet, while we lose $1.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater’s bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week. The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Scott Conant's comeback at the Meatpacking-adjacent Scarpetta. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows: Zero Stars: 12-1One Star: 5-1Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 4-1 √√Four Stars: 10,000-1 The Skinny: We're reasonably confident that Scarpetta was designed as a two-star concept. The prices, the vibe, the service, all say two stars. On rare occasions, Bruni has awarded a third star that the restaurant itself probably never planned on, with Dovetail being the most recent example. But that doesn't happen often. It's hard enough to get three stars when you're trying to. An unintended third star is a blessing granted to very few. Working in Scarpetta's favor is the two-star kiss that Bruni blew at Bar Milano just four weeks ago. In a way, it's an insult to the obviously superior Scarpetta to be saddled with the same two stars. With Italian restaurants and Bruni, it never hurts to figure on a star more than the restaurant deserves. But we know the Italian restaurants Bruni really liked—Babbo, Felidia, Del Posto, A Voce (under Carmellini) and Alto the second time around. We are hard pressed to put Scarpetta in that league. Our 1½-star review may have under-rated it, but we've seldom been that far away from Bruni's assessment. The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award a very enthusiastic two stars to Scarpetta.

Sam Horine via Eater Note: Forge has been renamed Marc Forgione, after an unrelated Miami restaurant complained that it had the original name trademarked. Forge is the brainchild of Marc Forgione, whose more famous father, Larry Forgione, has been a big-name chef for thirty years. Son Marc has worked as a second fiddle in a number of places, most recently as Executive Chef at Laurent Tourondel's BLT Prime. I always say that if you want a successful restaurant, you should open near a bunch of other successful restaurants. Forgione followed that advice-not that he asked me-and opened right in the heart of TriBeCa. The look is the same rustic chic you could swear you've seen at about a dozen other places. You'll have that same feeling about the menu, which offers standard New American bistro food. As Forgione is not blazing any trails, the only question is whether he is doing the old standards well enough to make Forge better than just a decent neighborhood fallback. I can't say that he is. The menu doesn't range far or deep. With just six appetizers ($12-18) and six entrees ($26-34)-plus leg of suckling pig for two ($68)-there is a high premium on getting just about everything right. There are signs of higher aspirations here, but I found the food uneven. The meal started on a promising note, with a terrific corn soup amuse-bouche. And I could have filled up on warm, soft dinner rolls with caramelized onion butter. If Forgione has learned anything from the BLT franchise, it's a superb bread service. The savory courses were a less happy story. A grilled fluke appetizer ($14) and a halibut entree ($26) both seemed too tart and acidic. The fish were impeccably prepared, but the sauces seemed to overwhelm them with a bitter salty taste that I wouldn't be eager to sample again. A cheese plate ($12) was very solidly done, and the house comped a small pour of Sancerre to go with it. Service was just fine, but I was in quite early, before the crowds. There is a large bar area, suggesting perhaps that management is hedging their bets as to what kind of restaurant this will be. The cocktail program is underwhelming: think raspberry lemonade with vodka. They were out of the sangria I ordered, as their supply of rum had run out. For now, Forge strikes me as a slightly over-achieving American bistro, fighting for the destination crowd among many other restaurants that do a more dependable job at the same type of food.

Was there ever any doubt? Yesterday, Frank Bruni awarded two stars to Szechuan Gourmet. Its flaws are considerable. The menu rambles (over 100 items), it's not as good as Spicy & Tasty in Queens (also two stars), and: It has its limitations: no hard liquor, a short list of wines you won't yearn to drink, an even shorter list of desserts so negligible that servers don't bother to ask if you want one before dropping the check. Meals here can be rushed, especially at lunch, when the restaurant is busiest. But somehow it manages two stars anyway. It's a pretty sure bet that Frank will do that when he's in his \"$25 & Under\" mood, so we and Eater both win our hypothetical one-dollar bets at 2-1 odds.

Note: Click here and here for more recent visits to Matsugen. Matsugen, which opened about a month ago in TriBeCa, is Jean-Georges Vongerichten's latest Manhattan restaurant. It replaces 66, which I sort of liked, but which died a slow, natural death, and closed last year. Vongerichten has had a long love affair with Asian Cuisine. Vong and Spice Market are both Thai-inspired, 66 was Chinese. At Matsugen, it's Japanese. But at those earlier restaurants, Vongerichten was the nominal chef, even if he paid little attention to them after they opened. At Matsugen, the Matsushita brothers are running the kitchen. The only things Vongerichten supplied were the space and the chocolate cake recipe. Funnily enough, he wrote a blog post about dining at Matsugen, as if he were an ordinary customer. An almost inconspicuous sign outside reads \"Soba Cuisine,\" but while there certainly is soba here, there's a lot more, at a wide range of prices: appetizers ($6-65), salads ($8-39), tempura ($12-22), grilled items ($20-135), shabu-shabu ($52-160), rice dishes ($32-45), hot & cold soba ($14-36), sushi & sashimi à la carte ($4-10), and rolls ($5-12). To be fair, the higher-end prices are for luxury items like Wagyu beef, fatty tuna, and sea urchin. Typical prices are nearer the lower end of each range. Still, this has to be called a luxury restaurant. So it's hard to avoid the fact that the decor is rather charmless and ugly. I deliberately didn't try to find the best angle. The photo (left) was the view from my table: an unadorned industrial column, white walls, spare tables, plain banquettes. Restaurant 66 wasn't a beauty, but I don't remember it being this barren. Maybe my memory is deceiving me. The staff aren't any more stylish than the space, but they are knowledgeable. When I asked about something to drink, I got a course in Sake 101. The explanation of the soba dishes rose to a graduate-level seminar. As I was alone, I didn't really mind the explanation. But it does underscore the potential to be overwhelmed by the menu here. Fortunately, when the food arrives your patience is repaid-maybe enough to make you forget the grim surroundings. Sliced chilled asparagus was cool and crisp, but it was $15 for a small portion. An eel-cucumber roll ($8) was uncomplicated, but beautifully done. There was a nice contrast between the warm rice and the cold cucumber. The soft, fresh-ground wasabi put to shame the clumpy version of it that most sushi places serve. That left the main event, Soba Goma Dare ($16), one of the simpler soba items on the menu. The noodles at Matsugen are offered three different ways, with a variety of accompaniments. I chose the darkest, huskiest noodles, served cold. They had a lively, bracing flavor that is difficult to describe. A server brought over a funky-looking teapot (right) containing the hot broth that the noodles were supposedly cooked in. I was instructed to pour this broth into the bowl in which the noodles and condiments had been dipped (lower left of the photo above), and to drink it like a soup. This was the highlight of the meal, with all of those terrific flavors floating together in one bowl. After $14 for a small carafe of sake (served in a bamboo box), this fairly modest dinner was $53 before tax and tip. As everything I ordered was near the low end of the range, it's safe to say that most meals here will cost a lot more. Any Vongerichten restaurant is bound to attract plenty of attention, but I have to wonder if such an expensive, yet ugly, restaurant will be able to build up a loyal fan base. I'll probably be back, but not on a regular basis. Matsugen (241 Church Street between Leonard & Worth Streets, TriBeCa) Food: **Service: **Ambiance: Are negative stars allowed?Overall: *½

We're not aware of a previous Times review, so there's no existing rating that cries out for correction. Therefore, the only conceivable point of the review is that Bruni has something compelling to say. What could that be? In a city where zero-star Chinese is on almost every block, and one-star Chinese is in almost every neighborhood, two stars is the realistic minimum that could be worth calling attention to. We assume that three-star restaurants don't hide in plain sight, and in any case Bruni isn't going to award the trifecta two weeks in a row. That leaves two stars as the only possibility. The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Szechuan Gourmet.

We're rather late with this week's edition of The Payoff, as in five days late. Our only excuse is that we've been busy. Anyhow, the news is that Oceana is still great. Who knew? We all do now, thanks to last Wednesday's three-star review from Frank Bruni: I RARELY hear people chattering about Oceana anymore. They don't mention it as a special-occasion restaurant they yearn to try. They don't mention it as a favorite they circle back to. Say the restaurant's name even to some diners who diligently canvas the city's dining scene, eager not to lose touch with anything noteworthy, and you can tell that Oceana has slipped away from them... But more than a decade and a half since it opened, Oceana presses on, still proud, still vital, still very much worth boarding. Its owners, the Livanos family, who also operate the Greek restaurant Molyvos and the Italian restaurant Abboccato, obviously care about Oceana, which they've steered through several chef changes: from Rick Moonen to Mr. Gallagher, and then to Ben Pollinger, who took over in late 2006. Like a number of other people, I was skeptical when this review was announced. Given the rarity of re-reviews, I thought it made more sense to review Oceana when it moves next year, rather than now, when it's nearing the end of a sixteen-year run in its old digs. But Bruni made a persuasive case that the review made sense. Although he doesn't admit it, about 90% of his reviews are really just confirmations of critical judgments the market has already made for itself. It isn't often that he can actually draw attention to an excellent place the food cogniscenti had ignored. As far as I'm concerned, he can do that all he wants. It's never too early to celebrate excellence. We and Eater both anticipated a demotion to two stars. We both lose on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The new Korean restaurant Persimmon opened quietly in the East Village a couple of months ago. So far, it has rave reviews in New York and the Village Voice to its name.Critics have noted the similarity to Momofuku Ko: low seating capacity (24), backless stools, and a prix-fixe Korean-inspired menu that goes heavy on the pork and kimchi. The staffing level is similar to Ko: four chefs, a dishwasher, and two servers. The head man, Youngsun Lee, even has some Momofuku time on his resume.The open kitchenThe differences are significant, too. Dinner is $37 for five courses-a stunningly good value. There is a printed menu, which changes bi-weekly, offering four or five choices for the appetizer, mid-course, and main course. The cuisine is more authentically Korean, in contrast to David Chang's Momofuku empire, which borrows from many cultures and cooking styles.Most importantly, you can get into Persimmon without playing Momofuku Ko's website lottery. Reservations are accepted by phone and seem to be readily available. Persimmon caters to a late-arriving East Village crowd: less than half full at 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening, but full by 9:30.Persimmon isn't as good as Ko, but at roughly one-third the price it is well worth your time and attention. There will be a new menu by the time you read this, but it will give an idea of what Chef Lee is up to.The restaurant seats twenty at a long communal table, and four at a bar that faces the open kitchen. We were lucky enough to be seated at the bar, so we were able to watch the food being prepared and have a dialog with the chef. Left: Grilled Korean Blood Sausage; Right: Fried Stuffed Squash BlossomsI started with the Grilled Korean Blood Sausage, served with pig's liver, pig's stomach, scallions and Korean herbs. The menu admits that the sausage comes from Min Sok Restaurant in Flushing. It's an understatement to say that this dish isn't for everybody, but I loved the salty, hot, intense flavor.My girlfriend was impressed with the Fried Stuffed Squash Blossoms, filled with scallop, tofu, and Korean miso. Squash blossom season is ending, so this dish is almost certainly no longer on the menu.Sliced Braised Pork BellyFor the second course, we both chose the Sliced Braised Pork Belly, or Bo Ssäm. Despite the similar name, don't expect the Momofuku Ssäm Bar version. The pork comes pre-sliced, with kimchi, salted Napa cabbage and salted baby shrimp on the side.I thought the pork was a bit too bland. As you can see in the photo, it's unadorned white squares of pork. My girlfriend didn't share that complaint, perhaps because her portion had more fat. We both loved the intense moo woo kimchi, which I used as a meat garnish. Right: Monkfish Stew; Left: Kimchi StewAll of the main courses are soups or stews. My girlfriend chose the Kimchi Stew, with onion, tofu, scallions, mushrooms and pork. I had the Monkfish stew with mussels, soybean sprouts, red peppers, chives, garlic and honey.Both stews came out in their own crockpots, so hot that the broth was still bubbling. Had they spilled on us at that point, we would have been in the E.R. with first-degree burns. It was quite a while before we could dare taste them. Both were spicy and intensely flavorful. Mine was filled with huge chunks of monkfish, vegetables, and a good half-dozen clams. Eating it without a knife (not supplied, and not available) was a challenge, though well worth it. I don't normally like to work for my food, but this was a rewarding exception. Left: Browned Rice Porridge; Center: Korean cookies; Right: Fermented fish intestinesNo choice is offered for the last two courses, and both were letdowns. The chef assured us that Browned Rice Porridge is a Korean standard, but to us it just seemed like dull rice with warm tea poured over it. There was a far better rice side dish served with the main course. A second rice dish didn't really add much. Dessert came in the form of traditional Korean cookies (sesame, black sesame and wild sesame), which were dry and a bit unexciting.There were various side dishes served with the meal. I don't remember them all, but they were mostly terrific, especially a bowl of kimchi-infused vegetables that we regretted we were too full to finish. Then again, maybe it was too much of a good thing. I also liked a serving of dried salted anchovies, but I don't recommend the fermented fish intestines.Persimmon is BYOB, and apparently there's no intention to change that, but they have nice stemless glasses and ice buckets for white wine. Taken with the almost unbelievably low $37 prix fixe, Persimmon must be one of the best deals in town.The service staff were friendly and kept on top of things, but the restaurant didn't really get crowded until the end of our meal. The decor is spare but pleasant, assuming you don't mind the backless stools. The orange placemats and decorative metal chopsticks were a nice touch, but silverware was not replaced between courses.The New York review said that the multi-course meal \"requires the dedication of the greater part of an evening.\" We didn't find that to be the case; our meal took about 90 minutes, of which about 20 minutes was the time it took for our main courses to cool down to a safe temperature.Some of the food here is adventurous (blood sausage, fish intestines), but there are \"safe\" choices for every course, such as chicken dumplings, grilled scallops and miso stew with seafood. There is at least one vegetarian option for each course.Persimmon is a first-class experience of its kind, and a welcome addition to a Momofuku-dominated neighborhood.Persimmon (277 E. 10th Street, west of Avenue A, East Village)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the three-star seafood palace, Oceana. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 8-1One Star: 6-1Two Stars: 3-1 √√Three Stars: 4-1 Four Stars: 90-1The Skinny: Oceana has been around a long time. It replaced an old French standby called Le Cygne in 1992, earning two stars from Bryan Miller. Rick Moonen's arrival in the kitchen prompted a two-star re-review from Ruth Reichl in 1994, which she bumped up to three stars in 1997. After Moonen left to open his own place, Cornelius Gallagher took over, and Oceana's three-star status was reaffirmed by William Grimes in 2003.Gallagher is long gone, but if you check out the Times website, it still says, \"Oceana has found a new chef, and a new surge of energy. It feels, in fact, as fresh as one of its fish.\" At least, it will say that for a few more hours. That surge of energy dates back to the Grimes review. So Oceana was probably overdue for an update, but we have to wonder about the timing, given the move to a new address planned for next year. The Times waited this long, so couldn't they have waited twelve months longer?No matter. The question is, what will Bruni say? Our own experience with Oceana isn't particularly relevant. Gallagher was still there, and it was two years ago on Valentine's Day, hardly the best day to test a restaurant's mettle.We have to agree with Eater that two stars is the most likely outcome here. Oceana has become a three-star backwater-a restaurant no one talks about. Bruni tends to give three stars to places that generate a lot of excitement. If Oceana is doing that, it hasn't been written up in any of the publications I follow. I have no idea what Oceana deserves, but I have a pretty strong inkling of what Bruni will say it deserves: two stars.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will msot likely award two stars to Oceana

***CONTENT
It's hard to be both good and popular. Large restaurants with mass appeal can't risk challenging their customers with unusual recipes, ingredients that are hard to pronounce, or menus that stray far from the old standards.These realities are evident at Gramercy Tavern, which has practically defined New American haute barnyard cuisine since its debut in 1994. It was the first restaurant as co-owner for chef Tom Colicchio, who had worked his way through several three and four-star kitchens; and the second restaurant for Danny Meyer (after another huge hit, Union Square Cafe).The list of chefs who have cooked in Gramercy Tavern's kitchen reads like a who's who of New York dining: Marco Canora and Paul Grieco (both now at Hearth, Insieme and Terroir); Jonathan Benno (now chef de cuisine at Per Se); Damon Wise (now executive chef at Craft); pastry chef Claudia Fleming (now co-owner at North Fork Table & Inn); John A. Schaefer (now chef-partner at Irving Mill).Before they opened, Meyer and Colicchio rather foolishly said that they were out to \"reinvent the four-star restaurant.\" Then, as now, if you say you're gunning for N stars, it's a sure bet you'll get at most N-1 . That's exactly what happened, as Ruth Reichl awarded an enthusiastic three stars in the Times. But as Colicchio drifted away, the restaurant ran on auto-pilot.Two years ago, Meyer and Colicchio had an amicable divorce. Colicchio wanted to focus on his Craft empire, and Meyer wanted a full-time chef. To replace Colicchio, Meyer hired Michael Anthony, formerly Dan Barber's partner at the Blue Hill restaurants-places that borrowed a lot from Gramercy's haute barnyard ethos, and arguably improved upon it.The current Times critic, Frank Bruni, had \"a few forgettable dinners\" and \"a clumsy, laughable one\" during the first few years of his tenure. Unusually for him, he gave Anthony time to right the ship before weighing in with a respectful three-star re-review last June. Bruni was about right, when he noted:There are restaurants with more shimmer, and there are certainly restaurants with more spark. There are restaurants that take bigger chances and stake bolder claims to your attention.But is there a restaurant in this city more beloved than Gramercy Tavern? It was a tough to get a table here in 1994, and it is tough today. In the Zagat survey, Gramercy Tavern is the second-most popular restaurant in New York (behind only Union Square Cafe). Its Zagat food and service ratings are 27 out of 30; no restaurant is higher than 28 in either category When reservations opened for Valentine's Day, they sold out in something like fifteen minutes. Even on a \"normal\" day, Gramercy Tavern is usually booked solid at prime times. To be sure of getting a table, you need to call four weeks in advance at 10:00 a.m., wait on hold, and cross your fingers. By the time you get through you may find that 5:30 and 10:00 are the only times remaining. We were finally able to book on OpenTable during the slower summer season.Gramercy is really two restaurants in one, with a casual no-reservations \"tavern room,\" which serves an à la carte menu; and the more upscale (but not really formal) dining room, where your only choices for dinner are an $82 three-course prix fixe, which we had, or one of two tasting menus ($88; $110).Like all of Danny Meyer's restaurants, Gramercy Tavern practically defines excellent service. I was seated immediately, even though my girlfriend had not yet arrived; and they gave us as long as we wished to ponder the menus. There was no sense of being rushed through the meal, even though you can bet your life that our table was going to be turned. Our three-course dinner played out over a relatively leisurely two hours and forty minutes.The wine list is of middling length, but there is something on it for just about everybody. I was pleased to find a 1996 Fronsac for $72, an unusually low price for a decently aged French wine. It was a bit tight at first, but opened up nicely over the course of the evening. The amuse-bouche (photo right) was a small wedge of house-made sausage. There were three kinds of bread to choose from, but none of them really floated my boat. The olive bread was too hard, and the butter wasn't soft enough. Foie Gras Custard with cherry marmelade and hazelnuts (above left) was probably the most exciting dish we tasted. Besides being very good in its own right, it was a more creative way of presenting foie than the usual terrine or torchon.But Lamb Pappardelle (above right) was cliche, other than the unusual beet greens on which it lay, and it wasn't quite warm enough. It wasn't a very attractive plating, either. Neither entree offered a trace of originality. Glazed Duck Breast and Duck Leg Confit (above left) were at least impeccably prepared. The duck skin was crisp, the inside succulent and tender. We were less enchanted with Rack of Pork and Braised Belly (above right). The rack was slightly on the tough side, while the belly didn't have quite the crisp-gooey texture that it should. If, like the rest of the meal, the sweets were devoid of fanfare, they were all at least well executed. The palate cleanser (top left) was a strawberry-rhubarb crisp. I had the selection of cheeses (top right), while my girlfriend had the Grand Marnier Mascarpone Cheesecake (bottom left), which she felt the average chef could make at home. I found nothing wrong with it, though. The meal concluded with petits-fours (bottom right).I agree with Frank Bruni that the empire's best food in Danny Meyer's burgeoning restaurant empire is now being served at Eleven Madison Park and The Modern. (Bruni favors the latter's bar room over its formal dining room, but at least he has the right address.) Gramercy Park has become the Zagat set's go-to occasion place. There's no doubt that Michael Anthony is a serious chef, and unlike Tom Colicchio he's actually here most of the time. But the menu falls back on predictability, which doesn't leave much room to excuse its occasional flubs.You won't have a bad meal at Gramercy Tavern-far from it-but there's more excitement to be had elsewhere.Gramercy Tavern (42 E. 20th Street between Park Avenue South & Broadway, Flatiron District)Food: **Service: ***Ambiance: **½Overall: **½

That isn't a strawberry-rhubarb crisp. It is a play on strawberry shortcake. It has neither rhubarb nor crisp. It has strawberry, a biscuit and lightened pastry cream.

15 East is the Japanese restaurant that blossomed out of the old Tocqueville space, when co-owners Marco Moreira and Jo-Ann Makovitzky moved that Union Square standout two years ago to larger digs down the block. The odd-shaped room always seemed too small for Tocqueville-the owners obviously thought so too-but in its new guise it seems just about right.The front room, which formerly housed Tocqueville's bar, now has a sushi bar. The layout isn't ideal, since guests waiting to be seated hang out in the same room, but the bar seating appeared to be comfortable. As there were four of us, we were seated in the main dining room, which has been attractively re-decorated. We had the restaurant to ourselves when we arrived at 6:00 p.m. on a Tuesday evening, but the space was mostly full a couple of hours later.The menu offers a wide range of appetizers ($6-22) and a smaller selection of entrees ($24-45). Sushi ranges from $4-12 per piece, rolls $5-18. Omakases and tasting menus range from $55-120.The composed appetizers and main courses may even be more compelling here than the sushi. The amuse-bouche was a terrific spring pea tofu (right). We followed it up with the slow-poached octopus ($12; below left) that was the highlight in Frank Bruni's two-star review.Servers told Bruni that the octopus was \"massaged 500 times.\" We didn't know that, but perhaps it explains the terrific fatty taste that reminded me of pork belly. Tuna tartare ($22; above right) is the most expensive appetizer, but the kitchen throws a party in its honor, spraying the plate with a spice confetti. The entry-level omakase offers ten pieces of sushi or sashimi for $55 (above left). For a party of four businessmen, the chef sends out safe choices. The rice was warm and each piece was individually seasoned, but you'll probably have a more interesting meal if you order pieces individually, or order one of the more expensive tasting menus. One of our party did not want raw fish, so he ordered the Wild Salmon Five Ways ($26, above right), which he seemed pleased with.The service here is more accomplished and elegant than at most mid-level Japanese restaurants. There was a hint of upselling, but the captain's ordering advice was sound, and he picked a fine sake to go along with our meal.15 East (15 East 15th Street between Fifth Avenue and Union Square)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

Yesterday, Frank Bruni concluded the review cycle for Alain Ducasse's latest and perhaps final New York restaurant, Benoit. The review says as much about Bruni's limitations as it does about Ducasse's, but in the end Bruni lands on the correct rating, one star:Don't get me wrong: Benoit isn't a bad restaurant, nor is it a throwaway restaurant, not even close. It has many enviable, pleasurable virtues...But Benoit is selling a dining experience so familiar it's almost a cliche, and that puts a particular premium on seamless execution, lest the production feel phony and cynical.Invention and surprise are mostly off the table, so consistency and panache matter all the more. With a museum-piece restaurant like this, the difference between timeless and somewhat tired - between utterly delighting and intermittently amusing - is in its fluency and diction.One star is the correct rating because, by all accounts, Benoit is inconsistent. We agree with Bruni that when \"invention and surprise are off the table,\" consistency and excellence are all you have to offer. Even fans of the genre concede that Benoit has two many slips to justify anything better than one star.We also agree with Bruni that the menu should change with the seasons, and if baba au rhum is going to be offered, it ought to be the tour de force Ducasse is so noted for, and not the pallid version of it offered here.But Bruni also uses words like \"fusty,\" \"frowzy,\" \"stereotype,\" \"cliche,\" and \"museum-piece.\" None of these are meant as compliments, and all of them are directed at the concept, not its execution. While the latter may rightly be faulted, the former should not be.The critical cogniscenti of this town were never going to warm up to Benoit, but Ducasse certainly could have put a better foot forward than he did here. He may very well shake things up, and make Benoit the standout classic French restaurant it was intended to be, but he'll never again have the critics' attention.We and Eater both predicted one star for Benoit. We both win $2 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater NYJBankroll$94.50 $118.67Gain/Loss+2.00 +2.00Total$96.50 $120.67* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost44-20 47-17

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Benoit, Alain Ducasse's classic French bistro. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 60-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1The Skinny: The betting calculus is pretty easy this week. The high-water mark for this type of cuisine in New York is generally agreed to be Balthazar, which carries two stars at the Times, courtesy of Amanda Hesser. No one yet has suggested that Benoit is anywhere near as accomplished as Balthazar, which means one star is the best Ducasse could hope for.Benoit already got the goose-egg from Adam Platt in New York, but Platt has little enthusiasm for French food, and even less understanding, even when it's done perfectly. Bruni, to be sure, is no Francophile either, but we think he'll grasp what's going on better than Platt did. That's a low bar to clear, but we think he'll manage it.Platt admitted that he was grading Ducasse on a tougher curve. There's some fairness in that. When you visit a Ducasse restaurant, you expect something of the quality and attention to detail that the world's most lauded chef is known for. By almost all accounts, Benoit is failing to deliver on its promise. Yet, if the restaurant is worth a star-which in BruniLand usually means \"mediocre\"-it shouldn't be treated more harshly just because of who owns it.We liked Benoit more than most of the critics, awarding two stars. But we wrote that review in the restaurant's early days, before it even had a liquor license. We loved the chicken for two, but based on later reviews it seems the kitchen can't reproduce it consistently. We hated the fries, but we assumed their sogginess would ultimately be rectified-it has not been.We would be torn between one star and zero, but for the fact that Bruni boards the zilch train fairly rarely, and he did so just four weeks ago, with Ago. Yet, make no mistake about it, if this is a one-star review, it won't be the kind Ducasse could be remotely happy about. It has been a doleful review cycle for this restaurant, and it isn't about to get any better.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will most likely award one star to Benoit.

If Robert Moses and other city planners had had more foresight, perhaps we would have subway or commuter rail lines across the George Washington Bridge, instead of just perpetually clogged car lanes. However, apparently they do use the GWB for transporting subway cars on flatbed trucks. That was news to me; I always thought they were delivered by barge to Brooklyn or the Bronx.We happened upon this unusual sight a couple of weekends ago, just after the p.m. rush hour on a Friday night. Police stopped everyone else so that the subway cars could have the bridge for themselves. On the Manhattan side, they went onto city streets-most likely to 207th Street Yard.

Were you arrested or fined for taking these pictures? Recently my parents (who were rushing to the airport) had to wait at the Goethals Bridge tolls because someone in the car in front of them took a picture of the toll fares sign. That car was stopped by the toll collector and forced to wait until police arrived. Then, I'm assuming, they were ticketed.

two dyas ago i was at the 59th st columbus circle station round 4pm and i saw a test train on the downtown express track...maybe the A line is about to get those new subways cars like the L, J, 6, N, etc...this would make sense then (the train on tn the flatbed heading to the 207st yard)...

The A/C/E are not getting any of the new trains. They will be keeping the R-44s and are already slowing getting some R-42s as they are displaced by the R-160s at East NY. There is a rumor that the A is going to get some R-68A's from the Q, but I think that is just rumor - I believe those trains will be moved to the B which is loosing its R40s

A group of six food-board acquaintances had dinner this week at Mia Dona. We'd all been before and were impressed with Michael Psilakis's inventive take on Italian cuisine.Alas, Mia Dona has regressed to the mean. Between us, we tasted sixteen dishes. They were all competently done, but mostly routine-the kind of generic upscale Italian food that could show up on dozens of menus around town. There was nothing, say, to live up to the Calf's Tongue appetizer I had last time, the kind of dish that makes you want to shout, \"You have to eat here!\"Prices have inched up too, though that was to be expected. Mia Dona is still inexpensive by today's standards, but the center of gravity for the entrees, formerly about $20, is now in the mid-twenties, and there's now at least one entree in the thirties. Dinner for six came to about $100 a head, including tax and tip. That included wine, but not a particularly expensive one.It surely doesn't help that Psilakis and his partner, Donatella Arpaia, are juggling about half-a-dozen projects apiece. The server said that both drop by frequently, but the point is that they're only dropping by. Day-to-day, the restaurant is in less capable hands.It also didn't help that there were about three dishes on the menu they were out of or no longer serving-and that was at 7:00 p.m. on a Tuesday evening. One of our companions quipped, \"What about spinach ravioli don't you have, the spinach or the ravioli?\" Out of our first batch of dishes (above), I liked the Bigoli (bottom left) best, with sausage, broccoli rabe, lentils, and peccorino romano. A version of this has been on the menu from the beginning. Stuffed figs (top middle) weren't bad. Among the second batch, a Grilled Trout (bottom left) was the best. The skin was crips, the fish tender, and the beet sauce elevated it above the typical treatment for this kind of fish. Lamb chops (top left) and hangar steak (bottom middle) were both solidly done, but unmemorable. Gnudi (top middle) were chewy. The server initially didn't want to serve us Spiedini (bottom right), as they were out of some ingredients, but they whipped up an acceptable substitute. We had two side dishes, but neither lived up to the terrific spinach we had last time. Among the two desserts we tried, a Panna Cotta (2nd from right) was pretty good, but again, fairly typical of modern-day upscale Italian restaurants.If you happen to be in this section of East Midtown, Mia Dona remains a solid choice, especially as it's still a pretty good bargain, even after the recent price increases. But it's no longer a dining destination. For that, you'll have to visit Anthos, or wait for the next Psilakis/Arpaia project.Mia Dona (206 E. 58th Street between Second & Third Avenues, East Midtown)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

At Bar Milano, Christmas comes early today, with a two-star gift from Frank Bruni. Let's go ahead and call it a one-star restaurant, as it properly is, and quote Frank's evidence:Italian cooking is about a lot more than pasta, but an Italian restaurant that bungles its pasta dishes is like a Las Vegas resort that doesn't let you gamble. There's still plenty to enjoy, but you're likely to feel that the essential point and signature pleasure of the place have been lost.Bar Milano bungles its pasta dishes. Not all of them, but too many, sometimes in small ways, sometimes in big ones. And by pasta dishes I mean the \"primi\" section of the menu, which includes a few risotto dishes. Bar Milano bungles them as well.And:...there are also less rewarding routes, along with an overall sense - surprising, frustrating - that a dedicated team of accomplished pros have undercut a potentially excellent restaurant with some significant missteps.What they do well, they do superbly: a rabbit terrine, crunchy-edged duck breast with duck sausage and lentils. What they do less well - orecchiette with lamb, lobster risotto, tagliatelle with favas - is hard to overlook.And:The dining room conjures a spirit of its own. One design element trumps all others, and it's one of the restaurant's missteps: a long, mesmerizing wall of marble strips and rectangles in different colors.The owners must have paid a fortune for it, and are still paying for it, in terms of the room's awful acoustics. You can see - in the carpeting, in the fabric on banquettes - attempts to fix the problem, but the cure isn't taking. At a crowded hour you'll spend much of your interactions with servers asking them to repeat what they just said or repeating what you've just said. Bar Milano is like a cellphone with constantly bad reception.And lastly:Desserts aren't one of Bar Milano's strengths, but drinks certainly are... Throw back a few of these and you might not even notice the pasta.To be sure, Bruni does find some good things at Bar Milano. But in the Times rating system, \"two stars\" allegedly means \"very good.\" In our book, it shouldn't mean \"half bad.\" There's some serious grade-inflation going on at Times HQ.To be sure, we did predict that Bruni would award two stars here. But we thought he would write the kind of enthusiastic review that a two-star rating calls for. We and Eater at least got the prediction right. We both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1One Star: 3-2 Two Stars: 3-1 √√ Three Stars: 50-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1The Skinny: The easiest thing about this week's bet is to declare what Bar Milano is not, \"a fun three-star place,\" as its owners put it. In so declaring, the Dentons assured themselves of one thing: they will not receive three stars. That's the curse of any restauranteur so foolish as to declare in advance how many stars they are gunning for.We were torn between one star and two, but unlike Frank had the luxury of splitting the difference at 1½. As Eater notes, the reviews have been mixed, but Bruni has waited a while, and perhaps the kitchen has settled down. Lastly, Bruni loves anybody who has touched Mario Batali's halo. If it's a close call, that argues for rounding up.The Bet: We're not as confident as we'd like to be, but we're betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Bar Milano.

Note: After a failed Department of Health inspection, Country gave up the ghost. The downstairs café has re-opened, but the main restaurant is now being renovated, with Country Steak presumably slated for a fall opening.now slated for a March 2009 opening. Yesterday brought the depressing news that Country will close at the end of the summer. Chef/owner Geoffrey Zakarian will replace it with a steakhouse, Country Steak. What a creative name! We adored Country. I awarded four stars to my first visit there, and over three subsequent visits we continued to find it enchanting. Unfortunately, it was in a slow but steady decline. After our most recent visit, about two months ago, we thought the food barely merited three stars. The new chef de cuisine, Willis Loughhead, had turned the formerly exciting menu into an uneven lineup of mostly snoozers. However, Loughhead was still in transition after the departure of the former chef de cuisine, Doug Psaltis. We hoped the downturn was temporary. The market, alas, decided otherwise. About a month ago, Eater put Country on Deathwatch, after the restaurant offered a summer \"Pay What We Pay\" wine list promotion, among other distress signals. Zakarian retorted that reservations were up, and that they \"look forward to business as usual in the dining room.\" Readers were right to be skeptical, when the restaurant was giving away its wine list at wholesale prices—clearly not a show of strength. We now learn that Zakarian was lying through his teeth. Here's the explanation for the new steakhouse idea: I've been trying to do a steakhouse concept for a while... I was looking for a location, and we're already doing a lot of head-to-tail cooking at Country. So we're just going to do it here. I'm installing a wood grill, and we're going to open after our usual summer hiatus in September... We're still looking at different woods, different methods. Yeah, right. And when he denied the restaurant was in trouble—just four weeks ago—the steakhouse concept wasn't already in the works? The shift was enough to awaken Frank Bruni from his blogging slumber. He wonders why steakhouses — as if we didn't have enough of them already — have been immune to the economic downturn. It's the only populist restaurant genre where à la carte entrées routinely hover at $40 or higher; yet, you hardly ever see a steakhouse fail. Most of them, in fact, are routinely full, despite a steakhouse glut over the last few years. It remains to be seen how far Zakarian will wander from the traditional steakhouse model. BLT Steak, Quality Meats, and Craftsteak are all examples of successful re-imaginings of the genre. V Steakhouse was perhaps the most conspicuous failure of that kind. One wonders whether Zakarian will leave the dining room's refined elegance intact, or if he'll try to make it \"look\" more like a steakhouse. One hopes, as Bruni put it, that \"the food at the forthcoming Country Steak will be more imaginative and surprising than that name.\"

There's a popular impression that traditional luxury dining is on the decline. Frank Bruni hardly ever misses an opportunity to tell us so. The trouble is, Frank can't count-or he refuses to. If he did, he'd realize that more of these places have opened in the last four years than have closed.Cru is a restaurant that defies the alleged trend: it has actually become fancier. Servers that once dressed in black now wear suits. The original à la carte menu has been ditched for an $84 three-course prix fixe. In less than four years, the tasting menu has about doubled in price, from $65 to $125.Then there's the wine list. It boasted 65,000 bottles four years ago, over 150,000 bottles today. Most of the collection is stored in a purpose-built wine hanger in upstate New York, with supplies at the restaurant replenished daily. The sommelier said, \"We buy aggressively at auction.\"As it did before, the list comes to you in two hefty volumes, each the size of a phone directory. A 1983 Hermitage was $150, a price the sommelier said was lower than that vintage attracts at auction these days. I could well believe it, as one seldom sees a 25-year-old Rhone in New York at anything less than the price of a monthly mortgage payment.This space on lower Fifth Avenue was once considered cursed, as it played host to one failed restaurant after another. But Cru was an instant hit, and it has stayed that way, which means the owners don't have to dumb it down or make it more casual-options its less successful brethren have had to consider.The chef here is Shea Gallante, a former chef de cuisine at Bouley. Cru's ascent seems almost to mirror the latter restaurant's decline. One must wonder when someone from the next generation will crack the four-star ceiling. Given the dinner we had, Gallante looks like he could be well on the way.The menu seems to have broadened since the early days. Frank Bruni, who awarded three stars, said it was \"tilting heavily toward Italy, nodding slightly toward Spain.\" Aside from a gnocchi starter-and who doesn't serve that these days-the influences here no longer seem grounded in Italy.I've been to Cru only once before, about three or four years ago. I didn't write a review of that visit, but while I certainly recall liking Cru, I don't recall coming away quite as impressed as this time. The kitchen sent out a plate of canapes (above, right) while we pondered the wine list. Shortly thereafter came the amuse-bouche (above, left), a fennel panna cotta with caviar. Gallante had a twist on Foie Gras \"Torchon\" (above, left). It came in a cigar-shaped cylinder, held together with what seemed to be a shaved cucumber. A sauce described as \"peach nectar\" was poured at tableside. His Potato Gnocchi (above, right) were as light as a dream, with tangy rabbit sausage, speck, pollen and spring garlic. We were just as pleased with a Roasted Pekin Duck Breast (above, left), which came with grilled eggplant, leeks, poached morrels and mustard-seed jus. Cuts of Porcelet Pig (above, right)-some places would call it a trio of pig-had chanterelles, golden raisins, tomato and crisp vegetable salad. If Cru had an early failure, it was the dessert program. We love Will Goldfarb, but his wacky creations were a poor fit for a classically elegant place like Cru. Panned by just about everyone, he quickly left. The menu doesn't note the current pastry chef, but he or she deserves to be better known.The palate cleanser (top left) was a buttermilk sorbet with strawberry and elderflower geleee. For dessert, I had the Macadamia Nut Cheesecake Crumble (top right), which worked a lot better than it ought to, with an apricot-lemon thyme jam, hazelnut chocolate praline, and smoked chocolate chip ice cream.Even wackier was the Poached Rhubarb Gratinèe (bottom left), a raspberry-rhubarb crips with-of all things-white asparagus ice cream. You wouldn't expect ice cream made from a vegetable to make a great dessert, but this one did. The asparagus only lurked in the background, its aggression muted by Tahitian vanilla.We finished with petits-fours (bottom right).The service here is top-notch. The mise en place includes some of the fanciest restaurant flatware I've seen, made by the French manufacturer Christofle. The captain and the sommelier were both informative and had plenty to say, but never in a way that seemed intrusive or pompous. Our only complaint was that the runners who dropped off the bonus courses (amuses-bouches, etc.) were practically incomprehensible-a problem many restaurants have.In addition to the prix-fixe and tasting menus, the captain told us about an additional option. Request five, seven, or nine courses, and the chef will cook for you. \"Even I don't know what he'll come up with,\" the captain said. I was tempted, but I figured we ought to try a smaller sample of Chef Gallante's food first.Based on this visit, Cru's Shea Gallante has us convinced. Next time, we're ready to put ourselves in his hands.Cru (24 Fifth Avenue at Ninth Street, Greenwich Village)Food: ***½Service: ***½Ambiance: ***½Overall: ***½

Hundred Acres is the latest brainchild of two haute barnyard cult figures, Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman. Between them, the husband-wife team already have two hit restaurants to their credit, Five Points in NoHo and Cookshop in Chelsea. Both are variations on a similar theme: market-driven menus leaning heavily on produce from local farmers.Last year, they acquired the old SoHo mainstay Provence. They were sentimentally attached to the restaurant, as it was the place where they became engaged. Their original plan was to keep it French, but Gallic cooking wasn't really in Meyer's soul, and Frank Bruni found the food uneven. Meyer told the Times that Provence was packed during the weekends, but weekday business was slow.So after a bit of remodeling, the space now looks like-you guessed it, a gussied-up farmhouse. Meyer and Freeman are once again doing what they do best.The menu here is more downmarket than either of their other two places, with a much gentler price point. Appetizers are $10-12, entrees around $15-20. Your mileage may vary, as the menu changes often, but these prices are about as low as you see at a serious restaurant these days.We were both attracted to the \"Trio of Toast\" - three crisp bruschette topped with rabbit, smoked fish, and liver respectively. It's daring to serve a dish like this, as many diners find at least one of those ingredients a turn-off.We liked the liver the best, and the fish was solid too. The rabbit had cooled off a bit too much, and it tasted oily. You don't see pollack-a member of the cod family-on many restaurant menus. It was cooked in parchment and topped with peas. The preparation was first-class, the fish moist and flavorful.My girlfriend had a lamb sausage burger. The sausage itself was terrific, but the plate was overwhelmed with toppings and garnishes. Shoestring fries weren't very interesting, and after a couple of tastes we left them alone.We finished with a warm rhubarb tart.You've got to give Meyer credit. Run down the roster: a trio of toasts with rabbit, smoked fish and liver; pollack; a lamb sausage burger. They're all the work of a chef who wants to challenge diners, not to pander. Good for him!We noticed, though, that the most popular dish seemed to be the fried chicken. Perhaps diners at Hundred Acres aren't quite ready for Meyer's version of barnyard cooking.The wine list is not extensive, but there were plenty of options under $50.The execution here was slightly uneven, but they've been open only a month, and I assume they'll get the kinks worked out. Service was much more polished than one would expect for such an inexpensive restaurant.Hundred Acres (38 MacDougal Street between Prince & Houston Streets, SoHo)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

In today's Times, Frank Bruni hands out a pair of one-star cupcakes to Gottino and Terroir, two fine restaurants masquerading as wine bars:Both are trawling an easygoing confluence of Italian soul and finger food. And they're reeling in enough- both menus have dozens of options beyond salumi and cheese - to force the question, are Terroir and Gottino restaurants in wine-bar drag?Ms. Williams seems terrified by that notion. On the phone recently she caught herself using the words lunch and dinner and quickly reversed course, saying she didn't want customers looking to Gottino for an actual meal.\"Just squeeze in, eat and drink, because it's not a restaurant,\" she said. \"I don't want people to have restaurant expectations. But if I tell people just to squeeze in, eat and drink, it'll all be O.K.\"Since the \"Restaurants\" column doesn't normally review wine bars, we figured Bruni would choose two that he liked. He acknowledged the \"very real limitations and discomforts of both Gottino and Terroir, where space is tight, the mood is agitated, reservations aren't accepted and you could easily wind up standing and waiting 45 minutes for the privilege of straddling a stool.\" Also, \"overall dining experiences are abbreviated, and not suited to many occasions.\"But make no mistake about it: Gottino and Terroir are those rare establishments that could be happy about a one-star review. Most likely, they were designed with no expectation of a starred Times review at all. It helps that both lend credence to Frank's favorite meme, namely, \"the increasing degree to which distinguished cooking pops up in the unconventional, informal settings that many food lovers often prefer.\" Their menus are \"unfussy compendia,\" and they don't \"play by mustier rules.\"It also helps that both are Italian, which is always a guarantee of Frank's attention-though not necessarily his love.We took the one-star odds on both restaurants. On hypothetical bets of $1, we win $3 at Gottino and $2 at Terroir for a total of $5. Eater, which predicted zero and one star respectively, loses $1 at Gottino and wins $2 at Terroir, for a net of $1.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni files a wine-bar twofer, looking in on Terroir (East Village) and Gottino (West Village). The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): GottinoZero Stars: 2-1 √√One Star: 3-1 Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 50-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1 TerroirZero Stars: 4-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 50-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1The Skinny: We bettors are out of our element today, as neither of these is a traditional review target. It's not even clear what the star system means when applied to a wine bar. But His Frankness has chosen them, so we'll place our bets.In our view, one star is the floor for both of these places. Bruni doesn't normally review wine bars at all. With so many to choose from, why waste space on one he doesn't like? The question is, could either of them get two?At Gottino, the chef is Jody Williams. Her last experience with the star system is one she'd rather forget: a one-star hazing at Morandi that read like zero. (She has since left the restaurant.) We don't think Bruni will pick on her again. Besides, the other critics have actually liked Gottino, including the Underground Gourmet for New York (three hollow stars out of five), Jacqui Gal for MetroMix (3½ stars out of five), and Robert Sietsema for the Village Voice.Terroir is the work of two really smart guys, Marco Canora and Paul Grieco, who have two terrific restaurants already to their credit, Hearth and Insieme. Here as well, the reviews have been positive, including Ed Levine at Serious Eats and Paul Adams for The Sun. We liked it too, though our visit was on opening night, so we didn't assign a rating.The ceiling for Terroir is set by Canora and Grieco's other two restaurants. Bruni awarded two stars to the more ambitious Insieme, while Amanda Hesser did the same for Hearth, which actually actually supplies many of the items that Terroir's non-existent kitchen can't produce itself. Terroir is lots of fun, but unless Frank is crazy it has to be a star lower than the other two places.With Gottino, we have less to go on, but we're having trouble imagining what a two-star wine bar would be like.The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award one star apiece to Gottino and Terroir.

Most chefs and old-line journalists look down on food bloggers with disdain. So what's it like when a four-star chef turns into a food blogger himself? Here's Jean-Georges Vongerichten on the opening of his latest restaurant, Matsugen:My newest New York City restaurant, Matsugen, is open. I am thrilled to bring truly authentic, refined Japanese dishes to this great city in a warm, chic setting.We have some of the best sushi and sashimi in the city, but Matsugen is ultimately a soba house. And what soba. These fresh noodles are the best I've ever had. Starting with whole buckwheat grains, we slowly grind them into fine, medium, and coarse flours each morning. Throughout the day, we prepare the doughs and cook the just-cut noodles to order. Here's Marja, my wife, enjoying a bowl of hot soba.Of course, I love our other Japanese specialties too, like homemade tofu and shabu shabu. Here I am enjoying some tempura at the end of a long night.

Merkato 55: Gorgeous, but a ghost townWhat must it be like to invest a king's ransom in a restaurant that flops? Perhaps the owners of Merkato 55 can tell us.In this gorgeous space, chef Marcus Samuelsson tries to do for African cuisine what Jean-Georges Vongerichten did for Pan-Asian street food at Spice Market, just a few blocks away. But four years after Vongerichten's success, the once trendy Meatpacking District is cursed. No restaurant with serious pretentions has succeeded here lately, and Merkato 55 now seems doomed. It was a ghost town at 7:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening. When we left an hour later, it was a ghost town still.Reviews were mixed. Frank Bruni in the Times and Steve Cuozzo in the Post weren't impressed, but Adam Platt in New York awarded two stars, and Restaurant Girl in the Daily News an amazing three. It appears that the dining public agrees with Bruni and Cuozzo. When a restaurant is nearly empty on a weekend evening, the prognosis must be grim indeed. Eater.com put Merkato 55 on deathwatch, and then pronounced it a shitshow.Shrimp Piri PiriIt doesn't help that Samuelsson's performance is phoned in, and he is only a small-part owner here. Even during the opening period, he was hardly ever sighted. His attentions are no doubt focused on his flagship Swedish restaurant, Aquavit, and various other marketing gimmicks that have his name attached.For all of that, the food at Merkato 55 isn't bad, though it isn't great either. The menu has various \"small bites\" from $3-13, appetizers $12-18, entrees $19-37, and side dishes $6-10. I'm not sure how \"African\" it is, and as Cuozzo noted, on a continent that is home to 53 nations and 900 million people, any concept of a single \"cuisine\" is probably in Samuelson's imagination.To start, my son and I shared Grilled Shrimp Piri Piri ($17), which were slathered in a forgettable, gloppy sauce on a bed of equally forgettable Baby Romaine lettuce. Left: Merguez Sausage; Right: Chicken Doro WatAn entree of Merguez Sausage ($19) is not for those with big appetites, but the contrast of spicy sausage with watermelon and corn worked for me. I loved the Spicy Chicken Doro Wat ($27)-a luscious, tender chicken curry-but it may not be to all tastes: my son absolutely hated it. Left: Steak Dakar; Right: Merkato FriesSince my son had detested both the appetizer and the entree, we ordered the Steak Dakar ($34). The kitchen did a respectable job with the steak, and it's a suitable bail-out dish for those who mistrust the rest of the menu, but it's no more African than the fries that came with it (also available as an $8 side dish). I found the fries too salty, but my son liked them.The beverage menu offers several versions of infused rum punch, overpriced at $14. I found mine overly sweet, dominated by lime juice, and offering no more than a splash of rum.Merkato 55 is a decent place. If I were in the neighborhood, I'd happily go back for the Chicken Doro Wat, though I'm not sure what else you can depend on. Service was attentive, but the staff had hardly anyone else to look after. I'll be surprised if Merkato 55 is still around next year.Merkato 55 (55 Gansevoort St. between Greenwich & Washington Sts., Meatpacking District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: *

Welcome back to Restaurant Outlook, a periodic, highly subjective listing of restaurants we're paying attention to. Fairly New Hundred Acres - This Marc Meyer/Vicki Freeman follow-up to Provence opened a few weeks ago. It's in the Five Points-Cookshop haute barnyard vein. Reservation: June 27. Persimmon - David Chang isn't the only one doing an Asian-inspired prix fixe in the East Village. Reservation: July 12. Forge - Consider us signed up for Marc Forgione's suckling pig for two. Reservation: July 18. Matsugen - Jean-Georges Vongerichten does Japanese in the old 66 space. Naturally, there's no website yet. Reservation: July 19. Duane Park - This sequel to Duane Park Cafe looks interesting, though there aren't many reviews to go on. No plans to visit yet. Talay - Pan-Asian food in Harlem, and how often does that get a mention from Florence Fabricant? No plans to visit yet. Forthcoming All of these restaurants have been announced or mentioned in the press, but some of them may be a long way off. Corton - Paul Liebrandt in the former Montrachet space in early August, or thereabouts. 'Nuff said. Bouley 3.0 - David Bouley's move to the Mohawk Atelier Building at 161 Duane Street. Expected \"by the fall.\" La Fonda del Sol - Mexican you can take seriously? Gael Greene thinks so, and so does Adam Tihany, who'll be designing the space. Expected in \"late fall.\" Susur Lee's first New York restaurant at 200 Allen Street on the Lower East Side, as yet unnamed, but also expected \"come fall.\" Brushstroke - another Bouley restaurant, at 111 West Broadway. Given the well chronicled problems getting this restaurant off the ground, I would be surprised to see it before 2009. SD26 - Tony May's follow-up to the now-shuttered San Domenico, expected April 2009.

***CONTENT
Just when we thought we had Frank Bruni figured out, he uncorked one of the weirdest reviews of his tenure, awarding two stars to Bar Q:In terms of its variability from one stretch of the menu to another, Bar Q is a riddle, but it's a riddle with a solution: don't pay too much attention to the restaurant's name, which alludes to barbecue, or to the culinary direction in which that name points you.With the exception of pork-stuffed spare ribs, richer than a Russian plutocrat and sauced with an elementary school's worth of peanut butter, the dishes that veer the closest to conventional barbecue or that give you bones to grab and gnaw on are among the least enjoyable and impressive.Let us be clear: our complaint isn't that Bruni awarded a different number of stars than we predicted. That has happened plenty of times. And our complaint isn't that Bruni liked a restaurant we didn't. That has happened plenty of times, too.The trouble is that this review, even on its own terms, doesn't read like two stars. We can't recall a review in which he had so many complaints about the food and still awarded two stars-unless it was a \"three-minus,\" such as Gilt or Gordon Ramsay. Bruni's critics sometimes bellyache about exceedingly casual places he elevated to two stars-Sripraphai and Franny's come to mind-but at least he made the case for them as passionately as it could be made. With Bar Q, he didn't even try.It makes nonsense of the current rating at Annisa, Anita Lo's other, and infinitely better, restaurant nearby. Annisa carries the same two stars (Grimes, 2000) as Bar Q, a misguided judgment Bruni shows no signs of remedying.Lastly, he also commits a cardinal no-no, at least in my book: complaining about the tough life restaurant critics (and those who dine with them) lead:A restaurant critic's most practiced companions know that the questions to be asked in advance of a meal go beyond the address, the hour and the (fake) reservation name.More important bits of information: is the visit to the restaurant a first one or a follow-up? And if it's a follow-up, what are they in for? Is the critic doing them a favor, or are they doing him one?As I ushered several of my most loyal and keenly inquisitive sidekicks into Bar Q for Visit 2, I tiptoed around the answers. I stressed that I was paying the check: drink up! I emphasized that Bar Q belonged to Anita Lo, whose cooking at Annisa can be sublime.We know that full-time critics have it rough (I know I couldn't hack it), but keep it out of the review.Eater and I both predicted a one-star review. We both lose $1 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater NYJBankroll$91.50 $111.67Gain/Loss-1.00 -1.00Total$90.50 $110.67* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost41-19 43-17

***CONTENT
We finally know the fate of San Domenico, the old-school Italian mainstay on Central Park West. We've known for months that the May family had lost their lease-more accurately, that they were faced with an increase they considered prohibitive-but not what would happen next.Today, as San Domenico closes for good, owner Tony May announced that the restaurant will move to 19 E. 26th Street at Madison Square Park, and be re-branded SD26.We have to wonder about the timing: if May had announced this on Monday, he could have had it in the Times, which instead just noted the closing without any details about the return.We want to be bullish on this place, but we can't. Leaving aside our awful meal there last year, the new concept sounds like May took an inventory of all the fashionable restaurant memes, and just ticked off the boxes: a 350-seat dining room (more than doubling the current space); a 75-seat lounge; a market that sells the same products used in the restaurant; a \"less-structured menu\"; and don't forget, \"product-driven.\"None of these things are bad per se, but when you see all of them in one restaurant, you get the sense that the restaurant is just following a bunch of trends. By the time it opens, something else will be fashionable, and SD26 will already seem old.Don't get us started on the decor, which looks like a Meatpacking-district reject.The owners hope for an April 2009 opening, which means the over-under is somewhere around next September.

Left: Cafe Gray; Right: GrayzCafe Gray will be closing on Saturday, June 21, about a week earlier than originally planned. On my last visit, I found it almost a ghost town, so I'm not surprised they're closing early. I won't miss the ugly, poorly-designed dining room, though it was sky-high rents, and not the interior designer, that killed the place. A branch of A Voce, most likely destined for mediocrity, will replace it.Meanwhile, Gray Kunz's other restaurant, Grayz, will close on August 10, re-opening on September 1 \"as a full-fledged restaurant...with a new format and a renovated downstairs dining area.\" This is a welcome development.The original concept for Grayz-allegedly a \"lounge and event space\"-was a blunder on all counts. I suspect that private events were supposed to pay most of the freight, and the lounge would have been gravy. The trouble is that catering is a feast-or-famine business: on the days it's not booked, the restaurant earns zero. The downstairs \"event\" space was in use the first time I visited, but empty the second. In these tough economic times, I suspect the \"empty\" nights predominated.The lounge space over-estimated the market for three-star bar food. To be sure, Kunz tweaked the concept over time. When I re-visited about a month ago, Grayz was finally serving a proper restaurant menu-a position it evolved into gradually. But he was still stuck with a lounge vibe, and the aftershocks of mixed reviews.I assume that Grayz 2.0 will serve a Cafe Gray-like menu in the former event space downstairs, so that the upstairs can be what it was meant to be: a lounge. I've only had a peek at the subterranean dining room, but it looks like it could be turned into an elegant restaurant without much trouble-albeit, without windows.Then again, if you know what Kunz did when he had windows-at Cafe Gray-perhaps that's not much of a loss.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni visits Bar Q, Anita Lo's Asian barbecue in the West Village. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 50-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1The Skinny: Luckily for Anita Lo, a zero-star review is off the table. Goose eggs are rare, so you can be sure Bruni won't crack two of them in a row. Ago, last week's spanking victim, takes Bar Q off the hook.We agree with Eater that Adam Platt's two-bagger sets the outer limits of what is possible here. As usual, Platt's reasoning is suspect: \"My wife agitated (loudly) for three stars; my hulking barbecue friends agitated (almost as loudly) for one. Diplomatically, I'll split the difference.\"We think Bruni will sympathize more with Platt's barbecue friends than with his wife. Besides, we found the place just a tad better than mediocre-certainly nowhere close to two stars, either in concept or execution.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Bar Q.

***CONTENT
Over the weekend, we paid a visit to the restaurant at Jedediah Hawkins Inn in Jamesport, New York, on the North Fork of Long Island. The Inn is a gorgeous 1863 manor home in the Italianate style, built and named for a prosperous captain in the Union Army. Once one of the North Fork's most stately homes, it fell into disuse and was at one point slated for demolition. After a two-year restoration, it re-opened in 2005 as an inn and fine dining restaurant.The space is lovely-I would almost call it extraordinary-with comfortable tables generously spaced and an authentic post-Colonial interior, marred slightly by modern art wall paintings that clash with the atmosphere.Chefs Michael Ross and Tom Schaudel serve an haute barnyard menu featuring locally-sourced produce. It would be considered extremely expensive even in Manhattan. Appetizers are $10-24, entrees $27-44. The tasting menu is $95, and there is a Friday night prix fixe at $45.If only the food lived up to the atmosphere. The local Catapano Farm makes a terrific goat cheese, and this featured in several dishes, starting with the amuse bouche and both of our appetizers. I had the Roasted Baby Beet Salad ($15), but the goat cheese was plopped on top of it in an unappetizing, unspreadable lump. It also seemed under-seasoned, with a 25-year sherry vinaigrette failing to make much of an impression.Tempura Squash Blossoms ($16) featured the same Catapano goat cheese, but the tempura had come out of the deep fryer too quickly. It was mushy and not warm enough. Yellowfin Tuna ($37) was sushi-grade, and only barely seared. Fish of that quality doesn't need much help, but here it was overpowered with a warm potato salad, tomato confit, chive oil, a quail egg, and a perversely bitter black olive-caper vinaigrette.In our second entree, we finally had a dish that lived up to the billing: an organic thick-cut New York Strip ($44), which wisely was allowed to make its own case without interference, except for traditional truffled parmesan potatos and a wonderful garlic creamed spinach. My girlfriend said, \"This was the best New York Strip I have ever tasted.\" It was smooth, buttery, and just about perfect.But at a restaurant this expensive, it's not good enough when, out of two appetizers and two entrees, there is only one item that could be recommended without hesitation.The wine list includes offerings from almost every North Fork vinyard-no small feat, as there are dozens of them now. A 2003 Martha Clara Estate Reserve Syrah ($55) needed a few minutes to open up, but thereafter delivered the goods.Service would have been fine, except that the amuse bouche and the appetizers came out almost simultaneously. At 9:00 p.m., we appear to have been the last reservation of the evening, and we sensed the kitchen was trying to get us out in a hurry.We really wanted to like this place, especially given the lovely atmosphere, but the performance was uneven, and based on the reports of others who've dined here, we doubt that our experience was atypical.Jedediah Hawkins Inn (400 South Jamesport Ave., Jamesport, N.Y.)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: ***Overall: *½

Today, Grub Street reports that L'Impero, the Tudor City Italian mainstay, will close on June 29, re-opening in mid-July as Convivio.The \"lugubrious\" interior, which Frank Bruni likened to the inside of a coffin, will get a long-overdue makeover. The menu will offer a $59 four-course prix fixe-that's $5 less than when we visited last year-with \"small plates\" served à la carte.We've often noted that small-plate menus are seldom any cheaper, once you order enough food for a full meal. And because they are more confusing, such menus are prone to upselling and over-ordering. It will be interesting to see if L'Impero, er, Convivo, can avoid falling into that trap.We agree with Cutlets that the makover offers a clean break from the Scott Conant era (he's now at Scarpetta), and it will likely lure Frank Bruni for a re-review. Those are compelling reasons in themselves.

***CONTENT
Today, the Brunatrix bends Ago over the table and administers a first-class spanking, with only the third POOR rating of his tenure:She led us to a round table little bigger than a bike wheel. When our four appetizers later arrived and claimed every square millimeter of it, the waiter audibly contemplated balancing a fifth, communal appetizer that we'd ordered on top of our wine glasses...This restaurant isn't in the hospitality business. It's in the attitude business, projecting an aloofness that permeated all of my meals there, nights of wine and poses for swingers on the make, cougars on the prowl and anyone else who values a sort of facile fabulousness over competent service or a breaded veal Milanese with any discernible meat.The one I had one night was pounded so thin that the breading on top met the breading on the bottom without pausing for much of anything in between. A vegan could have made peace with it...The review proves that Ago is doubly incompetent. In the first place, it offers terrible service to its non-VIP customers. And in the second place, even when it has a VIP customer, it doesn't even know the difference.This review also proves that critic anonymity works. There are about 15 times when the restaurant could have partially redeemed itself, if only they'd recognized that they were serving Frank Bruni. Critics that always trumpet their presence-Restaurant Girl, for instance-are practically assured of never having such an experience.Eater and I both predicted a zero-star review. We both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater NYJBankroll$88.50 $108.67Gain/Loss+3.00 +3.00Total$91.50 $111.67* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost41-18 43-16

Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni visits Ago-that's pronounced \"Ah-go\"-in Robert De Niro's Greenwich Hotel. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 3-1 √√One Star: 2-1 Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 25-1 Four Stars: 1,000-1The Skinny: By all accounts, Ago is a formulaic trattoria. The nominal chef, Agostino Sciandri, for whom the restaurant is named, spends no time in New York, and apparently doesn't intend to. Ago might be a one-star restaurant if everything were working perfectly. The trouble is, it's not that impressive. Alan Richman didn't think so, and neither did we.As Eater notes, Ago is \"goose-train eligible.\" Bruni normally doesn't review obscure restaurants only to trash them, but where you've got a celebrity owner, a celebrity chef, and a well publicized opening, then nobody's safe. Bruni is on record with the view that:...the definition of one star as \"good\" would quickly lose any meaning if the review space didn't occasionally present examples, and reviews, of restaurants that fall below that mark. That argues for zero-star reviews from time to time.To Bruni, \"occasionally\" has usually translated into a handful of zero-star reviews per year, but he has issued no goose-eggs since he rated Harry Cipriani POOR in November 2007. That's seven months ago. The goose train is overdue.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award no stars to Ago.

[Kreiger via Eater]At the new Italian restaurant Scarpetta, we have another telling of the usual story these days: a former three-star chef in one or two-star surroundings.Here, the former big-time chef is Scott Conant, who had five stars to his name between L'Impero (three, per Asimov) and Alto (the deuce, per Bruni). He left the two restaurants in 2007, consulted a while, and is now back in Manhattan at Scarpetta, on the edge of the Meatpacking District.The former Gin Lane space looks like a quiet country home on the outside, despite the Meatpacking madness just steps away. Indoors, there's a large bar space for the bridge-and-tunnel set.The dining room is decorated in a modern rustic chic, with mirrors fastened to the walls with leather saddle belts, and matching saddle leather placemats. A retractable roof could be delightful in the spring and autumn, but it was closed on a hot Saturday evening in June, so that the dining room could be air conditioned.The exposed hard surfaces make Scarpetta a noisy restaurant when it is full-and full is how you'll most likely find it, thanks to the sterling reputation that Conant brings with him. He's serving the same seasonal modern Italian cuisine that brought him accolades at L'Impero.Scarpetta, which means \"little shoe,\" has potential if the kitchen can work out some inconsistencies. Our first and second courses came out quickly, but we waited an eternity for the third, and we observed similar waits at other tables. When they finally came out, our entrees were somewhat disappointing.Prices are in line with other restaurants in \"former three-star chef\" club, with appetizers from $11-17, pastas $22-25, and entrees $25-37. The server told us that appetizer-sized pasta portions were quickly dropped after opening, when they found the kitchen couldn't keep up. That was apparently a wise move, since the kitchen still isn't keeping up.We fashioned a three-course meal by ordering an appetizer to share, followed by a pasta to share, followed by two entrees. The kitchen plated each of the first two courses as separate \"half-orders\" without being prompted. The bread service could quickly become addictive. Four kinds of homemade bread came with soft butter, an eggplant spread, and a pool of olive oil. Raw Yellowtail ($16) in sea salt and ginger oil had a bright taste, and there was a nice ring of fat around the fish, although the salt crust wasn't spread as evenly as it should be. The second course, Agnolotti dal Plin ($24), was impeccable. Pasta pillows were filled with mixed meat and fonduta, with mushrooms and parmigiano. Neither entree quite lived up to expectations. A Boneless Braised Veal Shank ($31) had been allowed to cook too long, and was slightly dry-still edible, but not as well executed as it should be. We loved the bone marrow & gremolata garnish, which was applied at tableside. Pacific Orata ($26) needed to have a crisper skin. I should note that both dishes had great potential. Neither was bad, and both could very well be winners in the long run.The wine list emphasizes Italy and France, and there are plenty of bottles at reasonable prices. A 2000 Portulano was only $53.For a restaurant as crowded as this, the serving staff did an excellent job of staying on top of things. This bodes well for Scarpetta, assuming that the kitchen can work out of its early growing pains. There is some very good food here, though no one should have the illusion that the quality or consistency matches the palmiest days at L'Impero.Scarpetta (355 W. 14th Street, east of Ninth Avenue, Meatpacking District)Food: *½Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Sheridan Square

***CONTENT
[Kreiger via Eater] Note: Sheridan Square closed in September 2008. Sheridan Square, as we noted a couple of weeks ago, is the latest of many new restaurants featuring former three-star chefs in casual surroundings. In this case, we have Gary Robins, who was a hit at the Biltmore Room, but flamed out at the Russian Tea Room. This trend is, I suppose, partly the product of tough economic times, as well as the judgment that most diners are turned off by stuffy dining rooms and $85 prix fixe menus. Restaurants need to be careful, though. Even in pared down surroundings, high-end entrées tend to hover around $30. At that price, diners expect first-class service and ambiance, which some of the latest restaurants fail to deliver. It appears to us that Sheridan Square has the balance about right. I say that with the caveat that, at the table next to us, a couple complained so bitterly about service delays that the manager comped their entire meal. We didn't experience anything like that, but the incident says a lot about growing pains at a two-week-old restaurant. Left: Foie Gras Ravioli with spring vegetables & summer truffles; Right: Tagliarini with Mussels & Clams There have already been multiple food board posts praising the Foie Gras Ravioli ($15) with spring vegetables and summer truffles. You can add me to the dish's many fans. My girlfriend loved the Tagliarini ($13) with mussels and clams. The relatively low price of both appetizers somewhat offsets the entrées, which skew expensive. Left: Anise Scented Crisped Long Island Duck Breast; Right: Rosemary Crusted Australian Rack of Lamb Anise Scented Crisped Long Island Duck Breast ($27) was very good, though it was undercut by the gloppy plating of creamed cauliflower, braised fava beans and spring peas. The dish tasted better than it looked. Rack of Lamb is one of two dishes appearing on the menu with \"m.p.\" instead of a price, and diners may be surprised to find that it costs $42. It is a larger portion than it needs to be: my girlfriend couldn't finish five hefty ribs. However, it is an excellent dish, with the wood-burning oven imparting a nice smoky flavor. As with the dush, the puddle of sauce is not attractively plated. There are some glitches to be worked out, but so far it seems to us that Sheridan Square is one of this year's better additions to the West Village dining scene.

Not So Bitter Betty
2008-07-20 00:00:00
I am one half of the couple that you mentioned in the review and I must say I am quite offended that you refer to us as “bitterly” complaining. We were in fact upset, as we were very excited to go there and were spending a pretty penny on the dinner. It is no wonder you didn’t experience any poor service as you had every member of the wait staff fawning over you as you did nothing to disguise the fact that you were a food critic, announcing yourself upon arrival and taking pictures of your food during the service. I think an honest review can only come from remaining anonymous and being a “real patron.” In fact I feel the only reason why our service was lacking was your indiscretion.With that said the food was fantastic and we let them know that when the management came over to speak with us. In fact we have been back two times since and had a great experience. Had the manager not come over and comped our meal, which we tried to refuse and were in no way looking for, we wouldn’t be such fans of the place.Again, we highly recommend the venue, just ask not to be seated next to a food critic.

Dear Betty,My use of the word “bitter” may have been a poor choice. I was merely trying to indicate the intensity of your displeasure, not suggesting that it was unjustified. I really didn’t follow events at your table that closely, but I am sure you had every right to be annoyed by the service.I must take issue, however, with your claim that I “announced” myself upon arrival. I never do that. I realize, of course, that servers are likely to notice the camera, and therefore to guess that I might be blogging about it. But I don’t tell them why I’m doing it, and they normally don’t ask. Picture-taking is so commonplace nowadays that restaurants basically shrug it off. I don’t get VIP service just by breaking out the camera. And I think I dine out often enough that I would have noticed the difference, if that were the case.Anyhow, what would it say about the restaurant if my presence was enough to throw the rest of their service off-kilter? I am not so self-absorbed as to think I have that kind of influence—nor would I want it. Restaurants aren’t perfect. I would assume you simply caught them at less than their best. That happens sometimes, and it happens to me even when I have my camera.I’m sorry you had a bad experience there; I wouldn’t want that to happen to anybody. But I think you should recognize it for what it was—a poor performance by the restaurant—rather than trying to put the blame on me.

I dropped by Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill the other day for a snack. A pulled pork appetizer from the daily specials list, at $12.25, was impressive. I didn't note the details, but it was essentially a cross between American barbecue and miso soup.I was seated at the end of the sushi bar, where a huge fish head was staring at me. Initially, I wasn't sure if it was real, but it surely was. Periodically, a chef would pour a bucket of ice cubes into the mouth-without which it would turn foul in a hurry. Service was a little helter-skelter, as one expects in this type of restaurant. I wasn't impressed the last time I visited, but the pulled pork appetizer persuaded me that perhaps Blue Ribbon Sushi is worthy of more attention.Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill (308 W. 58th Street in the Thompson Hotel, 6 Columbus Circle)

Welcome back to Restaurant Outlook, a periodic, highly subjective listing of restaurants we're paying attention to. Fairly New Sheridan Square - We already posted our first impressions, but we're going back for a closer look. Reservation: Tonight. Scarpetta - Italian restaurant by Scott Conant, formerly of Alto and L'Impero. Early reports are promising, but it's in the Meatpacking District, which hasn't seen a serious restaurant in years. Reservation: tomorrow. Hundred Acres - This Marc Meyer/Vicki Freeman follow-up to Provence opened a few weeks ago. It will be in the Five Points-Cookshop haute barnyard vein. Reservation: June 27. Talay - Pan-Asian food in Harlem, and how often does that get a mention from Florence Fabricant? No plans to visit yet. Persimmon - David Chang isn't the only one doing an Asian-inspired prix fixe in the East Village. No plans to visit yet. Duane Park - This sequel to Duane Park Cafe looks interesting, though there aren't many reviews to go on. No plans to visit yet. Forthcoming All of these restaurants have been announced or mentioned in the press, but some of them may be a long way off. Matsu Gen - Jean-Georges Vongerichten does Japanese in the old 66 space. Opening is a couple of weeks away. Naturally, there's no website yet. Lever House - Bradford Thompson is taking over the kitchen this month. We'll wait for the early reports before we decide whether to pay a visit. Corton - Paul Liebrandt in the former Montrachet space in early August, or thereabouts. 'Nuff said. Bouley 3.0 - David Bouley's move to the Mohawk Atelier Building at 161 Duane Street. Expected \"by the fall.\" La Fonda del Sol - Mexican you can take seriously? Gael Greene thinks so, and so does Adam Tihany, who'll be designing the space. Expected in \"late fall.\" Susur Lee's first New York restaurant at 200 Allen Street on the Lower East Side, as yet unnamed, but also expected \"come fall.\" Brushstroke - another Bouley restaurant, at 111 West Broadway. Given the well chronicled problems getting this restaurant off the ground, I would be surprised to see it before 2009. Off the List Merkato 55 - Now that it's officially a certified disaster, we're in no particular hurry to visit. If we happen to be in the neighborhood, then maybe... The Redhead - Despite a mostly enthuisiastic 29-page Mouthfuls thread about the Thursdays-only family-style meal, we'll wait till after a forthcoming expansion. Greenwich Grill - Near the office, but more likely a choice for a rainy day.

Exit Montrachet, Enter Corton with Paul Liebrandt

***CONTENT
Ending months of speculation, the Times reports today that the former Montrachet space will re-open \"in about two months\" as Corton, with Paul Liebrandt in the kitchen.In 1985, Montrachet was an iconic restaurant, blazing a trail in TriBeCa, which was then considered remote and even a bit dangerous-hardly the place where one would put a three-star restaurant. We visited Montrachet a couple of times near the end. We found it to be serving respectable, mid-range three-star food, but some people thought the restaurant had slipped, particularly the Times' Amanda Hesser, who demoted it to two stars.The list of chefs that worked at Montrachet is practically a Who's Who of New York City dining: David Bouley, Terrance Brennan (Picholine, Artisanal), Kerry Heffernan (Eleven Madison Park, South Gate), Claudia Fleming (Gramercy Tavern, North Fork Table & Inn), Harold Moore (Commerce). Looking back on the list of names that worked here, you have to wonder if perhaps there wasn't quite enough stability in the kitchen.The ringleader, then as now, was restauranteur Drew Nieporent.Montrachet closed in 2006, for what was originally described as a mere \"vacation.\" Since then, we've learned that \"closed for vacation\" often means, quite simply, closed. It's not clear what took so long, when the Nieporent-Liebrandt partnership was not exactly a secret. Apparently there was an ugly corporate divorce between Nieporent and his original Montrachet partner, Tony Zazula, who is now with Harold Moore at Commerce.The Times couldn't even get a straight answer on who owns the Montrachet name. In any case, they're renaming it \"Corton,\" which like Montrachet is a French wine appellation from Burgundy. Sadly, much of Montrachet's prized wine cellar was auctioned off last year. We can only hope that the new restaurant's wine program will be as impressive as the old one.According to the Times, there space will be extensively renovated to a Stephanie Goto design in \"textured white walls, chartreuse upholstery and touches of gold.\" Like many restaurants these days, Corton will have a \"wine wall.\" The dining room will seat 70, or about 30 fewer than Montrachet did. This will allow Liebrandt to expand the kitchen, which after twenty years is probably overdue for a facelift.Liebrandt must be the most popular chef that has never had a successful restaurant. Whether it was Atlas, Papillon or Gilt, Liebrandt always attracted admirers, but never enough paying customers. At Atlas, he at least had critical acclaim (three stars from Grimes), but not at Gilt (a pathetic two-spot from Frank Bruni). We think Bruni severely underrated Liebrandt's achievement at Gilt, but history will record that Liebrandt lasted less than a year.We think the Corton team won't be so foolish as to disclose their aspirations, but make no mistake: Corton is gunning for four stars, perhaps the last significant accolade that has eluded Nieporent. We're a little doubtful that they will open in August, given that we walk by the site fairly often and have never seen so much as a peep of activity. But if anyone can pull it off, Nieporent can.The timing is perfect, if they can stick to it. An opening in two months would put Corton's debut in early August, traditionally a slow period for fine dining. That will give the staff time to iron out the kinks before the fall season gets in gear after Labor Day.

The Payoff: Elettaria

***CONTENT
Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awards one star to Elettaria, finding the performance too inconsistent, the ambiance too scatter-brained:The ostensibly individual tables bisecting the dining room are essentially one way-too-long communal table, which makes for odd traffic patterns.And why is this central and most crucial region of the restaurant so cramped when there's so much elbowroom and extra space around the bar up front? Elettaria is lovely but awkward, and its awkwardness undercuts Mr. Nawab's impressively creative cooking.But then his cooking also undercuts itself, some dishes mirroring the setting: seductive in the abstract, less so in actuality. There's too broad a gap between the best of them, which are excellent, and the rest. I had only one meal that wholly delighted me, while the others were a mix of exciting, intriguing and frustrating moments.We and Eater both win $2 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

Tasting Room Closes

***CONTENT
Eater reported yesterday that there is a \"Closed for Renovations\" sign at the Tasting Room. In the Comments section, chef Colin Alevras confirmed that the restaurant is, indeed, just plain closed (see #16). Update: Apparently a new restaurant by former A Voce chef Andrew Carmellini will go into the former Tasting Room space. Further Update: Apparently not. The Tasting Room had a terrific cult following at their original location in the East Village. When they moved to Elizabeth Street in NoLIta, they tripled the size of the restaurant. We never visited the original Tasting Room, and so can't make comparisons, but perhaps Alevras wasn't able to scale the concept up to such a large space. Although we enjoyed the Tasting Room, the new space never quite attracted the rapturous reviews of the old. When I stopped by recently to sample Alevras's \"Old McDonald's Hamburger,\" I noticed that the menu had been retooled; ironically, it no longer offered \"tasting\" portions, which of course was the original point of the restaurant. Business seemed to be slow. There is no justice in the restaurant industry. The Tasting Room wasn't perfect, but it was better and less expensive than plenty of places that are still open. The Alevrases still have their original space on 1st Street between First & Second Avenues, which they transformed into a wine bar when the NoLIta location opened. What will they do now? We'll have to wait and see.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni takes a belated look at Elettaria, Akhtar Nawab's Indian-American fusion restaurant in Greenwich Village. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 5-1 One Star: 2-1 √√ Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 8-1 Four Stars: 1,000-1The Skinny: As usual, there are only two possible outcomes here: one star or two. The closeness of the odds (2-1 and 3-1 respectively) shows that this is basically a coin toss. Reviews have been all over the map, ranging from Platt's one-star slap to RG's three-star rave. Will the real Elettaria please stand up?The X-factor is the rather long time it took Bruni to get around to this review: it has been more than six weeks since most of the other critics filed, including this blog, which awarded two stars. We can only assume that Bruni saw potential, and wanted to give Elettaria time to resolve the early kinks. Bruni doesn't usually give restaurants that chance, so you've got to figure that he really wanted to like this place.We are torn, but our sense is that the cramped ambiance, abbreviated menu and chronic inconsistency will rate mentions in this review.The Bet: We are betting, with some reluctance, that Frank Bruni will award one star to Elettaria.

***CONTENT
Note: Savarona has closed. The new restaurant Savarona takes a double gamble. The first is that New Yorkers will warm up to haute Turkish cuisine, of which this is practically the only example in Manhattan. The second is that they'll do so in Sutton Place, a tiny East Midtown enclave not easily reached by mass transit. I can't say whether the gamble will pay off. The only thing I can say is: I certainly hope so. Savarona deserves your attention. In a town where so many restaurants are plainly derivative, this one blazes its own trail. The chef, Tevfik Alparslan, comes from Istanbul via La Tour d'Argent and Gordon Ramsay at Claridge's. His menu has a recognizably Mediterranean tint, but every dish we tried led us to unfamiliar territory, and quite happily so. The owners have given Alparslan a beautiful stage on which to perform: a comfortable space, elegantly redecorated. The lighting is warm and inviting, the tables generously spaced. The restaurant is on the ground floor of a residential building in the shadow of the Queensboro bridge, but set comfortably back from the street. There is room for outdoor seating in good weather. There is an ample bar and a spacious, semi-private dining room that seats twelve. Appetizers are generally priced in the teens, entrees in the twenties. The reasonably priced wine list is Mediterranean-centric, though there are no actual Turkish wines, curiously enough. There wasn't as much variety as I'd like; most of the bottles were fairly young. (We had a 2005 Italian Syrah; $56.) There was a nice bread service, with four kinds of homemade bread and a fried cheese spread (above right). I enjoyed the Stuffed Mackerel ($12; above left), accented with fresh pine nuts, currants, asparagus, warm fennel, and a fresh red pepper emulsion. My girlfriend had the traditional Mezze Platter ($14; above right). Two of the five items were made with eggplant, which is about the only food I don't eat, but she said they were terrific. I liked the yogurt cucumber and the chicken salad, the latter topped with pine nuts. I thought that the entrees surpassed the appetizers, but my girlfriend said, \"I'm not so sure; that eggplant was pretty damned good.\" An entree of Stuffed Grape Leaves ($24; above left) was remarkable: four plump grape leaves stuffed with beef tenderloin in a sweet cherry-apricot sauce. The Sultan Kebab ($25; above right) had tender meatballs and diced beef in a yogurt and light chili sauce. The pastry chef here trained in French kitchens, and the staff admitted that the deserts are more French than Turkish. Pineapple ($12) with mango sorbet, mascarpone and spun sugar could make an appearance anywhere. It was one of the most enjoyable desserts we've had in quite some time. There were minor service glitches, as one might expect at a three-week-old restaurant. Plates were deposited in front of the wrong diner. The cheese spread arrived a bit too late. One item wasn't quite as warm as it should be. The food at Savarona is very good, and the space is as relaxing as any we've visited in recent months. Since there is almost zero foot traffic on this stretch of 59th Street, the restaurant will be heavily dependent on word-of-mouth and favorable reviews. This is a restaurant we'll be rooting for.

***CONTENT
Note: This is a review of Elizabeth under chef John Iconomou, who has since left the restaurant. A new menu is allegedly in the works under his replacement, Ryan Grant, formerly of Ilili. The new restaurant Elizabeth showcases several recent trends. In the first place, we have a former three-star chef working in much humbler surroundings—trying to \"make it small\" after he'd already made it big. That chef is Doug Psaltis, who worked at both The French Laundry and Country. In the second place, Psaltis is merely consulting, with another former colleague from Country, John Iconomou, in the kitchen day-to-day. Lastly, there's a \"small plates\" format, which at its best encourages grazing and sharing, but at its worst encourages over-ordering or leaves the customer confused about how much to order. The outdoor gardenIn part, these trends reflect the preferences of some younger diners, who want to enjoy haute cuisine without putting on a coat and tie, who don't want to be locked into the standard three-course meal, and who don't want to pay the higher prices that fancier restaurants need to charge to recover their overheads. These trends also reflect tough economic times: the risks and the capital required to open a multi-starred restaurant. Some of the post-modern, deconstructed restaurants are terrific. Others are derivative—pedestrian—ordinary. Elizabeth is in the latter camp. The space is configured somewhat like a railroad apartment, with several dark rooms in sequence, leading to a bright, cheery garden space with a large skylight. The garden looks like it dropped in from another restaurant; it looks like nothing like the indoor space. Most patrons seem to prefer the garden. It was full at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night, but the dark indoor rooms, where we were seated, were empty. They started to fill up a bit later on. The menu is divided into three categories with five dishes apiece: First ($8–14), Second ($11–13) and Third ($14–19). Naturally, the idea is to encourage you to order one from each category, though we ignored that advice. If our experience is any guide, one appetizer and one entrée (selected from the third category) is sufficient unless you're unusually hungry. For the record, desserts are $7–9, a cheese plate $13. House cocktails, at $12–14, are a bit over-priced in relation to the rest of the menu. The wine list is more reasonable, though it is less than half a page, with about 10 choices by the glass and another 10 by the bottle. We had a respectable Shiraz for $45. A Green Gazpacho ($9) with cucumber and passion fruit was probably the best thing we tasted, cool and summery. In the middle of the bowl was a scoop of mango sorbet; the soup was poured over it at tableside. A lettuce salad ($8) was competently done. Pork Tenderloin ($14) was prepared in the traditional manner, with applesauce, sour cream, and potato latkes. A Crispy Cheese Burger ($14) wasn't tender enough. It was served with a bizarre frisbee of burnt cheese twice that was twice the diameter of the bun. Fries ($5) were huge and far too mushy on the inside. I called them \"horse fries,\" meaning that only a horse could love them. The restaurant has been open for about six weeks. Some early reports complained about service, but we found it mostly under control. We found nothing at Elizabeth that was worthy of the former chef de cuisine at the French Laundry. The kitchen serves decent comfort food. Elizabeth (265 Elizabeth Street between Houston & Prince Streets, NoLIta) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

First Look: Sheridan Square

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a full review of Sheridan Square.The long-delayed Sheridan Square opens tonight in Greenwich Village. The restaurant has been in a \"soft open\" for the last couple of days, and after reading a glowing review yesterday on Mouthfuls, I decided to stop in for dinner.The chef here, Gary Robins, joins a gaggle of former three-star chefs opening in much humbler Greenwich Village settings. Bar Blanc is run by a trio of Bouley alumni, Bobo opened with a former Ducasse chef (who has since left), Commerce has Montrachet's Harold Moore, and Sheridan Square has Robins, who earned three stars at the Biltmore Room and, less honorably, numerous pans at the Russian Tea Room.Sheridan Square might be the best of this quartet of restaurants, all within two square blocks of one another. We rated Commerce an outright failure, and Frank Bruni gave it only one star. Bar Blanc got the two stars it likely wanted, but it continues to be dogged by service complaints; we consider it an under-achiever. We liked Bobo (not yet reviewed by Bruni), but the jury is still out; it appears to be righting the ship after a nearly disastrous start.Bobo certainly has the loveliest space, though Sheridan Square rates a respectable second, with a cheery modern vibe, large windows that admit plenty of natural light, a woodburning stove, white tablecloths, and elegant service. It's a pity those windows don't offer something nicer to look at. Like all restaurants located on avenues and major cross streets, the view is nothing special.There's a divided kitchen, with most of the cooking done in the basement, and some of the finishing and plating done upstairs in view of the dining room. I don't quite understand the allure of open kitchens, but this one seemed to be humming along efficiently without being too much of a distraction.The seasonal (\"Late Spring\") menu is priced about in line with the neighborhood's other upscale newcomers, with starters $11-19, entrees $24-36, and side dishes $8. I counted at least four entrees that are prepared in the wood-burning oven, and I suspect they'll be among the most popular. I wasn't happy to see two entrees with \"m.p.\" instead of a price (lamb, strip steak). Given the ease of reprinting these days, and a seasonal menu that changes frequently, how hard is it to reprint when the price changes?A mis-named appetizer called \"Crispy Squash Blossom\" ($17) was mildly disappointing. The brown fritter in the photo is basically an oddly shaped jumbo lump crab cake with a tangy mango chili sauce. The corn salsa and avocado were a bit more exciting, but seemed to have parachuted in from a different appetizer. A couple of ugly shards of lettuce didn't add anything either, and for the life of me I couldn't find any squash.I adored the Wood Grilled Carolina Trout ($24), plated with golden beets in a honey ginger vinaigrette, wild rice, garden beans and yuzu hazelnut brown butter. Everything in this dish worked beautifully together, punctuated by two ample filets of tender trout and a mild smoky flavor imparted by the wood-burning oven.Service was about as smooth and assured as I've seen in a restaurant that is not yet technically open. I did not order wine, but the wine list, though not particularly deep, seemed to be fairly priced, with plenty of bottles under $50 and a good selection by the glass. I had a couple of terrific cocktails, but there was no printed cocktail menu. Bread service could be better, with only humdrum sourdough bread and a caraffe of olive oil as the only choice.I don't assign ratings to restaurants that are not yet open, but Sheridan Square seems to have all of the pieces in place for a solid two stars. I look forward to coming back again in another month or two.Sheridan Square (138 Seventh Ave. S. between W. 10th & Charles Sts., West Village)

After a week off, Frank Bruni returns today with a review of The Harrison, clocking in at the upper end of two stars:How often, really, do you go through four appetizers, entrees and desserts without confronting a total bore, a total bust or an overwrought underachiever?Take it from someone who spends as many hours dining out as a cat does dozing: not often. Even the best, most exciting restaurants stumble from time to time over their own ambitions. They're exhilarating rides, but also risky ones.The Harrison, in contrast, is the very definition of dependable, poised to impress you, if not quite wow you...Like the Red Cat, which is technically its older sibling but feels like its younger one, the Harrison doesn't promise or deliver out-and-out excitement. But it safeguards against disappointment as well as just about any other Manhattan restaurant.We haven't yet visited The Harrison under new chef Amanda Freitag, but Bruni's review captured the spirit of the place as we recalled it from past visits, though his complaint about the decor seemed off-key: \"...the Harrison's visual evocation of a country inn in the big city still strikes me as more stodgy than cozy.\" We don't find it stodgy at all.We win $3 on our hypothetetical one-dollar bet. Eater, who had predicted three stars, loses a dollar. Eater NYJBankroll$87.50 $103.67Gain/Loss-1.00 +3.00Total$86.50 $106.67* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost39-18 41-16

***CONTENT
Eater reports that Veritas chef Ed Cotton has been fired. Gregory Pugin, currently sous chef at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon, will be replacing him.There's no doubt that Cotton is gone: his name is now completely banished from the Veritas website. The second half of the story is mere rumor, but believable enough that we'll run with it. [Update: The Times confirms the story.]Historically, the food at Veritas has been very good, but low-key and not-at-all showy, which allowed the restaurant's nonpareil wine collection to take center stage. We thought that Ed Cotton's menu at Veritas still merited three stars, but as we were never there under founding chef Scott Bryan, we had nothing to compare it to. Some people thought that Veritas had lost a step.If they've hired Pugin, it surely means the owners are ready to serve food that can command as much attention as the wine list does.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni takes a pulse check on TriBeCa standout The Harrison under new chef Amanda Freitag. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 10-1 One Star: 6-1Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 5-1 √√ Four Stars: 12-1The Skinny: It may not be fair, but chef changes at existing restaurants don't get the same press as brand new restaurants, even where the change is fairly dramatic. The Times is the only paper in town that at least makes the attempt, however irregularly, to re-review restaurants where there has been a significant change of personnel-and indeed, sometimes when there hasn't been.When Amanda Freitag took over at The Harrison, owner Jimmy Bradley told Grub Street, \"We were doing French cookery in a New American style, but with Amanda the menu is going to be lusty, soulful, rustic Mediterranean-inspired cookery.\" That's enough to make The Harrison, for all intents and purposes, a brand new restaurant. But as it's still called \"The Harrison,\" the rest of this town's critics have basically ignored it.So I don't have any kind of critical baseline to go on here. I can tell you that William Grimes awarded two stars shortly after The Harrison opened in 2001, with the Little Owl's Joey Campanaro in the kitchen. Bruni wrote a favorable Diner's Journal follow-up after Brian Bistrong took over.I can also tell you that I've loved The Harrison both times I visited. The chef has changed, but what hasn't changed is Jimmy Bradley's sure-handed touch, which was good enough to attract a generous two-star Bruni review for Bradley's other restaurant, The Red Cat.Eater is taking the three-star odds, betting that Bruni will award three stars for the same reason he did at Dovetail: for the price, The Harrison is very good indeed, with appetizers mostly below $15 and entrees mostly in the mid-twenties. We also realize that Italian or Italian-influenced menus, if they are good, often get a \"bonus star\" from Bruni.Against that, we haven't heard the kind of raves about The Harrison that we heard about Dovetail, and we subscribe to the theory that three-star restaurants usually don't hide in plain sight. Our gut tells us that if Freitag were turning out three-star food, lots of folks would have noticed by now. Bruni has given out a lot of three-star ratings this year: at some point the average needs to return to normal.The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award an enthusiastic two stars to The Harrison.

Note: You can probably guess what rating Bar Milano got from Italian-loving Frankie two-stars, despite \"bungled pastas.\" The rest of the dining community, including us, had a more muted response. Bar Milano closed at the end of 2008 and has re-opened as a clone of the same owners' more casual place on the Lower East Side, 'inoteca. There's no shortage of great Italian restaurants in New York, so it's tough for a new one to command attention. So far, Bar Milano is off to a great start. In the first six weeks, reservations have generally been tough to come by. It helps to have Jason Denton running the show. With four previous establishments ('Ino, 'Inoteca, Lupa, Otto), he has shown a knack for the kind of stylish-yet-casual restaurant that feels like a neighborhood place, but has the following of a dining destination. It's something that many restauranteurs aspire to, but that Denton seems invariably to get right. Joining him here are brother Joe Denton ('Ino, 'Inoteca) and chefs he lured from two of those restaurants, Eric Kleinman ('Inoteca) and Steve Connaughton (Lupa). A name like \"Bar ______\" can mean almost anything these days (just like \"Bistro\" or \"Brasserie\"). This is the fifth Bar Something-or-other that I've reviewed this year, and they have little in common. I'm not sure it has much to do with \"Milano,\" either. The cuisine is allegedly Northern Italian, but only in the loosest sense. Rattlesnake There is indeed a lovely bar here, and the house cocktails are worth a look. From a set called \"Lost & Somewhat Forgotten\" I had a Rattlesnake ($13), with Rittenhouse rye, Pernod, lemon juice, powdered sugar and egg white. The bar tab was transferred to my table without complaint, which ought to happen all the time, but often doesn't. There are 20 American whiskies available for a classic Manhattan cocktail, or 10 gins for a classic Martini. The menu offers no suggestions for any of the 9 vodkas. Bread service The dinner menu is somewhat pricey for this patch of Third Avenue. Success will depend on attracting a destination crowd, as the Dentons have historically done at their lower priced restaurants. Antipasti here are $10-15, primi $9-24, and secondi $20-43 (but most under $30). An eight-course tasting menu looks like it's a bargain at $85. Bread service is a bit spartan, with two people asked to share a single slender bread stick, a small slice of bread and an equally puny dinner roll. Left: Tajarin con Porri Selvatici; Right: Agnolotti di Gamberi We had mixed reactions to our pasta starters. Tajarin con Porri Selvatici ($17), or pasta with ramps and bread crumbs, had a nice crunchy texture. I liked the way the ramps were integrated into the dish, instead of being just seasonal add-ons used mostly for show. But Agnolotti di Gamberi ($18), or shrimp-filled pasta with peas and mint, was not nearly as appetizing, with the taste of peas being far too dominant. Left: Costolette di Maiele (pork chop); Right: Cotoletta alla Milanese (veal chop) A pork chop ($26) and a veal chop ($32) were both expertly done, though if I'd stumbled on either preparation in another restaurant, I wouldn't have associated them with Italy. The pork chop lay on a bed of escarole and was topped with a mustard fruit somewhat redolent of applesauce; the veal chop had a light, delecate bread crumb crust. The meal ended with a couple of small petits-fours that seemed, like the bread service to start with, a little skimpy. Service was polished and attentive, but this was the Friday evening before Memorial Day, and the dining room was clearly less busy than it would ordinarily be. The Dentons told W Magazine that they envisioned Bar Milano as \"a fun three-star place.\" Bar Milano is fun, but it isn't three stars. The food here is generally solid, but there are some soft spots on the menu, and there isn't enough Milano in it. Like their other restaurants, it is a slightly over-achieving neighborhood place.

Welcome back to Restaurant Outlook, the quasi-weekly highly subjective listing of restaurants we're paying attention to. Fairly New Bar Milano - Early reviews are mixed, but the Lupa/'Inoteca guys have a strong track record. Reservation: tonight. Elizabeth - Former Country chef de cuisine Doug Psaltis is designing the menu here. It's only a consulting gig, which makes us skeptical, and Psaltis seldom remains anywhere for long, which makes us doubly skeptical. But at a low price point we're willing to roll the dice. Reservation: May 30. Savarona - The rare serious Turkish restaurant in New York is surely worth a try. Reservation: May 31. Hundred Acres - This Marc Meyer/Vicki Freeman follow-up to Provence opened last week. It will be in the Five Points-Cookshop haute barnyard vein. A hit is no sure thing, but I wouldn't bet against them. Reservation: June 6. Scarpetta - Italian restaurant by Scott Conant, formerly of Alto and L'Impero. Early reports are promising, but it's in the Meatpacking District, which hasn't seen a serious restaurant in years. Reservation: June 7. The Redhead - There's a twenty-page Mouthfuls thread about the Thursdays-only family-style meal, but it didn't get my attention till the Times review this week. No plans to visit yet. Duane Park - This sequel to Duane Park Cafe looks interesting, though there aren't many reviews to go on. No plans to visit yet. Merkato 55 - Reviews have been mediocre. We've had several reservations, all cancelled for various reasons. My girlfriend no longer wants to go, so I'll have to drop in one night after work. No plans to visit yet. Greenwich Grill - Of interest mainly because it's near the office. No plans to visit yet. Forthcoming All of these restaurants have been announced or mentioned in the press, but some of them may be a long way off. Lever House - Bradford Thompson is taking over the kitchen next month. We'll wait for the early reports before we decide whether to pay a visit. Bouley v 3.0 - David Bouley's move to the Mohawk Atelier Building at 161 Duane Street. Expected \"by the fall.\" Susur Lee's first New York restaurant at 200 Allen Street on the Lower East Side, also expected \"come fall.\" Brushstroke, another Bouley restaurant, at 111 West Broadway. Given the well chronicled problems getting this restaurant off the ground, I would be surprised to see it before 2009. Restaurant Liebrandt, with Paul Liebrandt (formerly of Gilt) at the helm. This week, Eater reported that it's \"set to go into the old Montrachet space.\" We walk by there regularly, and haven't seen the slightest whiff of activity.

Pegu Club

***CONTENT
I'm a newcomer to the cocktail revolution. The timing and temperament of my dining habits are such that I'm more likely to have a sit-down meal with wine than to have a liquid dinner at a bar. But the craft and care that goes into the better cocktail menus has started to get my attention, if belatedly.Pegu Club, which turns 3 in August, is practically the senior citizen of the post-modern cocktail circuit. It \"hides in plain sight,\" like many places in the genre-in this case, behind a barely labeled red door on Houston Street. No one who casually walks by would realize it's a bar. Even those who are looking for Pegu Club sometimes have trouble finding it.The bar is named for a nineteenth-century British officers' club in Burma, and one can just detect a bit of the fin-de-siècle elegance they were aiming for. It's a large, comfortable, and beautifully decorated space, with plush table seating and comfortable bar stools. Left: French Pearl; Right: Poquito PicantePegu Club takes its ingredients seriously, with house-made infusions, shots carefully measured, and sodas poured from fresh bottles. I tried three of them (all $12), starting with the Little Italy, a Manhattan variant made with an Italian bitter called Cynar (\"CHEE-nar\"). The bartender actually took a sideways glance at me as I took my first sip, to see if I'd like it as much as he predicted. I'd imagine he was pleased with the broad smile on my face. I also loved the French Pearl, made with gin, pernod, muddled mint, lime juice, and simple syrup.I wasn't as pleased with the Poquito Picante, which didn't live up to the promise of \"just a little bit of heat.\" The jalapeno floating on top was merely decorative. The other ingredients, cilantro, cucumber, gin, cointreau and lemon juice, made a bland impression.I wonder if Pegu Club is leaning too much on the menu it opened with, and if the restless inventiveness of the city's better cocktail chefs is still present here. The same handful of ingredients recur in many of the drinks-for instance, five of them include mint; five have lemon juice. That's a lot of repetition on a short menu. I didn't run out of choices, but I don't know if there's enough variety to justify many repeat visits.That said, there's still plenty more that I'd like to come back and try. There's food here, too. There's a beverage recommendation for each item on the brief food menu, but in a number of cases there was no such item on the cocktail menu. You'd think they could clear that up.The smoked trout deviled eggs ($10) have been on the menu since the beginning (Frank Bruni raved about them). In a word: wow! The little flecks of trout have a smoky taste almost like bacon, which nicely complements the curry mayonaise on the eggs. I didn't quite get the point of chopsticks as a serving utensil, as the eggs were far too slippery to pick up that way. I used my hands.A vegetarian spring roll ($12) was much more bland, but it was a decent enough snack.The service was excellent, but in fairness I came quite early in the evening-I was the first customer, in fact-so I can't attest to what it's like when they fill up.I'm only just beginning my journey through the city's great cocktail places, but I doubt that there are many as comfortable as Pegu Club, and many of the drinks here are already modern classics.Pegu Club (77 W.

I understand what you are saying about the menu, however, you can undoubtedly ask for suggestions and the bartenders will be more than happy to mix up a cocktail not on the menu.

Gray Kunz and the Short Rib Derby

***CONTENT
Left: Cafe Gray; Right: Grayz Note: Cafe Gray and Grayz have both closed. Cafe Gray will be replaced by a clone of A Voce. Grayz re-opened in January 2009 as Atria, with Gray Kunz's former chef de cuisine, Martin Brock, as executive chef. After four short months, it bit the dust. Cafe Gray will shortly be closing, a victim of sky-high rents at the Time Warner Center. That will leave the talented chef, Gray Kunz, with just one restaurant, Grayz, which struggles with problems of its own. Linking both restaurants is one of this town's great chefs and his destination dish, the legendary braised short ribs. He served a version of the dish at the four-star Lespinasse, and it anchors the menus at both Cafe Gray and Grayz. Recently, I tried the short ribs at both places. I wondered: how are they different? how are they alike? I also wanted to bid farewell to Cafe Gray, and to see if Grayz is as good as some message board enthusiasts say it is. * * * At Cafe Gray, one can't help escaping the glimmer of what might have been. In previous visits, I've never had the slightest doubt about the food: Kunz can cook rings around anyone. But the room: oh, the room! It's noisy and ugly, and it interposes an open kitchen between diners and the world's best view. If you're going to visit Cafe Gray, its final weeks are the best time. I found it mostly empty on a Wednesday evening. There's no escaping the bone-headed design, but at least I had a pleasant supper without contracting a migraine. Left: amuse-bouche; Right: petits-fours Service was polished and seamless. The amuse-bouche was a small spoonful of chickpea yogurt, and there was a nice plate of petits-fours at the end. I left Cafe Gray with a bit of sadness. This restaurant should have been, could have been, so much better. * * * Grayz is living proof of what happens when a promising restaurant botches its opening. The trouble here was that Kunz couldn't decide if he was opening a bar that served snacks or a restaurant with a bar. The muddled concept was confusing, and early reviews weren't favorable. The menu has been revised, and it makes more sense now. The entrees, which numbered just three when I visited in the early days, have now been expanded to six. Whether you want a full meal or just to...well, \"graze\"-Grayz can accommodate you. The interior design betrays indecision about the concept. You still feel like you're in a bar that serves snacks, but the service is very good, and the food is first-class. Think of it as an elegant restaurant where the bar is closer than you'd like it to be, like a social misfit elbowing in on your privacy. Despite its flaws, Grayz deserves your attention. Unfortunately, it's hard for a restaurant to get the word out after the early review cycle has concluded. The tables were less than half occupied on a Wednesday evening, and according to reports I've read elsewhere, that's not unusual. The GM came over after my meal, greeted me warmly, and gave me his card. Grayz is still trying to cultivate a following. Left: Bread service; Right: Weisswurst To begin, Grayz offers the same wonderful spears of warm bread as before, with a Lebanese yogurt, spice, and olive oil dressing. I was better behaved this time: I stopped after only one. I ordered the Weisswurst ($12), or German sausage, which comes with a homemade brown mustard. I'm not a connoisseur, so I don't have much to compare it to. I loved the delicate casings, but the mustard was definitely needed, as the meat didn't have enough flavor on its own. The bright-red cast-iron serving dish got in the way of my knife and fork. To close, the petit-four was a hollow cylinder of crisp brown chocolate on a bed of sugar. The cocktail menu here is a cut above the norm. I tried two of them, the Badminton Cup and the Aviation, both $14. My table was close enough to the bar that I could hear the conversation between the bartender and one of his customers-a post-modern meditation on the \"art of cocktails.\" I thought, \"This is so 2008.\" * * * So, what about the short ribs? Short ribs at Cafe Gray (left) and Grayz (right) As you can see from the photos, they are quite similar. The manager at Grayz said he believes the meat is prepared identically. At Cafe Gray, it's served on a bed of soft grits; at Grayz, it's creamed spinach. The price is $41 at Cafe Gray, $39 at Grayz. If I could have only one before I die, I'd choose the Grayz version. It was served on the bone; at Cafe Gray, there was no bone. At Grayz, it was slightly more tender, and spinach goes better with beef than grits. You could argue, though, that $39 is awfully dear for short ribs, even Gray Kunz's. * * * Kunz says that Cafe Gray will re-open at another location-rumored to be the current Oceana space.. He's known to be a slow-poke, so I wouldn't hold my breath for it. Wherever he goes, his first act should be to fire himself as an interior designer. But while we wait for Cafe Gray's reincarnation, Grayz will be quietly chugging along. Give Grayz a try. You could be pleasantly surprised. Update: Grayz will close on August 10, 2008, for a facelift, re-opening on September 1. The downstairs catering space will become a proper restaurant, and the upstairs space-reviewed here-will presumably become what it was meant to be: a lounge.

Note: Click here for a more recent update. There are strange doings at Mai House. In January, founding chef Michael Bao Huynh was out. Or was he? Apparently, it was just a misunderstanding: he had merely gone AWOL for five weeks. In March, Top Chef contestant Spike Mendelsohn launched a tasting menu at Mai House, based on the food he'd prepared on the TV show. Yesterday, the mystery of Huynh's whereabouts was apparently resolved: Gael Green reported that Huynh had taken over at Rain, on the Upper West Side. And today, Eater reported that Mendelsohn was fired at Mai House. Eater reported, at first, that another Top Chefer, Lisa Hernandes, was replacing Mendelsohn, but later in the day this was retracted. If this were any other restaurant, we'd assume an Eater Deathwatch was in order. But because it's a Drew Nieporent restaurant, we figure it'll all get sorted out. We love Mai House, and want it to live long and prosper. But who is in the kitchen?

Update: Andrew Carmellini's replacement has finally been named: Missy Robbins, formerly of Chicago's Spiaggia. To learn more about the débacle that led up to this, read on. The farce at A Voce is one of the sorriest spectacles we've seen in a long time. After weeks of rumor-mongering, Grub Street reported yesterday that Manuel Trevino, a former Top Chef contestant, will temporarily replace Andrew Carmellini at A Voce. According to the report, \"Trevino will oversee the expansion of A Voce to the Time Warner Center,\" where it is replacing Café Gray, \"but he is expected to make way for another big-name chef to be named (eventually) by A Voce's owners.\" How many shades of stupidity can be painted in one sentence? Apparently, if Trevino does a good job at the Time Warner Center, he'll get fired anyway. And if he does a bad job, the restaurant will have the mediocre reviews hanging like deadweights around its neck. Remember: once the critics have reviewed a place, they seldom return. Why would anyone open the Time Warner branch with a transitional figure, get pummeled, and then bring in the chef they really want? It gets worse. Today, Grub Street reports that pastry chef Josh Gripper has left the restaurant: \"I’m not comfortable with [the ownership’s] direction, and I don’t think it would be a smart move to stay with them.\" Ouch. As a reader noted in the Eater comments section: \"They might as well mail that 3rd star back to the Times right now.\" We were never persuaded that A Voce was three-star material, but it's still sad to see the owners squandering the good hand they were dealt.

The Rhythm of a Restaurant Meal

***CONTENT
During the first ten or fifteen minutes after you sit down at a restaurant, several things happen in quick succession that will determine the rhythm of the rest of the meal:You'll be given menusYou'll be told about specials-if there are anyYou might or might not receive a separate wine listYou might or might not receive a separate cocktail menuYou'll be asked if you'd like to order cocktailsThe cocktails, if you ordered them, will arriveYou might or might not receive a visit from the sommelierYou'll be asked if you'd like to order wineYou'll be asked for your food orderIt's remarkable how the order and timing of these events will vary from one restaurant to another. And how often they get it wrong.Even at three-star restaurants, I'm amazed at how often servers ask for your food and wine order when you've just begun to sip your cocktails. This often sets up a situation where your half-consumed cocktails, your just-opened wine, and your first savory course are all on the table at once. If you finish your cocktail, then the wine isn't serving its intended purpose-to accompany the food. If you leave your cocktail behind, then you've just wasted $5-7 (assuming the cocktail costs $10-14, which is typical).This, of course, is merely one way that these events can be mistimed. There are many other permutations, such as the sommelier asking for your wine order before you've seen a menu. He surely knows-or should know-that wine is normally chosen to go with the food.If there are specials, I prefer to have them in writing. But if they're going to be recited, this should be done at the same time the menus are presented. The time to tell me about other options is before I start studying the menu, not after. It's annoying when the server circles by later on with new information, potentially upsetting the ordering strategy I had already tentatively decided on.But it's the timing of the cocktail order that restaurants most often get wrong. If a party orders cocktails, it often means they want to relax a while before launching into the food and wine. The server ought to at least ask. Even high-end restaurants-places where diners are paying to enjoy a leisurely meal over at least a couple of hours-fail to get this right. This struck me last weekend at Cafe Boulud, a top-tier restaurant in most every respect, but where they were ready to take our wine and food order before the previously ordered cocktails had even arrived.The other alternative is that a party is drinking only cocktails and wines by the glass. Here, servers make a different error: once your glass is empty, they they circle back and ask if you'd like a refill. But what if you ordered by the glass because you want to sample more than one item? Isn't that one of the main benefits of ordering by the glass? Yet, I invariably have to ask them to bring back the beverage menu. That can take a few minutes, and then it's a few minutes after that to prepare another cocktail or fetch another glass of wine. In the meantime, I'm sitting there with an empty glass.Not all restaurants make these mistakes, but they happen well over half the time.Am I being unreasonable?

I always used to think the asking for the wine order before you've ordered your food is the most annoying.But now I've come to realize that it's the last one you mention -- the asking you if you'd like a refill of your by-the-glass wine, and then taking ages to come back with the wine list when you tell them, predictably, that you'd like to change -- that's most annoying. I've taken to figuring out at the beginning of the meal which wines I'll order with all the coming courses, in order to avoid that annoyance.Then, I just have the problem of remembering them.

No, you are being quite reasonable. Service should make one happy, not irritated. There are a few restaurants that are consistent, but I would suggest that at least half make these mistakes all the time. I had a very nice evening at Otto recently. The food was very good, but what stood out was the excellent service. The bar waiter was attentive, but the table waiter was a real professional. She did the little things that helped make the evening memorable. What is sad about this is that service like this is becoming rare. P.S. Her name was Lourdes. Request her if you go to Otto, and order the lardo pizza.

I agree with all of your complaints.the one thing I'll say for restaurants is that many/most wine-by-the-glass orderers do seem to order the same glass over and over.this is really annoying on a date (which is usually when I see it) when she orders refills of the same glass of wine....leaving me thinking at the third glass point that she should have just ordered a bottle. (same price but with 2 extra pours)...so restaurants may just expect that.

You are being sort of reasonable, sort of unreasonable. But you have to understand that restaurants try very hard, but ultimately can't please all of the people all of the time. To make things more difficult, all diners have different expectations. Some diners will order wine and want wine served even before the first bite of bread or amuse bouche - and will be angry if their wine isn't on the table before the food (see ridiculous WSJ journal on the subject). Some diners insist upon ordering the food before the wine \"so they know what wine they should order.\" This makes the timing very hard for a server/sommelier to get the wine down at the same time or before the 1st course lands, especially if the restaurant is packed.Also - servers and sommeliers may hit you up a moment too early because you are not the only table in the restaurant, and they may have time convenient for them at that moment. It's better to be asked a few minutes early then ignored for 10 minutes, no? In most restaurants at the 3 star level that I dine in in NYC, timing has never been that crazy that my cocktail/wine/menu sequence is so out of wack, but I don't expect someone to appear the nanosecond I am ready. A perfect restaurant would have one server for every diner, but we all know that the staff would not make any money unless your entrees were $80 each, sort of like a 3 star michelin restaurant in France. :)

Spitzer's Corner

When I heard that Wayne Nish was serving \"three-star bar food\" at a Lower East Side gastropub, I was a little skeptical.Guess what? He has pulled it off.Spitzer's Corner, which opened in August 2007, had a tough first nine months, with a revolving door in the kitchen. Nish is the fourth chef. The early reviews found his predecessors' menus underwhelming, and it's tough get the critics back for a second look.Wayne NishThey should come back, because Nish's menu at Spitzer's corner is remarkable. Although Nish is billed only as a \"consultant,\" his hand-picked chef de cuisine, Sung Park, has serious credentials, with stints under Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Didier Virot, and Laurent Tourondel under his belt. He was also Nish's chef de cuisine for the short-lived second act at Varietal.And Park is no absentee chef: he was there on a Saturday night.When I think about the food here, the closest comparison that comes to mind is Momofuku Ssäm Bar. Both restaurants offer sophisticated cooking with luxury ingredients in a laid-back, pared down environment. Park seemed taken aback when I mentioned the similarity, as David Chang's food has an Asian tang, while Nish and Park come from the French tradition. But once I explained myself, he seemed to agree that the analogy was valid.The foodies haven't descended on Spitzer's Corner as they've done at the Momofuku restaurants, but it's not struggling either. The Saturday evening business was fairly brisk. The restaurant seats 130 and is open daily for lunch and dinner, with food served until 2:00 a.m. There is also Saturday and Sunday brunch.The menu is inexpensive. A section called \"Bar Snacks and Sides\" features eight items priced from $4-10, while a section called \"Plates,\" corresponding roughly to appetizers and entrees, has fifteen selections from $9-17. Most items are suitable for sharing.The aesthetic is pared down, with most of the seating at long communal tables. (There are a few two-tops.) The wood that lines the walls is alleged to have been made from reclaimed pickle barrels. There are broad picture windows, which on a warm evening are open to the outside.The name, by the way, comes from a dress shop that formerly occupied the space. It has nothing to do with Eliot Spitzer, the disgraced former governor of New York.They don't have a hard liquor license, but there are 40 beers on tap and another 40 in bottles. They're listed on the menu with brief tasting notes, as you'd find on a wine list (\"Epic malts, spicy notes w/ hints of baker's choc\").They aren't just the obvious beers, either. There couldn't be many places in town serving Delirium Tremens, Victory Golden Monkey, Stone Arrogant Bastard, or Rogue Dead Guy Ale. The servers are like sommeliers, recommending beers that pair well with the food you've ordered.The wine list is more modest, though the server insisted it should be taken seriously too: five reds and seven whites, all available by the bottle or the glass, with the most expensive bottles priced at $36 (not counting Veuve Clicquot Brut, $110).Full disclosure: We dined at Spitzer's Corner at a publicist's invitation, and our meal was comped. We sampled considerably more food than any two sane people would order on their own. However, as I always do, I am calling the shots as I seem them.I'll be haunted for a long time by the \"French Kisses\" ($10), five luscious armagnac prunes filled with a liquified foie gras mousse. This was a dish that could come out of the kitchen at Per Se or Jean Georges, and it wouldn't seem out of place. Prunes and foie gras make startling bedfellows, but we had the same observation several times during our long meal. Nish works similar magic with a salad of warm Spinach and Shitake Mushrooms ($6), in which the startling extra ingredient is a white soy sauce.I was eager to try the Duck Fat Potato Cake ($6), but it was the evening's only dud. There's plenty going on in this dish too, with confits of shallot, garlic, rosemary and thyme, but it was too dry. I expected the duck fat to be more flavorful, but I really couldn't taste it. We loved the bracing, bright flavors of a Red & Yellow Tomato Salad ($9), with goat cheese, marcona almonds, balsamic vinegar, and watermelon-chili dressing. Even better was Mac & Cheese ($9), which the menu says is made from local artisanal Saxelby cheese and topped with herbed duck cracklings.A Sweetbread Po' Boy was just fine, but the sandwiches that came next surpassed it.We had the Roasted Pork Belly Sandwich ($11), the Warm Duck Confit Sandwich ($12) and the Soft-Shell Crab Po' Boy ($15). We couldn't agree with was the best, as all had their merits. They all benefited from Nish's playful combination of unexpected ingredients. The pork belly was paired with a red wine sauerkraut, the duck with pickled daikon radish, the crab with housemade aioli. My girlfriend thought that the tempura batter on the crab was especially successful, while I was partial to the pork-sauerkraut combination. Halibut, at $17, is the most expensive item on the menu. It was the second item we had (after the \"French Kisses\") that could come out any three or four-star kitchen with no one batting an eyelash. It was certainly as good as the wonderful halibut we enjoyed the night before at Cafe Boulud. A lemon walnut crust imparts a tangy crispness to the perfectly roasted fish.Our stomachs had by now reached our limit, so we barely tasted the Herbed Roast Chicken, but it seemed to be just about perfect, with (according to the menu) herbes de provence and jus roti. Once again, take note of the price: a half chicken for $12. The last item we tried was the Kobe Burger ($16). There's a bit of dishonesty here, as it's actually American Kobe beef, and strictly speaking, that's a contradiction in terms. On the other hand, where else is any kind of Kobe beef (even if it's Wagyu) available for $16.We aren't the hamburger experts, but my girlfriend said, \"This is the best hamburger ever.\" A blogger on Serious Eats disagrees with us, but to our taste it was excellent: a nice charred exterior, a perfect medium rare inside, and a buttery brioche bun. To be sure, the real Kobe beef would have more marbling, but this was impressive enough, and what do you want for $16? At the Old Homstead, the Kobe burger is $41, and I don't know if their menu is any more accurate about its origin than Spitzer's.For the record, Spitzer's also serves a trio of sliders for $9 and a short rib burger for $10. Both are available with cheese, but when a customer asked for cheese on the Kobe burger, the server declined. There are culinary standards to be upheld, even for hamburgers.Our server was knowledgeable, attentive and friendly. There are paper napkins, but silverware was replaced after every course. We were clearly getting the VIP treatment, so you can take that for what it's worth. But there's no denying the attempt here to serve \"pub food\" several orders of magnitude better than the norm. Word of mouth seems to be catching on, but only time will tell if this level can be maintained.There are some limitations, besides the spartan surroundings and communal tables. At present there is no dessert menu or even coffee. Some people would consider the lack of cocktails a drawback, but with 80 beers available no one should go thirsty here.Full credit is due to the persistent owners of Spitzer's Corner, who could have given up on their gastronomic ambitions and relied on their beer menu. Instead, they snagged Wayne Nish and Sung Park, who have turned this pub into a destination.Spitzer's Corner (101 Rivington Street at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side)

[Kalina via Eater]Unlike the professional critics, I don't have the time, the inclination, or the pocketbook to pay multiple visits to a restaurant before venturing an opinion. My posts are snapshots of individual meals. I can't help it if my impressions are either much better, or much worse, than the prevailing \"conventional wisdom.\" I may have caught the restaurant on an unusually good or bad day. I might, by dumb luck, just happen to have ordered the best couple of dishes on an uneven menu, or the worst ones on a very good menu.Sometimes, though, I have the distinct impression that a restaurant deserves a second chance. And that was what I thought after a friend and I had an exceedingly dull meal at Cafe Boulud two years ago. It's not that we had anything bad, but that, for the price point, the food struck us as uninspired. There were also some service miscues.In its ten-year history, Cafe Boulud has probably had some ups and downs. It seems to be a proving ground for chefs, who benefit from Daniel Boulud's mentorship and move on to better things. The opening chef, Alex Lee, was around just long enough to win three stars in the Times from Ruth Reichl. Andrew Carmellini had a six-year run (1999-2005) before leaving to open A Voce. Boulud then promoted Carmellini's sous chef, Bertrand Chemel, who won three stars from Frank Bruni and promptly departed for Falls Church, Virginia.Gavin Kaysen has been running the kitchen since December 2007, though presumably with plenty of input from Boulud. The menu, as it has always been, is divided into four sections: La Tradition (French classics), Le Voyage (world cuisine), La Saison (seasonal items) and Le Potager (vegetarian choices). The pattern persists through dessert and even the cocktail menu.Prices are about par for a three-star restaurant, with appetizers $16-28 (most in the high teens), entrees $27-55 (most in the $30s), and desserts $10-24 (most $14). \"Red Snapper\" cocktail (left); Amuse-bouche (right)My girlfriend and I tried a couple of the seasonal cocktails. The terrific, labor-intensive \"Red Snapper\" was made with jalapeno-infused gin, celery ice cubes, and tomato juice poured tableside from a glass caraffe. My girlfriend had a Rhubarb Mojito. They were both $12, which is extremely reasonable in a town where cocktails north of $15 are increasingly common. Spring Risotto (left); English Pea Raviolini (right)Our appetizers, chosen from the potager section of the menu, were full of bright flavors of the season: Spring Risotto ($19) with ramps and watercress; English Pea Ravioli ($18) with bacon, pea leaves, and a sherry-shallot jus. Butter Poached Halibut (left); Greek Lamb Trio (right)I loved the soft, buttery Poached Halibut ($36) from the Saison section of the menu, which featured an excellent supporting cast of whole grain mustard sausage, tiny potato gnocchi, English peas, and tomato fondue.The Greek Lamb Trio ($41), from the Voyage section, wasn't as exciting as the other items we had. The roasted loin was lovely, but as girlfriend noted, \"This isn't really very Greek.\" Oddly enough, both Times critics (Reichl and Bruni) found Le Voyage the weakest portion of the menu here, this has been true both times I visited. Rhubarb & Almond Tart (left); Madeleines (right)We shared a Rhubarb & Almond Tart ($14), and to finish, the server dropped off a folded napkin full of warm , delicious sugar-coated madeleines.The wine list has a section dedicated to bottles $60 and under. This part of the list seems to have shrunk since my last visit, but there are still some wonderful finds. The sommelier suggested the 2004 Stephane Tissot Singulier ($60), made from the seldom encountered Trousseau grape from the Arbois region of France. We were struck by its light, fruity texture, resembling a pinot noir. We appreciated the recommendation, as we'd have never have found it on our own.I wouldn't choose Cafe Boulud for a special occasion, but rather, for food that is reliably excellent. The dining room is lovely and fairly quiet, though it also has the feel of an Upper East Side neighborhood place. One family was there with a two-year-old, and the staff dutifully produced a high chair. Fortunately, he was well behaved.The service is polished and elegant, with a high ratio of staff to diners. Sometimes they get a bit confused, as when one asked us for our cocktail order after another had already taken it. Our cocktail order took a bit too long to be filled. It was a good thing I delayed our order, as otherwise the appetizers would have arrived before the wine was poured. These are minor complaints, and didn't at all detract from our excellent meal.There aren't enough days in the week to give every restaurant a second chance, but Cafe Boulud is one that deserved it. With Gavin Kaysen in the kitchen, Cafe Boulud is in good hands.Cafe Boulud (20 E. 76th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **½Overall: ***

Shun Lee, is the dean of the pre-Lincoln Center restaurants. It has been serving haute Chinese classics since 1981, when Mimi Sheraton awarded two stars in the Times.The original space was apparently \"dim and dowdy.\" It received a snazzy makeover in 1985, but Bryan Miller found the food inconsistent, demoting it to one star in 1987. For the record, Shun Lee's sister restaurant, Shun Lee Palace, which has been around since 1971, and serves the same menu, still carries two stars, courtesy of Ruth Reichl in 1995.Shortly after the 1985 makeover, the front dining room was converted into a separate Dim Sum-themed restaurant called Shun Lee Cafe. The main restaurant and the cafe are separately reservable on OpenTable, but they share the kitchen and restroom areas.Shun Lee Cafe offers an abbreviated version of the full restaurant menu, but when we visited the other day, we had Dim Sum on our minds.Dim Sum comes on a cart, which a server wheels around the restaurant. There are only a few items at a time on the cart. This keeps the food fresh, but you don't really know what's coming next. The server just tells you what she has; either you want some, or you wait until next time the cart comes around. After she serves you, she scribbles on the back of a card. The more scribbles at the end of the meal, the more you pay.Most items come in pairs, making them well suited to sharing. We had eight servings for a total of $54, which averaged out to $6.75 each. With two cocktails ($10 ea.) and two desserts ($6 ea.), the total cost of the meal was $86 before tax and tip. You'd pay a bit less in Chinatown, but you wouldn't have Lincoln Center across the street, and you wouldn't have Shun Lee's incredibly clever light fixtures staring down at you. We started with dumplings: beef (above left) and shrimp (above right), both done to a high standard. The cart's next couple of visits featured items from the deep fryer. Our favorite was the Giant Crab Claw (lower left-hand side of the first photo), a large juicy hunk of crab. We loved it so much that we asked for another one.Shrimp Cheese Puffs (right side of the second photo) came a close second. Shrimp and ricotta cheese made fine company. We also enjoyed the Shrimp Taro Pancakes (left side of the second photo).The only real dud was the Chicken Sesame Pancake (upper left of the first photo), which had the consistency of shoe leather.Service was efficient, as it must be at a pre-theater place, though there was some of the upselling, huckstering quality endemic to such restaurants. We asked for just one dessert to share, but the server, perhaps feigning hearing loss, brought two.Like most long-term restaurants, Shun Lee has its crowd of devoted regulars. Much of the crowd was distinctly elderly. The restaurant has a long-standing relationship with the Jewish community. The owner, Michael Tong, estimates that his clientele is seventy percent Jewish. His busiest day of the year is Christmas, and he can even prepare a kosher banquet on request.I haven't been to the main restaurant in many years. Our visit here reminded me that it has been too many years. I'll have to rectify that. In the meantime, if you're looking for a more casual option in the area, Shun Lee Cafe is a respectable choice.Shun Lee Cafe (43 W. 65th Street, east of Broadway, Upper West Side)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

I dropped in at Porter House New York last night for a quick bite. On a Thursday evening at around 6:30 p.m., the restaurant was mostly empty. Many servers and runners were just standing around. As in the past, the clientele included a number of families with small children.I wasn't that hungry, so I had the Skirt Steak, at $28 the second-cheapest entree (after the chicken, $27). This is a second-string cut of meat, but Porter House gives it a first-rate preparation, with a nice smokey char and an Argentine chimichurri sauce.Since my last visit, Porter House has wisely dropped its plats du jour-dishes that are served only one night of the week. The Cowboy Steak, formerly available only on Thursdays, is now offered every day. On a less happy note, that steak was $38 fifteen months ago; it is now $45.The \"porterhouse\" conceit has been scaled back. There were once porterhouses not just of beef, but also lamb, veal, pork, and even monkfish; only the beef and the veal options remain. There were once more than half-a-dozen seafood entrees; there are now only four.There are, of course, other entrees: hangar steak, filet mignon, chili-rubbed ribeye (not worthwhile at $48), lamb chops. But with a few exceptions (\"Duck Steak\"), the restaurant is evolving closer to the classic steakhouse, albeit with one of the world's best views.Bread service remains a strength, with three excellent house-made breads and a soft serving of butter. I didn't order wine, but the wine list didn't seem quite as egregiously priced as it was last time. Aside from that, I had a somewhat dour server who seemed displeased with his lot in life. Come to think of it, nobody seemed especially pleased. An empty restaurant will do that.In a sense, Porter House is a somewhat less interesting restaurant than it was before. But the steaks remain top-notch, and the ambiance is more comfortable than most steakhouses.Porter House New York (Time-Warner Center, 10 Columbus Circle, 4th floor)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **½Overall: *½

Welcome to Restaurant Outlook, a new feature in which we list the new and forthcoming restaurants of personal interest to us. There's no attempt to be exhaustive, but merely to list those restaurants that have caught our fancy. Fairly New Hundred Acres - This Marc Meyer/Vicki Freeman follow-up to Provence opens next week. This one will be more in the Five Points-Cookshop haute barnyard vein. As Eater noted, they could've just called it \"Cookshop\" and had a practically guaranteed hit-though no review from the Bruni. This one'll get reviewed. A hit is no sure thing, but I wouldn't bet against them. Reservation: June 6. Scarpetta - Italian restaurant by Scott Conant, formerly of Alto and L'Impero. Early reports are promising, but it's in the Meatpacking District, which hasn't seen a serious restaurant in years. Reservation: June 7. Elizabeth - Former Country chef de cuisine Doug Psaltis is designing the menu here. It's only a consulting gig, which makes us skeptical, and Psaltis seldom remains anywhere for long, which makes us doubly skeptical. But at a low price point we're willing to roll the dice. Reservation: May 30. Savarona - The rare serious Turkish restaurant in New York is surely worth a try. Reservation: May 31. Bar Milano - Early reviews are mixed, but the Lupa/'Inoteca guys have a strong track record. Reservation: May 23. Merkato 55 - Reviews have been mediocre. We've had several reservations, all cancelled for various reasons. My girlfriend no longer wants to go, so I'll have to drop in one night after work. No plans to visit yet. Greenwich Grill - Of interest mainly because it's near the office. No plans to visit yet. Forthcoming All of these restaurants have been announced or mentioned in the press, but some of them may be a long way off. Bouley v 3.0 - David Bouley's move to the Mohawk Atelier Building at 161 Duane Street. Expected \"by the fall.\" Susur Lee's first New York restaurant at 200 Allen Street on the Lower East Side, also expected \"come fall.\" Brushstroke, another Bouley restaurant, at 111 West Broadway. Given the well chronicled problems getting this restaurant off the ground, I would be surprised to see it before 2009. Restaurant Liebrandt, with Paul Liebrandt (formerly of Gilt) at the helm. Though Liebrandt admits he is working on a restaurant, no one is even sure where it will be (the old Montrachet site is the best guess) or when it will open. I walk by the Montrachet storefront regularly, and it remains sealed as tight as a drum.

Today, Frank Bruni awards the expected two stars to Eighty One, finding the ambitious food over-thought and over-wrought:Maybe it's an inevitable consequence of so many restaurants vying to be noticed. Maybe it's an attempt to justify entrees sailing far north of $35. Maybe it's a reflection of chefs too neurotic or vain to commit to one strategy or to dwell on one note.Whatever the reason, the high-end New York dining scene is awash in troikas of pork, trilogies of tuna and the like. A meat that does a wholly satisfying turn as a chop, or a fish showcased adequately in a fillet, appears in many guises, as if it's an actor doing one of those multi-part tours de force.The spectacle is impressive to a point, but exhausting, too.He awards points for the wine list, but subtracts them for the room:Eighty One certainly preens. It goes so far as to title a section of the menu in which it lists spotlighted dishes the \"tasting collection.\"When you see something like that, you're less inclined to overlook a restaurant's shortcomings. In Eighty One's case, they include a sprawling dining room with unflattering lighting and oversize red velvet booths that look as if they were carted in from a bordello on some planet where the prostitutes are 12 feet tall.We win $4 on our hypothetetical one-dollar bet. Eater, who had predicted three stars, loses a dollar. Eater NYJBankroll$88.50 $99.67Gain/Loss-1.00 +4.00Total$87.50 $103.67* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost39-17 40-16

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni gives us another pulse check on the Upper West Side's fine dining revolution, with a review of Ed Brown's Eighty One. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 10-1 One Star: 5-1Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 5-1 √√ Four Stars: 12-1The Skinny: This week's Eater odds reflect the lack of consensus on Eighty One, with anywhere between one and three stars being realistically possible.Of the reviews so far, the worst came from Paul Adams in The Sun. Adams doesn't award stars, but he called the restaurant \"a sad disappointment.\" At the other extreme was Steve Cuozzo in The Post, who doesn't do stars either, but said he would award three. Adam Platt in New York was in the middle, awarding the deuce.For the record, we gave Eighty One 2½ stars. If we were using Bruni's system, which does not have half-stars, we'd have rounded down to two. We think that's the most likely outcome here-not just because it conforms to our own verdict, but for other reasons too.First, Bruni is seldom impressed with the trappings of luxury, which he usually calls \"fussy.\" I abhor the word, but if ever there was a fussy restaurant, Eighty One is it.Second, Eighty One is more expensive than nearby Dovetail, to which he awarded three stars. Given that Bruni is highly sensitive to price, Eighty One would need to be a lot better than Dovetail to receive the identical rating. It's hard to see that happening, given that his review of Dovetail was a rave. Most critics, regardless of their rating, have had their complaints about Eighty One. If Bruni does too, it'll be enough to withhold the third star.Bruni has been pretty generous with three-star reviews this year. Maybe they're putting happy pills in the water over at Times HQ. The year's not half over, and three new restaurants have received that honor. In all of 2007, none did. As the honor comes rarely, and Frank can time his reviews however he wants, we doubt he'd do two of them in a row. Last week's review, of course, was three-stars for Momofuku Ko.Lastly, there's the Cuozzo effect: he and Bruni seldom see eye to eye. Cuozzo loved Eighty One.We're a little perplexed as to what has taken Bruni so long to file this review. The place has been open for months, and Platt's review appeared more than six weeks ago. We can only guess that Bruni really wanted to love this place-it's in his neighborhood, after all-but in the end, couldn't quite make the case.Why not one star? For a restaurant at Eighty One's level, a measly star would be close to insulting. Bruni is quite capable of delivering that kind of smackdown, but usually only when he feels he has to. Given how long he's waited, we figure he has something nice to say-just not three stars' worth.The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Eighty One.

Note: The upstairs dining room at Country has closed, to be replaced around October 1 March 2009 with Country Steak. The downstairs Café at Country remains open. Country is one of our favorite special-occasion restaurants. It may not be the best of those restaurants, but we adore the luxurious, spacious, old-school dining room, the first-class service, and food that usually exceeds our expectations. The new chef: Willis Loughhead [Country/Grub Street]We paid our fourth visit to Country on Saturday to check out the menu by Willis Loughhead, Country's new chef. Loughhead, who made his reputation in Miami, arrived here without much of a publicity footprint. He quickly set about rectifying it. We're doing everything differently now,” he told Grub Street. “We're breaking down whole animals, making our own charcuterie... And now that the Greenmarket is about to explode, you're going to see so much from us based on that. It's going to be very market-driven. Right now, I'm waiting for ramps, for instance. Just wait till they come in.” Earlier this week, Gothamist had a \"nose-to-tail\" piece, with a photo of lamb and pig carcasses hanging on meat hooks: Hanging in the wine cellar at Country’s Dining Room are, from left to right, lamb pancetta, pork pancetta, house-cured pigs’s leg prosciutto style, house-cured pig’s leg Serrano-style, Bresaola-style beef tenderloin and lastly imported Serrano with hoof. “It’s not something you’re going to do unless you buy the whole animal,” Loughhead says of making charcuterie. As for the nose-to-tail aspect, the only folks who seem to be freaked out are the hotel staff: “The room service people complain when there’s a big pig or lamb’s head outside there office.” One eGullet poster proclaimed the charcuterie in the Café at Country, the casual sister to the main dining room, was as good as or better than the offerings at Bar Boulud and Benoit—tall praise indeed if it is true. But Loughhead is taking his sweet time about reforming the flagship restaurant. We found a new menu that still needs a lot of work, and that falls short of the rapture that a restaurant on Country's level ought to deliver. There are just four appetizers, four mid-courses, five entrées, and four desserts—a perplexingly low total. The appetizers and mid-courses were uniformly good, but except for rhubarb in one dish, we didn't see the \"haute barnyard\" influence that Loughhead has been selling to bloggers and publicists. The entrées on a recent menu at Country The entrées were shockingly unimaginative, in addition to being over-cooked and tough. If Loughhead is breaking down whole animals, then why are most of the entrées just the standard rectangle of protein with a medley of vegetables? And why are they all cooked the same way? Every one we asked about, the server said: pan-seared, then roasted. The menu style shown above is reflected throughout: a main ingredient in capital letters (\"PORK\"), with little indication of what is done with it. The menu at Country is priced at $75 for three courses, $89 for four courses, or $135 for the chef's tasting menu. The middle option, which we had, is probably the best one, given that an extra savory course is only $14 extra. All of the menus at Country include canapés, an amuse-bouche, a plate cleanser, petits-fours, and one of the best bread services in town. We also received a complimentary glass of champagne to start. I am not sure if that is the norm, or if it was because the staff recognized us. Despite my dismay at Loughhead's half-hearted re-boot of the menu and the disappointing entrées, there are still many reasons to love Country. It sports one of the loveliest dining rooms in town, elegant service, and candle-lit tables widely spread out. There is hardly a better place to enjoy a leisurely, romantic meal. And given the number of excellent courses served for $89, I am almost ready to forgive the flawed entrées. Well, almost. The restaurant was not full, and our 8:00 p.m. table, nestled in a quiet alcove, was ours for the evening. Two dainty canapés arrived quickly. I neglected to photograph them, but one was a cube of seared tuna, the other a small, deep-fried risotto ball. The amuse-bouche was a frog leg in a garlic cream and watercress purée. The bread service, I am glad to say, has not changed: a large, warm Parker House roll. When we were about 2/3rds done with it, the staff brought another one, which we most reluctantly had to leave untouched. Four our first course, I had the White & Green Asparagus with Serrano ham, mustard vinaigrette and fried quail eggs. My girlfriend raved about the Sea Trout Tartare, with barbequed eel, yuzu and cucumber. I can't identify the foam that came atop a grilled sea scallop; pork belly on the left-hand side of the plate didn't make quite the impression that it normally does. But my girlfriend's seafood risotto was the knockout dish of the evening. It was chock-full of chunky lobster, squid, cockles and dorade. Our entrées were \"DUCK\" (left) and \"PORK\" (right). I loved the sear on the duck, but it was a bit tough; but that was nothing compared to my girlfriend's pork, which was dry and even tougher. \"They were probably cooked by the same heavy-handed guy at the meat station,\" she suggested. There clearly is a great talent in the pastry kitchen here. I neglected to photograph the palate cleanser, which was one of the most creative dishes we had: a lime granité with coconut foam, lemon pearls and sweet soda, served with a long spoon that doubled as a straw. Both desserts were excellent: \"YOGHURT\" with guava, grapefruit and sesame (above, left) and \"MILLE FEUILLE\" (above, right) with raspberry, gianduja and fromage blanc. Last, came perhaps the best petits-fours cart we've seen since Alain Ducasse. William Rhodes is now in charge of the wine program. The bottles are generally expensive, as one would expect, but Rhodes is stocking whites as low as $40 and reds as low as $50. Throughout the list, there are wines touted as \"Sommelier Selections,\" and they aren't just the expensive ones. Based on our 2005 St. Joseph, Rhodes's instincts can be trusted. There were minor service hiccups, none of which seriously undermined our evening, but which should not happen at a restaurant at this level. All were probably attributable to a server who, though eager to please, was error-prone. Though I'd ordered one of the sommelier-recommended reds, a white wine was brought to our table. It's a rather peculiar foul-up to bring a bottle many pages away from the one you picked. To his credit, the server admitted the error, and the restaurant had to eat the mistake. We were given plenty of time to order, but we actually had to ask for a wine list. During the meal, runners at least twice were mixed up about which dish was mine, and which was my girlfriend's. * If I had never before dined at Country, I would award 2½ stars. That is my usual rating for a restaurant that very clearly has the potential for three stars, but hasn't quite lived up to them. Given our long history with Country, we assume that we caught the dining room in transition. Chef Loughhead has a vigorous publicity machine behind him. Now, he needs to deliver the goods. Though I am coming down a bit hard on Country, it's because we know from experience that transcendent meals are possible here. By and large, this was a transcendent meal, but for the entrées. However, it is a significant problem when both meat dishes fall as flat as they did here. Diners lured by the press coverage are going to have high hopes for a restaurant with such a high price tag. We will be back, as the wonderful dining room and luxurious service will always have a tug on our affections. But for the new clientele that Country is trying to attract, there might not be a second chance to make a strong first impression.

Bern's Steakhouse

***CONTENT
The words \"fine dining\" and \"Tampa, Florida\" seldom occur in the same sentence. For a recent family celebration, only one restaurant came to mind: Bern's Steakhouse. It is the one Tampa restaurant with an international reputation, founded largely on its 700,000-bottle wine cellar, believed to be the largest privately-held wine collection in the world.That collection is so large that about 80% of it is not even stored at the restaurant, but in a warehouse across the street. The 212-page novel-length wine list is a massive tome, including bottles hundreds of years old. The list of wines available by the glass (around 150) is more than most restaurants offer by the bottle.The restaurant, named for Bern Laxer, has been at this site since 1956. Laxer's son, David, is now in charge.The building, not originally a restaurant, is unimpressive from the outside. But once you get in, the rest of Bern's is as overwhelming as its wine list. Its eight dining rooms, each with a different theme, seat up to 350. Our party of eight was in a room featuring enormous photographic mural of the Rhone valley.Bern's doesn't do anything small. The menu goes on for eighteen pages, several of which are long essays explaining how-in the restaurant's favorite phrase-\"We do things differently here.\" Want to start with caviar? There are twenty-one selections, priced from $20-220 per ounce. Want steak tartare? Bern's offers it four different ways.The steak portion of the menu goes on for four pages, because Bern's can do nothing without lecturing you. There are fifty-one ordering options-a function of the cut of meat and the desired thickness-priced anywhere from $29.10 for a six-ounce filet mignon, to $233.12 a sixty-ounce strip sirloin that feeds six. You'd think they could round the cents on a $233 steak.Bern's serves USDA prime beef, aged 5-8 weeks. They are aggressive about trimming fat and bone before cooking, so their eight-ounce steak has more edible content than it would at other steakhouses. The menu claims that they buy about 3-4 pounds of beef for every pound they serve.Most of the steaks are around $35-40 per person, but Bern's doesn't follow the typical steakhouse à la carte model. Every entree also includes French onion soup, a house salad, a baked potato, onion rings, and vegetables. Dinner for six adults and two children was $419 before tax and tip, and that figure included the wine-more on that below-and cocktails. The same dinner in New York would cost at least double that. As I studied the wine list, I could hardly contain myself as I saw one bargain after another. I settled on a magnum of 1967 Julien Devèze Châteauneuf-du-Pape, which was around $140. The sommelier tried to upsell me to a bottle that was $100 more, but after I declined, he brought back the 1971, which he insisted was better, and at $126 was less expensive than the bottle I'd asked for.To put that in perspective, at the New York wine-themed restaurant Veritas, the cheapest magnum of Châteauneuf-du-Pape costs $175, and it's a 1999, twenty-eight years younger than the one we had. Veritas has only a handful of choices older than 1990, and only one older than 1980, whereas Bern's has a long list of bottles going back to at least the 1960s.The wine was superb, though I don't have much to compare it to. In New York, a bottle that old, if you could find it, would cost the equivalent of a monthly mortgage payment. Everyone loved the French onion soup (above left), but a plate of \"cheese toast\" (above right)-basically melted cheese on saltine crackers-wasn't much good at all. The house salad (above left) was just fine, while my son ordered the caesar salad (above right) for $9.95 extra, which our waiter prepared tableside, in a multi-step process that seemed to take fifteen minutes.My girlfriend and I shared the 16 oz. Delmonico ($69.34), which the restaurant recommends as a portion for two. It doesn't look that big, but we filled up quickly, given all of the other food included. The steak itself was just about perfect, with a nice exterior char, marbling, and the nutty, tangy flavor that comes from long aging.Vegetables were a mixed bag. The onion rings were stringy and greasy, and the other vegetables on the plate were rather dull, but the baked potato was wonderful. Most restaurants would leave it to each guest to apply the fixin's, but our waiter split each potato at tableside and applied sour cream, bacon, and chives according to each diner's preference.Service in the main dining room was excellent. All of Bern's waiters train for a full year before they're permitted to serve customers on their own. Garnishes and sauces are all applied tableside, and the waiter himself serves and clears every dish. Be sure to ask for a kitchen and wine cellar tour, normally given between dinner and dessert. It takes about fifteen minutes, and is well worth it.Dessert is such an unusual experience that you should order something even if you're not hungry. It's served upstairs in the Harry Waugh Dessert Room (named for a famous wine collector). It's actually not a room, but a rabbit's warren of many rooms: to be exact, forty-eight separate alcoves of varying sizes, each shaped like a wine cask, that can accommodate between two and twelve guests.No one will be surprised that dessert here, like everything else, is over the top. The menu is four pages long, and has about 60 selections. It comes with yet another wine list, this one 42 pages long, with another 1,800 selections (armagnacs, cognacs, scotches, brandies, ports, etc.) Left: Dulce de Leche Liquid Center Cake ($10.95); Right: Tiramisu ($9.95) Left: Chocolate-Chocolate-Chocolate ($10.95); Right: Macadamia Nut Sundae ($10.00)We were mildly disappointed with a Macadamia Nut Sundae, if only because its billing on the menu (\"best sundae in the world\") would have been tough for any dessert to live up to. I don't think anyone finished their desserts (how could they?) but there were vague nods of satisfaction around the table.Service in the dessert room was nowhere near as polished as in the main dining room. The waiter's recommendations weren't quite as good as they were cracked up to be, and on two occasions it took a major hunting expedition to find him.The overall dessert room bill, including drinks, was $75.60 before tax and tip.*After you get past the steaks, there is some unevenness at Bern's. Any restaurant with such a long menu is bound to have some soft spots. But the overall experience is incomparable, and the wine list ranks with the great pyramids as one of the wonders of the world.Bern's Steakhouse (1208 South Howard Avenue, Tampa, Florida)Food: ***Wine & Spirits: ****Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Wildwood Barbecue

The restauranteur Stephen Hanson generally sticks to tried and true formulas. So it's no surprise that he has now opened Wildwood Barbecue, a few years after the barbecue revolution arrived in New York. Hanson is known for commercializing cuisines without really mastering them: think Ruby Foo's. Except for three-star Fiamma, Hanson's eateries invariably seem flashy but mass-produced. As Grub Street wryly noted, it was telling that Hanson hired his interior designer (David Rockwell) before he'd hired a pitmaster. Hanson quieted the skeptics when he hired Big Lou Elrose, formerly the deputy pitmaster at New York's best barbecue restaurant, Hill Country. But Wildwood has a lot to prove, as great barbecue inNew York is no longer the rarity it once was. Hill Country, Blue Smoke, and R.U.B. are all short distances away. Stephen Hanson tries to be funny: \"Get Sauced\"Ironically, Wildwood is located on the site of one of the few Stephen Hanson failures, Barça 18, a tapas place that even Le Bernardin's Eric Ripert, as consulting chef, couldn't save. With Wildwood, Hanson has reverted to the kind of corporate restaurant he does best. If Outback Steakhouse had a barbecue chain, it would probably look like this. The barbecue here isn't beholden to any particular region or style. Though respectable, it isn't as good as the better places in town. Prices are modest, with appetizers $5.25-8.95, sandwiches and salads $10.95-14.95, entrees $9.95-23.95, tasting platters $21.50-28.95, and side dishes $4.95-6.95. We got a good sample of the menu by ordering two tasting platters, which came with two side dishes apiece. This was a lot of food for two people. We brought home part of the chicken and several ribs, and the sides were left half-finished. The Rib Sampler ($28.95) included both the longer pork ribs and Memphis-style baby back ribs. The pork ribs were meatier and more tender. The baby backs seemed a bit dried out. The \"Best of the Best\" ($23.95) included a half-chicken, three slices of brisket, and a scoop of pulled pork. The chicken was the star of the meal: pink, tender, flavorful. Elrose serves it with an apricot barbecue glaze. My girlfriend thought this was superior to the chicken she'd had at Hill Country. The brisket, on the other hand, was disappointing. It was too thin, too lean, and too dry. This was surprising from a pitmaster who'd worked at Hill Country, where the brisket is one of the best things on the menu. The pulled pork seemed merely competent. We loved the side dishes: Crusty Cheddar Macaroni, Kettle-Cooked Burnt Ends & Bacon Baked Beans, Sweet Potato Fries, and Baked Cornbread. The first two were especially good. The sides dishes served with the tasting platters are smaller than the sides ordered separately. A couple at the table next to us thought our cornbread looked good to share, but theirs came in a cast-iron skillet, and was about twice the size of our portion. There are wine and cocktail lists, but the highlight is a broad selection of beers and bourbons. A pitcher of Cold Ass - not a brand we'd heard of - was $22. Service at Wildwood is better than most barbecue restaurants. Reservations are accepted for dinner. There is a coat check girl (who refused a tip), and there was even an employee outside to flag a taxi for us on a rainy night. But the space is too cramped, with hardly an inch to spare between tables. It's neither as comfortable nor as authentic as Hill Country. We had no trouble getting a table when we walked in at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night, but the place was full by the time we left. Though there's better 'cue in the city, we suspect that Stephen Hanson will figure out a way to keep the customers pouring in. He usually does.

When Masayoshi Takayama sold his famed Los Angeles sushi restaurant and moved into the Time-Warner Center, most of the attention was lavished on his famously expensive four-star gem, Masa. There, you pay anywhere between $400-500 per person for whatever omakase menu Chef Masa wants to serve that day.I've not been to Masa, as the appropriate occasion to blow $1,000 (for two) on sushi hasn't yet presented itself. There's an adjoining restaurant called Bar Masa, and I gave it a try the other night. Reservations aren't taken, but the bar was only about half full, and only a couple of tables were unoccupied.Bar Masa has garnered scant critical attention, perhaps because it's considered an annex of Masa. But Bar Masa is really a separate concept. Here, the menu is à la carte. If you're in the chef's hands at Masa, at the place next door you're totally on your own.Given that it's run by a sushi chef, I thought that Bar Masa referred to a sushi bar. Silly me. It's an alcohol bar that also offers food. Whatever you order, even if it's sushi, is prepared behind the scenes, thereby depriving you of one of the great joys of sushi dining: the interaction with the chef.The first two facing pages of the menu are dedicated to prepared foods. There are about 90 choices. That's not a misprint. They're priced anywhere from $8-68, but mostly $18 and higher. They're in ten different categories, like \"Chilled,\" \"Salad,\" \"Hibachi Grilled,\" \"Braised,\" \"Fried,\" etc. I had trouble getting clear guidance from the confused servers, but it seems that the vast majority are appetizer-sized, meaning you'd probably need to order a good three or four of them, maybe five or six if you're hungry, to make up a full meal.The next couple of pages are the sushi menu, with rolls $18-120 (most $25 or less) and sushi/sashimi $6-65 (most $10 or less), or $98 for the omakase.This being a bar, there is a drinks menu, which takes the price of dining at Bar Masa to ludicrous levels. The house cocktails are $18-35, including $20 for an \"Ocean Bloody Mary\" (tomato and clam juice with pepper celery ice cubes). Sakes, sold by the caraffe, are $19 and up; wines by the glass $16 and up; by the bottle $60 and up. I confess some curiosity as to what a $20 Bloody Mary would be like, but I didn't feel lucky, and I felt totally adrift in the sprawling menu. I only wanted a snack, so I ordered the cheapest caraffe of sake ($19) and two of the prepared dishes.The caraffe of sake came in a stone bowl, wrapped in ice; the ceramic cup was pre-chilled, too. You pay through the nose here, but at least the presentation is first-class.Peking duck with foie gras in mooshu skin ($24) was a miniature version of the Chinatown classic. The preparation was lovely, but the food was not really that much better than you get elsewhere. And those pancakes were awfully small-about two bites apiece-making the dish $3 a bite.The server asked that I discontinue taking photographs, so I can't show the more striking dish, the Crispy Snapper Head ($28). There was no mistaking the poor snapper when the plate arrived: a fish head split in two, with a vacant eye socket staring at me. The eyes themselves, the brains, and indeed all of the fleshy parts were excavated before the head was breaded and tossed in the deep fryer.Once I got past the gross-out factor, the dish was a disappointment. With the soft parts gone, all that remained were a bread crust and dessicated bones. Think Southern-fried chicken without the chicken. Either they wasted a perfectly good snapper, or someone else got the tasty parts.Desserts was the only bargain: I finished with a perfectly respectable cheesecake: $9. There are probably many gems, along with some duds, on the menu at Bar Masa. But two small appetizers, the cheapest caraffe of sake, and a small dessert set me back $100 (including tax and tip). At that price, I'm not rushing back.Bar Masa (10 Columbus Circle, Time-Warner Center, 4th floor)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

I'm not sure what criteria you use, but I ate at bar masa last night and it was sublime. Presentation was outstanding, ingredients were pristinely fresh and service was attentive but unobtrusive. No it was not cheap but even a mediocre seafood restaurant charges a lot. I'd rather pay more and get fresh ingredients imaginatively prepared and great service and that's what you get at bar Masa. I'm looking forward to reading your other reviews. Marc

Thanks for the comment. I suspect that it's possible to dine very well here, but on such a sprawling menu there are bound to be weak spots. You're the second person to suggest that I may have underrated Bar Masa. Perhaps I didn't select the best items.

The Payoff: Momofuku Ko

***CONTENT
Today, Frank Bruni concludes the early review cycle for Momofuku Ko with a strangely mixed three-star review:You don't get start-to-finish enchantment, but that's not a function of insufficient coddling. It's a function of where you set the bar for a restaurant that must master only a cluster of dishes on a given night, and that compels you to surrender so fully to its authority.Under those terms there's a promise of unwavering transcendence, and Ko in its early months serves a few dishes that merely intrigue along with others that utterly enrapture. It also falls prey to some inconsistency.At least half the review was about matters other than the food: the newfangled reservation system; the minimalist aesthetic; the pared-down service. When he does discuss the food, he finds it surprisingly uneven.In a sense, this was a \"review by subtraction.\" Bruni started with the unwritten presumption that Momofuku Ko was gunning for four stars - a presumption certainly bolstered by Adam Platt's review in New York - and proceeded to explain why \"Deification may have come prematurely to Mr. Chang.\"Bruni was also hemmed in by his two-star reviews of Momofuku Ssäm Bar and Degustation, the most similar non-Chang restaurant in Manhattan. Ko is better than both.It seems that there's a \"bonus star\" available for any restaurant that confirms Bruni's wholly unwarranted assumptions about what the younger generation of diners is purportedly seeking in a restaurant:Ko pares down stuffy atmospherics in a particularly thorough way. It wagers that for a younger generation more focused on food than on frippery, a scruffy setting, small discomforts and little tyrannies are acceptable - preferable, even - if they're reflected in the price.Bruni's reviews have improved markedly over the years. We could almost become a fan if these tiresome rants were sent to the cutting-room floor, where they belong.We and Eater both took the obvious three-star bet, paying just even money. We both win $1 on our hypothetical bets. Eater NYJBankroll$87.50 $98.67Gain/Loss+1.00 +1.00Total$88.50 $99.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost39-16 39-16

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni delivers his most anticipated verdict in quite a long while. The beneficiary, or victim, is Momofuku Ko. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 15-1 One Star: 6-1Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: EVEN √√ Four Stars: 12-1A Bit of Trivia: On August 3, 1990, Bryan Miller of the Times upgraded Bouley to four stars. The next new member of that exclusive club was not named until December 10, 1993, when Ruth Reichl upgraded Chanterelle. That 175-week drought is the longest in the 45-year history of the New York Times star system.Do you know how long it has been since Frank Bruni named a new four-star restaurant? Remarkably enough, the last new entrant to the club was Masa, reviewed on December 29, 2004 - exactly 175 weeks ago.Tomorrow, regardless of what he does, Bruni will match a record of futility not seen since the 1990s; and he will set a new record if he awards anything less than four stars to Momofuku Ko.We do not suggest that Bruni is aware of the record that he is about to reach. But he must be aware that he is grading on a four-star scale, and it has been three years and four months since a new restaurant earned the top grade. He must, in a sense, be itching to pull the trigger, while also being aware that four stars mustn't be doled out lightly.It's an open question whether Bruni has called his past shots correctly. We think he under-rated several promising candidates, though we cannot say for sure that any of them deserved four stars. The atrophied state of high-end dining is in any case newsworthy-and something he must be thinking about-regardless of whether it's Bruni's own fault, the market's fault, or some combination of the two.The Skinny: Frank Bruni's rating of Momofuku Ko will depend on his interpretation of this little blurb, which appears at the bottom of every New York Times review:Ratings range from zero to four stars and reflect the reviewer's reaction to food, ambience and service, with price taken into consideration. (emphasis supplied)Bruni has frequently awarded two stars, and occasionally even three stars, to objectively middle-brow restaurants that he regarded as \"good values for the price.\" But to the best of our knowledge, no Times critic, including Bruni, has ever taken price into consideration at the four-star level. A top-rated restaurant has to be extraordinary in the absolute sense, not merely \"good for the price.\"We think Bruni has dined at enough four-star restaurants to recognize that Ko is not one of them. It is a remarkable restaurant in many ways, and we have come (quite reluctantly) to the view that David Chang deserves most of the laurels that have been tossed his way. But let's get real. Ignoring price, the experience at Momofuku Ko is a quantum leap below every four-star restaurant in town. Indeed, it's probably a mid-tier three-star place.Yes, it is very good for $85 prix fixe. But at that level, Ko is squarely in the price range of many three-star restaurants. For instance, the prix fixe at Eleven Madison Park is $82; Granted, it's not a long tasting menu (which would be $145), but rather three courses with some amuses-bouches and petits-fours thrown in. But those three courses have considerably more culinary craftsmanship than most of the menu at Momofuku Ko, and they're served in a room 10 times as lovely, by a staff 10 times as polished.To be sure, a four-star rating for Momofuku Ko would give Bruni the chance to put the heel of his boot on the Times star system in a way that none of his previous ratings have done. It's an opportunity that must have occurred to him. But we think he cares enough about his craft to recognize a real four-star restaurant from a mere imitator.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Momofuku Ko.Update: Just anticipating some potential comments here: The 175-week drought is the gap between new entrants to the four-star level. Bruni has had other four-star reviews, but they were re-affirmations of ratings given by his predecessors.

Note: As of February 17, 2009, Bar Q has closed. Anita Lo, co-owner of the beloved (and Michelin-starred) Annisa, has lately followed the path of many a celebrity chef who was trained in French kitchens: she's gone downmarket and pan-Asian. First came the Rickshaw Dumpling Bar in 2005, where she consults; and now, Bar Q. Bar Q is just a few minutes' walk from Annisa, so she won't have trouble keeping tabs on the place. But the upscale comfort-food menu looks like it was designed for dependable replication in her absence. There are a lot of dishes that are braised, smoked, roasted and fried, including plenty of pork. \"Tea-smoked\" recurs in the description of three different items. There are odd combinations, like \"tuna ribs\" and \"pork wings.\" Who knew pigs could fly? A \"Trio of Tartares\" makes the obligatory appearance. The space has been beautiully done in blonde woods and white walls. One of the servers said, with a grin, \"I painted all the artwork.\" There is no artwork; just hard, bare walls. I am a bit concerned that the space could become oppressively loud when full, but that is mere speculation, as the restaurant was nearly empty when I visited at around 6:00 p.m. on a Monday evening. There's a lovely outdoor garden, which is scheduled to open sometime in May. The menu is not inexpensive, with raw bar selections at $2-7 per piece, appetizers $11-16, entrees $18-29, and side dishes at $7. There's also a tendency to upsell. My server said, \"We recommend starting with a raw bar selection, followed by an appetizer and a main course.\" I thought to myself, \"Well, yeah, of course you recommend that.\" Once I had nixed that idea, the server helped me narrow down my order to the better appetizer and entree choices, describing each as a \"signature dish.\" You have to wonder how that's possible for a place that has been open three weeks. There are house cocktails, but when I told the server I don't like excessive syruppy sweetness, he suggested I give them all a pass. I heeded his advice in favor of an Old Fashioned. Grilled Squid Salad (left); Stuffed Spareribs (right) I started with the Grilled Squid Salad ($10), which had a wonderful smoky flavor. I asked the server if the squid had been smoked, and he cheekily replied that this was a \"secret\". The accompanying Hijiki salad (seaweed) was unmemorable. A dish called Stuffed Spareribs ($23) might lead you astray. It's a solid brick of pork, served off the bone: pork stuffed with pork. The sauce is described as \"Lemongrass BBQ, Peanut and Thai basil.\" Peanut is what stands out. Is it good? The execution was superb, so it comes down to whether you like your spareribs to taste like peanuts. Hours later, I was still a bit haunted by the porky-peanutty taste. But I'm not sure I want my spareribs like that. Bar Q offers a little bit of fun, but it strikes me as overpriced for a neighborhood place, yet not quite enthralling enough to become a destination.

Today, Commerce gets a well-deserved smack-down with a one-star review from Frank Bruni:The memo apparently went out, and those New Yorkers versed in showing up at the right new places right when they're supposed to have descended on Commerce in style and in droves. That makes it either exhilarating or enervating, depending on your age, your mood and the strength of your eardrums...Commerce in one sense evokes the Waverly Inn and in another emulates Balthazar. But in the end it isn't like either of them, which becomes clear when the menu arrives and, in its wake, the food.[Chef Harold Moore] ... creates a rankling dissonance, his dishes beseeching a closeness of attention that the frenzied atmosphere doesn't easily permit.And he errs. While there's some wonderful food that reflects the talent he showed and the experience he received at Montrachet and then March, there's also some food that's not cooked or seasoned as it should be, and there's food that's too fussy, not just for the ambience but also for its own good.I never root for restaurants to fail, but I must confess I am delighted that Bruni didn't fall for this mess. We've seen far too many restaurants attempting to serve three-star food in zero-star surroundings, with the aim of earning two stars. Enough is enough.Unfortunately, we didn't trust our gut, so we lose $1 on our hypothetical bet. So does Eater.

The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 6-1 One Star: 2-1 √√ Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 9-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: It has been a long time since we hated-I mean, really hated-a restaurant, coupled with a near-total belief that there was nothing the management could do to rescue the place. But that was how we felt about Commerce, which we detested in every way imaginable.Yet, every critic to review Commerce has given Harold Moore his due: the guy can cook. Based on the series of kitchens he has run, I have to assume the turgid entrees they served us were atypical. Based on the reviews, I have to assume that the team at Commerce usually have their act together-or at least, that they know a critic when they see one.The ambiance here is so unpleasant that I was tempted to change my rating system to allow negative stars, but it's clear the critics in town-while recognizing the drawbacks-didn't deduct as many style points as I did. And Bruni's verdict is seldom far off of the critical mainstream.There's also the dicta in Bruni's Chop Suey review, in which he was trying to figure out where to take a friend visiting from Spain. The places he considered, besides Chop Suey? Adour, Mia Dona, and Commerce. The reviews are in on the first two, both positive. He's not likely to have considered taking his friend to a restaurant he disliked. Then again, he took the friend to Chop Suey!The Bet: Though torn, we agree with Eater that Commerce is likely to just barely cross the finish line with two stars.

Fifty Commerce is one of New York's most charming addresses. Located on a twisting lane that no one can find without a map, it's a reminder of New York a century ago, with its cobblestones, low-slung Colonial-style townhouses, and the lovely Cherry Lane Theater. It hasn't been a charmed address for restaurants, though. The Depression-era speakeasy became the Blue Mill Tavern, then Grange Hall, then a second Blue Mill Tavern. The first Blue Mill lasted fifty years, and perhaps it should have stayed that way. Grange Hall was, as I understand it, a reliable burgers-and-fries place. Blue Mill's reincarnation replaced it, and sank. [Kreiger via Eater]Now comes Commerce, owned by two Montrachet alumni, Tony Zazula and chef Harold Moore. They've given it a thorough make-over, removing Blue Mill's art deco additions and restoring something like the old Grange Hall look. But this is no burgers-and-fries menu. Moore has stints at Daniel, Jean Georges and March under his belt. He and Zazula strive mightily to bring haute cuisine to this tavern-like atmosphere. They fail on almost every level. The miserable space is the loudest we have experienced in quite some time. I felt like I needed to check into a clinic for aural detox. The reservations book is mismanaged: we were seated thirty minutes late, and another party waited an hour. The host tried to offer us a bar table. We should have taken that deal, which would have been better than a frenetic dining room as crowded as Penn Station. We were much better off than the party of six seated at a circular table with the diameter of a hula hoop. At another tiny table, a couple were practically in each other's laps; fortunately, they didn't seem to mind. Bread Service Moore's cuisine doesn't offer sufficient compensation, though I'm not sure any food could. We adored the bounty of bread rolls, which might be the best bread service in the city right now. Our appetizers were wonderful, but the entrees were awful and took quite a while to come out. Dinner here isn't cheap, with appetizers at $11-19 and entrees $23-44 (most in the high twenties). As Eater noted, \"the menu really doesn't have an escape plan dish (say, a burger).\" Even if the service issues are fixed, we can't see this loud, cramped space surviving with a menu where you can't get out for less than $60 a head-and that's before you order from the over-priced wine list. During our long wait for a table, we cooled our heels at the bar-also plenty busy, but more comfortable than the dining room. Several of the house cocktails caught our fancy, such as the Brunswick (rye whisky, fig puree), the Cherry Lane (gin, cherry puree) and the Agave Stinger (tequila, burnt honey, fresh lime, soda, honeycomb), all $13. They also serve food at the bar. If you can get a seat, you'll probably have a better time, and get more attention, than in the dining room. Ragu of Odd Things (left); Terrine of Foie Gras Rillettes (right) We loved our appetizers, which at least showed the potential for Moore's menu, if only it were served somewhere else. A \"Ragu of Odd Things\" ($16) featured the likes of tripe, tongue, and oxtail. This hearty, filling dish could be a small meal in itself. A Duck and Foie Gras Rillettes Terrine ($19) was also nicely done. Had we left at that point, I would have gone home happy. Halibut (left); Stuffed Veal Breast (right) Both entrees failed. Halibut ($28) had been overcooked to the point that it became mush. The sweet pea sauce was alleged to contain speck ham and black truffles, but I couldn't detect the taste of either. To the restaurant's credit, they took it off the bill. Stuffed Breast of Veal ($26) had potential, but it had been left sitting under a heat lamp too long. It was only lukewarm. The front-of-house team seems to really care about what they're doing, but they are simply overwhelmed. I ordered (and was charged for) a 2003 Italian red wine; they brought the 2006. The flubs at our table, plus those we observed at others, seemed like more than most restaurants make in a week. And apropos of nothing, why don't they have a website? It's rare that we leave a restaurant with near certainty that \"We will never eat here again.\" That's the verdict for Commerce. If you go, bring your tylenol.

La Sirène

***CONTENT
Part of a critic's job is to direct readers to great restaurants they wouldn't otherwise discover. Unfortunately, most of New York's professional critics seldom have time to do so. With just one published review per week, it's all they can do to keep up with new restaurants that, for all intents and purposes, must be reviewed.So we were gratified to see Frank Bruni's review of La Sirène-a restaurant we'd never heard of. We're not sure how Bruni even found the place. When it opened in May 2007, every critic in town ignored it, except for Time Out New York, which awarded four-of-six stars. (TONY's ratings are a bit odd sometimes, but they have one of the most thorough dining-out sections in town.)Bruni awarded one star, but you shouldn't be deceived by that. One star is supposed to mean \"good,\" and though the stars have been debased over the years, this was one of those rare reviews in which one star was a compliment: Bruni loved the place.So did we.The name means \"The Mermaid,\" perhaps a nod to chef Didier Pawlicki's Marseille roots. The minimal decor in this tiny slip of a restaurant is faintly nautical, though there's red meat on the menu too, in addition to the obligatory fish and seafood, especially mussels.Pawlicki is a constant presence in the dining room, explaining himself and seeking our approval. He served the hangar steak at a table next to ours, and said, \"Here it is, medium. I refuse to cook it medium well.\" At another, he served sea bass and explained how much of the fish gets thrown away to yield just one filet. To us, he explained the sweet-sour balance of the chocolate in the profiteroles.Time Out New York called Pawlicki the \"Cockiest chef with the goods to back it up.\" (The little plaque the magazine gave him is hanging proudly on the wall.) On Citysearch.com, Pawlicki adds a personal comment to every review. The overwhelming majority of those reviews are positive.On the classic bistro menu, which changes seasonally, appetizers are $7.50-$13.95, entrees $19.50-$28.50, desserts $7.50-$12.75. There are four different preparations of mussels, $12.75 as an appetizer, $21.75 as an entree. It is probably time that Pawlicki rounded his prices off to the nearest dollar.These prices have risen considerably since TONY reported that the average entree was just $20. But La Sirène is more-or-less in line with other places serving food of comparable quality. The restaurant is also BYOB, and apparently has no plans to obtain a liquor license. This reduces the de facto cost of dinner considerably. Some of the menu descriptions mix French and English in almost comical ways, such as \"Brie, Blue Cheese et Chèvre Rotis sur Croutons a l'ail et Salade Verte\" ($13.75); that's brie, blue and goat cheese on garlic croutons over greens. Our other starter, Gateaux de Crabe ($11.85), speaks for itself.Both appetizers were adequate but unmemorable, and the plating of the crab dish wasn't very attractive. Hangar Steak, or Onglet Poele à la Facon Luchonaise ($24.50) was wonderful. The menu pronounces it the \"Signature Main Course.\" The steak was lightly seared, cut in thin ribbons fanned around the plate, served with a garlic and parsley sauce, and with a brick of sweet potatoes in the center. Hangar steak can sometimes be tough, but Pawlicki's version was so tender you'd think it was rib-eye.My girlfriend had the terrific Kassoulet Toulousain de la Maison ($26.95), with cannellini beans, tomato, duck leg confit, bacon and pork sausage, all braised with \"duck fat yummy!!!\"The challenge with this dish is to ensure the ingredients maintain their clarity; the last two places I've had it, the cassoulet was over-cooked, and it the flavor had all boiled away. Here, it was just about perfect.The entrees came with \"veggies du moment\" (left), served family style.The profiteroles have apparently been controversial, with some diners complaining the chocolate was too bitter, though others seemed to love it. Pawlicki yanked it from the menu, but he was able to whip up a batch rather quickly when Frank Bruni and his friends asked for it.Anyhow, it's back, along with Pawlicki's quirky description: Grand Profiteroles au \"Bittersweet\" Chocolat (Good to Share)Back on the Menu due to Overwhelming demand. (You like it, Good. You don't, it will stay this time! This isn't Hershey's Chocolate, but Callebaut!Pawlicki ain't kidding when he says \"Good to Share.\" With three pastries, each stuffed with ice cream, and the whole plate slathered in chocolate and whipped cream, even two people will struggle to finish it. We certainly didn't. We can understand the \"overwhelming demand\" for this excellent dish, but it's the most expensive dessert on the menu ($12.75). It should probably be scaled back a bit.The early TONY review referred to an \"empty dining room,\" but that isn't the case now. La Sirène has been discovered, and it was full on a Friday night. There are two servers for twenty-five seats, but they're patient and polished, despite the slightly hectic atmosphere. The ambiance is decidedly informal-you have to pass through the cramped kitchen to get to the restroom-but there's a romantic rusticity here that is instantly endearing. We suspect that La Sirène will remain a neighborhood classic for some time to come.Note that, except for AMEX, credit cards are currently not accepted.La Sirène (558 Broome Street, just east of Varick Street, SoHo)Food: *½Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: *½

An OpenTable Milestone

***CONTENT
Within the last week, the number of restaurants listed on OpenTable for Metro New York rose above 1,000.I've been on OpenTable for a little over four years. When I joined, the number of restaurants available was something well under 500. (In October 2005, the earliest date captured on the wayback machine, the total was 474.) I use OpenTable for almost all of my restaurant reservations. In the old days, you had to look up telephone numbers, make multiple calls, and wait on hold. Occasionally, either you or the restaurant screwed up, and the time they recorded (if they did at all) was different from what you asked for.With OpenTable, a list of available tables is available instantly. Even at tough-to-book times, there are usually dozens, if not hundreds of choices. Because it's all done electronically, with the restaurant seeing the same thing you have on your screen, errors are rare.There are still some limitations. Some restaurants do not make all of their tables available to the system. When OpenTable says there are no tables, that might not be true. Some restaurants are nominally on OpenTable, but seldom have actual tables available at reasonable times. The perennially-booked Gramercy Tavern is an example. If you want a table there, you'd better be prepared to get on the phone at 10:00 a.m. exactly four weeks in advance.A few well known restaurants aren't yet on the system at all, such as Babbo and Jean Georges. These restaurants have no trouble filling their tables the old-fashioned way, and have probably decided it isn't worth paying the bounty OpenTable charges for every reservation. I suspect they will join eventually. These days, pretty much every significant new restaurant is on the system immediately.For every reservation you make (and keep!) through the OpenTable system, you earn at least 100 \"dining points.\" Every 1,000 points is worth a $10 certificate, good at any OpenTable restaurant. My current total is 33,800 points, which would cover one blow-out meal or a few inexpensive ones.Some restaurants make 1,000-point reservations available; these are at times they have trouble filling. You'll never see it at Gramercy Tavern, but they aren't necessarily bad places, just unpopular times. If I'd made a point of nabbing 1,000-point reservations over the years, I could have had a lot more points accumulated by now.If you haven't made the switch to online reservations, it's way overdue. Whether you dine out occasionally or several nights a week, it is far more convenient than using the phone.

The Tasting Room's Hamburger

Note: As of June 2008, the Tasting Room has closed.The Tasting Room has added an \"Old MacDonald's\" Hamburger to the menu. I read about it on Grub Street, and it sounded intriguing enough to take an after-work detour.Chef Colin Alevras \"swore for twenty years that I wouldn't make one,\" that is, a hamburger, \"unless I could completely rework it in a way I believed in.\" Well, I guess he believes in it now. It has a section of the menu to itself, labeled \"To Experiment\" (it comes after \"To Start\" and \"To Continue\").Here's the description: Coarse Ground 6-week Dry Aged Piedmontese Beef, Marrow, Heart, Tongue & Liver Homemade Wholewheat Bread, Ouray Cheese, Fried Egg & Mushroom KetchupThe taste is not quite like any other burger you've had. All of those organ meats give it a slightly gamey flavor, but in an enjoyable way. The \"mushroom ketchup\" (how'd he come up with that?) complements the burger nicely. Alevras cooks it rare, with a charred crust.According to the server, some guests have tried to make a sandwich of it, but you need to be prepared for a gooey mess. I wasn't prepared for that, so I used my knife and fork, alternating between the burger and the fried egg & cheese. There was a garnish at the bottom of the plate, but I'm not sure what it was.I agree with Cutlets at Grub Street that the bread doesn't add much. If anything, it gets in the way. That's a drawback I recall from my last visit: Alevras puts bread on plates that would do better without it.The menu category, \"To Experiment,\" is appropriate. Alevras is toying with an idea. If you're the type who likes playful, inventive food, and if you don't mind taking a chance for $23, then maybe you'll enjoy this burger. It certainly won't be to all tastes.The menu at The Tasting Room changed over the winter. Formerly, most dishes were offered in either \"tasting\" or \"sharing\" portions. As I noted last time, this system leads to confusion, because the \"tasting\" portions were sharable too, and it wasn't clear how much to order.Well, the menu now features just one price for every item, with appetizers at $14-24, fish entrees $21-26, meat and poultry entrees $21-27, the cheese plate at $18, and desserts $8. It's gratifying to note that the entrees haven't yet crossed the $30 barrier, but the naming of the first three sections-\"To Start,\" \"To Continue,\" \"Followed By\"-tends to encourage a meal of three savory courses, and costs can mount in a hurry.The bartender told me that they found the old system of both \"tasting\" and \"sharing\" portions was confusing diners, who would either over- or under-order. It's a strange discovery for a restaurant that's been around a long while. I suspect the real reason is that the original format, which was developed for a restaurant one-third the size, didn't work as well in a larger space.Anyhow, there are no more \"tastes\" at The Tasting Room, which might just be a better restaurant without them.The Tasting Room (264 Elizabeth Street, south of Houston Street, NoLIta)

[Kreiger via Eater] Note: Click here for a more recent review of Benoit. My girlfriend was waiting when I arrived at Benoit last night. \"I've decided I want the whole menu,\" she said. It's an understandable reaction. If you like French classics, Benoit is the place for you. Nominally, the proprietor here is the reknowned Michelin star-studded chef, Alain Ducasse. But at Benoit, what you're getting is not so much Ducasse, but the French tradition that Ducasse has purchased and repackaged. The original Benoit, in Paris, dates from 1912. Ducasse bought the restaurant three years ago and duplicated it, first in Tokyo, and now in New York. Ducasse didn't stint here, spending more on the decor than he did at his other new restaurant, Adour. It abounds with wonderful little stylistic touches, such as the cute little paper wrappers around the napkins, the hefty wooden frames in which menus are delivered, and the fire-engine red trivets that hold the copper serving pots. That same red matches the banquettes and the coffee cups. The menu will bring a smile to anyone who gets weak-kneed at the sight of escargots ($16/doz.), onion soup gratinee ($9), or duck à l'orange ($24). Prices, for now, are bargains by today's standards, with the most expensive entree at $29: a lamb chop, medallion & filet, with gratin Dauphinois. If Ducasse were doing market research, he'd have branded it \"Lamb Three Ways\" and charged at least five bucks more. A Pâte en Croûte ($17) was wonderful. The menu advises that it's the \"Lucien Tendret recipe since 1892.\" Around the pâte itself is a luscious rim of gelatin, and around that a thin, soft coating of pastry. It's better than any individual pâte at Bar Boulud, though the latter restaurant has a much wider variety of them. If you're in a charcuterie mood, Benoit offers a $39 platter for two, featuring various hams, sausages, veal tongue, and so forth. That pâte isn't the only recipe credit on the menu. The cassoulet ($26) is the J. J. Rachou recipe. Rachou was the chef and owner at LCB Brasserie Rachou, and before that La Côte Basque, which had occupied this space before Ducasse acquired it. The cassoulet sorely tempted us, but we had another order in mind. The menu's most expensive item is a Roasted Chicken for two ($48). Ducasse is either crazy or a genius for making such a humble item the centerpiece of the restaurant. He could have served a 40 oz. côte de bœuf at an extravagant price, and no one would have blanched. It's what we expected of him. Instead, he is serving humble poultry-not a Bluefoot Chicken with truffles under the skin, as he did at the Essex House, but its humble, more rustic cousin. Benoit has only been open two days, but so far the strategy is working: chickens were flying out of the kitchen. It's a self-sustaining market. A wonderful aroma of garlic and rosemary fills the dining room as the waiters bring a sizzling chicken out of the kitchen. Those who haven't ordered yet ask their server, \"What is that?\" The server tells them, and they say, \"We'll have that too.\" Soon, another chicken comes out of the kitchen, to beguile another set of patrons. Lather, rinse, repeat. After the chicken is presented, the server whisks it back into the kitchen for carving. There's no magic about it, either. It is simply the traditional dish, expertly prepared. It is a bargain at $24 a person, considering that it is probably more chicken than you can finish. As good as it is, you'll want to try. Side dishes weren't as impressive. The chicken comes with french fries \"L'ami Louis style,\" which would be $8 if ordered separately. They're stacked and woven together in a cylindrical tower, which is striking to look at, but fries on the \"inside\" of the tower needed more time in the fryer, and weren't warm enough. Those on the outside were too greasy. A side of creamed spinach ($7) was nothing special and arrived too late. Except for the spinach snafu, the service routine was in very good shape for the second night. Bread rolls were fresh and soft, as was the butter. The restaurant's liquor license wasn't approved yet, but the restaurant had warned us in advance, and I'd brought a bottle with me. \"La Crema,\" our server noted. \"That will pair well with our food.\" The city's French \"old guard\" has been in decline for many years. Does that mean the old classics have lost their allure? We think they never do, especially when they're prepared as well as at Benoit. Some formality has been lost in the transition from La Côte Basque to Benoit. There's no \"voila!\" as each plate is delivered. A suit and tie are no longer de rigeur. But the food is right out of the old school-or so it seemed to us. As the Times noted a couple of weeks ago, this type of food, minus the jacket-and-tie policy, seems to be making a comeback. We're as fond of it as anyone, so we'll be hoping for many years of success at Benoit.

Today, Frank Bruni drops one star on Merkato 55, finding the highs and lows that we expected. The highs:With the qualified exceptions of Morocco and Egypt, Africa hasn't received much high-gloss treatment on the Manhattan restaurant scene...Merkato 55 fixes that, and how.With some 150 seats on two elaborately decorated levels in the overexposed, overwrought, when-will-it-be-over meatpacking district, it does more than give many African cuisines a degree of conventional polish they don't usually get...That is not a bad concept, and Merkato 55, at its best, is a bold adventure, ranging across the entire African continent in search of dishes you don't see often enough and dishes you haven't seen before.The lows:The menu mingles inspiration with too many hedges: the tuna tartar that astonishingly exists in every cuisine's canon, at least once that canon has been translated for modern-day New York; a lobster salad with ambiguous sub- or supra-Saharan bearings; a thinly veiled steak frites; a rack of lamb - supposedly graced with an Ethiopian berbere spice mixture, including garlic, red pepper, cardamom and fenugreek - that could be any restaurant's rack of lamb.My companions and I had lovely service and we had laughable service, usually on different nights but sometimes on the same one.We and Eater both win $2 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

Restaurant Girl's Ratings, WTF?

***CONTENT
Since she debuted as the New York Daily News restaurant critic last year, Danyelle Freeman (a/k/a \"Restaurant Girl\") has taken plenty of flak. In a recent interview, Robert Sietsema, the Village Voice's veteran critic, ripped into her:[New York Daily News]I think she was thrust into a very important position without having a lot of experience and perhaps chosen for extraneous reasons. Her writing has been improving, but still she seems to take an a priori, frivolous attitude towards the material. And the fact that she did choose to be recognized is, to me, like, really horrible... I presume that part of her being non-anonymous is that she goes into a restaurant under her own name, flashes her cleavage, and they just bring her free food.You could fill a book with her tortured prose, like this howler in her review of Dovetail: \"The rosy fish, grilled à la plancha, is exhilarated by a creamy horseradish gribiche (egg and mustard sauce) and bursts of caviar.\" The fish was exhilarated? Actually, I thought the poor fish would rather still be swimming.Fully alive to the problem, Freeman has the fix: she's changed her rating system to a best-of-five stars, replacing the former best-of-four. I believe it happened just this week, with three-of-five for Elettaria. She's also gone back and revised her old reviews retroactively-only the stars; not the grammar. That Dovetail review, formerly 3-of-4, is now 4-of-5.Her old scale allowed half-stars, but it seems the new one does not. Merkato 55 is a winner, rounded up to 3-of-5 from 2½-of-4. South Gate is a loser, rounded down to 1-of-5 from 1½-of-4. Most perplexing is Adour, which she didn't seem to like, but which gets the benefit of rounding to 3-of-5 from 2½-of-4.We weren't expecting to revise our star-system roundup quite this quickly. But revise it we will.Update: RG explained to Eater.com: \"The New York Daily News has newly implemented a five star rating system for all critical reviews (theater, movies, restaurants,) thus eliminating half stars...I have adjusted my system accordingly as well as readjusted all formerly filed reviews to the new system in order to maintain consistency.\"

hi. actually 2.5/4 = 62.5% and 3/5 = 60% so merkato loses too.

Mathematically, you’re right. But the average person loses sight of the math, and 3 stars sounds better than 2½.We don’t have a long track record with RG, but people talk of Bruni’s and Platt’s ratings as if they’re comparable, despite the fact that Bruni tops out at four stars, and Platt goes up to five.With that in mind, I’m sure the Merkato folks are happy with their three stars. That was what I meant.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Marcus Samuelsson's homage to Africa, Merkato 55. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 6-1 One Star: 2-1 √√ Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 9-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Here's a brief primer on Merkato 55.Marcus Samuelsson was born of African parents, but raised in Sweden. He became executive chef at the star-endowed Aquavit (which features Swedish cuisine) at an extremely young age, and by most accounts the restaurant is still delivering the goods, night after night-not withstanding our mildly disappointing meal there.Merkato 55 offers Samuelsson's take on African cuisine, but the concept is problematic on almost every level. Samuelsson is hardly ever there, and according to Eater, \"he's said to own a single-digit percentage of the restaurant.\" Does it even make sense to claim to cover a whole continent?Samuelsson's record outside of Aquavit doesn't inspire confidence. His only other non-Swedish venture was the Asian-fusion Riingo. It's still open after more than four years, but it's totally off the foodie radar. When we visited recently, we quickly saw why. And it has a lot in common with Merkato 55: a cuisine Samuelsson isn't known for, a restaurant he pays no attention to.Merkato 55 is in the Meatpacking District, which is better known for pub-crawling tourists than serious cuisine. There are plenty of restaurants here, but the neighborhood hasn't had a critical success since Spice Market, four years ago. Bruni has never liked a Meatpacking District restaurant.Early reviewers agree that it's possible to cobble together a good meal at Merkato 55. The better dishes are probably good for at least one star, especially as there's not much else in New York to compare them to. Bruni seldom gives the goose-egg unless a restaurant is hideously over-priced, or there's almost nothing worth ordering. Merkato 55 is better than that.But to get two stars, Merkato 55 will have to have a high ratio of hits to misses. Bruni will be skeptical of the absentee chef and a neighborhood where restaurants don't stay good for long.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Merkato 55 this week.

Whither \"$25 & Under\"?

***CONTENT
Last Friday, Eater.com broke the story that Peter Meehan had resigned as the \"$25 & Under\" dining critic at The New York Times. Meehan's editor, Pete Wells, confirmed the story on Grub Street, and today Meehan speaks up on Eater.com-dubbed an \"exit interview.\"Eric Asimov founded the \"$25 & Under\" column in 1992. As conceived at the time, the column was supposed to highlight \"restaurants where people can eat lavishly for $25 and under. For that price, you should be able to get a complete meal: appetizer, main course, and dessert. Beverages, tax, and tip are not included in the calculation.\"Like the Alternative Minimum Tax, the column name wasn't indexed for inflation. Asimov kept reviewing the kinds of restaurants he'd always reviewed, but by 2004 (his final year), the name wasn't literally true any more. As Asimov recounted in an eGullet Q&A, \"Let's be honest about the $25 cutoff. It made literal sense in 1992. Nowadays it communicates generally that this restaurant is going to be cheaper than the other restaurant on the page, and that it's going to be a good value.\"When William Grimes stepped aside as chief restaurant critic, Asimov could have had the job if he'd wanted it. Instead, Asimov chose the cushier job of chief wine critic, Frank Bruni took over as the main restaurant critic, and the \"$25 & Under\" job went to the then-unknown Peter Meehan.The paper had apparently decided to restore truth to the \"$25 & Under\" label. Meehan did as he was told, but the column became increasingly irrelevant, as he struggled to find newsworthy restaurants where you could have a $25 meal worth writing about. Bruni, in the meantime, \"stretched\" the traditional star system to encompass everything from Per Se to Katz's Deli.My view? Asimov had it right. Rename the column \"$40 & Under.\" Doing so would give Frank Bruni more bandwidth to cover the traditional territory of \"starred restaurants,\" and would restore to the former Asimov column the luster it used to have.My reasoning? The Times is a national paper first, a metro paper second, and a neighborhood paper third. Anyplace the Times reviews needs to be a \"destination\" in some sense. The $25 ceiling forces the critic into reviewing obscure outer-borough destinations that most readers don't care about. The paper will never have the bandwidth to do justice to tavernas in Queens or taco stands in the Bronx. Websites like Chowhound.com cover that ground more effectively than the Times ever can.I am not trying to make the Times any more elitist than it already is. I know there are some people who adore these humble neighborhood joints. But I am trying to be realistic about what the paper's dining section can realistically achieve. Editor Pete Wells seems to have realized this, when he dialed back \"$25 & Under\" to bi-weekly, replacing it with \"Dining Briefs,\" a column that provides shorter snapshots of two or three restaurants at a time.If Times management is unwilling to lift the \"$25 & Under\" ceiling to a level that would restore the column to its original purpose, then they should just kill the column altogether, and run \"Dining Briefs\" every week.

L'Atelier de Joël Robuchon

***CONTENT
The French Gault Millau hailed Joel Robuchon as Chef of the Century-the last one, that is.So when Robuchon's L'Atelier (the name means \"workshop\") arrived in town, what did the city's two principal critics say? They complained the place was too casual. New York's Adam Platt said that he would award four stars for the food, negative one for the ambiance, for a total of three, the same total Frank Bruni awarded.Let us recall that Platt awarded four stars to Momofuku Ko without subtracting a star for ambiance, even though the experience at Momofuku Ko is in every respect inferior to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.Let us also recall that after Frank Bruni reviewed this restaurant in October 2006, it took another sixteen months for him to find another new restaurant worthy of three stars. When he finally did, what was it? Why, Dovetail, another restaurant in every respect inferior by an order of magnitude to L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.After I returned home from my visit here, I immediately resolved to downgrade Momofuku Ko, a very good restaurant to which I had, nevertheless, erroneously awarded 3½ stars. One needs to be reminded occasionally of what the word \"extraordinary\" really means, lest it be confused with that which is merely \"excellent.\"Food isn't the only thing that's extraordinary at L'Atelier. So are the prices. Little tasting plates range from $17-38 (not counting the caviar dish), and you'll need about four of these to make a satisfactory meal. Appetizers range from $16-44, entrees from $37-46. Desserts are $17 apiece. The nine-course tasting menu is $190, making it the city's third-most expensive after Masa and Per Se. The wine list, as you'd expect, carries prices to match: I saw no reds below $70.But those who dine at this class of restaurant are already reconciled to dropping a sum of money. Momofuku Ko doesn't become better than L'Atelier, just because David Chang has found a way to serve extremely good (though not extraordinary) cuisine at a price for the masses.The two restaurants are comparable in many ways, as both feature counter dining, though the counter at L'Atelier is considerably more spacious and comfortable. L'Atelier also has twenty-six table seats, and I suspect much of the experience is diluted if you sit there, as it would be at any good sushi restaurant.But continuing the comparison, it must be noted that L'Atelier has considerably more kitchen space than Momofuku Ko. With about 36 savory courses and 8 desserts, you could dine at L'Atelier a good half-dozen times without duplicating a selection. At Momofuku Ko, you will have come fairly close to exhausting the possibilities after just a couple of dinners.At L'Atelier, the level of precision is something remarkable to behold. A chef actually uses tweezers to place chives on a plate. A couple of times, we were astounded, not merely at how good something tasted, but at how it could have existed at all. Robuchon is not just a chef, but a magician too.Although Robuchon has seventeen Michelin stars (currently tops in the world), and something like eighteen restaurants, he is not a totally absentee chef. He recently spent a week in New York. Food & Wine reported that he was actually cooking. (We asked the staff about this, and they conceded he does not spend the whole evening in the kitchen, and that he does a good deal of schmoozing, too.)To dine at L'Atelier, you have to put up with a slightly overwhelming menu. The items are in three categories (tasting plates, appetizers, entrees). Assuming you give the tasting menu a pass (which we did), how much constitutes a meal? The server advised that each \"tasting plate\" is generally about half the size of a conventional appetizer, but this isn't strictly true when you consider the richness of the food. (My girlfriend wondered how many tons of butter they go through in a day.)We decided to order two tasting plates and one entree apiece, and to swap plates in between courses, which allowed us to try six things between us. Bread service; Amuse-boucheThe bread service was lovely, though I would have preferred softer butter to go with it. The amuse-bouche was a delightful little foie gras mousse with a port reduction and parmesan foam. Le Saumon (left); L'Ognion Nouveau (right)The dishes here have deceptively simple names. I started with Le Saumon ($25). On the right side of the plate are two strips of thinly cut smoked salmon. On the left is a tangle of shredded crisp potato, but inside is a lightly poached egg. How they got the potato to completely surround the egg without damaging it is a mystery. You cut into the potato, and the egg yolk spills out: a deconstructed egg, salmon and potato omelet.L'Ognion Nouveau ($24), an onion tart, was less mysterious, but every bit as accomplished in its preparation. Le Ris de Veau (left); Les Burgers (right)Le Ris de Veau ($29) offered two succulent sweetbreads, but equally delightful was the spring of stuffed romaine lettuce-stuffed with what? We were not sure, but it was astonishing.But that was nothing compared to Les Burgers ($39), two small double-decker burgers with beef, foie gras and caramelized bell peppers, with hand-cut fries and Robuchon's take on homemade ketchup. In another restaurant, these tiny burgers would be called sliders, but they put to shame every other version I've tried. The beef and foie gras melt together into one potent flavor package. Of the fries, my girlfriend said, \"These are what I want before I die.\" La Caille (left); Le Tete de Veau (right)The entrees didn't rock our world quite as much as the tasting plates did. La Caille ($45), or quail, is one of Robuchon's signature dishes, and I suspect anyone that loves the bird would love this bird. He stuffs the breast with foie gras, and caramelizes the outside. There are two little wings, two little breasts, and a potato puree on the side. I thought the dish disappeared awfully quickly for something that costs $45, and it was a lot of work to pull off what little meat a quail wing had to offer. But 'tis ever thus with quail. (The menu also offers a tasting portion of this dish, at $30.)Le Tete de Veau ($42) is a remarkable preparation of a veal's head, with bits of the cheek, tongue, and other unmentionables pounded thin, layered, rolled in a layer of fat, and cooked till crisp. We both thought that the fat overpowered the dish, but we didn't have a basis of comparison for evaluating this classic. Cheese plate; Cappuccino; Petits-foursIn lieu of dessert, we chose the cheese plate ($28), with four wonderful choices: from left to right, Hoch Ybrig, Emissaire de Notre Dame, Camembert Chatelain, and Bleu d'Auvergne. (The staff kindly produced a handwritten list when we asked for it.)The unusually large cappuccino ($12) seemed worthy of a photo too, as well as two precious chocolate petits-fours that came on their own little pedestal.The service throughout was first-class, notwithstanding the inherent informality of the counter setting. (Even the runners wear white gloves.) Our server had some mannerisms that were a bit irritating. Whatever we ordered seemed coincidentally to be her favorite item on the menu. A couple of times, she punctuated our dinner with \"Good job!\", as if we were earning merit badges.The restaurant is located in a corner of the Four Seasons hotel, but there is little separation between the dining room and the hotel bar just outside it. Both New York's Platt and the Times' Frank Bruni complained that the bar's hubbub interfered with the quiet seclusion that such a meal ostensibly calls for. That may well have been true in the early days, when foodies were tripping over each other to try New York's latest new thing. It was not an issue at any time during our two-hour meal on a Saturday evening. The restaurant was about two-thirds full.With its stratospheric prices, L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon does not allow you to get out cheaply. Dinner for two came to $475, including tax and tip. At our income level, it cannot be anything more than an \"occasion place,\" visited occasionally. But assuming you take the plunge, you are almost certain to be treated to a level of cuisine few New York restaurants can match.L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon (57 E. 57th Street between Park & Madison Avenues, in the Four Seasons Hotel, East Midtown)Food: ****Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ****

Cocktails at Tailor

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Tailor. Most restaurants go through an adjustment period after they open, as chefs figure out what works, and what doesn't. Those adjustments were somewhat more dramatic at Tailor, where chef Sam Mason had to eat a huge helping of humble pie, after his restaurant was roasted and pilloried by every critic in town. In an early visit, I found the restaurant promising, but the menu didn't have enough choices, and the lack of a serious wine list was a serious drawback. Mason has rectified both. The current menu offers about a half-dozen each of appetizers ($15-17), entrees ($24-27) and desserts ($12), though it must be noted that portion sizes remain small, and hearty eaters may need to order more than three courses to go home full. A seven-course chef's tasting menu is $90, which seems exorbitant when you consider that Momofuku Ko serves ten courses for $85. The wine list has been fleshed out too. Early on, Mason conceded that \"Wine's a little beyond me,\" but he finally figured out that customers want wine with food. From the beginning, Eben Freeman's cocktails won high praise, but I still think they pair poorly with food. They need to be enjoyed on their own. Last night, I dropped in for a couple of cocktails before heading uptown for dinner. The bar area is downstairs, and it is one of the loveliest bar spaces in town. Both of my visits have been quite early (around 5:30 p.m.), when it is still relatively empty, and the bartenders have time to chat. One feature of Eben Freeman's cocktail menu is that almost every item has ingredients you never heard of. I asked for something \"not too sweet,\" and the bartender recommended the Mate Sour ($13), which is made from Yerba Mate, Queberante Pisco, Lime Juice, Honey, Egg Whites, and Angostura. Half of those ingredients are as unfamiliar to me as they probably are to you. But it had a nice cool, bracing taste. Freeman also serves a tasting of three \"solid cocktails\" ($12), captioned Cuba Libre, Ramos Gin Fizz, and White Russian. The menu is unhelpful-it lists only the short names-and I wasn't about to give the bartender the third degree. I'd describe them as interesting, rather than good, and they disappear awfully quickly. I asked the bartender about a mysterious unlabeled bottle, which he said was tobacco-infused bourbon. None of the cocktails on the printed menu actually uses that ingredient, so I asked him to make one up for me. So he put some tobacco-infused bourbon, Jim Beam, and a couple of different bitters into a mixing vessel, and voila! Out came the drink shown on the left, which resembled an Old Fashioned. Last week's Time Out New York named Tailor \"Best restaurant you were sick of before it opened.\" That captures the contradiction, which is that Tailor is very good, but suffered badly from early over-exposure. I didn't eat any of the food this time, but it looks like Tailor has matured. Those who were sick of it should consider a second look.

Uncle Jack's Steakhouse

***CONTENT
New York's bustling steakhouse industry has settled into three distinct camps: classic, modern, and Peter Luger clones. Classic steakhouses feature fairly predictable menus, old-school waiters (always men), and throwback decor (mahogany paneling, white tablecloths, oil paintings). You often see large, boistrous, all-male parties at these places; they're much favored by investment bankers celebrating the latest deal, and so forth. Sparks and Keens are typical classic steakhouses. Modern steakhouses are those that break the mold, usually by offering non-steak items you can take seriously, more inventive side dishes, friendlier service, and more contemporary decor. BLT Prime and Craftsteak head up this category. The Luger clones are a variant on the classic steakhouse, but there are enough of them to list separately. The key giveaway is a menu that emphasizes \"Steak for One\" (Two, Three, or Four), the famous thick-cut Canadian bacon, and German-fried potatoes as a side dish. Examples include Wolfgang's and Mark Joseph. Uncle Jack's Steakhouse is firmly in the classic mold, and it may be the best of the bunch. I loved my first visit there, 2½ years ago, even if my three-star rating was utterly crazy. I don't know what took me so long to get back, as the Ninth Avenue location is practically on the way home. Anyhow, I finally got back again the other night. I was enormously impressed with a truncheon-sized ribeye ($45) with a beautiful exterior char. Only at Strip House have I seen it bettered. I was impressed with the wine list, too: a hefty tome with plenty of decent bottles below the $50 mark, and wines by the glass that are actually printed. At most of the classic and Luger-style steakhouses, the waiter just intones, \"Cabernet, Merlot, Shiraz, Pinot Noir,\" as if it were irrelevant which Cabernet, Merlot, Shiraz, or Pinot Noir they were serving. The decor, I must admit, is a little tacky, with \"Lobster,\" \"Caviar,\" etc. painted in big block letters along the wall. In other respects, Uncle Jack's has the standard steakhouse ambiance nailed. Service is better here, with waiters who don't seem as bored as most steakhouse waiters, and who circle back frequently to check up on you. Uncle Jack's doesn't get as much publicity as the other classic steakhouses, but I am not sure why. On the basis of my visits, I much prefer it to Keens or Sparks-to give but two eamples. There are now three outposts of Uncle Jack's: the original in Bayside, the one I visited on Ninth Avenue, and the newest branch in West Midtown, on 56th Street.

I had a very different experience.I asked for a Kir with Cassis. What I got was clearly not made with cassis. I mentioned this fact to our waiter who replied,\" Kir with cassis, looks like one to me.\" \"Please take it back\", I said. The waiter returned without the drink saying \"we have no cassis.\"Then our waiter warned us that the appetizers were very large and one would be fine for both of us. We ordered the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail to split. \"Would that be sufficient?\", we asked. \"Certainly\", he replied, \"that will be two pieces each?\". \"Fine\", we said.When the check arrived it had a $6 charge for \"extra piece (shrimp)\". I questioned the charge and he said \"well, the shrimp cocktail has only three pieces and I asked if you wanted four\". \"How could we possibly know your shrimp cocktail had only three pieces?\".We are seeing 14 Broadway performances through December, we will not being going back to this restaurant..The $6 was not the point; it was like some Theater District clip-joint.

With Passover starting tomorrow, I doubt that anyone who cares about celebrating a Seder is still looking for restaurant suggestions. Still, I thought I'd share my research.I was surprised how many serious restaurants are offering Seders or Passover-themed meals this weekend:At Savoy, chef-owner Peter Hoffman cooks the Sephardic-accented meal and leads the Seder himself. Price: $110.At Tabla, Floyd Cardoz celebrates Passover Indian-style. Price: $95.At Compass, Neil Annis mixes a modern American and traditional Jewish menu. Price: $110.At Capsouto Frères, which has offered its Seder for 20 years, the menu is Sephardic-themed, and the proceeds are donated to charity. Price: $150.These are all wonderful restaurants-places I'd be pleased to recommend any day of the week. On paper, Tabla appears to have the best deal, not merely because it has the lowest price, but because it's the best restaurant of the bunch.But the pièce de resistance is Passover at Sammy's Roumanian, where the watered-down Seder (just 20-minutes long) costs $190. Just three years ago, they were charging only $90 for it. We were actually considering Sammy's-the 20-minute service is right up our street-but at the inflated price we'll take a pass.So where are we going instead? L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. Same price as Sammy's; food from another universe.

The Times' Florence Fabricant and I may be among the few cheering about the return of classic French cuisine, but perhaps there will soon be restaurants full of us. The other night, I looked in on the newest of these, Brasserie Cognac de Monsieur Ballon, or just Brasserie Cognac for short.Let's get this out of the way: Monsieur Ballon doesn't exist. He's an invention of the folks who own the Serafina chain, who now envision a bunch of brasseries by Mr. such-and-suches-this being the first. I wasn't optimistic that the purveyors of formulaic Italian could put out a French restaurant of any distinction, but at first blush they've made a very serious attempt.For starters, they engaged Rita and Andre Jammet, who had owned three-star La Caravelle, as consultants. The kitchen is in the hands of Florian Hugo, the great-great-grandson of the author Victor Hugo. The decor and menu are in the conventional brasserie style, authentic-looking without going over-the-top.I would have overlooked a dish called Vol-au-vent, had not the server pointed it out. I don't recall seeing it on any brasserie menu in New York. The waiter, who was French, assured me that it's one of the classics, but not often served because it's difficult to prepare. Wikipedia explains:A Vol-au-vent (French for \"windblown\" to describe its lightness) is a small hollow case of puff pastry. A round opening is cut in the top and the pastry cut out for the opening is replaced as a lid after the case is filled. Vol-au-vents can accommodate various fillings, such as mushrooms, prawns, fruit, or cheese, but they are almost always savory.The Vol-au-vent here was a lovely, light puff pastry that corralled a serving of lobster, foie gras and mushrooms in a lobster sauce. I was astounded that an entree made with so many luxury ingredients was only $29.There is some serious talent at the bar, too. I counted 18 house cocktails, and not just rote formula drinks with \"-tini\" and \"-rita\" suffixes. Six of them are cognac based, including the terrific one I tried, the Do Re-my ($12), served in a champagne glass with Remy Martin, sour mix, St. Germain liqueur, and Charles Heidsieck champagne.There are 110 cognacs available. The printed list wasn't yet available (it was only the restaurant's second night), but the manager recommended an XO (normally $14) and then comped it. Service was slightly helter-skelter, but the staff (mostly Europeans, it appeared) were friendly and apologetic. I assume it will improve after things settle down.I'll withhold judgment till I've had a chance to sample more, but if the rest of the menu is as good as the Do Re-my cocktail and the Vol-au-vent, then Brasserie Cognac is very good indeed. At the least, it's a compelling new option for pre-Carnegie Hall dining.Brasserie Cognac (1740 Broadway at 55th Street, West Midtown)

I went there last night and for the first time in my life, I received terrible service, Cold French Onion Soup, the cheese was like a block on the lions bowl. It should not take 20 minutes to get a bottle of wine when the restaurant was half empty. The Sarafina Boys take NYers for granted and its amazingly evident at this location.I am in the restaurant business and this is not how I would do it. La Caravelle this place is not. Rita and Bruno don't need the money and they have failed in their mission in this location.

Fabulous restaurant! I have been there 4 times and it is better everytime. I am addicted to the spinach salad with avacados and pine nuts. They add new dishes to the menu nightly, I had the best cous cous dish there a few weeks ago. The warm cheese puffs are good, but I'm worried about the calories...The vibe in the restaurant is very fun. When the owners are there, make sure to say hello and ask them any questions. I don't know them personally, but they always say hello and treat my friends and I with warmth.

Today, Frank Bruni awarded the expected three stars to Alain Ducasse's newest restaurant, Adour:Alain Ducasse may never live down the grandiose way he first swept into town, granting blinkered New Yorkers a vision of French elegance few of them had ever experienced, expected or, for that matter, asked for...This time around he's taking a less flamboyant approach, and he's eager to get out that message, so much so that advance reports on Adour, named for a river in France, made it sound like an embellished wine bar.Right. It's a wine bar the way Lourdes is a roadside shrine, and it proves that even a dressed-down Mr. Ducasse is still a puffed-up anybody else...But you'll notice a relative straightforwardness in many preparations that distinguishes Adour from its Essex House ancestor. And among a well-edited collection of dishes that range from quietly appealing to quietly stunning, you won't notice that forebear's ostentation.Someone seems to have put happy pills in Frank's coffee. He has already awarded three stars to four restaurants this year, two of which are new. Last year, he gave out three stars only six times all year, and they were all re-reviews. This is also the fourth time this year that Frank has filed a reasonably favorable review of a French restaurant, a cuisine he has not historically been fond of.We and Eater both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

Ducasse’s Benoit to Open

This has been a busy year for Alain Ducasse, with two new restaurants opening in New York, to say nothing of his ever-growing worldwide empire.First up was Adour, which we weren't fond of, but was feted with three stars by both Adam Platt and Frank Bruni. For the verdict Ducasse really cares about - Michelin - we'll have to wait till October.Meanwhile, Benoit opens on April 21 in the former Brasserie LCB space, which before that was La Côte Basque. As usual, Ducasse didn't stint on the decor. Per the Times:To furnish Benoit, Mr. Ducasse haunted the Paris flea markets buying stuff, including an 1866 decorative ceiling painted on glass, and fixtures from a former Banque de France. A 19th-century herbal pharmacy from Bordeaux was reassembled on the second floor.He also kept a few decorative elements from La Côte Basque. \"I hoped to transfer the ambience of Benoit, not make an exact reproduction,\" Mr. Ducasse said, adding that Benoit in New York cost more to build than his other new Manhattan restaurant, Adour, in the St. Regis a block away.La Côte Basque's former chef-owner, Jean-Jacques Rachou, told the Times that he thinks \"New York is now regretting the disappearance of the classic food.\"Classics, indeed, are what dominates the menu at Benoit. Ducasse said, \"Dishes like these have a history, and I have a list of 100 of them that I hope to put on the menu sooner or later. I call it my mental terroir.\" The opening menu, though, runs the risk of putting the audience to sleep, with a $44 chicken for two as the signature item. I'll be rooting for Ducasse to open up his cookbook sooner, rather than later.I took an envious look inside last night. The restaurant was clearly open and serving \"friends & family.\" I am neither, and so I left Benoit for another day.

The chicken you refer to somewhat contemptuously is supposed to be in the style of the famous L'Ami Louis in Paris which has the best chicken I have ever had in my life--tender, succulent, crispy skin-not just \"chicken\" so bravo to Ducasse bringing classics back to NY

The printed menu did not mention the L'Ami Louis connection. As this was a preview of a restaurant not yet open, I was going by waht was printed.I have sinced dined there (report here, and that chicken was indeed excellent. I am totally with you about the excitement of bringing back bistro classics.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Alain Ducasse's Adour, the chef's latest attempt to bring high-end French dining to New York. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 15-1 One Star: 10-1Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 3-1 √√ Four Stars: 7-1The Skinny: We weren't impressed with Adour. Perhaps its far superior predecessor, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, cast too long a shadow. We found Adour boring and underwhelming, a verdict that a number of other early diners have shared. Even New York's Adam Platt, while awarding three stars, seemed to damn with faint praise: \"Ducasse's new, occasionally flat interpretations of local tastes is rescued by the elegant room (one star), the elevated cooking technique (another star), and the desserts (the third star).\"On top of that, Bruni has never shown much affection for French food. Until quite recently-his review of La Sirène, to be specific-I was not aware of an example where Bruni went to a French restaurant by choice. He visited them, to be sure, but only when the visit was more-or-less compelled by circumstances beyond his control. No restaurant critic can avoid French food entirely, but it just doesn't seem to float his boat the way Italian, Asian, and steakhouses do.For all of these reasons, until a week ago, we were ready to bet the house that Adour would receive at best two stars from Bruni, with a singleton being a not indistinct possibility. But as Eater noted, we can't ignore the dicta in last week's review: \"I knew that Chop Suey, which I'd visited before, wouldn't give us a meal as proficient and pampering as the one we'd get at, say, Adour.\"Now, for a restaurant at Adour's price level, a two-star review is a put-down, and Bruni knows it. If he thinks Adour is \"proficient and pampering,\" he has to award the three stars the restaurant was designed for. You just can't call Adour \"proficient\" while two-starring it.We could leave it at that, but there's one other observation. Critics love it when their opinion is perceived to be vindicated. Bruni wasn't fond of Adour's predecessor at the Essex House, demoting it from four stars to three. It was one of the dumbest reviews of his tenure, but it happened, and the restaurant closed. He was vindicated. Bruni thinks New Yorkers no longer want traditional formality. He is wrong, but that's what he thinks. Adour is a lot less formal than Ducasse's old space in the Essex House. Bruni is again vindicated, and the review will surely say so.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Adour.

Stars: Here and Elsewhere

Many media outlets, including this blog, use stars to rate restaurants. I've posted explanations of the star system before, but recently it struck me how much different the various \"star systems\" are, despite their surface similarity.This can cause quite a bit of confusion. In the Michelin Guide, one star is a significant honor, but in The New York Daily News one star means \"disappointing\". The New York Times system is somewhere in between: one star means \"good\". Three stars or more always signifies an extremely good restaurant, except in Time Out New York, where the scale goes up to six, and therefore three is just mediocre.I thought it was time that all of these systems were summarized in one place. First, here's a summary, with the systems listed roughly in declining order of pedigree. Beneath the name of each source, I provide a link to a page, or pages, where it's explained in more detail:SourceRangeExplanationMichelin Guide[see here]1-3*** Excellent cuisine and worth the journey**Excellent cooking and worth a detour*A very good restaurant in its categoryNew York Times[see here, here]0-4****Extraordinary***Excellent**Very Good*GoodZero Satisfactory, Fair or PoorNew York Magazine[see here]0-5*****Ethereal; almost perfect****Exceptional; consistently elite***Generally excellent**Very good*GoodZero (No explanation)New York Daily News[see here, here]1-45(No explanation)****Sheer perfection***½ Truly exceptional***Outstanding**½Great night out**A safe bet*½Hit or miss*DisappointingTime Out New York[see here]1-6(No explanation)Bloomberg[see here]0-4****Incomparable food, service, ambience***First-class of its kind **Good, reliable*FairZero PoorI listed the Michelin system first, for though it is relatively new to New York, it has been employed in Europe since the 1930s. To be a \"Michelin-starred\" restaurant is an internationally recognized honor, and it's a distinction many European tourists rely on. However, it's the system that New Yorkers pay the least attention to.The newspaper and magazine systems all operate on the same basic idea, though the meaning of a rating varies widely, depending on how high they go (four, five, or six), how low they go (one or zero), and whether they accommodate half-stars (only the Daily News does).The New York Times is the dean of the star-bestowing media. It has been handing out stars since 1963. At the other extreme is Bloomberg, which seems to have inaugurated its star system just a few weeks ago with a three-star review of Jean Georges.But most of the others are pretty new, too. New York Magazine's star system debuted in 2006. The current system in the Daily News dates from the summer of 2007, after a lengthy period when the paper had no restaurant reviews. Time Out New York's peculiar six-star system bowed in mid-2006.New York TimesAlthough the Times system is 45 years old, it has changed often. Leonard Kim, the eGullet Society's star system historian, has charted its many tweaks. The original system was just three stars, with the fourth added in 1964. In 1971, critic Raymond Sokolov added a separate rating of one-to-four \"triangles\" for service, atmosphere and decor. The triangles were dropped in 1973.There's more to the Times stars than the cryptic explanation printed in the newspaper every week. Thanks again to Leonard Kim, we know that Mimi Sheraton's typical rating was one star (almost half of her reviews), with about 20-25% two stars, and another 20-25% zero stars. Three and four stars were given out quite infrequently. Kim thinks that \"this is the most sensible system.\"Under Sheraton's successor, Bryan Miller, the percentage of zero-star reviews dropped to around 10-15%, with one or two stars being handed out with about equal frequency (35-40%). Under the next critic, Ruth Reichl, two-star reviews were given out over half the time. She also gave out three stars a fairly generous 15% of the time, while zero-star reviews became a great rarity (4-5%).William Grimes brought the stars back under control, reducing the frequency of three-star awards and increasing the frequency of one star. However, he continued Reichl's practice of giving out zero stars only rarely. Bruni's frequencies are more-or-less comparable to Grimes's, but Bruni comes down hard on luxury restaurants while being quite generous with two-star ratings for extremely casual places.Because the zero-star rating is so seldom used, some of the other ratings have lost their nominal meanings. For decades, one star has supposedly meant \"good,\" but Frank Bruni's one-star reviews seldom sound good. It's the rare restaurant nowadays that would be pleased to receive just one star. The Times's zero-star reviews carry an additional label: Satisfactory, Fair, or Poor. (No other paper does this.) Bruni has given \"Poor\" only twice, he has never given \"Fair,\" and his \"Satisfactory\" reviews never sound very \"satisfied.\"Some papers don't reprint the definitions every week, but the Times does, along with this blurb: \"Ratings range from zero to four stars and reflect the reviewer's reaction to food, ambience and service, with price taken into consideration.\"That blurb has changed over the years. In 1974, it said, \"The restaurants reviewed here each Friday are rated four stars to none, based on the author's reaction to cuisine, atmosphere and price in relation to comparable establishments.\" The words \"comparable establishments\" were dropped in 1984, though you could argue that the system in spirit still operates that way.Bruni has explained what the stars mean to him:There are no assigned percentages for food versus service versus ambience. The star ratings take into consideration all of those elements, giving primary importance to food, to come to a conclusion about how excited I would be to return to the restaurant. The number of stars chart ever greater degrees of excitement.This cannot be the full explanation, because you'll read two-star reviews in which he sounds extremely excited (e.g., Franny's), and you'll read other two-star reviews that sound like he hates the place (e.g., Gordon Ramsay). That's because there is an unwritten \"rule of expectation.\" An expensive luxury restaurant expects to get at least three stars, and his review is written in light of that. In his Ramsay review, it sounded like he was \"taking away\" the implied third star. A two-star rating is supposed to mean \"very good,\" but the tenor of the review was \"not good at all.\"There seems to be an unwritten rule that a three-star restaurant needs to have most, if not all, the trappings of \"traditional luxury.\" Frank Bruni has relaxed that requirement on occasion, but you haven't seen a three-star pizzeria yet. There also seems to be an unwritten rule that there can be no more than half-a-dozen four-star restaurants at any given time. Four stars means \"extraordinary,\" and by its nature, it can't often be given out.None of the New York media updates obsolete ratings systematically, but the Times at least tries. In the first three months of 2008, four of Bruni's reviews were updates, including two that Bruni himself had previously reviewed. New York's Platt, as far as I know, has never updated any of his own ratings in several years on the job. However, with only 52 reviewing slots per year, most of them covering just a single restaurant, the Times often goes many years between updates, even when there have been significant intervening events.For instance, the Times's blurb for three-star Oceana says, \"The good ship Oceana - a two-story town house decorated to resemble a yacht - has found a new surge of energy.\" That \"surge\" dates from William Grimes's 2003 review. The chef who supplied that surge of energy, Cornelius Gallagher, left Oceana in 2006, but the obsolete review remains in place. Major shakeups at three-star restaurants are infrequent enough that you'd think the Times could take note of them, but apparently Mr. Bruni doesn't think so.Two other changes over the years have limited the paper's ability to keep its ratings updated. Up to the end of Bryan Miller's tenure, the critic normally reviewed two restaurants per week. When Ruth Reichl arrived in 1993, she switched to one longer review of a single restaurant per week, dramatically reducing the paper's bandwith to update previously given ratings. Frank Bruni has revived the custom of the double review, but he uses it only a handful of times per year.The other change is in the way that casual, inexpensive restaurants are handled. Historically, the Times restaurant critic's beat had a clear emphasis on \"fine dining.\" That became more explicit in 1992, when Eric Asimov started the \"$25 and Under\" column. Asimov used to cover serious, though inexpensive, restaurants. His successor, Peter Meehan, has been marginalized. His column now appears only every other week, and it is usually relegated to extremely humble eateries in the outer boroughs. As a result of this change, Frank Bruni now covers everything from delis to high-end French luxury palaces.The Times does not give star ratings to its \"$25-and-under\" restaurants. New York has a separate star system for casual places (signified by one-to-five \"hollow\" stars). No other media outlet has a separate rating system, or indeed a separate critic, for casual dining.Other MediaSince all of the other star systems are fairly new, there is nothing like the kind of historical perspective we have at the Times.New York MagazineThe New York Magazine star system debuted with the January 1, 2006, issue. Adam Platt retroactively put star ratings on 101 restaurants, including many that he'd never reviewed himself. He surely couldn't have paid the minimum of three contemporaneous visits that the Times requires of its critics.All reviews since then have been rated on Platt's zero-to-five system. The only explanation given for a five-point scale, rather than the traditional four, is that, \"We chose to use five stars, instead of three or four, because the more levels of discrimination, or so the thinking goes, the more useful the list.\" But despite having an extra step on his ladder, Platt has actually given three stars less frequently than Bruni. And except in his 101-restaurant retroactive list, he has yet to give out five stars, while he has given four only once.The OthersThe New York Daily News re-instated its restaurant reviewing column in August 2007, with Danyelle Freeman (a/k/a \"Restaurant Girl\") handing out the stars. Initially, she used a one-to-four system, with half-stars allowed. In April 2008, she abruptly switched to a five-star system without an explanation, retroactively re-rating all of her previous reviews. Her system doesn't go down to zero, so a one-star rating from Freeman is like a zero-star rating from Bruni or Platt.Time Out New York instituted a six-star scale, which has never been explained, but its critics are fairly promiscuous with three and four-star ratings, making the TONY ratings entirely meaningless in relation to everyone else's.Bloomberg seems to have inaugurated a new zero-to-four star system with an April 2008 three-star review of Jean Georges, but it is too new for us to draw any conclusions.This BlogThe rating system on this blog is similar to that employed by The Times. I award zero to four stars, with one star intended to signify a good restuarant, not \"fair\" (Bloomberg) or \"disappointing\" (NYDN). However, I endorse Adam Platt's comment that \"one star for a restaurant with elite aspirations is really not much better than no star at all.\" Unlike the Times, I use half-stars, and I give separate ratings for service and ambiance, in addition to an overall rating.

Momofuku Ko
***AUTHOR

***DATE

***CONTENT
The hassle of obtaining a reservation of Momofuku Ko has quickly become the stuff of legend-and that's for a restaurant barely over a month old. After finally wrestling this bear to the ground, I can finally answer the question: Is it worth it?Not that my opinion matters, because MoKo (hat tip: The Pink Pig) has MoJo. If, by any chance, there were a negative review-and I haven't seen one yet-it would hardly make a difference for the restaurant that seemingly can do no wrong. In this week's New York, MoKo earns four stars from Adam Platt (conferred by the frothing critic after just one visit). At the Paper of Record, Frank Bruni is taking his time, but the smart money is betting on another four-star review.Irrelevant though our verdict may be, the short answer is: Yes, MoKo really does deserve all of that attention. And yes, if you care at all about food, it really is worth your while to jump through hoops to become one of the approximately 32 guests that are served six nights a week. (They are closed Tuesdays.)The ten-course tasting menu is not the best we've had in New York, but it is pretty darned close. And you get it for $85, which is at least $50 per person less than what you'd pay elsewhere for comparable quality. What you lose is the comfort and coddling that the better restaurants offer. You're seated at a bar on wooden stools; those with back problems needn't apply.The chefs also serve the food, assisted by two servers who have to navigate a narrow space and sometimes can't quite keep up with the demand. Peter Serpico, the restaurant's executive chef, served most of our courses. He seemed to have very little enthusiasm for that part of the job. Two other chef-servers seemed more cheerful, but our sense was that the real joy for them is in the cooking.Chef-owner (and media darling) David Chang was in the house. For about the first half of the meal, he was behind the counter doing mostly prep work, along with three other chefs. A photographer from Bloomberg news was snapping photos; everyone lightened up considerably after he left. Chang later disappeared, though we saw him again briefly before we left. There appeared to be two other employees behind the scenes, washing dishes and doing other prep work.The two non-chef servers had an awful lot to do: greeting and seating guests; checking and returning coats; taking and delivering beverage orders; clearing plates (but not always); and setting silverware (but not always). Though the restaurant's 14 seats were never completely full at any time during our meal, that is still a lot for two servers to do. Silverware didn't always arrive when it should, and we detected some uncertainty among the staff about who was responsible for clearing plates.Want a cappuccino after dinner? Sorry...they only have espresso.The entrance, unlabeled and easily missedI am not suggesting that service is bad here, but merely pointing out the gulf between Momofuku Ko and traditional three- and four-star restaurants. The service routine will improve with time, but MoKo will probably never offer the kind of pampering and coddling that many diners expect at this price level. It's not an \"occasion place,\" but if future menus are as good as the one we had, I would happily go again. And again.The beverage program is continuing to improve. There's now a respectable wine list, with bottles as low as $32, as well as those in the hundreds. There is now a premium wine pairing at $85, in addition to the standard wine pairing at $50 that was available before. We ordered the premium wine pairing and were impressed with the choices, which included two sakes, a sparkling rose, one red, and a number of whites.Wine pairings are always a crap-shoot. At their best, you get provocative wines from producers off the beaten path-great wines that compelment the food, and that you never would have chosen yourself. At their worst, you get dull, generic wines that make you wish you'd just ordered a \"blow-the-doors off\" full bottle. The pairings at Ko are firmly in the first category. At $85, the wines are mostly young; you're not getting anything like the 1962 Madeira we were served at Per Se. But it is still one of the more impressive wine pairings we've had, and well worth it.In the restaurant's early days, the menu is pretty much the same for everybody, but there are alternatives for most courses, to offer variety for second-time guests or to accommodate diners with dietary restrictions. We reported only one such restriction (my girlfriend doesn't eat scallops) but we were served alternatives for four out of ten courses. By switching plates, we were able to sample fourteen dishes between us. English muffin with pork fat and pork rinds (left); Fluke sashimi with spicy buttermilk & poppy seeds (right)The first item-technically the amuse-bouche-was a miniature English muffin slathered in whipped pork fat, with dried pork rinds on the side. Some reviewers have raved about the muffins, but we weren't quite as impressed. Chang has proved you can pair pork with anything; so what? The wine pairing was a sparkling rose.We adored the first savory course: Long Island fluke sashimi with spicy buttermilk and toasted poppy seeds. The cool, bracing freshness of the fluke worked perfectly with the spicy heat of the buttermilk. The wine pairing was a nice Chablis-and that comes from folks who aren't Chablis fans. Berkshire pork belly & oyster in kimchi broth (left); Louisiana crawfish in a Georgia pea soup (right)The next course was split. I had the Berkshire pork belly with a Long Island oyster, Napa cabbage and kimchi consomme. You'll never go wrong when David Chang serves pork (we saw him shucking the oysters), but I must confess I don't quite get the fuss over the kimchi that many other critics have raved about.My girlfriend had the Louisiana crawfish in a Georgia pea soup with crumpet mushrooms. The flavor contrast here might have even been better than the pork/oyster combo, but the crawfish should have been a little warmer. And it was probably just a goof, but we had to ask for spoons.The wine pairing here was a sake. Hen egg, caviar, potato chips (left); White asparagus, caviar, asparagus puree (right)Another split course came next, again with white wine.There've been snickers about \"hen eggs\" (anyone ever hear of a rooster egg?), but they can call it anything they want when it's this good. A lightly smoked egg was supported here with hackleback caviar and candied lemon zest. At the edge of the plate, a pile of fingerling potato chips added very little to the effect.We saw the chef lavishing plenty of attention over lovely white asparagus stalks, which were grilled, sauced with an asparagus puree and garnished with caviar. This bland and overly salty creation couldn't compete with the intensity of the hen egg. Scallop (left); Soft-shell crab (right)While we were eating our caviar, we watched as the chef decapitated live soft-shell crabs and put them the frying pan, their legs still squirming. We did our best to ignore the crabs' fate, but it wasn't a sight for the squeamish.This was another split course, with the crab served to me and the scallop to my girlfriend, even though she is the one who doesn't eat scallops. The scallop was served with radishes, the crab with ramps, and both dishes had a other ingredients we couldn't write down fast enough. The wine pairing was a Chardonnay.The crab didn't have much flavor, and it was also difficult to eat. Even though my girlfriend doesn't eat scallops, I persuaded to try a bite, and she agreed it was the more enjoyable of the two.Shaved foie gras, lychee, pine nut brittle, riesling geleeIf MoKo has fired a \"shot heard 'round the world,\" it's surely the dish that came next: shaved foie gras over lychee, pine nut brittle and a riesling gelee. The ingredients join in your mouth, leaving a startling sensation of the foie gras melting and melding with its unlikely companions.The wine pairing was a sweet sake. Deep-fried short rib as it came out of the fryer (left); and as served on the plate (right)The deep-fried short ribs are almost as big a hit. They're slowly braised overnight, then quickly finished in the deep fryer. The chef trims away the ends, a waste that we considered practically criminal, given how tender they are. I would happily eat a meal comprising nothing but the ends Momofuku is throwing away.There's also daikon radish and pickled mustard seed on the plate, but the short rib is the star. The wine pairing was our only red wine of the evening, a Cabernet Sauvignon. Miso soup with grilled rice (left); Lychee sorbet (right)The last few courses weren't quite as interesting. The last savory course was a miso soup with grilled rice and pickled vegetables. I believe the rice is slathered in more pork fat. The palate cleanser was a lychee sorbet over sesame crumble. Cereal milk panna cotta (left); Deep-fried apple pie (right)Everyone at MoKo seems to get one of two desserts, so we were pleased to be able to try both. The more interesting of the two is a cereal milk panna cotta with brittle chocolate and an avocado puree. The alternative was a deep-fried apple pie, which was just fine, but not all that far removed from the McDonalds version. On the whole, the desserts didn't have the same level of invention as the savory courses.There were no outright duds among the fourteen items we tasted. Setting aside the hype, there were several extraordinary dishes, a number of others that were merely good, and four or five that really ought to be better. A couple of dishes (the foie gras, the short ribs) have already gone platinum, and may be on the hit parade for a long time to come. The lesser stars will, I am sure, give way to new flights of Momofuku fancy.Not since Per Se has a new restaurant been the subject of such over-heated attention. But sometimes places are hyped because they're really worth it, and this is one of them. If you don't mind hard, backless benches and occasionally inartful service, Momofuku Ko is just about everything it's cracked up to be.Momofuku Ko (163 First Avenue between 10th & 11th Streets, East Village)Food: ***Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: ***

Note: Chop Suey closed in October 2008. The chef Zak Pelaccio has come a long way since he was a cult hit at the Chickenbone Cafe in Williamsburg. His fans followed him to 5 Ninth in the Meatpacking District (from whence he later departed), and then to Fatty Crab a few blocks away. Since then, he has turned his solid reputation into self-parody, cashing in one \"consulting chef\" gig after another. Chop Suey is the latest of these. It features one of Pelaccio's trademark multi-Asian menus, along with one of the best views in the city, assuming you find it charming to look out on the bright lights of Times Square. Frank Bruni did, awarding one star in The Times. Chop Suey is more than just a great view. The Renaissance Hotel did a lovely job with the renovation. The décor is stylish, comfortable, and understated—as it should be when you've got the most famous view in America. With only 78 seats, a majority of which were empty at 8:15 p.m. on a Saturday evening, you can actually have a quiet and unhurried meal here. If only the food matched the view That assumes the food is worthwhile, which it isn't. Pelaccio's menu seems phoned in. That's the problem with a \"consulting chef\" who doesn't stick around to edit out the clunkers, or even to ensure his vision (if he had one) is faithfully executed. We had three appetizers and three entrées between us, and there was only one item I'd recommend. That's too low a ratio of successes to failures, especially when dinner for three runs to almost $250 (including tax and tip). Crispy Rock Shrimp (right); Curry Leaf Fried Chicken Wings (right) Crispy Rock Shrimp($18) would have been unobjectionable, but a bed of stringy, cold, allegedly braised pork belly was just strange. Curry Leaf Fried Chicken Wings ($15) seemed no different to us than the Hooters variety. Steamed Rice Cakes (left); Atlantic Halibut (right) If you saw Steamed Rice Cakes ($12) on the menu, would you expect something resembling the photo above? I sure didn't. I'm a simple guy: \"rice cake\" implies \"rice\" and \"cake,\" and the dish included neither. But it was the evening's only hit. There were gnocchi in there, along with spicy pickled vegetables and a Korean pork bolognese. Moving to the entrées, an Atlantic Halibut sous vide ($28) was lovely enough, although boring. I detected none of the promised Prosciutto di Parma, and the clam medley underneath it was pointless. Ginger Chicken (left); Beef Short Ribs (right) My son wasn't fond of the Ginger Chicken ($32), also cooked sous vide, nor of the ginger tempura dumplings that came with it. Beef Short Ribs ($30) were a horror show: sliced too thin, overwhelmed with chili sauce, and not tender enough. We thought it was impossible to ruin short ribs. Now we know better. The other \"consultant\" at Chop Suey is pastry chef Will Goldfarb. Perhaps he has done a wonderful job with the desserts...but perhaps not. We weren't willing to roll the dice again. With this wonderful space and this gorgeous view, the Renaissance Hotel deserves a far better restaurant than this. It's time to fire the consultants and start over again.

Wow, some of those dishes look downright disgusting. The ginger chicken looks like something I'd get for $3 from a stand on the street in Chinatown, but worse.I'm confused - nobody in their right mind would go to Times Square for anything, let alone to eat (I feel bad that you had to just for the sake of writing the review). So what's the point of having the \"consulting chef\"? Tourists are going to see a place, think it looks nice, and go eat there. They don't care about the chef. Ah well.Anyway, as one of my first comments, I should probably say that I love your reviews, and your blog has quickly made itself the only restaurant-review blog in my \"must read\" list. Thanks.

one comment: that dish does indeed appear to contain Korean \"rice cakes\"...which are like gnocchi.

Thanks for the comments. I agree that the “gnocchi” were the rice cakes the menu referred to. Perhaps this is well known to Korean food devotées (which I admit I am not), but I suspect I’m not the first diner to be surprised.This place had a couple of good reviews, which led me to give it a try. Good Theater District restaurants are scarce, but not unheard of. The conceit of a “consulting” chef made me a bit skeptical, and it turns out the skepticism was justified!I see no reason in principle why there couldn’t be a good restaurant in this space. As it’s slightly north of the main drag of Times Square, and on the 2nd floor of a hotel, I don’t think it’s going to attract the same tourist traffic as, say, Olive Garden.

Indeed, those Korean rice cakes on the left are dukboki: recipe here -- they're made of rice flour, and they're delicious (as I hope they were at Chop Suey). Dukboki is super-awesome Korean street food! Now you're makin' me hungry.

It might seem odd to recomend a restaurant because it is empty. But aside from the very good food, that is one of the principal attractions of Brasserie 8½-at least at dinner.No one can fault the space, with its grand staircase, drawings by Matisse and Giacometti, and tables that are both comfortable and generously spaced. With the restaurant only 10% full, my friend and I were able to enjoy a quiet conversation, as well as food that deserves a lot more attention than it has been getting.The name is a cute take-off on the address: it's at 9 West 57th Street. The restaurant is in the basement, so they call it \"Brasserie 8½.\" However, the place really isn't really a \"Brasserie\" in any normal sense of the word. When it opened in 1980, critics found the food uneven and occasionally overworked. In The Times, William Grimes awarded one star. Reviews in New York and The New Yorker were similar. But management stood by chef Julian Alonzo is still in place, which in this era is remarkable all by itself. Perhaps with eight years' experience he has edited out the clunkers, or perhaps we just got lucky with our choices. I loved an asparagus soup ($12) that was as tasty as it was striking to look at, with an oval-shaped glass bowl and concentric circles of green and white foam.An entree of Sauteed Diver Sea Scallops \"Benedict\" ($29) offered three plump scallops, each with a vegetable puree beneath, a fried egg on top, and hunks of crisp braised pork belly in between. This pun on \"Eggs Benedict\" isn't unique to this restaurant, but when it's as well executed as this, who cares if it's original?I assume that Brasserie 8½ does a brisker lunch business, which is typical of restaurants in this part of town. I also assume that a self-promotional YouTube video that was posted late last year is part of an attempt to drum up business. If our meal was at all indicative, then management is entitled to crow about it as much as they please.Brasserie 8½ (9 West 57th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: ***Overall: **

Note: Ago was rumored to be closing at the end of January 2009, to give way to a new Italian concept under Jean-Georges Vongerichten's management.That deal fizzled, and now Andrew Carmellini, the former Cafe Boulud/A Voce chef, will be taking over. According to the Times, \"The new restaurant, as yet unnamed, will open in early spring.\" Ago closed in May 2009 to make way for the change-over. The first time I visited Ago (pronounced Ah-go), I only got as far as taking a quick look and picking up a menu. Yesterday, I dropped in for dinner. I was seated immediately, but it was in the front area, where restaurants usually seat their walk-ins. The bar was doing a brisk business, so it was noisy and not at all charming. Last week, the menu offered a rib-eye steak grilled on the wood-burning oven, for $34. Yesterday, it appeared on the menu as \"M.P.\" (possibly now a t-bone) and I ordered it without asking the price, which turned out to be a stunning $54-a rather dramatic increase, wouldn't you say? Given that the menu is just a loose sheet of paper that is clearly being frequently reprinted, why can't the price of this item be included? Leaving the price aside, it was a wonderful hunk of meat, with the wood-burning oven imparting a wonderful smokey flavor. But was it worth $54, given that Wolfgang's offers more-or-less comparable quality for $15 less, just two blocks away? The potatoes are included here, but as they come on the same plate, they quickly get soggy from wallowing in the steak's juices. The server was friendly and reasonably attentive, though he missed out on the chance to sell me a second class of the barbera d'asti, by failing to note that the first glass I'd ordered ($14) was empty. When he finally came around, I decided it was time to leave. Ago (379 Greenwich Street at N. Moore Street, TriBeCa) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Perhaps it was mislabeled on the menu, but that REALLY looks like a porterhouse steak to me. Perhaps that's the reason for the price difference.

Thanks for the comment. I didn't bring a menu home, but you are right: it does not look like a ribeye. It didn't say \"porterhouse\" either (I would have remembered that). It may have been a t-bone; I am not sure now. I've revised the post accordingly.

State of the Bouley Union

Restaurant Bouley (left); In case you were wondering... (right) David Bouley, chef/owner of three successful TriBeCa restaurants, is throwing his whole restaurant empire into a state of turmoil. The flagship, Bouley, will be moving into new quarters in the old Mohawk building, a block away. His bakery, now located across the street, will move into the old restaurant space. That will create room for the restaurant Upstairs to expand into all three floors of that building. (I wonder if they'll still call it \"Upstairs\"?) Bouley's Austrian-themed restaurant, Danube, will close, to be replaced by Secession, a French brasserie. Lastly, he'll be creating a three-story Japanese restaurant, Brushstroke, in the space formerly occupied by Delphi, which had been the oldest restaurant in TriBeCa. The place closed last year after it couldn't agree to a new lease with its landlord. These changes are supposed to happen in the course of this year. Mind you, all of these restaurants, existing and to be, are literally within one block of the current Bouley space. If David Bouley is a control freak, he won't have to go far to check up on any of his projects. So how is the state of the Bouley union? Let's begin with the flagship, Bouley. I was able to get a nice wide-angle shot (above), because there are no cars outside. This is one of the Community Board's major complaints about the place. Notice the sign outside, \"No Double Parking.\" At the moment, there's no single parking there either. Restaurant Upstairs (left); At Danube, \"Do you think someone's going to blog about us?\" (right) Business is brisk at Upstairs (above left). This was the first night of the year that the outdoor tables were in use. Over at Danube (above right), a gaggle of employees loitered outside. The old Delphi space will house the new restaurant Brushstroke, and apparently, Luxury Lofts up above The space that will be Brushstrokes still looks like the vacant hulk that was Delphi. It isn't a very appealing sight. Note the sign for \"Luxury Lofts\" next door. Doesn't look very luxurious, does it? This restaurant has not had an easy gestation. In February, a committee of Community Board 1 twice voted to deny Brushstroke a liquor license, based on years of complaints about the way Bouley runs his restaurants. Bouley put on a charm offensive with the full Community Board, and miraculously, they voted in favor of recommending a liquor license. (They almost never override the committee vote.) Here it gets creepy. The very next day, the Buildings Department issued a Stop Work Order at the Delphi site \"after finding that a floor joist had been removed without providing shoring.\" That seems almost too coincidental. Could it be that someone in the area who had opposed the liquor license filed an anonymous tip? There's no work being done here, after the Dept. of Buildings found unsafe conditions It looks like this restaurant still has a long way to go. I don't think we'll see Brushstroke before 2009.

France Makes a Comeback

***CONTENT
In today's Times, Florence Fabricant reports that traditional French restaurants are making a comeback (\"There'll Always Be a France, Especially in New York\"). Evidence: Daniel Boulud has just opened Bar Boulud, with a classic French bistro and charcuterie menu. Later this month, Alain Ducasse will open Benoit in the former La Côte Basque space. Ducasse already opened another French restaurant this year, Adour, in the former Lespinasse space. Next Monday, Brasserie Cognac opens in West Midtown. Rita Jammet, who owned La Caravelle, is on hand as a consultant. Keith McNally, who owns perhaps the most successful casual French restaurant in New York, Balthazar, is converting Minetta Tavern (in Greenwich Village) into a French bistro. Later this year, David Bouley will convert his three-star Austrian Danube into a French brasserie, Secession. Bouley is also moving his eponymous flagship French-inspired restaurant to a new space about a block away from its current location. What's notable is not merely that these restaurants have a nod to the French tradition, but that many of them are overtly traditional, serving the old standards (lobster thermidor, cassoulet, duck à l'orange) that were considered dinosaurs a short while ago. Bouley told Fabricant, \"I see traditional food coming back. It's also newly popular in France, and it's great to see. I have an emotional connection to that food, to my grandmother's cooking: some of my family comes from Arras and Tours. And I love the tradition - braising rabbits and boning fish tableside, but in a relaxed atmosphere.\" These new restaurants lack the \"jacket-and-tie mandatory\" atmosphere of their \"Le\" and \"La\" predecessors, but in many other ways they're throwbacks. I, for one, am delighted. It's not that these restaurants are uniformly excellent. I love some of them (Le Perigord, Le Veau d'Or) and have been underwhelmed at others (La Grenouille, Adour). It's just fascinating to see that restauranteurs are giving New Yorkers something different by giving them something traditional. Frank Bruni, who usually finds French food so dull, is going to have to brush up on Escoffier.

Momofuku Ko: Shame on Adam Platt

***CONTENT
We've roasted and skewered the Times' Frank Bruni more than the law allows, but he's the model of rectitude compared to New York's Adam Platt, who bestowed four stars on Momofuku Ko after just one visit.Platt concedes that critics are \"normally\" supposed to pay multiple visits before passing judgment. Why break that rule? Apparently because it's so hard to get in:The murmuring, deferential patrons who manage to find a spot at the modest, twelve-seat bar are chosen at random, by a computerized system that seems designed not to entice people to dine at Momofuku Ko but to drive them away. These seats can be booked only a week in advance, and only by logging on to the Momofuku Website. The computer begins taking reservations each morning at ten o'clock, and thanks to the legions of devoted and increasingly frantic Chang groupies (the 30-year-old chef was just nominated for his third James Beard award, and has been the subject of many glowing profiles in many glossy magazines), they're gone not in minutes but in seconds. Under these trying conditions, getting in the door once, let alone the three times most critics prefer, could take months or even years.Sorry, but that makes no sense. I have Ko reservations this Friday, and I didn't \"have the services of many diligent assistants willing to peck at their keyboards like gaming zombies for an entire week.\" I did it myself.As the food boards attest, there are already people who've dined at Ko more than once, and the place is still under a month old. It's difficult, but not that difficult, to get in. It certainly wouldn't take \"even years\" to visit three times. As Platt paid his lone visit in the restaurant's third or fourth week of existence, you'd have to conclude he didn't try very hard.If it takes \"months,\" so what? Four years ago, it took Frank Bruni more three months to review Per Se, which in the day was just as hard to get into (I would argue that it was harder) as Momofuku Ko. Bruni was obligated to take his time, particularly before giving out four stars, and he took that obligation seriously.Platt's breathless over-eagerness is shown by the timing of his review, posted late yesterday (Tuesday). His reviews are normally posted in line with New York's publication cycle, with new issues hitting newsstands every Monday. It seems he was more concerned with making Eater.com's Week in Reviews than with writing responsible criticism.You may be thinking, \"Wait a sec! What about this very blog, New York Journal, which routinely reviews restaurants after only one visit?\"Well, I respectfully submit that there are some significant differences between Adam Platt and me. I'm not paid to do this, I spend my own money, I don't do it full-time, and I don't have the benefit of \"diligent assistants\" to make reservations for me.I also haven't changed my standards for one restaurant.

The Payoff: Chop Suey

***CONTENT
In today's Times, Frank Bruni awards one star to Chop Suey. He finds the view better than the food:...sometimes food isn't the primary consideration in deciding where to eat, and some restaurants have persuasive charms beyond the perimeter of the plate. Chop Suey is all about setting, a second-floor perch in the Renaissance Hotel that juts like a ship's prow into a bold, brash sea of light.As expected, he's not impressed with the idea of consultant-chefs, Zak Pelaccio and Will Goldfarb:The erratic results underscore the question of just how engaged such consultants get: of whether, once they've lofted a few ideas and cashed their paychecks, they feel any real pride of ownership or bother to follow through. I have my doubts. Chop Suey didn't assuage them.But there are enough winners to justify a star:In intent, most dishes are more distinctive than the lowest-common-denominator tourist grub prevalent in this patch of town. Some are more distinctive in actuality, too.The char siu - roasted pork with Hong Kong noodles as thin as angel-hair pasta - is described on the menu as \"twice caramelized,\" and the dominoes of tender pork demonstrate why. They have crisp, sweet surfaces and corners.Crisp pie-shaped slices of scallion pancake are given some fruity zip by an Asian pear mostarda. A thick, juicy hamburger forsakes the usual condiments for kimchi, which does the trick. It's a Korean Whopper.As for Korean gnocchi, Chop Suey rushes in where Momofuku Ssam Bar earlier trod, serving steamed rice cakes with a spicy pork Bolognese of sorts. They don't fall far short of their idols.We and Eater both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Country.It's a little late to be blogging about Valentine's Day. I hadn't planned to say anything about our excellent meal at Country, as we went there last year too, and the format was fairly similar.This time, there were two four-course menus captioned pour lui and pour elle, though we were allowed to mix-and-match between them-we both had the foie gras, for example. I wonder if any gay couples were offended by the presumption that every couple would be a man and a woman?Willis Loughhead has taken over as executive chef, replacing Doug Psaltis, who left last November. We're not exactly sure when Loughhead started. His name was printed on the Valentine's Day menus, but his appointment wasn't announced in the Times until April 2. \"We've changed everything,\" he told Grub Street.Quite a few of the menu items currently shown on the Country website strongly resemble those served on Valentine's Day, such as the Apple Veloute, the Chicken, the Sea Scallop, and the Bison. It struck us then as a first-class meal (especially for a holiday), though not perhaps the same extraordinary experience that Country seemed to us when it was new.My girlfriend and I still love Country, and we look forward to sampling Chef Loughhead's menu again on a more relaxed occasion.Country (90 Madison Avenue at 29th Street, Flatiron District)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Times Square's latest Chinese restaurant, Chop Suey. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 3-1 √√ Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 25-1 Four Stars: 5,000-1The Skinny: Chop Suey has attracted a little bit of critical attention, thanks to its two \"consulting chefs,\" Zak Pelaccio (savories) and Will Goldfarb (desserts). The Post's Steve Cuozzo loved it. New Yorker's Ligaya Mishan wasn't impressed at all. Cuozzo's tastes are notoriously opposite of Frank Bruni's, so we're more inclined to trust Mishan.In case the term \"consulting chef\" is new to you, it basically means they phoned in a couple of menu ideas, pocketed a fee, and have hardly visited the place since it opened. Pelaccio and Goldfarb are talented guys, but these days no one can keep track of all their projects. We don't expect Bruni to look favorably on chefs who can't be bothered to show up, and Bruni has never been much of a Goldfarb fan anyway.If the online menu is accurate, appetizers at Chop Suey average around $15, and entrees around $30, which means you can't get out of there for less than $50 a head, assuming you drink cokes. That's a lot of money for Chinese food. It had better be good, or Bruni will bring out his hatchet in a hurry.Ordinarily we'd be grabbing the zero-star odds, but we hesitate for a couple of reasons. In Times Square, there's a zero-star restaurant every fifteen feet. It's one of the city's few neighborhoods where you expect every restaurant to be bad. Is there any news value in a zero-star review of a Times Square restaurant, especially one that most of the city's other critics ignored?The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will \"award\" -we use the term loosely - one star to Chop Suey.

***CONTENT
The Upper West Side isn't known for destination dining, but that has changed with the arrival of three wonderful new places, all within the first three months of 2008: Dovetail, Bar Boulud, and now Eighty One.So far, Eighty One is a hit, with prime-time tables regularly selling out on opentable.com. Longer-term, Eighty One could face tougher challenges. Bar Boulud, with its modest prices and its Lincoln Center perch, is almost surely there for the long haul. Dovetail, which is about four blocks south of Eighty One, racked up nine stars from the city's major restaurant critics; it's a bit cheaper and a lot more casual than Eighty One.At Eighty One, entree prices average in the mid-thirties. If you want black truffles shaved over any of them, it will set you back another $42. Appetizers are $15-19, but another section of the menu, peculiarly named \"Tasting Collection,\" offers another half-dozen appetizer-sized items from $15-39. These aren't \"neighborhood\" prices. Luckily, Eighty One resides in the tony Excelsior Hotel, from whence it will no doubt draw many of its customers.The decor screams \"upscale chic,\" though we felt that the deep red-velvet hues sucked up the available light, and made the dining room seem a bit depressing. (The drapes were drawn when we visited.)Amuse-boucheChef/owner Ed Brown runs the kitchen, coming off a thirteen-year stint at Rockefeller Center's Sea Grill. Chef de Cuisine Juan Cuevas has stints at Alain Ducasse, Bruno Jamais, and most recently Blue Hill on his resume. They're doing a terrific job, serving what I assume is intended to be three-star food, but to which most critics will probably give two. We loved the amuse-bouche, a square of Hiramasu crudo with a Hawaiian seaweed salad. Bread service came with nice soft butter at room temperature, but the accompanying bread rolls were pedestrian. Sea Scallop & Foie Gras Ravioli (left); Tuna Tartare Tasting (right)I started with the Sea Scallop and Foie Gras Ravioli ($16) in a straw wine sauce, a buttery ethereal pleasure.My girlfriend had the Tuna Tartare Tasting ($21), with three half-dollar-sized cylinders of tuna, each in a different preparation. Our favorite the one on the left, with an Indonesian soy sauce, wasabi leaves and a dollop of cream. The other two weren't bad either: blood orange (center) and olive oil with chervil (right). Lamb Three Ways (left); Dry-Aged Black Angus Sirloin (right)Lamb Three Ways ($39) was a beautifully composed plate, with sheep's milk ricotta gnocchi, pine nuts, wild mushrooms and braised butternut lettuce hearts. There was a wonderfully smooth potato puree, served on the side. The \"three ways\" conceit is becoming a bit cliche, and perhaps it would be better to hit a home run with just one way. I loved the juicy and well marbled rack of lamb, but neither the roasted loin nor the confit shoulder rocked my world.My girlfriend was happy with a Dry-Aged Black Angus Sirloin ($37), which also included the short rib. We didn't quite understand the point of an accompanying Caesar wedge with aged parmigiano. The preparation was just fine, but it would have made more sense as a salad or mid-course.The wine list includes plenty of bottles at reasonable prices, though you can splurge if you want to. We enjoyed a 2003 Château Lafleur Pomerol ($60). I don't believe I've ordered a Pomerol before, but this bottle made me want to explore more of them.Service was generally smooth and professional, but the staff paid decidedly less attention to us near the end of our meal, after the restaurant had started to fill up. Our appetizers came out awfully fast (it seemed like just moments), so we had almost half-an-hour to kill later on, before we headed over to Lincoln Center for our show.Of the three new Upper West Side restaurants that I mentioned at the top of this post, Dovetail and Eighty One are the most similar, with broadly comparable culinary ambitions, and located within a few blocks of each other near the Museum of Natural History. Indeed, based on one visit apiece, I can't really separate the two in terms of food, though the service and ambiance at Eighty One are considerably better-with prices to match.Most of the critics in town will have their swords drawn when they review an expensive place with luxury trappings. That explains why Adam Platt awarded two stars to Eighty One, though he had given Dovetail three. I suspect that Frank Bruni will do the same. I give them identical 2½-star ratings. You can decide for yourself if Eighty One's more comfortable atmosphere and smoother service is worth a few extra dollars.Eighty One (45 W. 81st Street between Columbus Avenue & Central Park West, Upper West Side)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: ***Overall: **½

The restaurant scene around Lincoln Center-rather, the lack of it-is inexplicable. Its theaters and auditoriums, with about 10,000 seats between them, are in use almost every night of the year. The programs they put on appeal to the city's most affluent and sophisticated people. Many of them need to eat dinner.Yet, the vast majority of the restaurants on the surrounding blocks are dull, if not awful. If you broaden your search to Columbus Circle and the Upper West Side, there are certainly plenty of pre-show dining options. But I can't conceive of a reason why the restaurants in the immediate vicinity should be so depressing. Until recently, Picholine and Shun Lee West were the only ones I could seriously recommend.Enter Bar Boulud, the most recent creation of über-chef Daniel Boulud. As he did at his previous three New York restaurants, he seems to have grasped exactly what the neighborhood needed. Both the food and ambiance are casual, and equally suited to a quick pre-show meal or a snack afterwards.But Bar Boulud has become a destination in itself, which in this neighborhood is almost unheard of. Reservations have been tough to get-it took me nearly three months. And unlike most restaurants catering to a pre-theater crowd, we saw no appreciable clearing-out after 8:00 p.m.GougèresSylvain Gasdon's chacuterie menu has garnered rave reviews, including two stars from Frank Bruni in the Times. But hardly anyone has raved about the standard appetizers and entrees. Bruni said \"there's little wow from the kitchen, which turns out treatments of salmon, sea bass and roasted chicken that, while not quite losers, are definitely snoozers.\"I loved the Pâte Grand-mère the last time I visited, so I persuaded my girlfriend to join me for an all-charcuterie dinner. It wasn't a tough sell, as we both love to order pâtes and terrines wherever they're served. And no restaurant offers anything like the variety on offer at Bar Boulud.Degustation de CharcuterieThe items on the charcuterie menu run anywhere from $5-18, or you can get a good sample with either of two degustation plates ($22, $46). We ordered the larger of these, which appeared to have a bit of almost everything.They only thing they don't supply is the roadmap. There were sixteen pieces on the plate, and even the server wasn't sure what they all were. His explanation went by awfully quickly, and we could barely hear him in the loud room. So we gave up trying to figure out exactly what we were eating, though I can tell you that the pâtes are on the right side of the photo, the more gelatinous terrines on the left.Anyhow, it is all excellent. There were two different mustards and a basket of bread, but I was happy to enjoy the pâtes and terrines on their own. Rillons Croustillants au Poivre (left); Cervelas Lyonnais en Brioche (right)There are also a few hot dishes on the charcuterie menu. Rillons Croustillants au Poivre ($12), or pork belly with pepper, was predictably good, though I thought it should be a bit warmer.Cervelas Lyonnais en Brioche ($14) is a Lyon sausage baked into a brioche (see photo, right). I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but it's a fun dish. The menu promised black truffle, but if it was in there, it was a trace amount that my taste buds couldn't detect.Besides charcuterie, the other theme at Bar Boulud is wine. Indeed, the long, narrow room is in the shape of a wine bottle. The first time I visited, I was surprised to find just four reds and four whites by the glass, a curious choice for a restaurant focused on wine. That has now been rectified: there are more like ten of each ($10-22).Wines by the bottle are focused on Burgundy and the Rhone Valley, plus \"cousin wines\" made elsewhere from similar grapes. Each section of the list is divided into \"Discoveries\" (less expensive), \"Classics\" (more) and \"Legends\" (most). Among the \"Discoveries\" are numerous bottles below $50, and even one as low as $29. We were happy with a Rhone that the server recommended at just $40. It has been a very long time since I saw a decent bottle in a restaurant at that price.We are fans of Bar Boulud, but there are some definite drawbacks. There is just a small waiting area at the front, where patrons scrum to announce themselves to the hostess, check and retrieve coats, wait to be seated, and order drinks. Several tables adjoin that area, including the one where we were seated. It has all the ambiance of a train station.Tables are quite close together, and the staff seem to be over-taxed. I ordered a martini; it took fifteen minutes to arrive. I heard one patron say, \"We've been waiting twenty minutes for our coats. Can we just go downstairs and look for them ourselves?\" I wasn't given a claim-check for mine, and I feared the worst, but miraculously the attendant quickly found it.Boulud had his own china made for Bar Boulud, but they're stingy about using it. We had to eat the charcuterie on our bread plates, and the server didn't replace the knives we'd used to spread the butter. We couldn't tell if this was a considered choice, or just one of the many service lapses the restaurant is quickly becoming famous for.Despite the occasional miscue, Bar Boulud is probably the second-best Lincoln Center restaurant (after Picholine). For its charcuterie menu alone, it's a worthy destination even if you don't have a show to go see afterwards. My girlfriend remarked, \"It's a good thing this isn't in our neighborhood, or I'd be eating here every day.\"Bar Boulud (1900 Broadway near 63rd Street, Upper West Side)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Marc,I love your blog, but think it strange that, if you frequent Lincoln Center, you haven't reviewed either Telepan, which is quite good, or Café Luxembourg, which is useful, like Bar Boulud.Michael

Thanks for the comment. I have reviewed Telepan (here). As for Café Luxembourg, I am guilty as charged. I was put off by the exorbitant prices and a not-so-good NYT review, but I agree I'm overdue for a visit.

Note: Click here for a later visit to Ago.The long-anticipated restauarant Ago opened this week in Robert DeNiro's Greenwich Hotel. I work across the street, so I thought I'd drop in for a drink before heading uptown for dinner. There were plenty of empty tables at 6:30 p.m., but the bar was packed. I didn't care to stand around, so I just picked up a menu and left.The name, pronounced \"Ah-go,\" comes from the chef Agostino Sciandri, who heads up the original restaurant in West Hollywood. Since it opened a decade ago, branches have sprouted in Las Vegas and South Beach. The New York outpost, which feels like it has been under construction forever, has garnered tons of coverage on Eater and Grub Street.It's hard to comprehend all that excitement for a chain of trattorias serving standard Italian food. I didn't see any pathbreaking items on the menu, but by today's standards it's inexpensive, with only one entree north of $30 (the ribeye steak). Salads and antipasti are $10-21, pizzas and panini $14-16, primi $12-21, secondi $25-34.Ago (379 Greenwich Street at N. Moore Street, TriBeCa)

This is my final post about the reservations adventure at Momofuku Ko, because I finally have one. It's next Friday at exactly 6:05 p.m.Frank Bruni had several funny posts this week explaining how it works. The puns and sexual imagery were out in full force:Assuming the Ko computer system is working properly - and you really have to take it on faith, and your faith wobbles as you try and try without success to reserve - you are in competition for a reservation if, at 10 a.m. precisely, or better yet at 9:58 a.m., you begin submitting a reservation request and then submitting it again, essentially refreshing and re-refreshing your browser as you try to thread the electronic needle and have the Ko system register your electronic request at the precise moment it's freeing up a new night's worth of reservations, before all the other electronic requests, like sperms swimming furiously to be first to the egg, beat yours to the punch. The screenshot above is what you see when you finally get through. You've got exactly one minute to click \"Accept.\" Then, there's another screen where you enter any dietary restrictions. Finally, you get the screen on the right, and a confirming e-mail arrives moments later.Poor Frank Bruni still hasn't gotten through, even though he has a friend \"B.\" and \"a small posse of other gourmands who'd love to have me buy them a meal at Ko\" working on his behalf. I had to do it all by myself.Just yesterday I learned one of the secrets: there are fewer people trying on weekends. Sure enough, that worked. (Today is Saturday.)Another trick is to synchronize your watch to the Ko computer. Sometimes, you get a message that there are no reservations available, and you see the exact time (to the second) on your screen. If you try that at 9:59:26, then you should wait exactly 34 seconds before trying again, so that your next attempt will be at exactly 10:00:00.When you get the screen with a green check mark (signifying an available reservation slot), you can't linger over it. There are a thousand other sets of eyes looking at that check mark. You'd better know what times are acceptable to you, so that you can click instantly. He who hesitates is lost.Is it worth all this trouble? Obviously I can't answer that definitively until Friday.But it's not really much trouble at all. For a reservation at Per Se, I had to call at 10:00 a. m. exactly two months ahead. I had to hit re-dial about a dozen times, then wait on hold for about twenty minutes before getting through to a human being. The ritual at Babbo is even worse, and that restaurant is at least a decade old.At Momofuku Ko, the process takes only two minutes. By 10:01, either you have a reservation or you don't. It's certainly not the restaurant's fault that so many people want to eat there.I realize that some people are frustrated by a new technology. But some people were probably frustrated when the telephone was invented, too.

I wish every restaurant had a system like this. More user-friendly than OpenTable, and like you said - no time wasted on hold. I wish they took reservations further into the future, and I think (hope?) they might once the hype dies down.

Today, Frank Bruni awards two stars to Mia Dona. It was a predictable outcome, given Bruni's love of hearty Italian comfort food at economy prices, sans tablecloths. And if any chef knows how to push all of Bruni's buttons, it's Michael Psilakis:At the big-hearted new restaurant Mia Dona you'll find pasta dishes so forcefully flavored and generously portioned they could play as well at Carmine's as at Del Posto. You'll find a deep-fried rabbit appetizer that owes less to the grand commanders of haute cuisine than to Colonel Sanders. You'll find meatloaf.And if you step back to survey all of what you're eating and all of what it's costing - which, in the context of the restaurant's East Side neighborhood, isn't very much - you'll find something else: a portrait of a rising young chef with more practicality than vanity, even though the acclaim that's rushed his way over the last few years has given him ample reason to preen...We win $4 on our hypothetical bet, while Eater loses $1.

My son and I dropped in on Scarlatto the other night. It was an unplanned visit: we were in the area and were hungry.The space used to be Pierre au Tunnel. I believe I dined there once. It closed in 2005 after a remarkable 55-year run. I remember it as a somewhat drab and faded space, as those old French bistros tend to be. The Scarlatto team spruced it up nicely, with comfortable chairs, exposed brick, and black-and-white photos of movie stars on the walls.Alas, those movie-star photos are just one of the many theater-district cliches that Scarlatto fails to avoid. There's the slightly grimy menu with multiple inserts that look like they've passed through too many hands, and the gruff service by staff conditioned to get patrons to their shows by 8:00 p.m. You get that same service, even if you tell them (as we did) that you have no deadline.But the food is considerably better than it needs to be, in a neighborhood where most of the Italian restaurants follow a standard playbook. Chef Roberto Passon doesn't take many chances here, though a few items (stewed rabbit, sauteed chicken livers) go beyond the Little Italy classics.We went for old standards and were pleasantly surprised. Veal Osso Buco ($36) was as good a rendition of that dish as I have ever had. My son, who is not easily pleased, gave Veal Scaloppine ($16) the thumbs-up.Aside from the Osso Buco, which was a daily special, prices are quite reasonable. Appetizers are $8-14, salads $7-10, soups $8, pastas $10-19, entrees $15-21, side dishes $5-7. The pre-theater three-course prix fixe is $29. I didn't order wine, but I noticed that the wine list, too, had plenty of inexpensive options.The critics all ignored Scarlatto, as they do most theater district restaurants. Had the identical restaurant opened in the Meatpacking District, it would have warranted at least a mention. For pre-show Italian that is a cut above most of the neighborhood, Scarlatto is worth a look. If you're not going to the theater, I'd recommend waiting until 8:00 p.m., after the crowds have departed.My son, who just turned 13, is already getting the hang of how the stars work. He said, \"My guess is one star, because even though it's good, there are lots of other places doing it.\" True enough-though not in the theater district.Scarlatto (250 W. 47th Street between Broadway & Eighth Avenue, Theater District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Mia Dona, the latest production of chef Michael Psilakis and restauranteur Donatella Arpaia. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 3-1 √√ Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 8-1 Four Stars: 15,000-1The Skinny: Frank Bruni hearts Michael Psilakis. He has awarded two stars to every one of Psilakis's New York restaurants to date (Onera, Dona, Anthos). He also adores Kefi-he devoted two blog posts to the mere fact that it was moving-although he delegated its review to $25-and-under columnist Peeter Meehan.Eater thinks that two stars for Mia Dona is a \"hard sell,\" given that Mia Dona's casual vibe and super-low prices put it practically in Meehan's territory. But that has never stopped Bruni before. He holds the New York Times record for two-star ratings given to $25-and-under restaurants.Perhaps the most relevant precedent is Urena, which won two stars from Bruni. It re-opened (after a slight make-over) as Pamplona, with food not quite as good, but prices much gentler on the pocket book. Bruni, once again, awarded two stars.That's precisely the situation we have here: Dona was forced to close when Psilakis and Arpaia lost their lease. They moved six blocks away, changed the name, and installed a simpler menu at much humbler prices.All the pieces are in place for a two-star review. The only question is whether Bruni likes it as much as we did.The Bet: Given Bruni's obvious affection for Psilakis's cooking, the Urena/Pamplona precedent, and our own high opinion of the place, we are betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Mia Dona.

Yesterday, Frank Bruni upgraded Mas to two stars, omitting to mention that this is the rating it deserved in the first place:In growing older Mas has indeed grown wiser. Its talented chef, Galen Zamarra, is making better decisions and his kitchen operates with more discipline than in 2004, when I gave the restaurant one star.Frank is amazed that restaurants that start out good can actually stay good:Too many restaurants start off like gangbusters, only to sag into a sour, cynical middle age while they're still young. Once they've made their first impression, they focus mainly on making money. In lumbering lock step, the Champagne flutes and the servers lose their sparkle.They even polish the silver: \"The exquisite place settings, with gleaming silverware propped in flawlessly parallel lines on carved slate wedges: wasn't this the jittery perfectionism seen in enterprises still awaiting judgment?\"Eater and New York Journal both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

He awarded just one star, which even then felt too low. When I finally got around to visiting, albeit a couple of years later, the restaurant felt like a clear two stars, with the potential for three.Despite Eater odds that suggest a real horserace, two stars is the only realistic outcome here. Two-step promotions are extraordinarily rare in the NYT star system, and Mas isn't an important enough restaurant for Bruni to bother re-reviewing just to re-affirm its original one-star rating. Actually, Mas isn't a restaurant I would have expected Bruni to keep on his radar screen at all, so I'm glad to see him rectifying one of his earlier mistakes.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Mas.

Note: Click here for a later review of Mia Dona. It wasn't as impressive the second time. Restauranteur Donatella Arpaia and Chef Michael Psilakis have been busy. Every few months, they seem to be closing one restaurant and opening another. Donatella Arpaia and Michael Psilakis In less than five years, Arpaia has opened six restaurants. One closed, and she severed ties with another, leaving her with four. In less than four years, Psilakis has opened five restaurants. Two closed, leaving him with three, all partnered with Arpaia. One of them, Kefi, will be moving shortly, and they intend to open yet another restaurant in the current Kefi space. Got that? Mia Dona is their latest creation. It was supposed to replace Dona, which was a hit, but lost its lease not long after it opened. As it was at Dona, the cuisine at Mia Dona is Italian, though interpreted through Psilakis's Mediterranean-Greek lens. But Mia Dona is really a much different concept, despite the superficial similarities. Dona was much more elegant and nearly twice as expensive. I wasn't wowed at Dona, though I realize many others liked it better than I did. At Mia Dona, you almost have to pinch yourself when you see the prices. Could this be true? Appetizers are $8-13; pastas are $10-12 as appetizers or $15-17 as entrees; meat and fish entrees are $17-24; side dishes are $8-9. The wine list has plenty of decent bottles under $50. Compare this to Dona in mid-2006, where entrees topped out at $45, and a four-course dinner was $75. The front dining room [thewanderingeater] Of course, something has been lost, too. The tablecloths are gone, and there's a motley assortment of unmatched china and cheap wine glasses. A single hostess has the dual role of greeting guests and checking coats. The casually dressed servers are a bit pushy and somewhat bumbling. The restaurant has been open for five weeks, so perhaps some of these things will improve. The decor is a confused jumble: three rooms, each of which looks as if it were entrusted to a different decorator. Some of the choices are odd indeed: blonde wood paneling and zebra-skin carpeting? That's the back room. We were in the front room, which has bare brick walls, no carpeting, and colorful enamel dishes hanging from the walls. Bread Service With as many projects as Psilakis has in flight, you have to wonder how much time he spends in any of his kitchens. Yet, I've seen three menus-two on the Internet (here, here) and the one I brought home with me-and all are different. So it seems he still has time to innovate, or he has able deputies who do so in his stead. Compared to the opening menu, most of the appetizers, pastas, and seafood entrees have changed, at least to some degree, and many of them considerably. (The meat entrees have remained pretty much the same.) The appetizer I ordered, which was perhaps the most remarkable item we tried, must be a new creation, as nothing even remotely like it is on either of the Internet menus. Psilakis continutes to astonish. We liked the bread service, which came with two contrasting warm breads and a clove of warm garlic. Bigoli (left); Warm Calf's Tongue (right) When I ordered Warm Calf's Tongue ($10), I scarcely imagined what I was in for. Yes, there's calf's tongue, but also mushrooms, pecorino romano, a soft poached egg. That's what the menu said, but there is apparently quite a bit more in there, including green vegetables and chili peppers. It's a remarkable creation, and so hearty that it could almost be an entree. My girlfriend was impressed with Bigoli ($11), thick pasta noodles with sausage, broccoli rabe, lentils, spicy chiles, and (again) pecorino romano. At least, that's how it was served yesterday. Tomorrow, Psilakis may come up with something else. Roasted Chicken (left); Roasted Red Snapper (right) Psilakis does have a way with chicken. The preparation here ($17) is a bit less artistic than the version we had at Anthos, but just as tender and flavorful. Roasted Red Snapper ($22) was the evening's only disappointment. The fish was dull, and the skin (which could have imparted flavor) was too tough for my knife to penetrate. The cous cous underneath it were also bland, though mussels and merguez sausage were nice. Even with side dishes, Psilakis gives you far more than you have any right to expect at the price. Spinach ($8), which could have served five people, was luscious, with bechamel and pecorino (a cheese that recurs in multiple dishes). At Dona, portions were on the large side, and that's true here, despite the bargain prices. Psilakis's cuisine skews towards the beefy and hearty, and we left a bit overfed. We took most of the spinach home, and we were so full that we skipped our usual nightcap. The wine list isn't long, but it has plenty of budget-friendly bottles. We settled on a 2003 Chianti ($58). The first page of the list, with a pretentious list of Donatella's favorites (\"Wine I drink while watching my friends on television\"), ought to be scrapped. Servers need a bit of training on wine etiquette (hint: pour the lady's glass first). Four out of the five things we ordered were excellent, and both appetizers and entrees were priced a good $5 apiece lower than they needed to be at this level of quality and ambition. If the service improves, and if Psilakis continues to lavish as much attention on the menu as he has to date, Mia Dona may rank among the city's most remarkable restaurants.

My girlfriend and I toured a bunch of Long Island wineries last summer. She drove, I did most of the drinking, and I took a day off from blogging. We were back last weekend, and though I didn't shoot photos, we were at least a bit more systematic about recording what we saw, what we tasted, and what we liked.The Long Island wine industry is only about twenty-five years old, though very few of the wineries go back even that far. New ones open every year. Most of the industry is on the more rural North Fork, where old potato farms are converted to vinyards as fast as rich folks can buy them.It's not a business for the impatient: it takes several years for a vinyard to produce its first wines, and usually much longer than that to establish a reputation. It is still rare to see a Long Island wine in a New York City restaurant. Many vinyards are too small for restaurants to deal with, but most have their own tasting rooms and wine clubs.Tastings used to be free (they would make it up on wine sales), but the vinyards found that too many guests were showing up to get hammered. For a nominal fee (usually around $5) you get small tastes of between three and five wines. Most places use only one glass for the entire flight. The better ones will at least provide a new glass when you switch from white to red.Wine tours are now big business, especially in the summer. Groups hire stretch limos and ride around the North Fork all afternoon. The wineries are close together, and you can hit a large number of them in a few hours, provided you have a designated driver. This time I was driving, so we limited ourselves to four stops and one shared tasting between us at each place.If you're visiting, be sure to check opening days and hours. Most are open on weekends only. Typical closing time is 5:00 or 6:00 p.m., and sometimes they're closed for private events, such as weddings. The Tasting Room2885 Peconic LanePeconic, NYhttp://www.tastingroomLI.com/The Tasting Room is in an 1800s storefront (it was a speakeasy during prohibition), and is Long Island's only multi-vinyard tasting room. Six boutique wineries are featured, including two of our favorites, Comtesse Therèse and Schneider Vinyards. The owner is Theresa Dilworth; she's \"Therèse,\" but she's no countess, just a tax lawyer from New York. She's also the only female head winemaker in New York.We visited the Tasting Room last year and wanted to come back, as we love the friendly atmosphere, less aggressive selling, and the chance to compare wines from multiple producers. We picked up two bottles of the 2005 Comtesse Therèse Blanc de Noir, a fruity peach-colored wine that we've enjoyed before. It's in the style of a rose, made from Cabernet Savuignon and Merlot grapes.Macari Vinyards150 Bergen AvenueMattituck, NYhttp://www.macariwines.com/We were drawn here because of the great 2002 Macari \"Bergen Road\" that we'd enjoyed with dinner at the Frisky Oyster. Macari has a fairly new tasting room that reminded us of a Swiss chalet. They're one of the larger wineries on the island, and they clearly didn't stint on its construction: it's one of the most elegant tasting rooms in the area.Their tasting, $8 for four wines, was one of the most expensive we've encountered. The servers do spend a bit more time talking about the wines than they do at other places, but not really enough to justify these prices.We loved the buttery 2004 Chardonnay Reserve ($20.99), barrel fermented with hints of honey and nectar. We were also impressed with their inelegantly named 2004 \"Block E,\" a velvety dessert wine, but we weren't prepared to spend $39.99 for a half bottle.Macari has some of the most expensive Long Island wines we've seen. Their 2005 \"Solo Uno,\" released only just a few months ago, is $100. Their 2004 \"Alexandra\" is $80. Neither of these were on our tasting. We did try the 2005 \"Bergen Road,\" but it was nowhere near as good as the 2002 we'd had the night before.The shop sells all of the Macari wines, but they also have an impressive selection of wine decanters in many styles in the $50-70 range. The same decanters would sell for well over $100 in the city. We were tempted, but reality set in: we're all out of storage space.Martha Clara Vineyards6025 Sound AvenueRiverhead, NYhttp://www.marthaclaravineyards.com/Martha Clara Vineyards is owned and operated by the Entenmann family, they of the supermarket baked goods fortune. Their tasting room resembles a big barn. It attracts bigger crowds than many of the other tasting rooms, and it isn't at all charming.There's a rectangular wrap-around tasting bar, and servers rocket back and forth between guests without taking much time to explain the wines. We chose a three-wine tasting for $4. We could have taken the glass with us, but I didn't need a wine glass with the Martha Clara logo on it.We were here last summer, and I vaguely remembered a pretty good Cabernet Franc, but this time none of the three wines rocked our world, and we left without buying anything.Diliberto Winery250 Manor LaneJamesport, NYhttp://www.dilibertowinery.com/Sal Diliberto is another lawyer from the city who wanted to open a winery. For many years, he was making the wines himself at home in Hollis Hills, Queens. His Long Island winery is only a few years old, and his tasting room is the Island's newest: it was still under construction when we drove by last year. It's beautifully decorated in the style of an Italian piazza.Diliberto has only been growing his own grapes for six years, but he's already medaled in several competitions and has received favorable write-ups in the Times. He offers one of the more generous tastings: five wines for $5. The pours seem a bit more generous than they are elsewhere. You take a seat in his \"piazza,\" and a server comes over with each pour. It's a lot more relaxed than standing at a bar.Diliberto himself was on hand, and he came over to our table to chat. Extroverted and friendly, he loves his wines and loves to chat them up. His wines are only available from him directly: he's too small for restaurants and stores to deal with.We loved his 2003 \"Tre\" ($27), a Bordeaux-style blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon and Cabernet Franc. We might well have bought his 2001 Cabernet Sauvignon too ($27), but at that point we'd acquired enough liquor for one weekend.We'll be back in a few months to sample a few more wineries.

Fat Food Bloggers

***CONTENT
In today's Times, Kim Severson has an article about - how do we put this? - fat food bloggers.Exhibit A: Jason Perlow. As Severson tells it:Back before everyone with a fork and a laptop started nursing a food blog, Mr. Perlow was a founder of eGullet, a pioneering online discussion forum that helped obsessed food enthusiasts find one another. It put him at the center of a community where no food was too fatty and no field trip too extreme. Ferreting out the best place for an empanada or the perfect way to braise pork belly meant tasting countless versions, often in the same day. Being the first in the group to find it was golden.Reality hit in October, when the 400-pound Perlow collapsed and spent three days in the hospital. He was diagnosed with diabetes and told he had five years to live.Perlow's eGullet co-founder, Steven A. Shaw (\"Fat Guy\"), who weighs 270 pounds, is unrepentant: \"I think the whole diabetes thing is a major hoax. They are overdiagnosing it.\" Presumably he believes Perlow's hospital stay was a hoax too.I have managed to avoid a weight problem only with difficulty. I weigh about 15 pounds less than my high, but about 10 pounds more than my low. A lot of my clothes (acquired at the low) just barely fit, and I do not want to replace them.I spend a lot of time food-blogging, but fortunately I've never been as obsessed as Perlow. This week, I'm on a four-day stretch when I'll eat only a very light breakfast and lunch, and no dinner. My first dinner of the week will be on Friday. I will most likely order just an appetizer, an entree, and a bottle of wine-no dessert. Despite that regime, which no one would call gluttonous, I am just barely treading water. If I ate out anywhere near as often I'd like to, I would be constantly gaining weight.When I have a mid-week dinner on my schedule-anything on a Monday through Thursday-I know that it will be a tough week. I will probably end that week with a net weight gain. Just to tread water, I need to fast an awful lot. My metabolism is slow. What I lose the first four days each week, I generally gain back on the weekend, when I do most of my \"dining out for fun.\"Next week will be challenging. I will be on vacation in Hawaii, and there will certainly be a temptation to eat out more than I normally would. To avoid gaining weight on the trip will require constant focus.I am battling it every day.

Your metabolism is slow because you aren't eating. You need to eat 3 healthy meals a day to get your metabolism up. The other way to rev up your metabolism is to exercise on a regular basis, which you didn't mention. Finally, skip the wine (and hard alcohol). It has loads of calories.

The Payoff: La Sirène

Today, Frank Bruni awards one star to an \"oddly compelling little bistro,\" La Sirène:I don't want to oversell La Sirène, which opened last spring. It operates on a shoestring, doesn't have a liquor license and doesn't ace many of the dishes on its relatively short French menu...And drawing attention to La Sirène runs the risk of overcrowding it. It has only about 25 seats and not an inch to spare, so if your table isn't ready you have to stand outside, where you're treated to an intimate view of cars streaming into the Holland Tunnel.But this scrappy restaurant, where you can hear the bell every time a dish is ready and heat from the kitchen steams diners' eyeglasses, will charm many people turned off by the vacuous polish and higher prices elsewhere. With no corkage fee, it's a solid option for wine drinkers seeking liberation from restaurant markups.Though he loved the place, only five paragraphs mention the food. The rest is about the cramped ambiance and chef Didier Pawlicki's penchant for responding personally to Internet critiques on sites like citisearch.com.But I loved the review anyway. It was one of the rare Bruni reviews that called attention to a worthy restaurant that all the other critics had missed. Usually, he just follows breadcrumb trails already well paved by others.And it was one of the rare one-star reviews that was actually positive. Too often, Bruni's one-star reviews read like a list of regrets that he couldn't award a higher rating. One star is supposed to mean \"good,\" and there ought to be no shame in that.Lastly, as I mentioned yesterday, this seems to be the first time that Bruni has actually gone out of his way to review a French restaurant. I don't want to celebrate prematurely, but perhaps he is finally expanding his interests beyond Italian, Asian and Steakhouses.In the betting department, we're a loser again this week. We acknowledged that one star was the most likely outcome, but with Eater offering 15-1 odds on the higher rating, we couldn't help but take the chance, though we must admit it's a betting strategy that has never yet worked. But because this was such a good week for Bruni, we actually don't mind losing. The review was at the higher end of one star, as we expected, but one star nevertheless.Eater wins $4, while we lose $1.

North Fork Table & Inn

***CONTENT
The North Fork Table & Inn is a charming bed & breakfast on the North Fork of Long Island, with a restaurant that has food addicts buzzing. It opened two years ago, after four Manhattan restaurant veterans decided they were sick of the big city.Their credentials are impressive. Gerry Hayden (Aureole, Amuse) is executive chef. His wife, Claudia Fleming (Gramercy Tavern and numerous others), is pastry chef. Their partners, Mike and Mary Mraz (Hearth, Gramercy Tavern), run the front-of-house.The upstairs had been a B&B under a succession of owners, while various French restaurants had occupied the dining room. The old building needed a gut renovation. The kitchen was too large, the bathrooms inconveniently located. One of the support beams was sagging.As of 2006, it has all been redone in an understated post-colonial austerity. Both the dining room and the guest rooms are dominated by whites and light tans, with the walls mostly bare. The dining room is elegant and upscale, if you don't mind floorboards that creak a little bit. There's a handsome bar which can also accommodate walk-ins for dinner.The four guest rooms are large, comfortable, and recently renovated. There's Wi-Fi access and a flat-screen TV. Each room has its own bathroom, also renovated.The house actually has rooms on two levels, but alas, those on the third floor aren't available to guests. Had they been renovated too, the North Fork Table & Inn would have been considered a hotel under the zoning laws, rather than a B&B, and a different set of building codes would have applied. The owners considered it, but the cost was prohibitive.The restaurant garnered plenty of attention, including positive reviews from Andrea Strong, Gael Greene and Newsday. Dining there was the main reason for our trip, though we also <a href=\"http://nyjournal.squarespace.com/journal/2008/3/20/long-island-wineries.html target=\"_blank\">took in wineries, visits with my girlfriend's family, and dinner at another, equally compelling restaurant, The Frisky Oyster.\"Northforkopoly\" (click to expand)We chose to visit in late winter, mainly because we wouldn't have had a prayer of getting in during the summer. Had we been bored, we could've settled in for a game of Northforkopoly, the local version of Monopoly (board and pieces supplied) though we'd need to have our heads examined if we could find nothing better to do.We arrived to find bucket with a bottle of water on ice, but there's no mini-bar or coffee maker. For that you have to go downstairs. Breakfast is served from 8:00-9:30 a.m., though when we wandered down much later than that, coffee and plenty of Fleming's breakfast pastries were still available.Dinner is served Wednesdays through Mondays, lunch Saturdays and Sundays. The lunch menu is similar to the dinner menu, though a bit less expensive and with smaller portions. At dinner, appetizers are mostly $12-18, though the foie gras starter is $25. Mains are $32-38. The five-course tasting menu is a bargain at $75, and though we didn't order it, we noted that the portion sizes were generous. These prices are quite expensive by Long Island standards, and the restaurant is dependent on being regarded as a \"destination\" for out-of-town visitors. Raw Hamachi and Seared Foie Gras (left); Potato Gnocchi in a Braised Veal-Tomato Ragout (right)The menu relies on locally sourced ingredients wherever possible, though in the winter practically everything came from elsewhere. Chef Gerry Hayden paired Raw Hamachi with Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras ($25), accented with glazed daikon, radish syrup, mustard cress and fleur de sel. I'm not sure if it was a mistake or a considered decision, but the foie gras was more crisped than seared, but its warm, crunchy texture was a terrific foil for the hamachi.My girlfriend had the Potato Gnocchi in a Braised Veal-Tomato Ragout ($15), which was rich and hearty, but made with a heavier hand than some of the better gnocchi we'd had in the city recently. Long Island Duck Breast (left); Shinn Estate Vinyards \"Wild Boar Doe\" 2005 (right)You can't get any more local than Long Island Duck Breast ($34), which we both chose as our main course. It was painted with a wonderful soy-honey glaze, and the duck slices had a hefty rim of wonderful fat, but I didn't see the point of the accompanying crisp jasmin rice roll, which was too dull to share the plate with such assertive company.The wine list is brief and fairly priced. Keeping with our determination to drink only local wines, we chose the wonderful and wittily-named Shinn Estates \"Wild Boar Doe\" ($55), a blend of Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Malbec, Petit Verdot and Cabernet Franc. Once again, we found that blends are dependable choices on Long Island, especially when you're ordering a wine you've never heard of. Cheese Plate (left): Coconut Tapioca (right)We finished with the Cheese Plate ($12), which offered three American cheeses: a firm, raw sheep's milk cheese from California, a crumbly raw cow's milk cheese from Oregon, and a soft sheep and cow's milk cheese from the Hudson Valley. The kitchen also sent out servings of the Coconut Tapioca with Passion Fruit Sorbet (normally $11), a terrific end to our meal.I can't close without commenting on a remarkable coincidence. A short while after we sat down, the table next to us opened up, and the next couple to arrive was the same couple that had been seated next to us at the Frisky Oyster. It's not quite as improbable as if it had happened in Manhattan, but the chances of it happening are still awfully low.Naturally we got to talking, and comparing notes about our meals on consecutive evenings. Which was better, the Frisky Oyster or the North Fork Table & Inn? The North Fork is fancier, more romantic, and more elegant. But what about the food? It's awfully close, but several of us thought the Frisky Oyster had the North Fork beaten by a nose. Even between the four of us, we tasted only a fraction of the menus at both places, so it's not a definitive judgment, by any means. You can have-check that, you will have-a terrific meal at either restaurant.We loved our visit to the North Fork Table & Inn. The owners are outgoing and accessible. This is their passion, and they will do everything they can to make your visit a happy experience. Service is attentive and flawless, as you'd expect in a restaurant with so many Gramercy Tavern alumni in its midst.We certainly hope to be back.North Fork Table & Inn (57225 Main Road, Southold, Long Island)Food: **Service: **½Ambiance: **½Overall: **

BruniBetting: La Sirène

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni has an under-the-radar special: La Sirène. The Eater oddsmakers have set the odds as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 3-1 One Star: 4-1 √√Two Stars: 15-1 Three Stars: 75-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: It's hard for a reviewed restaurant to be more obscure than this one. La Sirène-that's French for The Mermaid-has been in business for nine months, and I can't find a single professional review. How did it even come to Bruni's notice? Well, it does seem to be popular in the gay community. (I am not suggesting that that's its only attraction.)The Eater odds today are really crazy. Frank has never pulled a restaurant \"out of nowhere\" to give it zero stars. It makes no sense to waste a reviewing slot on a place the critics have already ignored anyway, only to suggest that it's not worth our time.When Frank reviews a small, earnest restaurant that's off the beaten path, the rating is usually two stars. After all, one star in the Bruniverse isn't much of a compliment for restaurants above the level of a deli. One star used to mean \"good,\" but the truly good one star review is a rarity nowadays.To the best of our recollection, this is the first time Bruni has reviewed a French restaurant that wasn't, in some sense, \"compelled.\" La Sirène is a restaurant he could easily have skipped-after all, every other critic did. When Bruni goes out of his way, it's usually Italian, Asian, or Steak. So what's going on here? Bruni must really have been smitten.We hesitate to jump on the deuce train. For one thing, it's BYOB, and that's a rare deficiency in a two-star restaurant (though not unheard of in the Bruni era). Also, what is the probability that there's a two-star restaurant that every other critic completely overlooked? Assuming that chef Didier Pawlicki's cuisine is worthy of Frank's attention, the rating could come down to service, and we have no reliable data points from which to judge.Our usual practice here is to bet on the most probable outcome, which we believe is one star. But we are positive that if Bruni bothered to put this restaurant on his reviewing rounds, he must have found something extremely compelling, and he would just love to pull the two-star trigger if he could. Therefore, Eater's 15-1 odds on that outcome are just as crazy as Eater's 3-1 odds on a goose egg.Perhaps Eater is just toying with us, but we can't leave an attractive 15-1 spot hanging like that.The Bet: Although we believe one star is the most probable outcome, we are laying a wager on the huge payday that the Eater oddsmakers have offered, and are betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to La Sirène.

This weekend, we took a break from New York City to head out to the North Fork of Long Island, where my girlfriend grew up. On our culinary tour, first up was The Frisky Oyster in Greenport. The restaurant has been open since 2001, and has received generally glowing reviews (New York Times, Newsday).Despite the name, seafood accounts for only about 40% of the menu, which changes daily. Indeed, when we asked our server for ordering advice, she said that several entrees and appetizers were new that day, and she hadn't tried them yet.The vaguely New American menu has some standard-issue favorites (steak frites; beet and goat cheese salad), but more than a few dishes that combine ingredients in unexpected ways: cannelloni with goat cheese cream; scallops with eggplant puree. The space has comfortable tables and banquettes, and there's a lively bar scene in the front of the restaurant. The flowery red wallpaper is a bit gaudy, but the restaurant feels warmer in person than the photo above would suggest. The dining room is on the loud side, with solid surfaces and uncarpeted floors that allow the sound to reverberate.The vibe feels very much like the West Village, and we surmised that most of the clientele were from out of town. Prices are high by local standards, but visitors from Manhattan will feel at home, with appetizers $9-15 and entrees $25-35. Oysters 'Friskafella' (left); Lobster and Corn Quesadilla (right)Several reviews mentioned that The Frisky Oyster often has no oysters on the menu, but on Friday night they were present and accounted for. I started with the Oysters 'Friskafella' ($15), a play on the old classic, Oysters Rockefeller, made here with spinach, garlic and chipotle, and covered with a sheet of parmesan.My girlfriend had the Lobster and Corn Quesedilla ($15). Halibut with \"clams oreganata\" (left); Striped Bass (right)I was especially impressed with the entrees, which can often be a letdown. Both fish we tried were impeccable. Halibut ($28) was topped with Clams Oreganata (crushed clams, bread crumbs, oregano, parsley, mint), on a bed of asparagus. The combination worked perfectly. My girlfriend had the Striped Bass ($28) with an artichoke, potato, shitake ragout.The wine list is brief and eclectic. Naturally we wanted a Long Island wine, so I chose the Macari 2002 Meritage Bergen Road ($55). This is a Bordeaux-style blend, which I find is more dependable than the Long Island wines that rely upon a single grape. This one had matured nicely, and it wasn't too overbearing to be enjoyed with fish.We've heard reports of service issues at this restaurant, including long waits for food. That didn't happen to us, but there were only two servers for the whole dining room (more than half full), and it could be a very different story during the high summer season.Even if you do have to wait, it is well worth it for seafood so beautifully prepared.The Frisky Oyster (27 Front Street near Main Street, Greenport, Long Island)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Today was the first day I actually tried to make a reservation at Momofuku Ko. That would have been for next Wednesday: the site opens every day at 10:00 a.m. for six days in advance.Two days ago, the site debuted, and its instability quickly became a joke. Yesterday offered a respite: since the restaurant is closed Tuesdays, there would be no 10:00 a.m. rush. The Ko team took the extra day to add some spit 'n' polish to their still-raw website.So today at 10:00 a.m., I was poised and ready to go. The site stayed up this time, but with hundreds logged in simultaneously, snagging a reservation would be the luck of the draw... Alas, no. Next Wednesday sold out in 92 seconds!Until tomorrow...

Wayne Nish's Career Path

***CONTENT
Wayne Nish is now in charge of the menu at Spitzer's Corner, the Lower East Side gastropub. Incidentally, it's named for a former dress shop that occupied the space, not for the disgraced former governor of New York.What an odd career path Nish has had:In the 1980s, he served an apprenticeship at the Quilted Giraffe, rated four stars.In 1988, he took over one of the city's old-guard French palaces, La Colombe d'Or, earning three stars.In 1990, he opened March, earning three stars.In 2007, he closed March and opened Nish in the same space, a much more casual restaurant that earned two stars. It closed within six months.While Nish (the restaurant) was in its death throes, Nish (the chef) signed on at Varietal, which had recently been slammed with one star. It also quickly closed.As of this week, with no restaurants to his name, he's designing the menu at the \"zero-star\" Spitzer's Corner.If you're keeping track, it's taken Nish a bit over twenty years to get from four stars to zero. (To be fair, no one has actually given Spitzer's Corner zero stars; no critic that awards stars has rated it at all.)March was a serious restaurant, no doubt about it. But by the time it closed, in 2007, it had lost some of the early luster. My own visit there, in 2004, was mildly disappointing.The casual make-over that turned March into Nish was a miscalculation. Though it won rave reviews, Nish (the chef) had turned a destination restaurant into a neighborhood joint, and there wasn't enough foot traffic at 58th & First to pay the freight.The failure at Varietal wasn't Nish's fault: after blistering reviews, the place was clearly on life support, and Nish's menu-which won praise from the few who tried it-arrived too late.So now he is at a Lower East Side gastropub, where he says, \"What I'm really looking to do here is three-star bar food.\" I'm actually eager to try it. It might be great, or it might not, but at these prices-nothing over $16-who wouldn't be curious?Yet it is a strange career path: four stars to zero. I wonder if Nish has another serious restaurant in him?

As we noted yesterday, the SoHo Italian restaurant Fiamma jacked up its prices, while reducing choices and banishing luxury ingredients from the kitchen, not long after Frank Bruni awarded three stars. Bruni took them to the woodshed in the Times dining section.Hours later, Fiamma waved the white flag. Chef Fabio Trabocchi e-mailed Frank, and announced that prices would be lowered once again-not back to November 2007 levels, but to lower levels than they'd been just twenty-four hours earlier.Mr. Trabocchi said that he and Mr. Hanson decided today to lower the three-course prix fixe from $92 to $85, the five-course from $120 to $105 and the seven-course menu from $138 as of early this week to $125.Anyone want to take bets on how long this lasts?

Fiamma remains my favorite restaurant despite the war on prices...I am sure that running the high quality restaurant costs a bit...but if you have not tried it yet, the portions are great, and the quality of the ingredients is superb!! alwasy a memmorable experience! I dont mind paying a bit extra for superior quality, it is absolutely worth it. compared to other restaurants the same price, chef trabocchi definitely is superior in his kitchen and menus. lets try to focus on the cooking not on price, because if not, soon we will have no where ot eat in NY!!

Yesterday, Frank Bruni awarded a slightly generous two stars to Bar Boulud, even though \"there's little wow from the kitchen, which turns out treatments of salmon, sea bass and roasted chicken that, while not quite losers, are definitely snoozers.\" He actually preferred the lunch sandwiches to anything offered at dinner.Frank has never cared much for classic French food, but the charcuterie won him over:Bar Boulud is a terrine machine, a pâte-a-palooza, dedicated to the proposition that discerning New Yorkers aren't getting nearly enough concentrated, sculptured, gelatinous animal fat, at least not of a superior caliber.I'll buy that, and I'll buy it on the basis of the restaurant's smooth pâte grand-mère (chicken liver, pork, Cognac) and coarse pâte grand-père (foie gras, pork, port), both of which are such pure joy to eat - on their own, on toasted bread, with mustard, without - that they sent me on a search across the menu not only for close relatives but also for distant cousins. I was ready to ingest the entire extended family.And it gave Frank an opening to write another meta-review, to meditate on the micro-trends that fascinate him so:Much of what you need to know about the direction of fine dining these days is distilled in Bar Boulud, where one of the most accomplished French traditionalists on this side of the Atlantic stages a production whose weakest facet is the conventional three-course dinner.It's not just white tablecloths that have fallen by the wayside at Bar Boulud, which extends the chef Daniel Boulud's trajectory toward ever-more-casual restaurants, mirroring the culture around him. Gone, too, is the notion that sitting at a proper table and ordering a proper sequence of dishes is the way you want to eat. You can certainly take that route, which in fact has rewards enough for anyone who does elect it. But unlike Mr. Boulud's other New York restaurants - Daniel, Cafe Boulud and DB Bistro Moderne, in their order of birth and descending degrees of formality - Bar Boulud doesn't press that path on you.Many of its roughly 100 seats are stools at a high, long counter or chairs at a circular communal table. The fraction of menu real estate claimed by entrees is only about a quarter.You get the sense that if Boulud had installed white tablecloths, Frank would have deducted a star.We took the one-star odds, and lose $1 on our hypothetical bet. Eater took the two-star odds, and wins $4. Eater NYJBankroll$70.50 $86.67Gain/Loss+4.00 -1.00Total$74.50 $85.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost33-14 33-14

Etats-Unis, Twice

A friend and I were overdue for a \"catch-up\" dinner, and I suggested Etats-Unis. I had good memories of the restaurant when I dined there about a year ago, and the neighborhood was convenient.Everything that made Etats-Unis worthwhile then is true now, but we had a peculiar experience. My friend asked for a tissue, or in lieu of that a cocktail napkin, or a paper towel, or anything made of paper that one could wipe the nose with-and for some reason the server refused, and in fact, was quite insistent that she would not. It was not, to be sure, a run-of-the-mill request, but why refuse?Eventually the server complied, but after that we were all but ignored. As my friend lives nearby, she went back the next day to complain. The restaurant was very apologetic, admitted they'd had problems with that server, and gave us a gift certificate more than ample to cover the cost of a second meal.So this is a review of Etats-Unis, twice. The second time, we had a different server, and Etats-Unis shone-as I'm sure it usually does.The printed menu changes daily. And it really does change. I brought home copies of the menus from both visits. Two weeks apart, only two of five appetizers and one of five entrees were identical. And the others hadn't just changed slightly; most had changed totally, aside from the chicken entree (present both times, but with different preparations and accompaniments).Frank Bruni wrote up Etats-Unis on his blog about five months ago. He clearly was reviewing it through the prism of the restaurant's Michelin star status. Most restaurants so honored are considerably more luxurious than this one, and he expected more of the dishes to be knock-outs.What strikes me, rather, is that so much of the food at Etats-Unis is just incredibly solid. After three visits, I remain impressed. Everything is robust, hearty, and impeccably prepared.Its failing, if you'd call it that, is that Etats-Unis goes straight for the gut. These aren't meticulous, composed artistic creations, with sauces laid out in squiggly lines, plates with funky shapes, and dollops of caviar or truffles. Most could be described as comfort food, but executed at a level that commands attention.The portions are also enormous. I have never finished a meal at Etats-Unis, and I probably never will. It's not for a lack of desire. It's just more food than I can eat.It is also expensive. Appetizers are $17-22, entrees $28-38. On my second visit, there was an aged prime rib for two, for $96. The wine list somewhat makes up for it, with plenty of reasonably priced bottles. There are about 20-25 choices by the quarter-bottle (a little more than the standard glass), and almost twenty half-bottles. Tiger shrimp and Dungeness crabmeat chowder (left); Twice risen wild mushroom souffle (right)On our first visit, my friend started with a shrimp and crabmeat chowder ($18), while I had a wild mushroom souffle ($17), which for me was the knockout dish of the evening-an impressive creation. Seafood paella \"Etats-Unis\" (left); Veal chop (right)Seafood paella ($38) is the one entree that was on the menu both times we visited. I hesitate to order paella sometimes, because the seafood is usually in the shell, and the effort to eat it isn't always repaid in flavor. At Etats-Unis, all of the seafood is out of its shell, and therein lies much of its merit. It includes lobster, shrimp and scallops, along with onions, chorizo, artichokes, bacon and rice. My friend loved it so much that she ordered the same thing two weeks later.I had the veal chop ($38), which was one of the least interesting things we tried. It was perfectly done, as is everything at Etats-Unis, but not much was done with it, aside from supplying a boatload of rather unmemorable vegetables. Date pudding (left); Chocolate souffle (right)Among the desserts, date pudding ($12) and the chocolate souffle ($14) never leave the menu. Both are baked-to-order, and you need to request them at the beginning of your meal (the server will ask). As I mentioned last time, either one is easily shareable, especially given the size of the appetizer and entree portions.Anyhow, we ordered both anyway. The data pudding is the better of the two, particularly given that no one else in town is serving anything like it. The souffle is very good, and you won't go home unhappy, but there are plenty of restaurants that do it as well. Fresh pea soup (left); Organic roasted chicken (right)The second time back, we both chose the same appetizer: a terrific pea soup ($18) garnished with chives, lemon, and Dungeness crab meat.Lemon poppyseed souffleFor the main course, my friend had the paella again, while I chose the organic boneless chicken ($28). Whereas my veal chop last time was rather simplistic, there was much more going on here. The chicken was rolled and stuffed with cilantro, onion, and avocado. On the side was a luscious potato terrine, made with six-year aged Gouda cheese. To finish, we re-ordered the date pudding, but this time there was a new souffle to try: lemon poppyseed ($14). It was just fine, but not quite gooey enough. If you're going to have a souffle, the chocolate is better. (There are always four desserts; both times, there was a lemon pudding cake available. On the first visit, a key lime cheesecake took the place of the lemon souffle.)I was impressed that the staff at Etats-Unis essentially comped an entire meal because of the poor service we experienced the first time. Any restaurant would abjectly apologize, but an entire comped meal at this price level is unusual, especially for a restaurant like Etats-Unis that generally has no trouble selling out.The space remains spartan and somewhat cramped, but the service (aside from a certain individual) is otherwise very good.Etats-Unis (242 East 81st Street between 2nd & 3rd Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: **

[Kalina via Eater]In today's Times, Frank Bruni slaps Fiamma with a wet noodle, after hearing complaints that prices went up dramatically, while quality went down, after he awarded three stars in November 2007.Indeed, the prix fixe menu went up from $75 to $95, while many of the luxe ingredients were banished from the kitchen. New Yorker's \"Tables for Two,\" which often reviews restaurants much later than the other critics, caught Fiamma after its downturn, and it wasn't pretty. The Eater Complaints Dept. sprang into action, noting not just the price hike, but also fewer choices than before.The prix fixe was $92 on Bruni's most recent visit, \"an increase of more than 20 percent in just three months.\" The five-course prix fixe had risen from $100 to $120, while the chef's tasting menu \"had contracted from seven courses to five.\" He says, \"The number of choices within the prix fixe was slightly smaller than on a menu I'd saved from mid-November, and in some slight ways the food on the more current menu seemed less luxurious, a shift noted and debated on several dining blogs recently.\"While the cost of dining, like everything else, has continued to rise, the shift at Fiamma-more money for less luxury-was especially abnormal, and deserved the dubious distinction of being called out in the newspaper itself. Normally, Bruni saves this type of news for his blog.But he left Fiamma at three stars, while noting that it \"makes me feel a bit less enthusiastic about a restaurant with so much to recommend it.\"The trouble is that most people who are searching for restaurant reviews will find Bruni's original three-star rave, and not the far less conspicuous correction. You can't tell whether Fiamma has slid to the lower end of the three-star range, or if Bruni would award two if he were doing it all over again.Unfortunately, Times policy doesn't allow a re-rating without three full visits, rather than the one visit that preceded this update. Bruni is no doubt unwilling to make that investment for a restaurant he reviewed only four months ago.Had Bruni lowered Fiamma to two stars, the repercussions would have been substantial. It would have been a cannon-shot across the bow of restauranteurs: \"As quickly as I gave you the third star, I can take it away.\" Instead, restaurants can feel free to take advantage of the consumer after the rave reviews are in, knowing that they are not likely to be revised for many years to come.

Momofuku Ko's online reservation site debuted at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. It crashed at 10:02.All day long at Eater.com, breathless editors chronicled the site's ups and downs-mostly downs (here, here, here, here). It took about five hours for the first week to sell out, though it would have taken only minutes if the site had been working.At Ko HQ, engineers said they'd been hit by a denial-of-service attack. To us, it looked like they simply weren't ready. It turns out that building your own website isn't as easy as it looks.The money quote was in the Eater.com comments: \"Oh wait I get it now. In keeping with the whole concept of the restaurant, they've put the reservation system on a server that only can handle 12 people at a time!\"It didn't take long for scalpers to start hawking reservations on eBay and Craig's List. Team Ko added a word of warning to their home page, phrased in their trademarked sentence fragments:please note you must show id that matchesyour reservation info when you come in to eat(wish we didn't have to do that)As we expected, David Chang's publicity machine is in high gear today, the first day the restaurant is open to paying customers. A photo of Chang tops this week's Dining section in the Times, and Ko leads off Julia Moskin's feature article, \"Your Water Tonight... Will Be the Chef.\" Naturally, Momofuku Ko is also the top item in Florence Fabricant's \"Off the Menu.\"Our cynicism notwithstanding, we do intend to dine at Momofuku Ko very soon...if the website cooperates.Momofuku Ko (163 First Avenue at E. 10th Street, East Village)

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Daniel Boulud's Lincoln Center charcuterie palace, Bar Boulud. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 3-1 Two Stars: 4-1 √√Three Stars: 8-1 Four Stars: 5,000-1The Skinny: This week's bet is a tough one, with the BruniTrends® balanced on a razor's edge. Though early reviews haven't been rapturous, you've got to figure that if anyone can right the ship, it would be Daniel Boulud, whose restaurants already carry nine New York Times stars. Charcuterie takes center stage here, and Bruni is a confirmed meathead. Lastly, the restaurant is on his beloved Upper West Side, where the grading is always easy.But was Boulud able to correct things quickly enough? Reports of bumbling service still come across the transom fairly regularly, and aside from the charcuterie no one has really loved Bar Boulud-not counting celebrities who go there to \"see and be seen.\" Great charcuterie, on its own, is probably a one-star deal, and Bruni loves to take down celebrity haunts. Bruni has been awfully lenient lately, with five positive reviews in a row. If this keeps up, people might almost start to think he's gone flaccid. Frank wouldn't want that to happen, would he?Alas, we can't bring any personal experience to the decision: our own first look at Bar Boulud was on opening night, and we tasted too small a sample to get a good idea of the restaurant's capabilities.The Bet: Our reasons, we admit, are soft. But we feel that Bruni is overdue to bring someone crashing down to earth. We are betting that he'll award one star to Bar Boulud, with strong praise for the charcuterie, but too many other things wrong to justify the second star.

[Krieger via Eater]Chef Kerry Heffernan first came to prominance as executive chef of Danny Meyer's Eleven Madison Park. He left in 2005 to helm another Meyer establishment, Hudson Yards Catering, a behind-the-scenes job that didn't really suit his temperament.At South Gate, in the Jumeirah Essex House Hotel on Central Park South, Heffernan is back in a restaurant kitchen, where he belongs. I loved Heffernan's work at Eleven Madison Park the one time I visited, but both New York Times critics that reviewed it awarded only two stars, which for a Danny Meyer restaurant has to be considered disappointing.The newly refurbished Essex House is practically synonymous with luxury. Not long ago, it was home to Alain Ducasse, probably the fanciest restaurant New York has seen in recent times. With South Gate, the Essex House has gone down-market. The Tony Chi interior dazzles, with its floor-to-ceiling wine wall, gleaming mirrors, and a working fire place. But bare wood tables and floors, and a large space dominated by a wrap-around bar, send a decidedly casual vibe. So does the booming sound system in the adjoining lounge, which made us decidedly uncomfortable.If Heffernan has brought along some of his old recipes from Eleven Madison Park, he certainly hasn't brought along his old service team. It was amateur hour on a Saturday evening, when the amuse-bouche and the appetizers arrived simultaneously, but dessert (cheesecake) took twenty minutes. And good luck flagging down a server when you need one.Heffernan was in the house and greeted most diners (including us), but he couldn't have been pleased to see the place half-empty. Judging by the many accents we heard, we guessed that most of those in the dining room were hotel guests. To survive, such a large restaurant will need to attract a broader clientele.The menu is one of low ambition. There are six appetizers ($14-21), four soups & salads ($12-16), five seafood and vegetable entrees ($26-39) and four meat entrees ($29-38). The obligatory foie gras and lobster make appearances-they're the most expensive appetizer and entree respectively-but you don't find any caviar, black truffles, or Kobe beef. There's no tasting menu.The wine list is on the expensive side, but there are some decent options that don't break the bank. I don't claim any great expertise, but I thought that the 1998 Chateau Camensac Haut-Medoc ($74) was one of the better wines we've had in a while. They don't decant it, as they do at Eleven Madison Park, and the same glasses are used whether you order red or white. Amuse-bouche (left); Wild Mushroom Martini (center); Hamachi (right)The bread service was much better than usual for this class of restaurant: warm bread rolls with individual soft butter servings for each of us. But is it possible to have too much bread? The amuse-bouche was foie gras torchon with orange jelly and lemon zest on a cracker, accompanied by warm gougères.I was sufficiently intrigued to take a chance on the Wild Mushroom Martini ($16). It was basically a hot mushroom soup with spinach fondue, a poached egg, and a slice of crostini. There was allegedly crisp pancetta in there too, but I couldn't find it. Give Heffernan credit for serving something no other chef in town has thought of, but the dish was a failure. The various ingredients were clumpy and hard to get at, especially when they came in a teeter-tottering martini glass.The dish was also, quite frankly, extremely unappetizing to look at. Look at the photo, and write your own disgusting caption. At another table, a French woman took one look at it, and sent it back. It didn't taste bad at all, but I really didn't see the point.My girlfriend's Hamachi ($18) was a good deal more successful. Gianonne Chicken (left); Short-Cured Salmon Pave (right)Chicken ($29) and Salmon ($31) are hotel restaurant cliches, and I'm not sure that Heffernan did much to elevate them beyond their usual fate. The chicken was competent enough, but once again it was not all that appetizing to look at, and it was over-sauced. Did paprika really belong here?Salmon was alleged to be \"short-cured\" - that is, cured for exactly one hour, according to the server. Can an hour of curing really make a difference? We certainly didn't detect any, but the fish was tender enough. Cheesecake (left); Petits-fours (right)For dessert, we shared an order of cheescake ($10). With cheesecake, pastry chefs sometimes get too cute for their own good, but this one was the real McCoy, albeit dressed up a bit. We enjoyed it, and also the petits-fours.With appetizers averaging over $15 and entrees over $30, South Gate needs to do better. The only dish on the menu that seemed to take any real chance-the Wild Mushroom Martini-is surely destined for an early retirement. Is this meant to be a dining destination, or an unadventurous hotel restaurant with a hip bar scene? Whichever is the case, at these prices patrons deserve much better service.South Gate is barely a month old. Given Kerry Heffernan's track record, I assume that it will improve.South Gate (160 Central Park South between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, West Midtown)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

[Kalina via Eater] Note: Click here for a more recent review of Dovetail. John Fraser must be floating on air. Dovetail, his new restaurant, scored a rare \"triple triple\": three-star reviews from Adam Platt, Restaurant Girl, and most importantly, Frank Bruni. Just before the Bruni review came out, I snagged a Friday night reservation for a few weeks away, figuring that it was about to become nearly impossible to get into this place. I was a big fan of Fraser's work at Compass (so was Bruni). If ever a chef deserved his own place, it was Fraser. And he was gutsy enough to put it on the Upper West Side, a neighborhood where upscale restaurants haven't traditionally thrived. Compass, at least, is close enough to Lincoln Center to attract a pre-show crowd; Dovetail most likely will not. Location doesn't matter now: with nine stars to its credit, and counting, Dovetail is a certified destination. Even on the Upper West Side. The Richard Bloch design suggests some nervousness about the restaurant's mission. In the entrance lobby, a floor-to-ceiling glass-enclosed \"wine wall\" and a large host stand make Dovetail look upscale and stylish. The main dining room looks much humbler, with bare wood tables and exposed brick that would be more suitable for a neighborhood place. (An overflow dining room downstairs looks even more spartan.) Wisely, he added carpeting and padded walls to absorb the sound, but it isn't quite good enough. With tables that are awfully close together, you don't get much privacy. Menu (click to expand) Servers in conservative ties and crisply pressed white coats look and act like they parachuted in from a much fancier place. I was pleased that they seated me before my girlfriend arrived, and that they let us linger over cocktails without pressing us to get on with it. But after we ordered, the amuse-bouche, appetizer, and entree all came out at speed. By contemporary standards, Dovetail is a mid-priced restaurant, with appetizers $11-18, entrees $24-34. A five-course tasting menu is only $65, and on Sundays there's a three-course prix fixe at just $38. And it is virtually all excellent. As my girlfriend put it, \"This is what Adour should have been.\" A sommelier noticed that I was puzzling over the wine list. When I asked her for a red under $60, she came back with three options well below that price, including two in the $40s. It was a refreshing change of pace from wine directors who invariably suggest wines right at your maximum, or indeed even above it. A duo of amuses-bouches offered sashimi-quality tuna on a skewer coupled with salmon roe on a white spoon. The bread service was a warm slice of cheddar corn bread. Idaho Potato Gnocchi; Pork Belly Both appetizers were hits: potato gnocchi with veal short ribs and foie gras butter, and pork belly with porcini mushrooms, spinach, and a fried hen egg. Halibut; Rack and Leg of Lamb The entrees offered a bit less excitement, but halibut was expertly done. My girlfriend thought that rack of lamb was a bit tougher than it should be, though I didn't find any problem with the piece of it that I tasted. The ambitious food is somewhat let down by both the ambiance and service, but they certainly won't stand in the way of Dovetail being a tremendous success.

[Kalina via Eater]Cercle Rouge has been through a tough first 2½ years. Once touted as \"Tribeca's Balthazar-to-be,\" it seemed destined for an early demise after the State Liquor Authority threatened to revoke its license, because it was adjacent to a mosque. An Eater Deathwatch followed.At around that time, the original chef, David Feau, departed, followed soon by his deputy, Michael Wurster. Since October 2006, Pierre Landet has been executive chef. Somehow, Cercle Rouge kept its license and survived. In mid-January, after 90 weeks on the Deathwatch, Eater's official position is that Cercle Rouge is in \"remission.\"It certainly didn't become a \"Tribeca Balthazar.\" The initial excitement has long since died down. I walked in after work one day last week, shortly before 7:00 p.m., to find the restaurant practically empty. Business did pick up a bit during the hour I was there, but it was never busy.Menu for Toulouse Cuisine WeekThe menu now seems to be that of a standard French brasserie, though the chicken wings that critics raved about during the Feau era are still on offer. I suppose it's a problem when chicken wings are the best dish at a French restaurant. They're the only thing on the current menu that isn't French.Prices are in a wide range, with appetizers $7-18, entrees $17-38. Côte de Boeuf Bearnaise for two will set you back $68. Wines are reasonable; I was pleased to find a great half-bottle of Haut-Medoc for $38.Last week, the restaurant was showcasing the cuisine of Toulouse, chef Pierre Landet's native region (menu at left; click for a larger version). It was the promise of cassoulet that drew me there, though I was also eager to try those chicken wings once again. The Chicken Wings ($8) are as fun as I remember with them. Somehow, the chicken is scrunched up at one end of the bone, making each one into a lollipop. They are lightly breaded and mildly spicy. The accompanying bleu cheese sauce seemed to have been made up hours before and stored in the fridge, and it wasn't really suitable for dipping.Cassoulet ($24) is the perfect antidote to a cold evening. White beans, carrots, braised duck, and sausage are cooked in a steaming hot crockpot. In this rendition, the vegetables were better than the meats, which were over-cooked and not as flavorful as they should be.The space is comfortable and easy on the eyes. Service was attentive and enthusiastic.Cercle Rouge (241 W. Broadway at N. Moore Street, TriBeCa)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: *

[Bottomless Dish] Note: Greenwich Steak & Burger Co. closed in December 2008. It's always nice to see a respectable casual dining option in TriBeCa, a neighborhood with more upscale restaurants than most. Greenwich Steak & Burger Co. opened in late February at the corner of Greenwich & Franklin Streets, where the TriBeCa Studio Deli had been. It's a much more attractive space than a such a casual restaurant would need to be, with tables generously spaced, high ceilings to dissipate the noise, and large windows looking out on Greenwich Street. Although \"steak\" and \"burger\" are in the name, the menu is dominated by other things. Appetizers ($7-12) span a wide variety of cuisines, such as Tempura Mussels ($8), Lobster Quesadillas ($10), Smoked Salmon Pizza ($10), and Crab Wontons ($8). There's an assortment of soups ($6), salads ($9-12) and pastas ($12-15). Ten different burgers ($9-10, except for a Kobe Beef Burger, $18) offer not just beef, but also crab, tuna, salmon, turkey, and lamb, with seven sauces to choose from. Among eight entrees ($17-25), only three are steaks, the others being chicken, seafood and duck. Side dishes are $6. The most expensive steak, New York Strip, is $24, and it comes with mashed potatoes. I would guess that a steak this cheap won't be a meat-lover's dream. Warm Chips with Truffle Oil; Tuna Tartare I ordered two appetizers. While I waited, the server dropped off a sleeve of warm chips coated in truffle oil. They are hard to resist, and if you're not careful they could easily spoil your appetite. It seems that almost every restaurant has a Tuna Tartare these days, so I was a bit skeptical when the server recommended it here. But this version was as enjoyable as any in town. Equally refreshing was the price: just $10. Yet another helping of warm truffle fries on the side didn't add much. Kobe Beef Sliders; Sweet Potato Fries Kobe Beef Sliders were a bit over-cooked and under-seasoned. They came with a batch of Sweet Potato Fries, but by this time I was far too carbed out to enjoy them. Once again, though, one can hardly complain about the price: $12. Greenwich Steak & Burger offers a more ambitious menu than its humble name would suggest. There's probably an equal measure of hits and misses, but at low enough prices that one is happy to come back and try more. Greenwich Steak & Burger Co.

[The Wandering Eater]Craft, Tom Colicchio's landmark haute barnyard, has just celebrated its seventh anniversary.Since my last visit, about two years ago, Tom Colicchio and Danny Meyer went through an amicable corporate divorce, with Colicchio leaving Gramercy Tavern to focus on his expanding Craft franchise. There are now Crafts in four cities, Craftsteaks in three, and a chain of 'Wichcraft sandwich outlets. There is still only one Craftbar (around the corner from the main restaurant).With so many restaurants to tend, quality can suffer. The New York branch of Craftsteak opened to tepid reviews. Colicchio got to work, and he was able to right the ship, but it was a rare dent to his reputation. Craft lost its Michelin star this year, though no one is quite sure why.Craft has recently introduced a seven-course tasting menu ($110), which I tried with a colleague a couple of weeks ago. The server mentioned that they'd sold only fifty of them so far-a pretty small number for a restaurant that is always jam-packed.The tasting menu allows you to skip the most difficult part of dinner at Craft: deciding what to order on the long, complex menu, which changes daily. Everything on our tasting menu was prepared to the restaurant's usual high standards, but I think the kitchen excels at larger portions that you can linger over. Their strength is the novel, not an anthology of short stories.A serving of Poussin (i.e., chicken) is indicative of the way a tasting menu can titillate, but not satisfy. You've seldom had chicken this tender, this succulent. But when it's reduced to a tasting menu portion, all you seem to get are a few tantalizing scraps. Ordering à la carte is still the way to go at Craft.I certainly wouldn't try the wine pairing again ($75), which didn't offer any remotely interesting choices. For $150, we could have ordered a full bottle that blows the doors off, instead of putting up with a succession of totally unmemorable individual glasses.Craft may have pioneered the \"haute casual\" style-three-star service without tablecloths-and no restaurant in town does it better. The wooden tables are large-to accommodate Craft's trademark cast-iron serving pans and large sharing portions-and generously spaced. A diner seated at the banquette can easily walk between two adjacent tables without having to turn sideways.Service was friendly and attentive.

Last week, I wanted to take my son to a Japanese teppanyaki restaurant-one of those places where the chef prepares the food in front of you on a hibachi grill and performs a bunch of slapstick knife and spatula tricks. Benihana was fully booked, but a bit of googling led me to Ginza in Park Slope.Benihana basically invented this genre. I've been to teppanyaki restaurants in Tokyo, where the food is taken seriously, and there are no clown tricks. But every version of it that I've found in the U.S. (plus once in London) follows the same pattern: mediocre food, but a fun night out for kids and tourists: Disney meets Japan.Craig Claiborne of The New York Times awarded two stars to Benihana in 1970, but it hasn't been a serious restaurant in years. Ginza, at least, feels a lot less commercial. It's in a narrow Fifth Avenue storefront, and with plenty of exposed brick it even feels cute. There's a small seating area for those who want to order sushi, but four hibachi grills are the showcase. We saw plenty of families, most probably from the neighborhood.The chef knew all of the standard clown tricks, but the food was pretty bad, starting with a humdrum salad and dull miso soup. The chef gets the rice and vegetables started, then the shrimp, and throws in some fire for show (it has nothing to do with the cooking). The shrimp are about done now, and so is the fried rice, to which the chef had added two fresh eggs. These are the best things we had at Ginza, mainly because they were not over-cooked, and the chef didn't cut them into little pieces. Now, the chef finished off the chicken. Three lovely chicken breasts were chopped up and fried to death, losing all of their natural mosture. In the photo on the left, you can see a strip steak on the grill, thick and nicely marbled.But the same violence was inflicted on the steak, too: it is cut into tiny pieces and fried to death, so that almost none of the natural juices are left. The chef cut off a fatty piece on the end, and was about to throw it away, but we insisted he give it to us. At least it had some flavor.Ginza is good fun for the family, but I wouldn't go for the food. My son complained about the long subway ride from Upstate Manhattan into far-away Brooklyn, but his objections melted away when he saw the hibachi grills: kids adore this stuff.Prices don't break the bank. My girlfriend had the chicken and shrimp dinner ($20.95), with an extra side of vegetables ($7.00). My son and I had the chicken, shrimp and steak dinner for two ($47.95). Beers were $6 apiece.Ginza (296 Fifth Avenue between 1st & 2nd Streets, Park Slope, Brooklyn)Food: FairService: FineAmbiance: Nice neighborhood placeOverall: Fair

The Payoff: WD~50

***CONTENT
Yesterday, Frank Bruni upgraded WD~50 to the three stars that some of us believed it deserved all along:[Chef Wylie Dufresne] pushes hard against the envelope of possibility and the bounds of conformity to produce food that's not only playful but also joyful and even exhilarating, at least when the mad science pays off. It pays off more frequently now than in the past, when his attitude was cheekier, his judgment wobblier and too many of his creations gratuitously perverse. Foie gras with anchovies? Venison tartare with edamame ice cream? I'd often shake my head, drop my fork and glance longingly toward the exit.When William Grimes reviewed WD-50 in The New York Times shortly after the restaurant's opening in 2003, he gave it two stars, saying that for all Mr. Dufresne's ingenuity, he demonstrated \"a certain contempt for the pleasure principle.\"...But most of the dishes I tried over the last few months were knockouts, their measured eccentricities in the service of something other than eccentricity itself. These dishes validate the kind of experimentation that culinary pioneers like Mr. Dufresne undertake, and they reflect a thoughtful, mature equilibrium between what's merely edgy and what's truly enjoyable.I've quoted Bruni at more length than usual, so that I can ask a question: has the restaurant really changed that much since the original two-star review? Or have Bruni's tastes just caught up with what Dufresne was doing all along? It's difficult to say, because there remain plenty of people who still think that the cuisine at WD~50 makes no sense at all.In all of Bruni's re-reviews, he tries to exaplain how the restaurant is different than before. But usually there is something far more specific-a change of chef being the obvious example. Bruni does admit that the restaurant \"isn't right for everyone or every mood,\" a rare concession in a three-star review. Is there any restaurant that's right for everyone or every mood?Eater and New York Journal both took the three-star odds. We both win $2 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

First Look: Terroir

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a later visit to Terroir. It takes a lot to draw me over to First Avenue on a weeknight, which is about as far out of my commuting path as I could get without leaving Manhattan. But when I heard that sommelier Paul Grieco (Hearth, Insieme) was opening a new wine bar, I had to give it a try. It's called Terroir, for the French word that describes the \"sense of place\" that gives each wine its personality. Grieco's partner, Marco Canora, is in charge of the food, which includes several favorites from his tenure at Craftbar, and other snacks that go well with the informal bar setting. There isn't much of a kitchen in the tiny space at Terroir, but a lot of the food comes from Hearth, which is just 30 yards down the street. The vibe is very East Village-y, including the gentle price point. There are over twenty wines offered by the glass, from just $5 to $19, with many at $10 or less. All are also offered by the half-glass. The variety is hard to characterize, but rest assured anything Paul Grieco offers will be compelling. The wine list at Hearth is famously verbose, but for now the much smaller list at Terroir is limited to the bare facts. \"There's not much literature in it yet,\" Grieco said. \"Right now, it's like an e. e. cummings poem.\" I suspect it won't be that way for long. The food menu fits on one page: bar snacks ($4-5, or 6 for $22); fried stuff ($7); salads ($7-8); bruschetta ($6-7); charcuterie ($4-5, or assortment $21); cheese ($3.50, or 6 for $20); soup ($8); panini ($9) and large plates ($15), with generally four or five choices in each category. The large plates include such choices as veal & ricotta meatballs, braised duck leg, sausage, and broiled sardines. I ordered the charcuterie assortment ($21), which came with about nine different kinds of hand-cut meats (which is more than I saw listed individually on the menu), a terrific pork terrine, and sliced bread. Canora explained each one, but I won't attempt to duplicate his descriptions. I asked Grieco to pair wines with it. He chose a contrasting white from southern Italy and a red from France; for both, he opened a fresh bottle and gave me a small taste before pouring a glass. I was charged half-glass prices ($4.00/$4.75) for what seemed to me generous pours. They were wonderful choices, as I have come to expect from anything Grieco recommends. The small space was full, but I had no trouble getting a bar stool after about five minutes' wait. This being opening night, a lot of the customers were friends of the owners, stopping in to say hello. For such a small space, it seemed to be well staffed, with everyone pitching in: Canora cleared plates; Grieco dried glassware. Now that Canora and Grieco have three restaurants, there is one problem: I don't know where Grieco will be. I trust that the kitchens can execute Canora's cuisine in his absence, but who will be there to recommend wines? Wherever Grieco is working on any given day, that's where I want to dine.

[Kalina via Eater]David Chang's latest restaurant, Momofuku Ko, is all set to open on March 12. Always attuned to his own self-promotion, Chang chose a Wednesday, so that Florence Fabricant can announce the opening in that day's Times food section.Dinner service for Friends & Family began this week, and already the blogosphere is a-ga-ga. Ruth Reichl files a review that sounds like it would be four stars if she still wrote for the Times. She is ready to fellate Chang. Ed Levine keeps his pants on, but loves the place too.At least two lucky eGullet members have photos posted (here, here). Pro photographer Kathryn Yu has a beautiful set up on flickr (here). The photos even show David Chang himself in the kitchen; and there, we thought he hadn't actually cooked anything in years.eGullet founder Steven A. Shaw isn't one of the fortunate few to have dined there yet, but he's already a skeptic:Those dishes all looked entirely within the capabilities of the Ssäm Bar kitchen (indeed, as noted above, variants of several of these dishes have been served at Ssäm Bar over the past few months). Maybe the portions in the Ko photos are smaller and the plate compositions slightly more precise, but that's about it....I've been as enthusiastic about the food at Ssäm Bar and Noodle Bar as just about anybody, and have made the case that Ssäm Bar is the best restaurant in New York right now, so I'm not saying that it would be a bad thing for the Chang team not to be able to cook food any better than what they're serving at Ssäm Bar. It's already fantastic. But it won't get better by virtue of being put on smaller plates with dollops of caviar.Momofuku Ko hasn't got a phone. An online reservation system is the only way to get in (preview here), with bookings accepted up to a week in advance. As there are just 14 seats, you can expect this to be New York's toughest table-at least for a while. I'm picturing thousands of foodies in their pajamas with fingers poised on the refresh button at 12:01 a.m. every day.Such is the hype that even the URL is a subject of speculation. Eater, who's in-the-know, posts that \"The system will go live sometime between now and Saturday.\"Momofuku Ko (163 First Avenue at E. 10th Street, East Village)

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the city's lone successful example of haute molecular gastronomy, WD~50. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 5-1 Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 2-1 √√ Four Stars: 5,000-1The Skinny: WD~50 currently carries two New York Times stars, per William Grimes in June 2003. It also carries a Michelin star, and for whatever it's worth, three stars on this website.Frank Bruni's re-reviews almost always come with a change of rating, unless there has been an intervening event to justify a fresh look-and there has been no such event at WD~50. The restaurant certainly hasn't regressed in the last five years, which suggests the rating has nowhere to go but up.The X-factor is that Bruni generally doesn't like food you have to think about. The few examples of avant-garde cuisine that have come along during his tenure have not won favorable reviews. This would also be his third 3-star review in just five weeks.But we have to agree with Eater that this review is pointless unless Bruni upgrades the restaurant to three stars. One can never put it past Bruni to waste a review slot, but we're not betting he will. Expect Bruni to give Wylie Dufresne credit for staying in the kitchen at WD~50, when most chefs of his calibre (and fame) would surely by now have opened a second restaurant...or a third, or a fourth.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award three stars to WD~50.

[Kalina/NYMag] Note: Click here for a subsequent visit to Olana. Olana opened in late February on a slightly gloomy stretch of lower Madison Avenue. The restaurant is named for the Upstate New York Persian-style home of the artist Frederic Edwin Church (1826-1900). A Hudson Valley theme is supposed to run through Olana's DNA, though we found it somewhat imperfectly realized. Frederic Edwin Church's home, Olana [olana.org] Al di Meglio, formerly of Osteria del Circo, is running the kitchen, and his Italian roots are evident on a menu where pasta dishes shine. We noted plenty of ingredients that, as far as we know, are not indigenous to the Hudson Valley, such as sea urchin, octopus and king crab. Others, like Roasted Rabbit and Organic Chicken, could have come from local sources, but the menu didn't say so. More puzzling was the wine list, which was reasonably priced, but followed no plan of organization that I could detect. It had only one wine from New York State-a white from the South Fork of Long Island. The space is beautifully appointed in deep, plush red. There is a gorgeous semi-circular bar that already appears to be a hit with the neighborhood's after-work crowd. In the dining room, large bright glass panels showing naturalistic upstate scenery were a bit jarring in the clubby-looking surroundings. The restaurant is offering a preview menu for the first two weeks, at 15% off. Service seemed a bit confused at times, as one might expect in the opening days. One server sounded like a brash Texan, but another called us monsieur et madame. Olana is clearly intended to be upscale and, by today's standards, relatively formal. One can only hope that they'll pull it off. The menu is divided into appetizers, pastas (available in appetizer or entree portions), fish and meat, plus side dishes. There are roughly a half-dozen in each category. I failed to note the prices, but they're at the high end. You can also construct your own 4, 5, or 6-course tasting menu, choosing any items from the menu. We had the four-course tasting ($62, before the discount). Amuse-bouche (left); Risotto with sea urchin, king crab and black truffles (right) The amuse bouche was a delicate tarte with pear and tomato jelly. I loved the first course, an exquisite risotto with sea urchin, king crab and black truffles. My girlfriend tried another pasta dish, the chestnut crespelle with ricotta, mushrooms and pine nuts, which she liked, but was surprised to find was more like a crepe than a pasta. Armagnac and Orange Poached Flounder (left); Roasted Rabbit (right) We had mixed reactions to the fish course. I thought the kitchen had a deft touch with an Armagnac and Blood Orange Poached Flounder, but my girlfriend thought that Striped Bass was dull. An impressive entree of Roasted Rabbit was stuffed with almonds, apricots and foie gras. It also seemed to both of us that the whole production was wrapped in bacon, though the menu did not say so. My girlfriend didn't want to eat Bugs Bunny, so she had the Grilled Berkshire Pork Loin, which was just fine, but not nearly as impressive. Ice Cream (left); Petits-fours (right) We both wimped out on dessert, mainly because we were full. There are more interesting choices than ice cream, but that was all we were in the mood for. A nice plate of petits-fours was, unfortunately, lost on us. On this early showing, Olana appears to be serving ambitious cuisine, much of which is very good indeed. I can't fathom why they opened with an obvious \"Hudson Valley\" theme, and then offered a menu and wine list that fails to fully exploit it. But if that is rectified, Olana's quiet elegance could make it a compelling addition to the restaurant scene.

In today's Times, Frank Bruni makes the remarkable discovery that some places called \"Bar ______\" aren't really bars in the usual sense:In an era of casual dressing, piecemeal supping and food as the adjunct to wine, is a restaurant's best bet to pretend it's less than it is? Should it persuade diners that it doesn't harbor big ambitions or demand close attention, even if the opposite is true? These are questions brought to mind by Bar Blanc, which belongs to a growing brood of establishments whose names suggest scruffier atmospheres and more modest menus than the places actually present.Among its semantic siblings is Bar Stuzzichini, a fairly full-fledged Italian restaurant that opened last year, and Bar Milano, an apparently full-fledged Italian restaurant scheduled to open next month.And then of course there's Bar Boulud, a new French restaurant - yes, restaurant - that doesn't even have a proper bar. Misleading nomenclature comes naturally to the chef Daniel Boulud, whose Cafe Boulud bears no resemblance to a cafe and whose DB Bistro Moderne isn't anything like a bistro. Oh, yes. What about the food? Two stars.We'll admit it: We were very close to betting on just one star. But we didn't. So Eater and NYJ both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

We were less enchanted, awarding only one star.With most of the entrees between $25 and $35, these are not West Village neighborhood prices. To award the deuce, Bruni will insist on first-class service (not a strength of this restaurant in early reviews) and a high ratio of hits to duds.The Bet: We are usually inclined to trust our own instincts (one star), but most critics have been positive, and we're not willing to disagree with quite so many luminaries all at once. We are therefore betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Bar Blanc.

Note: As of 2009, Davidburke & donatella is renamed David Burke Townhouse, after Donatella Arpaia severed her ties with the restaurant. Davidburke & donatella is a frustrating restaurant that is hard to ignore. The first time I visited, I rated it a shade below three stars. The second time, I was so disgusted that I wasn't sure I'd ever return. But David Burke's witty menu, now under chef de cuisine Eric Hara, drew me back. Some of the restaurant's drawbacks are destined never to be remedied. Tables are squished so tightly together that you're practically in your neighbors' lap. This is certainly not the place for a romantic tete-à-tete. To get to the restroom and back, you must navigate an obstacle course. Given the price range, you'd like the service staff to be more attentive; given the cramped quarters, I'm not sure how they'd squeeze in any more of them. The comely Ms. Arpaia and her Vespa The wine list remains exorbitant. A mediocre pinot noir was $75, and I saw nothing for much less. Both David Burke and Donatella Arpaia have since drifted on to other adventures. Arpaia's latest is Mia Dona, with chef Michael Psilakis. Burke has opened six restaurants in the last four years, of which David Burke Las Vegas is the most recent. But despite the distractions, the menu at davidburke & donatella has not remained stagnant. There were several items I had not seen before, and Burke's abundant wit remains evident in all of them. I don't know if he is still contributing, or if in Eric Hara he has found a worthy deputy. When you sit down, the evening's tasting menu ($75, five courses) is already in front of you. There are also several hand-written specials. It is admirable to have them in writing, especially given the dense complexity of Burke's (or Hara's) creations. If they were recited, I suspect they would be inaudible through the din. A three-course prix-fixe (which wasn't available before) is $55, although numerous dishes carry supplements. On the à la carte menu, appetizers are $15-24, mains are $28-44. Scallop Ceviche (left); Bread service (right) The amuse-bouche was a rather bland scallop ceviche. As before, the wonderful hot bread rolls are served in a copper pot, and the butter is an artful sculpture that one is almost sorry to cut into. PB&J (left); Parfait of Salmon and Tuna Tartars with Crème Fraiche (right) \"PB&J\" ($21) seems to have undergone some refinement since it was featured in New York. Earlier photos (example here) showed a hunk of pan-seared foie gras between two slices of toasted brioche, with strawberry jam and a macadamia nut spread. But the version of served yesterday was a lot less interesting. The foie gras itself was more like a tennis-ball-shaped terrine cut in half, with the jam and peanuts on the side. Though visually arresting, it was not as interesting with the contrasting ingredients demoted to observer status. My girlfriend adored the parfait of salmon and tuna tartars ($16). The version served last night was handwritten on the menu, so it might not be exactly the same recipe shown on the restaurant website, although I believe it is close. Organic \"Ostrich\" Scramble (left); Handmade Cavatelli & Braised Short Ribs (right) For the main course, I decided on one of the handwritten specials, described as an \"Organic 'Ostrich' Scramble\" ($44 as an entree; also available as an appetizer). The 'Ostrich' in quotes refers to the serving vessel: half an ostrich egg. There is otherwise no ostrich in the dish, which includes scrambled organic eggs, lobster, tomato, caviar and crème fraiche. I give Hara (or was it Burke?) full credit for dreaming up something that, I think we may safely say, no one anywhere else is serving. But in the end it was just a tasty mash-up of luxury ingredients that didn't really sustain enough interest to be a main course. My girlfriend was quite happy with the Homemade Cavatelli & Braised Short Ribs ($32). We concluded with a shared order of Burke's Cheesecake Lollipop Tree ($18; left). I've now had it three times, and like many Burke creations, I think it's more notable for how it looks than how it tastes. More than four years after it opened, davidburke & donatella has lost none of its popularity. It seems to be nearly always full, drawing heavily on a well dressed Upper East side crowd. It would be easy for such a place to lapse into dull repetition, but Burke and Hara continue to swing for the fences with their inventive cuisine. If not every item is a hit, one has to respect the creativity. But in so many other ways the restaurant is incredibly unpleasant. After three uneven visits, I am not sure I'll be back again anytime soon. davidburke & donatella (133 E. 61st Street between Park & Lexington Avenues, Upper East Side) Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Something you'll never see: The Little Owl with no customers. [Kalina via Eater]Much of The Little Owl's reputation seems to rest on two knockout dishes: The Pork Chop, which I had the last time I visited; and the meatball sliders.I was in the mood for a snack the other day, so I dropped in for an order of those balleyhooed sliders. All of the bar seats were available at 6:15 p.m., but within fifteen minutes they were all taken.[Amateur Gourmet]In a town awash with sliders, I thought these were par for the course. These are made with beef, pork and veal, and slathered with gravy. The server asked what I thought, and I said, \"They're fun.\"\"They're perfect!\" she replied, almost looking offended, as if merely \"fun\" wasn't good enough. At $10, they certainly make a fine snack.The space remains unbelievably popular, and unbelievably cramped. They must have added a couple of tables since Kalina's photo (above) was shot: it almost looks roomy, which The Little Owl, with its 28 seats, is not. They now manage to fit five at the bar, and believe me, it's a squeeze.I continue to believe, as I did before, that The Little Owl is slightly overrated, but it's a wonderful neighborhood restaurant. I wish I had something as good where I live.The Little Owl (90 Bedford Street at Grove Street, West Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: CrampedOverall: *

***CONTENT
Note: Since this review was written, Market Table has dropped the \"Market\" part of the concept. The front room is no longer a market, and the restaurant now has 60 seats, 20 more than before.In November 2008, Frank Bruni awarded two stars in the Times. We believe-as we did at the Little Owl-that this was one star more than it deserved, bearing in mind that one star is supposed to be a compliment. Thanks to the Bruni review, it's probably no longer true that \"Market Table is a Little Owl you can get into.\"Two years ago, Joey Campanaro and Gabriel Stulman electrified the West Village with their hugely successful Little Owl, which won a remarkable two stars from Frank Bruni in the Times. Five months ago, they returned with a sequel, Market Table, just five blocks south. Early on, the demand for tables was intense: Bloomberg's Ryan Sutton waited 90 minutes to get in.Critical reception hasn't reached the levels of rapture accorded The Little Owl. Market Table made Adam Platt's Best of '07 List, but Platt doesn't seem to have reviewed it. In the Village Voice, Sietsema was unimpressed. For the Sun, Paul Adams mostly liked it. Randall Lane awarded four of six in TONY, and Restaurant Girl awarded 2½ out of 4 in the Daily News. But Frank Bruni surprisingly gave it a pass, letting Julia Moskin deliver a mixed verdict in Dining Briefs.At Market Table, the central conceit is that it's a market with tables. The front room sells coffee, sandwiches, and some of the same food ingredients used in the restaurant. The serving area is in the back room. It's roomier and comfier than The Little Owl. Still, the shared DNA is apparent: exposed brick, bare table-tops, and a bar that's set up for walk-in diners. Their menus and wine lists are similar, too.Market Table is a Little Owl you can get into. At 6:15 p.m. on a Saturday evening, The Little Owl couldn't accommodate our party of three. Five minutes later, we walked into Market Table and were seated at the bar immediately.The menu is laden with comfort-food favorites. It had certainly captured our server's affections. We asked him for recommendations, and by the time he was finished he had gushed over practically every dish. Mikey Price, formerly of The Mermaid Inn, is in charge of the kitchen,. He was off on the evening we were there, but Campanaro (who humbly called himself the \"chef's assistant\") was on hand. Beet and goat cheese salad (left); Fried calamari (right)A salad with heirloom beets and breaded balls of fried goat cheese ($11) was lovely. Humble fried calamari ($9) were crisp and not at all greasy. Crab cake (left); Lamb shank (right)A crab cake ($21) was impressive, with only the slightest cloak of breading and tender chunks of crab. But a braised lamb shank ($20) was dull and tough. Silky potatoes au gratin with gouda cheese offered some redemption.At a restaurant where most entrees are below $25, it's nice to see that they don't try to make it up on wine. A Finger Lakes Cabernet Franc was $44, and these days I feel the need to cheer when there is anything decent for under $50.There is also a selection of half-bottles-another estimable trait shared with The Little Owl.Is Market Table as good as The Little Owl? It's not lacking for business, but the foodocracy still seems to prefer the older sibling. The space at Market Table is considerably more pleasant, but the menu doesn't seem to have that \"killer dish\"-at The Little Owl, it's the famous pork chop-as a draw.But I'll probably come back to Market Table, because it's fun, friendly, and inexpensive. And readers, please note that the rating below-one star (the same as I gave The Little Owl)-is not an insult. One star means \"good\".Market Table (54 Carmine Street near Bedford Street, West Village)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: *

Left: The walk-thru wine cellar; Right: The dining roomFive years ago, Bruno Jamais opened his \"exclusive\" restaurant club on the Upper East Side. The Times reported that admission was open only to Mr. Jamais' exclusive client list, honed over his years as maître d'hôtel at Daniel and Alain Ducasse. Membership in the club was $7,000 a pop.The restaurant is on a quiet Upper East Side block in an elegant townhouse, just steps away from the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Starchitect Tony Chi's interior, featuring a spectacular walk-through wine cellar, won Hospitality Design's Best Restaurant Design award in 2004. The dining room now doubles as a one-man show for the French artist Cyrille Margarit. Even Donald Trump might find it too opulent.Critics mostly ignored the restaurant, which was evidently as Mr. Jamais wanted it. The only pro review was in the New Yorker, which found the food mediocre. The critic was more intrigued by diners whose dates seemed to be paid by the hour.The supper club idea didn't last; these days, anyone can get in. Indeed, there's a distinct sense of almost begging, with the menu reminding you-in capital letters, no less-that the space is available for \"BIRTHDAY PARTIES, SPECIAL OCCASIONS, WEDDING RECEPTIONS & CORPORATE EVENTS.\" Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays are singles' nights, and there's a half-price prix fixe on Sundays.There's a decent number of reviews on the web, though some of the writers may be shills. The food seems to have been uneven over the years-sometimes terrific, but not dependable. The revolving door in the kitchen cannot have helped: the restaurant opened in late 2002, and it's already on its fourth chef. With that background, this isn't a restaurant I would have chosen without an invitation. Full disclosure: our food and drinks were on the house, though I paid for the wine myself. Having said that, we were extremely impressed. The cuisine at Bruno Jamais is serious and excellent.John Keller, who previously worked at Le Bernardin and Nobu, has been executive chef since 2006. His deft menu, which changes daily, is mostly conservative, but Keller can be clever too. Ingredients like caviar and foie gras are deployed liberally, but not in the lazy ways of chefs who use luxury as a substitute for thought. This is cooking of a high order.The wine list is impressive, with one of the city's better selections of Bordeaux and Burgundies. It skews expensive, but there are bottles as low as $40 (not many, though). A 1993 Chateau Lynch-Moussac Pauillac seemed to me fairly priced at $140.There are some good house cocktails, too, but I failed to note all the ingredients in the one I liked best-something called \"Sexy Back,\" which the bartender recommended. The house signature cocktail, the Bruno's Martini Platinum, was decent but crazily over-priced at $38.The early New Yorker review complained of stratospheric prices: in 2002, a $42 entree was sufficient to provoke outrage. Today, it's at the high end of mainstream. Appetizers are $12-25, main courses $22-42 (most in the low thirties), side dishes $7-10. While clearly not inexpensive, there are plenty of Manhattan restaurants at this price level, including many that aren't nearly as good.The menu is reasonably focused, too, with just ten appetizers and ten entrees. There are a few nods to Asia and a number of French classics, but the menu is written in English. Portion sizes are ample. Toast points with tomato chutney (left); Bread service (center); Goat cheese and mushroom strudel (right)The bread service began with warm toast points and a tomato chutney spread. There was also a basket of excellent fresh breads, which cold triangles of butter didn't live up to. The amuse-bouche continued the tomato chutney theme, with a terrific goat cheese and wild mushroom strudel. Lobster Brûlee (left); Foie Gras Terrine (right)Lobster Brûlee ($25) was an absolute knockout-think crème brûlee, but with lobster. This is one of the cleverest items on the menu A foie gras terrine ($25) was one of the menu's more conservative choices, which the kitchen executed well. Filet mignon au poivre (left); Duck Breast (right)Steak in a non-steakhouse is often disappointing, but my girlfriend's Filet Mignon au poivre ($35)-a boring choice, I know-was excellent. Duck breast was just about perfect, served with champagne-vanilla poached pear, chanterelle mushrooms and foie gras. It's as good as any duck entree in town, and at $26 you would have to consider it a bargain. Left to right: Creamed spinach; Truffle mashed potatoes; Potato croquettes with gruyère cream; French friesThe four side dishes that we tried were far more than we needed, but they were all first-rate. The next morning my girlfriend said, \"I'm still dreaming about those french fries.\" Homemade cookies (left); Floating island (center); Chocolate souffle (right)Our desserts were French standards, executed as well as they are anywhere.We were seated at a comfortable banquette. The tables are a variety of sizes: ours would have comfortably accommodated four, but others looked seemed awfully small even for two. Service was polished and enthusiastic. Servers' menu recommendations were sensible and accurate. The publicist said that Bruno Jamais attracts a late-night crowd (the kitchen takes orders until 3:00 a.m.). She recommended an 8:30 p.m. reservation-later than I normally prefer-so that we could get a better feel for the ambiance. Yet, over the course of three hours, the space was never more than half full. For much of the time, the staff outnumbered the customers. It was a varied clientele, both young and old, not fitting the stereotypes normally attached to such a place.Does Bruno Jamais want to be taken seriously as a restaurant? If the rest of the food is as good as we had, it certainly should be. It could start by upgrading its website. Even fifteen years ago, it would have looked tacky; today, it is an embarrassment. Memo to Mr. Jamais: the only places that call themselves \"ultra elegant\" are the ones that are not.Bruno Jamais-the restaurant, not the man (whom we did not meet)-seemed schizophrenic to us. The supper-club vibe leads you to expect cruise ship cuisine for aging plutocrats, courtesans, and B-list celebrities. Some of the literature still has the quirky, off-putting name, \"Bruno Jamais Restaurant Club.\" But the kitchen turns out three-star food: there wasn't a single dud, or anything remotely close to it, among the many things we tried. (Dining on a publicist's dime, I've learned, is no guarantee of excellence.)We had a wonderful meal, which we did not expect at all. If you pocket your aversion to the faux exclusivity that Bruno Jamais wears on its sleeve, you'll find that the food is worth your attention.Bruno Jamais (24 E. 81st Street between Madison & Fifth Avenues, Upper East Side)

***CONTENT
Yesterday, Frank Bruni awarded a glowing three stars to Dovetail, confirming that the Upper West Side sleeper hit is the Real Deal:The inconspicuousness of the restaurant's entrance may be bonkers or in fact brilliant, a subtle signal of Dovetail's confidence in its inner strength. The carpeting and padded walls in the back definitely make sense. They keep noise in check.Depending on where you sit, the restaurant can feel too plain for entrees that average above $30. The wines by the glass could be more exciting, and a few dishes don't succeed, like an appetizer marriage of skate and chicken wings that's inspired by semantics more than anything else.All of that gives me concern about the possibility of a slightly disappointing dinner here. But most of my experiences were hugely positive.The Eater oddsmakers offered an astonishing 15-1 odds on three stars, an opportunity for someone to make a killing. The oddsmakers are seldom that far off the mark. Like Eater, we took the more conservative two-star bet, so we both lose $1.

Both Adam Platt and the Restaurant Girl awarded three stars. The Platt review was especially striking, as he has awarded more than a deuce just three times in the 26 months since he started giving stars. That's even less than Frank Bruni.Could Dovetail be en route to a triple triple? Eater doesn't think so, and neither do we. Bruni tends to spread out his three-star ratings (he has given just 21 of them in 45 months on the job), and he awarded three stars to Le Cirque just two weeks ago. On top of that, our sense is that Dovetail is more casual than most of the places that have earned three stars from Bruni.On the other hand, Bruni's judgment is seldom more than a star away from Platt's, which would seem equally to preclude a one-star outcome.The Bet: We therefore agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Dovetail.

Yesterday, Frank Bruni gave himself the week off, leaving the reviewing to \"three latke-loving New Yorkers with appetites and opinions.\" The result was the expected one star for the 2nd Avenue Deli:We were at the Second Avenue Deli, newly reopened and newly misnamed, since it's now on East 33rd Street near Third Avenue.But its location doesn't matter. What does is that after a two-year absence it's back, rejoining Katz's and the Carnegie among a handful of old-timers devoted to Jewish deli food, which isn't just about eating.It's about tradition, nostalgia and (my favorite part) the sport of friendly bickering over what's orthodox, what's not, whether there's room in this short life for lean sandwich meat and who has the best tongue in town.For the second week in a row, there was no real suspense about the number of stars Frank Bruni would award. Eater and I both win $2 on our hypothetical one dollar bets. Eater NYJBankroll$64.50 $80.67Gain/Loss+2.00 +2.00Total$66.50 $82.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost30-13 31-12

Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the 2nd Avenue Deli. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 3-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: 75-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: There isn't much we can add to Eater's compelling logic. Frank Bruni doesn't usually mess with delis, so it would be awfully peculiar for him to invest the time in a review, only to give it a goose egg. But two stars for a deli would be awfully generous, given that the revered Katz's deli came away with only one.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to the 2nd Avenue Deli.

[Rockwell Group] Note: This is a review of Adour under chef Tony Esnault, who left the restaurant in November 2008. His replacement is American-born Joel Dennis. We look forward to giving Adour another try after Dennis has a chance to put his stamp on the menu. My girlfriend and I thought it was near tragic when Alain Ducasse at the Essex House closed. It was the site of perhaps the best meal we have had in New York. When Ducasse announced that he was moving to the St. Regis, site of the former four-star Lespinasse, in a new restaurant called Adour, we hoped the magic would be moving with him. Alas, the magic is nowhere to be found. Adour is a bore. A really crashing bore. I don't think three-star food has to be innovative: I find real pleasure in classics done well. But the menu here is downright soporific: one yawn after another. There's no excitement on the plate at all. And if no longer priced in the stratosphere, as it was at the Essex House, the food at Adour is still very expensive. For entrees priced in the $40s, one expects at least some indication of the creative spark that earned Ducasse all of those Michelin stars. The menu is printed on stiff boards glued into an upholstered cardboard folder. It is obviously not easily changeable. It makes Adour feel like a crass hotel restaurant. The subtle message it sends is: \"The food isn't changing anytime soon.\" It is almost all in English. It apparently hasn't occurred to Monsieur Ducasse that patrons at his restaurant might want, you know, French food. Is this Ducasse's way of saying \"Screw you, New York\"? Or, in his eagerness to pander-to give Americans what he thinks we want-has he forgotten to give us what he's actually good at? We asked one of the servers what had happened to the great menu served at the Essex House. \"It was time to move on,\" he said. To \"move on\" to this? We certainly expected dialed-down luxury, given a price point about 50% lower than the Essex House. But there isn't even an amuse-bouche here. If you order a cheese course ($22), there's no cart, just a plate of four cheeses deposited on your table. The wine service shines, though. The menu, after all, is supposedly designed to go well with wine, though I am not sure what that means. The list has plenty of compelling choices at decent prices, including multiple bottles of red under $50. We selected a 1996 Bricco Boschi Barolo at $105, which the staff decanted for us. I also liked the bread service, which came with a wonderful soft olive butter. Sweetbread \"Meunière\", Egg Purse (left); Foie Gras Tapioca Ravioli (right) Sweetbreads with wild mushrooms ($24) were simply grilled, but I appreciated the egg purse in the center of the plate, which made a rich, runny mess. My girlfriend's Foie Gras Tapioca Ravioli ($23) were dull. The taste of foie can always be counted on for luxury by default, but the dish made no attempt to offer any contrast. Venison Medallions (left); Roasted Colorado Rack of Lamb (right) Both Venison ($42) and Rack of Lamb ($48) were left basically to fend for themselves, with token vegetables offering little to amuse the palate. My girlfriend said that the side of risotto that came with her lamb was more interesting than the lamb itself. Pear Clafoutis (left); Gala Apple Souffle (right) Neither dessert captured our imagination either, though at $14 apiece we didn't feel cheated. The plates of petits-fours were generous, though we were full and didn't touch them. At Adour, the service team is no longer all French, as they were at the Essex House. Most of them seem capable, though we observed some minor snafus that no doubt will be worked out as the restaurant gets its legs. When we arrived, we appreciated that we were given ample time to peruse the wine list and enjoy our champagne. The restaurant wasn't full, and the table appeared to be ours for as long as we wanted it. The David Rockwell-designed space is comfortable and gorgeous. It could easily be one of the city's most serene spots to enjoy a meal. But the food doesn't live up to it. We can only hope Ducasse will take this milquetoast menu back into his laboratory, and return with some real excitement.

OpenTable.com has a list of the Top 10 Booked Restaurants in New York. For a long time, the Stanton Social was on that list. It isn't any longer, but I'm sure it's not far off the pace. I almost pinched myself a few weeks ago, when I saw a 7:00 p.m. two-top on a Friday evening, and grabbed it. If there's a popularity checklist in the restaurant industry, the Stanton Social ticks all of the boxes. Its inexpensive tapas-style menu covers all the popular cuisines. Check. Kobe beef and foie gras are on hand to contribute an haute cuisine flourish or two. Check. Lower East Side vibe. Check. Eye-popping AvroKO decor. Check. An ear-thumping sound track. Check. I arrived early, so I headed upstairs to try a few of the house cocktails. Black Magic ($10), a simple mixture of Guinness and Brut Champagne, was a complete failure. The bartender later admitted he hates it too: \"Guinness and champagne can be good friends outside of work, but they don't belong together at work.\" The Social Tea ($12), with Stoli Citros, green tea and orange-honey marmelade was appealing in a generically sweet way. But the best of the three I tried was the bartender's recommendation, the Blood Orange Jalapeno Margarita ($12), with a house tequila that marinates in jalapeno peppers for about two weeks. The menu, as noted, is entirely tapas-style: \"Rather than offering individual starters and main courses, The Stanton Social serves dishes that are designed for sharing and are brought to the table steadily and continuously throughout the meal.\" Awarding one star in the Times, Frank Bruni commended chef Chris Santos's \"determination to find readily divisible finger food where no chef has found it before.\" Our server advised 5-6 dishes as being about right for two people. That was pretty reasonable advice. We chose five (out of a menu offering nearly fifty), including all three that she recommended. While we waited for our food, the kitchen brought out crisp bread with chipotle garlic butter (above right). We would easily have eaten more than one slice apiece, had there been more. Duck Confit Empanadas and Potato & Goat Cheese Pierogies (left); French Onion Soup Dumplings (right) It's safe to assume that the kitchen's greatest hits are mostly pre-assembled, as our first two plates came out after only five minutes or so. We loved Duck Confit Empanadas ($9), which had a nice tang, the blood orange dipping sauce offering a sweet-sour contrast. Potato and Goat Cheese Pierogies ($8) were less interesting, and my girlfriend (who's half-Polish) felt that these deep-fried dumpling-like creatures weren't pierogies at all. [Sorry about the washed-out photo.] We also wondered why, on a menu designed for sharing, the kitchen would send out three empanadas and three pierogies. Most of the parties at the Stanton Social are even numbers of people. Would it have been that hard to create dishes in twos or fours, rather than threes? French Onion Soup Dumplings ($11) admirably show off the chef's talent for going where sharable plates have never gone before. Served in an escargot dish, there are six dumplings, each on a skewer with its own crouton, a hot onion soup center, and Gruyère slathered on top. Even more admirably, there are six of them. Kobe Beef Sliders and Fries (left); Braised Short Rib Soft Tacos (right) Kobe Beef Sliders are one of the few dishes not designed for sharing: they're $7 apiece, and a wonderful tender gooey mess. The server recommended a bowl of fries ($6) to go with them. They were hot and not greasy, but over-salted. Beef Short Rib Soft Tacos ($19) weren't very flavorful, and seemed somewhat \"flat\" compared to everything else we tasted. Once again, there were three of them-an odd design in more ways than one. Tapas-style restaurants usually send out plates when the kitchen is ready, no matter what the customer may want. I don't know if we got lucky, or if the Stanton Social is more enlightened, but the pace of our meal was just about right. Plates were delivered, cleared, and delivered anew on schedule, without us having to deal with mountains of food we weren't ready to eat. Of course, that \"schedule\" needs to be construed in the terms of a restaurant designed to turn over the tables quickly, and where no food item is meant to be lingered over: we were in and out in under 75 minutes. Given the din of the sound system, we weren't eager to spend any more time there than necessary. Although we snagged a 7:00 p.m. table, no one should conclude that the Stanton Social is losing its popularity: the place was packed. The small-plates format is still a winning one, and there are many clever choices to tempt you. If one or two are less successful, you'll still have several others to enjoy. A larger group could very well try most of the menu. We weren't quite impressed enough, however, to endure again the crowds, the noise, and the difficulty of getting a reservation.

Yesterday, Frank Bruni awarded the expected three stars to Le Cirque. Even so, he made no attempt to conceal his disdain for the classic luxury that this restaurant has always represented:At Le Cirque you will indeed eat too much food...at a sometimes ludicrous expense.But that has long been the way of certain restaurants, which exist to be absurd, to speak not to our better angels but to our inner Trumps, making us feel pampered and reckless and even a little omnipotent, if only for two hours and three courses with a coda of petits fours.And while I'm not calling for the spread of these establishments..., I'm charged with noting when one of them fulfills its chosen mission with classic panache. Le Cirque now does.Has a NYT critic ever called a restaurant \"absurd\", noting he's not keen to see any more like it, while awarding three stars?What's absurd is that Frank Bruni would describe the restaurant in those terms, when all Le Cirque is doing is what it has always done, which in the past the Times has considered a three or four-star experience. The only thing that has changed is the critic.Both Eater and New York Journal considered the trifecta a sure thing this week. We both win just $1 on our hypothetical bets.

Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni re-reviews one of the city's few remaining grand dames of French glory, Le Cirque. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 9-1 One Star: 8-1 Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: EVEN √√Four Stars: 25,000-1 The Skinny: Our view is the same as Eater's: any outcome except three stars would be extremely surprising. Let's roll out the BruniTrends®:This is the fourth time Bruni has re-visited one of his own past reviews-his first review of Le Cirque was just over eighteen months ago. In each prior case (Eleven Madison Park, Craftsteak, Alto), the result was an upgrade. Indeed, most of Bruni's re-reviews-even when the prior review was by another critic-have resulted in a change of rating.No one has suggested that Le Cirque has gotten worse over the last eighteen months, and there is quite a bit of evidence that it has gotten better. As Adam Platt noted in his year-end round-up for New York, \"perhaps the most impressive kitchen overhaul of all has taken place at Le Cirque, where Sirio Maccioni's latest chef, Christophe Bellanca, has expanded the pricey, formerly stolid menu to include a whole variety of sophisticated, radically pricey new treats.\"We also rated Le Cirque three stars when we visited late last year.If this review turns out as we are predicting, other BruniTrends® will need to be re-calibrated. In over 3½ years on the job, Bruni has never yet awarded three or four stars to a classically luxurious French restaurant, unless he was re-affirming (or reducing) a prior critic's rating. One could safely have assumed that it was not a format that interested him. After tomorrow, we may no longer be able to make such assumptions.To the best of my recollection, this is the first time Eater has set even-money odds on any outcome, and I believe it is also the largest gap between the most likely and second-most likely outcomes. There are good reasons for this: everything points to three stars this week.The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Le Cirque.

Note: This is a review of Veritas under chef Ed Cotton, who left the restaurant in May 2008. His replacement is Gregery Pugin, formerly the executive sous-chef at L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon. Ten years ago, Park. B. Smith figured out that if he opened one bottle a day from his massive wine collection, it would take 119 years to drink it all. It was that scary thought that led him to open Veritas, the lovely 65-seat wine-themed restaurant in the Flatiron District. Acclaim came quickly, with a three-star rating from Ruth Reichl in the Times, and much later a Michelin star. Veritas has hummed along quietly, less publicized than showier restaurants, but still doing a brisk business. In October, founding chef Scott Bryan left suddenly, \"with no destination decided.\" Ed Cotton, who was to have opened Bar Boulud for Daniel Boulud, replaced him. As it was a decade ago, wine is the story at Veritas. Even then-when it was far less common-Veritas' wine list was available online. It is divided into two sections, a smaller and less expensive \"market list,\" and the longer \"reserve list.\" The large volume is one of the heftiest in New York; you could get lost in it for hours. There are bottles under $60 and bottles over $10,000. We chose the 1998 Le Crau de ma Mère ($115) from the reserve list. It's a Châteauneuf-du-Pape, Park B. Smith's favorite French wine. While we were ordering, we couldn't help overhearing the spectacle at the next table. An elderly solo diner was presented with his bill, $999, which had to have been mostly wine. And the bottle on his table, which must have cost $800, was still half full. The gentleman, clearly a Veritas regular, left without settling his bill (he was short of cash), telling the staff that he would be back for dinner the next evening. The wine he left over was, we are sure, shared and enjoyed by the restaurant staff. The menu is $82 prix fixe, with tasting menus available at $110 (five-course) or $135 (seven-course). There are ten appetizers, eight entrees, and six desserts. The amuse-bouche (above left) was house-cured salmon with a small vegetable medley. My girlfriend and I both started with the Wild Game Bolognese (above right) with butternut squash, wild chestnuts, and house-made cavatelli. I enjoyed the Red Wine Braised Short-Ribs (above left), though they were slightly stringy. My girlfriend adored the Slow Baked Loch Duart Salmon (above right). Finally, there was a terrific Banana Cream Tart (above left), while my girlfriend had the Chocolate Caramel Torte (above right). Petits-fours Service was smooth, alert, friendly and professional. Our wine was, of course, decanted for us, a practice that too many fine restaurants have abandoned. The cuisine at Veritas might be described as safe and traditional, but everything we tried was beautifully assembled, impeccably prepared, and just complex enough to be interesting. The wine's the show at Veritas, but it's served in a serene setting, with food more than good enough to deserve admiration and praise.

In tomorrow's Times, Frank Bruni awards one star to Ilili:In addition to its considerable charms, intermittent disappointments and svelte-letter palindrome of a name, the new restaurant Ilili presents a case study: how do you try to turn a medium-profile cuisine into a big-time event? The answer isn't revelatory to anyone who's been foraging in trendy, splashy New York restaurants in recent years.You throw foie gras at the problem. Raw tuna, too. You write a menu that permits diners to build a nibble-of-this, nibble-of-that meal from a lengthy succession of small plates. You add pulsing music and lavish decor.For what it's worth, this review may have set a record for the earliest posting in the Bruni era: it was on the Times website before 6:00 p.m., about 3-4 hours earlier than usual.After a three-week losing streak, we decided to throw out all the BruniTrends®, and just went with our gut. As a result, the streak ends: we win $2, while Eater has now lost two in a row.

Note: Click here for a full review of Adour.Adour Alain Ducasse at the St. Regis opened this evening. I stopped in for a drink at the bar, where another patron informed me I was the sixth customer.The electronic menus have received most of the press. You find your wine by navigating a touch screen that displays on the surface of the bar, projected from above. To get to Burgundy reds, for instance, you'd tap \"Wines,\" then \"Red,\" then \"France,\" then \"Burgundy,\" and then you can scroll down the list. For any given wine, you can retrieve tasting notes, producer history, and so forth.It sounds good in theory, but the mechanism is finicky. If your touch is off by even a little, the mechanism misbehaves. After a while, I just gave up, and I noticed that others were frustrated too. I don't think bar patrons-even at a high-class bar like this one-want to learn a new technology just to order a glass of wine. Within six months, I suspect they'll be back to traditional paper and ink.Selections by the glass were ample, and I enjoyed a wonderful Southern Rhone blend for $13, along with a cup of Yuzu Sorbet for just $4. If you're thinking that those don't sound like Ducasse prices, you'd be right.There are about a dozen bar snacks, ranging from $9-16. It's a remarkable selection at a bar that seats only four, and the guys next to me loved everything they tried. One of them was so taken with the Yuzu Sorbet that he asked the manager if the restaurant could supply a quantity for his Super Bowl party. (The manager replied that he was not sure the pastry chef could have quite enough of it made by Sunday.)In the main restaurant, there are nine appetizers priced from $17-29, ten entrees at $32-49, and six desserts at $14. The cheese course is $22, and the five-course tasting menu is $110. Though clearly not bargain-priced, this is still a good deal less than the predecessor restaurant at the Essex House, where the prix fixe was $150 and the tasting menu $225.I'm looking forward to dining there in two weeks' time.Adour Alain Ducasse (2 E. 55th Street at Fifth Avenue in the St. Regis Hotel, East Midtown)

The Florida Primary

***CONTENT
Tomorrow, Florida holds its presidential primary.The Republican race is hotly contested, with John McCain and Mitt Romney running neck-and-neck in the polls. Although Romney actually has more delegates up to this point, McCain is the front-runner nationally. If McCain wins in Florida, his momentum going into Super Tuesday, a week from tomorrow, would be all-but insurmountable. If Romney wins, we will still have a race.Regardless of the outcome, I think tomorrow is the end for Rudy Giuliani's presidential campaign. Florida was supposed to be his \"firewall\". But having not only lost, but badly lost, in the first six states, he surrendered whatever advantage may have had. He now trails the front-runners, not only in Florida, but everywhere else.The Democratic contest in Florida is technically uncontested. The national party stripped Florida of its delegates, after the state scheduled its primary a week earlier than the official rules allowed. That strikes me as a short-sighted strategy. The Democrats need Florida. It is one of the few states \"red\" states that the Democrats have a realistic chance of winning in November. (Some people call it a \"purple\" state.)Nevertheless, Hillary Clinton is on the ballot and is expected to win, just as she did in Michigan, the other state penalized by the national Democratic party. In all likelihood, these two states' delegates will wind up getting seated at the convention. I just can't see the Democrats freezing out their most passionate supporters in two battleground states.Whatever happens in Florida, the Democratic race is still wide open. Hillary Clinton has a wide lead in delegates over Barack Obama, and she leads the polls in most of the Super Tuesday states. It will be interesting to see if the endorsement of Senator Edward M. Kennedy, which Obama captured today, will make a difference. Historically, endorsements seldom matter very much, but Kennedy is obviously in a category unto himself.It's worth considering the different opportunities and problems the two leading Democrats would have in November.Almost 100% of voting Americans have heard of Hillary Clinton, and know what they think of her. And a pretty high percentage of them (about 48%) don't like her, and cannot be persuaded to like her, no matter what she may say or do.That doesn't mean the remaining 52% will vote for her. It only means they're \"persuadable\". But when you start with a ceiling of 52%, there isn't much room for error. I mean, both Al Gore and John Kerry started with a higher ceiling than 52%, but they ended up with less than that. This is because some people who are willing to consider voting for you, end up not voting for you, not because they don't like you, but because they like the other guy better. Or because they just stay home.So for Hillary to win in November, she needs to hold onto that last 2.1% that will get her over the hump. And historically, that's tough to pull off. In electoral college terms, she needs to win every state that John Kerry won, and pull away at least a couple of states from the Republican camp. There are only 3 or 4 states where she has even a chance of that, and it is only a chance.Obama starts out with a much higher ceiling, because there are very few people who actually say they don't like him. Even the staunchest Republicans - those who have never voted for a Democrat in their lives, and won't vote for Obama - at least say that he's a likable guy.So that means that most Independents - the people who actually settle a presidential race - will at least consider him. So whereas Hillary starts with a ceiling of something like 52%, Obama starts with a ceiling more like 60-65%. Mind you, he wouldn't get 60-65%, or anything close to it. As in any election, some percentage of those folks would eventually choose the other guy. But the point is they're available to be persuaded, and for Hillary they're not.The problem for Obama is the thinness of his record. The most that his supporters can say, is that he stands for \"change\" in some vague way. But what kind of change is it? Most voters don't know. As his background and his proposals start to get better known, uncomfortable truths could seep out. So whereas Obama has a higher ceiling, he has a lower floor. The bottom could really drop out if there are skeletons lurking in his record.In contrast, we already know Hillary's skeletons. After her 20 years in the public eye, it's doubtful we'll find out anything worse about her than what is already known. So with Hillary, the worst that happens is that she loses a little worse than Kerry and Gore did, and the best that happens is that she ekes out a narrow victory. With Obama, almost anything is possible.

Note: This is a review of Bobo under chef Jered Stafford-Hill, who has since left. His replacement is Patrick Connolly. Click here for a more recent review. Tenth Street in the West Village is quickly turning into a new Restaurant Row, with p*ong and Bar Blanc, and now Bobo, which opened in September, within steps of each other. Things didn't exactly start out well for Bobo. There was a Ducasse-trained chef, Nicolas Cantrel, in the kitchen, but Bobo was panned. The Restaurant Girl said that \"Bobo...is a no-no.\" Gotham Gal didn't like it either. Cantrel left in December. It was described as an amicable parting, but something is amiss when the chef leaves after less than two months. Rick Jakobson and Jared Stafford-Hill were brought in to revamp the kitchen, though as of last Friday the menu still seemed to be basically the same as Cantrel was serving. Despite the early hiccups, we thought we'd give Bobo a try. If Bobo can settle down, it could easily become one of the most romantic spots in town. It has the loveliest dining room we have seen in a very long time. The name, derived from bourgeois bohemian is admittedly a bit precious, and so is the concept: ...inspired by European dinner parties, celebrating the shared experience of dining with family and friends in a warm setting. So that, even at 5 o'clock in the morning, your guests haven't even considered leaving. But Bobo really grows on you. The food isn't consistent enough yet, but perhaps it's getting there. I started with a wonderful spaghetti appetizer (above left), and a codfish entree (above right) was first-rate. My girlfriend found the foie gras terrine satisfactory, but Chicken Grand-Mère-a holdover from the Cantrel era-was slightly overcooked, as indeed other critics had found it. There are several enjoyable house cocktails: I especially liked Bobo's Mead (Plymouth gin, Lime, Lavender-infused honey). The staff transferred the bar tab to our table, as all decent restaurants should, but alas, many do not. We were also pleased to see a real choice of decent red wines below $50. Service was just fine, aside from slightly stale bread rolls. Bobo is a restaurant you want to root for. The early negative press doesn't seem to have hurt very much, as the space was close to full on a Friday evening. I look forward to visiting again after the new chefs have their own menu in place.

Momofuku Ssäm Bar

***CONTENT
Is it possible to be more hyped than David Chang? Where should we start? In 2007, he was the James Beard Rising Star Chef of the Year. Both Bon Appetit and GQ named him Chef of the Year. Frank Bruni awarded two stars to Momofuku Ssäm Bar, then named it Best New Restaurant of 2007, despite the little detail that it opened in 2006.On eGullet.com, a crowd of adoring admirers has all-but canonized him. They said that Ssäm Bar was at the vanguard of a \"New Paradigm\" of \"haute cheap\" restaurant dining. Discussion board regulars criticised me, not because I disliked Momofuku Ssäm Bar (which I don't) but because I failed to exhibit the required paroxysm of rapture. In truth, on two previous visits I found the food at Ssäm Bar very good indeed, though the ambiance leaves a lot to be desired.That's the backdrop to the very generous offer I received last week from eGullet regular Nathan, to join him for a Bo Ssäm, the one remaining item at Momofuku Ssäm Bar that I was really dying to try.The Bo Ssäm is a 10-pound Berkshire pork butt (the shoulder, actually), braised for seven hours. Ssäm Bar serves two of them a night. A Bo Ssäm pre-order is the only way to get a reservation-6:00 p.m. or 10:00 p.m. (11:00 on weekends). It requires a big group, which I'm not quite enterprising enough to put together myself, so I was grateful that Nathan did all of the organizing: he's so fond of the Bo Ssäm that this is the third time he's ordered it. And he'll probably do it again.Current Menu (click to expand)Prices at Momofuku Ssäm Bar are gradually inching upward, with many items a dollar or two higher than they were last year. The Bo Ssäm, which was $165 just fifteen months ago, is now $200. There are now two tasting menus ($45 and $75). The wine list has expanded a bit, though I don't find any of the choices particularly impressive, and most bottles are over $50. Nathan ordered the appetizers, and our party of nine was able to sample a good deal of the Ssäm Bar menu. Diver Sea Scallops - lychee, yuzu, watercress (left); Seasonal Pickles (right)We started with Diver Sea Scallops ($16), which I enjoyed, although Ssäm Bar regulars said that an earlier version of the dish was better. Seasonal Pickles ($10) offer plenty of taste contrasts. Fuji Apple Kimchi - Burgers' smoked jowl, maple labne, arugula (left); Steamed Pork Buns (right)Fuji Apple Kimchi ($13) is one of the regulars' current favorites, and it can't be denied that the apple and bacon combination works beautifully. Steamed Buns ($10) with juicy pork belly is a dish that can't miss. Fried Brussels Sprouts - chilies, mint, fish sauce (left); Spicy Tripe Salad - poached egg, frisee (right)I remembered the Fried Brussels Sprouts ($12) from my first visit. They're terrific, so it's no surprise they've remained on the menu. I was not especially fond of the Spicy Tripe Salad ($15). Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes - Chinese broccoli, crispy shallots (left); Grilled Veal Sweetbreads (right)I don't have a particular recollection of Spicy Pork Sausage & Rice Cakes ($18), but I loved Grilled Veal Sweetbreads ($15)-usually, they're served fried, breaded or sauteed, but when simply grilled they stand up beautifully on their own. Santa Barbara Sea Urchin - tapioca, whipped tofu, scallions (left); One dozen oysters (right)The Santa Barbara Sea Urchin ($16) with tapioca and whipped tofu is a much celebrated dish. I certainly respect the creativity that went into it, but I wasn't all that enamored with it.At this point, I felt like I'd already had a full meal, and the pièce de resistance (accompanied by a dozen oysters), hadn't even been served yet.The Bo Ssäm in all its GloryThe Bo Ssäm could almost be called liquid pork: it is braised to a point of such tenderness that the meat practically collapses at the touch. It comes with leaves of lettuce; you are supposed to put the pork inside, add sauce, wrap it up, and eat it like a burrito-that's what the \"Ssäm\" in the restuarant's name actually means. I tried this once, but from then on I was content to just eat the pork itself. It is so luscious that one can hardly be bothered to interrupt the appointed journey from plate to mouth. This must be one of the top ten dishes in New York. Cheddar Shortcake - apples, ham cream (left); Hazelnut Torte - parsnip buttercream, grapefruit (right)Desserts, which could so easily be an afterthought at such a restaurant, were first-rate. I especially liked the Amish Cheddar Shortcake ($9), with an almost wickedly clever \"ham cream.\" Hazelnut Torte ($9) wasn't bad either.With nine certified foodies at the table, it's no surprise that the State of the Momofuku Empire was a topic of conversation. One of my companions admitted that he had expected to see Momofuku clones springing up; so far, it hasn't happened. My own view is that Ssäm Bar is sui generis. Impressive as the food may be, it lacks almost every other amenity that a good restaurant should have-a place to hang up your coat, for instance. As prices continue to rise, and Chang is distracted by other projects, I wonder if Ssäm Bar's charms may start to fade as diners come to grips with its limitations.There are signs that Chang's act is starting to wear a little thin. Over on Grub Street, Cutlets suggested that Chang, \"earnest and talented as he is...needs to be reassessed.\" Over on Eater.com, a contributor complained that the very dish that Momofuku Ssäm Bar was named for-the $10 Momofuku Ssäm-is no longer offered at dinner.What on earth is Chang up to? Another of my dining companions, a Ssäm Bar regular, conceded that \"I've never seen him here.\" Two weeks ago, Chang announced that \"it's clear some of us need to step aside and let the real talent shine,\" naming new chef-partners for his two current East Village restaurants, as well as the still-unopened Momofuku Ko.You have to wonder if all of the accolades are going to his head. If Thomas Keller-who has more restaurants than Chang-is in the kitchen at The French Laundry on most evenings, then why is Chang \"stepping off to work on new restaurant projects\" when, less than two years ago, all he had was a noodle bar? As Cutlets notes, \"Ko will have to be phenomenal (and, let's be honest, it very well could be) to shield him from what could be some backlash against the flood of praise bestowed upon the young chef in the past year.\"I don't think Chang is the certified genius that some people say, but you have to give him credit for the remarkable phenomenon that is Momofuku Ssäm Bar. No one knows where it will go from here, but it certainly won't be boring.Momofuku Ssäm Bar (207 Second Avenue at 13th Street, East Village)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: Burrito BarOverall: **

Note: Click here for more visits to Keens Steakhouse. My girlfriend, son and I had a pre-theater dinner at Keens Steakhouse last week. I ordered the incomparable Mutton Chop ($45.00), which I think is the best item on the menu. My girlfriend had the sirloin (43.50), which wasn't quite as tender it should be. Keens is one of the few NYC steakhouses that offers prime rib. The only option shown on the dinner menu is a so-called King's Cut ($49.50). The perceptive server guessed that a twelve-year-old probably wasn't going to finish such a massive portion, so he offered us the English Cut ($28.00), normally served only in the downstairs \"pub\". Fries ($8.00) could easily become addictive. We didn't order a bottle of wine, but a glass of the respectable house cabernet was a remarkably cheap $8.50. While the time-warp ambiance at Keens is matchless, its steaks are a notch below other places in town while being several dollars more expensive. The huge two-story space is built for volume, and servers aren't as attentive as they should be. But for the mutton chop or the prime rib, Keens is always worth the occasional visit.

Source: Eater Lime Thai Bistro & Lounge is a recent arrival in the lower West Village, though it is apparently a modest makeover of an earlier Thai restaurant called Hurapan Kitchen. Despite the attention-grabbing orange sign, the new version doesn't yet have much of a following on this desolate stretch of Seventh Avenue: we had the place practically to ourselves. That's a shame, as we found the food food clever, terrific, and blissfully inexpensive. Lobster and Shrimp Shumai ($9; above left) in a mustard-butter sauce were flawless. My friend Kelly enjoyed the Chicken Tom Yum soup ($5; above right). I don't recall much about the Peking Duck Wrap ($11; above left), except that we liked it. Kelly raved about the Spicy Drunken Noodle with Duck ($8.95; above right), a concoction of fresh basil, white onion, tomato, carrot, and Thai hot sauce. I was mightily impressed with Marinated Skirt Steak ($19; above), which was beautifully prepared, not at all greasy, and a better quality of beef than I would have expected at this price. The chili dipping sauce added a nice kick, but wasn't overly hot. The decor is functional but rather charmless. Service was prompt and efficient.

Kalina via Eater Note 2: Bar Blanc closed on April 6, 2009, re-opening shortly thereafter as Bar Blanc Bistro. The all-blanc decor was toned down, and so was the menu. Note: This is a review of Bar Blanc under chef Cesar Ramirez, who has left (as of July 2008) and will be replaced by Sebastiaan Zijp, formerly of Bouley Upstairs. Bar Blanc is the brainchild of three Bouley alums, with executive chef Cesar Ramirez at the helm. The very blanc interior is sleek and easy on the eyes. Open since early December, reviewers so far (Andrea Strong, Tables for Two, Gourmet) have found the service clumsy, but the ambitious food promising. We had no issues with the service, though our 6:15 p.m. reservation was well before the masses arrived. We started with a cocktail, and the bar tab was transferred to our table without complaint-something you can never take for granted these days. The focused menu has just four appetizers ($12-18), three pastas ($20-24), six meat and fish entrees ($24-36), three sides ($8) and four desserts ($10). These prices won't be sustainable unless Bar Blanc can become more than just a neighborhood place. The wine list, too, is extravagantly priced. I ordered a Palmer Vineyards Cabernet Franc ($34). Kudos to Bar Blanc for stocking a Lond Island wine and serving it at the correct temperature, but that shouldn't be the only red under $50. The server tried to upsell us to a tasting menu ($75), and he was also pushing the side dishes, but we both ordered just an appetizer and an entree, which was plenty. The amuse-bouche was a small puff pastry stuffed with goat cheese. Slow Roasted Rabbit and Sweetbread Salad (left); Milk Fed Porcelet (right) Coincidentally, our sights landed on the identical choices. Slow Roasted Rabbit and Sweetbread Salad ($14) isn't much of a salad at all, but it's wonderful nonetheless, with a ricotta puree nicely balancing the two contrasting meats. The menu description of Milk Fed Porcelet ($32) is practically essay-length. There is roast baby pig, pig head terrine, pig belly, chanterelles puree, diced Brussells sprouts, and a jus of cinnamon, star anise, and orange. That's probably twice as much as it needed, as most of those ingredients were undetectable. The roasted pig was stringy and tasted like bitter ham. The belly was enjoyable, as pure fat tends to be. It is still early days for Bar Blanc, and with this much talent in the kitchen I suspect there is much more to enjoy here. Though our entree was a dud, the restaurant nevertheless looks promising.

Yesterday, as the world yawned, Frank Bruni issued a one-star mini-smackdown to Mesa Grill:Mesa Grill, no question, has considerable charms. You can't mix this many creative margaritas, put this much vivid color into the decor and the food, and tap this wide a variety of chilies without summoning a festive spirit...But on balance Mesa Grill presents only flickers of the excitement it did in 1991, when it opened, or in 2000, when William Grimes gave it two stars in The Times. It's an overly familiar, somewhat tired production. More to the point, it's an inconsistent one.Flay could have responded by spending more time at the restaurant. Instead, he fired the GM, which seems a bit silly. He couldn't have been screwing up that badly, as the restaurant is still packed. The review is history, and Bruni's successor won't be back for another decade.We lose for the third week in a row...but this time Eater loses too. We're both $1 poorer.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Bobby Flay's Southwestern standard, Mesa Grill. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 3-1 √√ One Star: 2-1 Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: 75-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: The Times has reviewed Mesa Grill twice, with Bryan Miller awarding two stars shortly after it opened (March 1991), and William Grimes re-affirming that rating nine years later (May 2000). Re-reviews are a waste of space unless something has changed in the intervening years. No one would suggest that Mesa Grill is a three-star restaurant, so that means the only likely outcomes are one star or zero.I don't have strong feelings about Mesa Grill. I dined there only once, about two years ago. I didn't blog about it, but my thoughts at the time were: nothing special, but not bad. I suppose that I would have awarded one star.But Mesa Grill is truly irrelevant nowadays. You can tell how bored Bruni is, when he can find nothing more interesting to write about. Bruni is always looking over his shoulder to see what other people are doing, and I doubt any of his pals frequent Mesa Grill. If Bruni thinks its worth wasting a review for a smackdown, he's probably going to smack it hard.The Bet: We'll try to break our two-week losing streak with a zero-star bet on Mesa Grill.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill, the latest chain restaurant to invade the mall at Columbus Circle-it's actually across the street, but that's beside the point. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 5-1 One Star: 2-1 Two Stars: 3-1 √√ Three Stars: 50-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: In our view, all the BruniTrends® point to one star. Like most people, Bruni has been fairly cynical about the Columbus Circle restaurants. (His reviews of Masa and Per Se were raves, but those for V Steakhouse, Cafe Gray, Porter House, and Landmarc were anything but.)On top of that, critical response to the latest Blue Ribbon has been muted-I gave it one star-and Bruni seldom bucks consensus. Bruni isn't fond of restaurants with overly long menus, and at 168 items Blue Ribbon's is as long as they come. Bruni has never been fond of chain restaurants. This Blue Ribbon is much larger than the others, and the restaurant will probably suffer for it.I also think that sushi restaurants of approximately this quality (or better) are a commodity in New York, and a restaurant needs to be a lot more intriguing than this to warrant two stars. It certainly isn't cheap enough to warrant two stars on price alone. That's just my view, but I believe Frank Bruni would say the same.Eater does make an intriguing point: it seems a little pointless to waste a review on the 8th Blue Ribbon restaurant \"if it's just going to be for a single star.\" But it seemed a little pointless last week to review Barbuto, when it hasn't changed since the last review, and the only seriously recommendable dish is the chicken. Signor Bruni did just that. The fact is that we're in a rather slow season for new restaurants, but Bruni still needs to find something to review every week.The Bet: For the second week in a review, we disagree with Eater, and bet that Frank Bruni will award one star to Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill.

From a previous visit, I recalled the relatively quiet atmosphere with widely spaced tables, which I thought would be conducive to a family conversation. I didn't expect it to be quite this quiet: on a Saturday evening, it was practically dead when we arrived shortly before 6:00. It livened up a bit-but only a bit-by the time we left.At $37.95, the steaks here are priced slightly below the NYC average. We found two hefty fillet mignons, a Kansas City strip, and a humongous rib steak, all top-notch, along with asparagus ($10.50) and mashed potatoes ($8.95). Two especially thick strips of Canadian bacon ($5) were wonderful. I was also pleased to find a good Côtes du Rhône for $45, which by steakhouse standards is not bad at all.In short, everything at Staghorn Steakhouse was more impressive than last time. I am not sure which visit was more typical. Staghorn Steakhouse (315 W. 36th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Kalina Note: Click here for a more recent visit to BLT Market. We last visited BLT Market on opening week, finding it promising but not yet polished. Since then, the reviews are in, most of them favorable (Platt, Cuozzo, Lane, Tables for Two). Frank Bruni issued a peculiar dissent, relegating the restaurant to Dining Briefs (i.e., not a full review). He found much of the food very good, but called chef Laurent Tourondel \"a slacker\" for opening \"assiduously promoted, trend-conscious restaurants\" instead of making the \"real impact on the city's dining scene\" that he's capable of. I agree with Bruni to an extent. My meals at the BLT restaurant brood have generally been very good (with a few odd lapses), but you always feel you're getting something less than Tourondel's best effort. With his large restaurant family now numbering fifteen, he cannot be spending much time at any one of them. Nevertheless, you'll pass a happy time at Tourondel's latest New York restaurant, BLT Market, though you won't get out cheaply. On a recent visit, Amish Chicken ($30) was among the less expensive entrees. Rock shrimp risotto ($36) and a pork chop ($38) were both wonderful, but no one would call them bargains at a restaurant this informal. Cocktails at the bar (technically part of the hotel, not the restaurant) were staggering: $16 for a Whisky Sour, $17 for a Negroni. The menu has been expanded to include separately-orderable side dishes that it lacked before-always a sure way to plump up the bill (though we didn't bite). At all the BLT restaurants, the menus are printed on thin, cheap paper with a half-life that couldn't be more than a day or so. So why are the specials printed on a separate sheet of paper, of which we were given only one copy? Surely a restaurant so expensive could get this right. We were on our way to a show, so I was pleased to find that they got us out in an hour without rushing. The amuse-bouche was the same pigs-in-a-blanket as before, but more enjoyable this time. The garlic bread is still superb. BLT Market (1430 Sixth Avenue at Central Park South, in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel, West Midtown) Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Le Cirque

Kalina via Eater Note: This is a review of Le Cirque under Chef Christophe Bellanca, who left the restaurant in October 2008. His replacement is Craig Hopson of One If By Land, Two If By Sea, and before that, Picholine. Owner Mauro Maccioni wants \"a great chef, someone who will get us three Michelin stars.\" Picholine earned two Michelin stars during Hopson's tenure there as chef de cuisine, so Le Cirque could be on the right track, but it has a tall hill to climb. Le Cirque currently has zero Michelin stars. Le Cirque is one of the few remaining bastions of classic old-French luxury in New York. Now in its third location, it was at various times a three or four-star restaurant, but critics hammered it when the current version opened in 2006. Frank Bruni and Adam Platt both returned two-star verdicts, which for this type of restaurant is equivalent to condemnation. Much beloved of celebrities and the monied set, Le Cirque didn't need Frank Bruni's blessing. Owner Siro Maccioni could simply have shrugged, as the owners of the Four Seasons apparently did after a similar Bruni smackdown. Instead, he went to work. He fired chef Pierre Schaedelin, bringing in Christophe Bellanca to replace him. The review cycle is over, so Le Cirque is stuck with its two stars for now. But at least Adam Platt recognized the improvement in his 2007 year-end retrospective: But perhaps the most impressive kitchen overhaul of all has taken place at Le Cirque, where Sirio Maccioni's latest chef, Christophe Bellanca, has expanded the pricey, formerly stolid menu to include a whole variety of sophisticated, radically pricey new treats. The grandly impersonal room underneath the Bloomberg tower remains filled with the usual collection of grimly smiling contessas and aging plutocrats tottering to and fro in their pin-striped suits. But when I dropped in not very long ago, there were an impressive nine specials of the day on the menu, along with all sorts of newfangled entrees: dim-sum-size ravioli swollen with foie gras, carefully deboned portions of squab crusted with crushed walnuts, and ribbons of chestnut-flavored pappardelle decked with braised pheasant, which the plutocrats merrily supplemented one night (for a $185 fee) with shavings of white truffle shipped direct, via Maccioni's fabled connection, from the hills of Alba. (I don't quite understand why, if he thinks the improvement is that significant, Platt does not also upgrade his two-star rating, but I'll save that rant for another post.) The bifurcated service at Le Cirque-one level for celebrities, another for the rest of us-is the stuff of legend. Upon her arrival in New York, Times critic Ruth Reichl was famously treated like dirt. Everything changed once Maccioni figured out who she was: \"The King of Spain is waiting in the bar, but your table is ready.\" Reichl demoted the restaurant to three stars. In the 2006 update, Frank Bruni encountered much the same attitude that Reichl did. So did the Amateur Gourmet, who wrote about his experience in a post called \"Only a Jerk Would Eat at Le Cirque.\" Perhaps Maccioni has finally learned his lesson. When I visited with a friend for a year-end dinner, we saw no evidence of second-class service. Our table was ready immediately, and we weren't seated in Siberia. Service was friendly and polished, but the large, busy space is not geared to long, quiet meals. I didn't note the exact timing, but I felt that the multi-course tasting menu went by a tad quickly. The clientele was a broad mix of young and old. We didn't notice any celebrities, but a couple of middle-aged men were with lavishly dressed women who appeared to be a good deal younger than they. You can fill in the possibilities for yourself. For a variety of reasons, it took me a month to get around to writing this blog post, and I'm afraid my recollections have dimmed somewhat. We ordered the tasting menu, which in general was impressive, with only a couple of dull spots (which most tasting menus have). The food is shown below in photo-essay format.

Picholine

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Picholine. Picholine has redeemed itself. Two years ago, we were ripped off on New Year's Eve, spending $800 for two on a meal that might charitably have been worth a third of that. Last night, we spent $400 on an excellent meal that was worth every penny. I'm not the only one who thought the \"old\" Picholine needed some attitude adjustment. Before a September 2006 makeover, Frank Bruni chose Picholine for his sister's birthday, and it was so lackluster that he had to apologize. For the Times restaurant critic, not being able to find the right restaurant for a family celebration must have been acutely embarrassing. Post renovation, Bruni found it \"arguably the nicest restaurant surprise of this disappointing season,\" re-affirming the three-star rating two previous critics had awarded. The 2008 Michelin Guide upgraded Picholine to two stars, making it one of the city's top ten restaurants. The revamped decor has impressed no one except, perhaps, some Upper West Side dowagers. Even the china looks like something your grandmother would use. La Grenouille, a restaurant that is thirty years older, is far more lively. There is nothing the management can do about the narrow space, but when you enter you hit a traffic jam around the host station/bar/coat-check area, a drawback I recall from two previous visits. The aisles in the two dining rooms are narrow, and servers sometimes seem to be pirouetting around obstacles. Fortunately, there is nothing old-fashioned about chef Terrance Brennan's rejuvenated cuisine, which is reason enough why Picholine remains popular, and one of this town's toughest tables to book. Even with several weeks' notice, 8:45 p.m. was the earliest I could get on a Saturday evening, although we showed up at 8:20 and were seated immediately. (Picholine does a lot of pre- and post-Lincoln Center business; it was still more than half full when we left at almost 11:00.) With the best cheese selection in town (shared with sister restaurant Artisanal), the cheese course at Picholine is practically obligatory. It is therefore curious that the menu does nothing to alert you to this fact. If you choose either of the printed prix fixe options-three courses ($85) or four courses ($95)-it apparently does not include cheese. (Both of the tasting menus, at $110, do include cheese.) When we told the server we wanted an appetizer, an entree, and a cheese tasting, he offered us an option not shown on the menu-two courses for $65-and then we were charged separately the odd price of $33.50 for a six-cheese tasting. I am not sure how a first-time visitor would be expected to figure this out. And why is the menu still captioned \"Autumn 2007\"? The opening trio of amuses-bouches was slightly pedestrian. A codfish cake (9:00 in the photo) tasted like a smaller version of a cafeteria fish stick, and lobster salad (1:00 in the photo) didn't taste very lobster-y. A smooth mushroom panna cotta (5:00) was the best of the group. Chef Brennan loves his panna cottas. Sea urchin panna cotta (above left) with caviar had an ethereal silky texture. My girlfriend ordered the foie gras terrine (above right; $8 suppl.), which was on a par with the better examples of the genre around town. Heirloom Chicken \"Kiev\" - the quotation marks suggesting a riff on the classic dish - was a tour de force. It is still January, but for now this is the dish of the year. Brennan wraps chicken around chanterelles and foie gras, covers it in a cornflake batter and deep fries it, melting the foie gras. After the dish is brought to your table, a server lances the chicken with a silver spear, and the liquid foie gras oozes out. (The photo was taken after this surgery had been performed.) Frank Bruni loved it too. The frommagier brought the cheese cart to our table and gave us an overview. We told him our general preferences and asked him to choose six. There was not a weak selection among the group. As always, he handed us a printed cheese guide to take home, with the ones he'd selected for us identified by number. The meal ended with a broad selection of petits-fours. The wine list is long and expensive, so I decided to let the sommelier choose for us, giving him a ceiling of $100. He came up with a luscious burgundy at $95 that went perfectly with the chicken. We also accepted his offer of a taste of sauterne to go with my girlfriend's foie gras. We were charged only $10 for that, and he comped a white wine to go with my Sea Urchin appetizer. Our captain, a veteran no doubt of many dinner services, provided helpful ordering advice and stayed on top of things. Both the frommagier and sommelier followed up to ensure we were happy with our meal. The junior staff that served the bread and amuses-bouches were a little hard to understand-a problem at many New York restaurants, as these positions are often taken by non-native speakers. Although we were seated side-by-side at a table with ample space, the cramped quarters meant that servers had to reach awkwardly to set and clear the silverware. The space at Picholine will always seem twenty years too old, but the food, wine and cheese are the stars.

I love it when restauranteurs take a chance-bringing something truly new to New York, rather than just copying what everyone else is doing.But there is a line between risk-taking and recklessness, and I almost wonder if the owners of Ilili have crossed it. The massive 5,000-square-foot space accommodates 330 people in multiple bars and dining rooms on two levels. The high-rent neighborhood (Fifth Avenue between 27th and 28th Streets) is dead to evening foot traffic, and Lebanese cuisine has never been especially popular in New York.It won't be easy to keep all of those seats occupied. Shortly after it opened in late 2007, Steve Cuozzo of the Post filed a blistering review. They were apparently busy enough that they couldn't be bothered to give Cuozzo a walk-in table. The Sun's Paul Adams enjoyed himself, mainly because he didn't expect much.An Eater deathwatch may be premature, but on a Friday night in January we found it dead at 6:30 p.m., and only around half-full by the time we left, around 8:00. That's not good enough. The high-concept design didn't come cheap, and the owners surely have a huge investment to recoup.I haven't figured out what the name means, but it has attracted its share of ridicule. Eater.com readers voted it the worst name of Fall 2007, beating out Bobo, Kurve, and Say.Bread serviceThe menu is a mixture of small and medium-sized \"tapas-style\" plates in various categories, without the usual appetizer-entree distinction. There is no clue or suggestion about how much to order, which leaves the guest vulnerable to up-selling-which apparently has been a problem at Ilili. However, we must have had one of the more honest servers: when we chose four dishes to share (which turned out to be plenty), he didn't try to talk us into a fifth. Fried Brussels SproutsChef Philippe Massoud comes to New York from Washington, D.C., where he served Mediterranean fare at Nayla. The cuisine is nominally Lebanese, but alongside traditional dishes, like shish kebab and falafel, are ingredients probably not common in Beirut, like foie gras and Kobe beef. The bread service, which the server called an amuse-bouche, consisted of spicy thin crackers with olives. I loved the goat cheese yogurt spread, but the crackers were over-seasoned.Our server suggested fried Brussels sprouts ($12), with grapes, a fig puree, walnuts and mint. It is a justly popular dish, but as it came out almost instantly, I strongly suspect it was pre-made, and waiting under a heat lamp. The Brussels sprouts were not quite warm enough. Our remaining three dishes were delivered all at once. Manti, or Lebanese Pasta ($14; above left), was the best of the lot, with a nice balance of beef, lamb, mint, and yogurt. Mekanek, or Lamb Sausage ($13; above right) was lightly sauteed in olive oil and lemon, but it didn't have a very lamb-y taste. The Mixed Grill ($20) offered a Kafta (spiced ground beef with parsley and onion), chicken kebab and beef kebob. With thought it peculiar that the chicken and beef were sliced in threes, on a plate clearly designed for sharing. The beef kebab was the best in this grouping, as the cubes of meat were tender, rare, and not at all over-cooked.The wine list was over-priced in relation to the rest of the menu, with few bottles below $50. Several Lebanese wines are offered, but we weren't feeling that adventurous, so we settled on a Crozes-Hermitage right at $50.Service was generally competent. We appreciated the server's sensible ordering advice. But we weren't as happy to have dessert plates dropped suggestively on our table before we'd indicated whether we wanted any (which we didn't).If Ilili isn't quite hitting its stride, one can nevertheless put together an enjoyable meal here, and the prices (except for alcohol) are reasonable.Ilili (236 Fifth Avenue between 27th & 28th Streets, Flatiron District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Adour: Shame on Ed Levine
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2008-01-10 09:22:00
***CONTENT
In a post yesterday about Alain Ducasse's new restaurant Adour, food journalist Ed Levine asked, \"Does the World Need More Fancy-Pants French Restaurants?\"It's the hallmark of argumentative writing to ask a question, while at the same time leaving no doubt as to the answer. No one uses the phrase \"fancy-pants\" about something they like. (Frank Bruni's obsession with the word \"fussy\" is very much the same.) In the comments section, Levine said he was really looking for a word like \"stuffy,\" which isn't much of an improvement.It's no surprise that Levine isn't really comfortable with luxurious French restaurants. He made his name writing about humbler fare. When Levine dined at Per Se, Thomas Keller (in jest) served him a hot dog. But in phrasing the question as he did, Levine is asking, not merely whether Ducasse is offering what Ed Levine needs, but what the \"world\" needs. Those are two completely different things.It's lazy thinking to presume that one's own tastes are the same as everyone else's. Levine says, \"In New York people love the energized informality of Babbo or the Union Square Cafe or Craft. We love places that serve serious food in a way that makes us feel comfortable, relaxed, and well taken care of.\" Well, there are almost 18 million residents of the New York metro area, and they don't all love the same thing. I'll bet the vast majority of them haven't even heard of those restaurants.If you add the approximately 44 million tourists who visit New York City annually, that makes at least 62 million people who will eat dinner in New York at least one night this year. Do you think there might be enough of them who, unlike Levine, actually appreciate what Alain Ducasse has to offer?Levine thinks \"we need more restaurants with heart and soul,\" apparently having concluded that a Ducasse restaurant cannot qualify. Now, I'm sure Mario Batali (Babbo), Danny Meyer (Union Square Cafe) and Tom Colicchio (Craft) feel passionately about what they're doing, as does Ducasse. But all three of them are running huge restaurant conglomerates for profit, as does Ducasse.Ironically, New York has more of Levine's heart-and-soul restaurants than ever before, while not a single three or four-star restaurant opened last year. Yet, the demand for luxury restaurants remains intense. Just try booking a last-minute prime-time table at any of the city's high-end dining palaces. They are usually full. Obviously these places aren't for everybody, but with 20,000 other restaurants in New York, they don't need to be.And it's not as if we have glut of four-star restaurants. There are just five of them (per the Times), and the two most recent (Per Se and Masa) opened four years ago. All candidates since then have been found wanting, at least according to Frank Bruni. I don't know how much of a chance Adour will have, when a Francophobic critic like Bruni is doing the judging. But should restauranteurs stop trying?Places like Adour don't come along very often. Do you want a restaurant with rustic pleasures and menus sourced daily from the greenmarket and local farmers? There's practically a new one every month. But how many luxury French restaurants are there in New York? They can be counted on the fingers of one hand.I don't know whether Adour will be a great restaurant. No one can know that until the place opens. Based on my experience at its predecessor, Alain Ducasse at the Essex House, I am optimistic. From a critic of Levine's stature one expects a new venture, especially one that comes along this rarely, to be judged on its merits.

Kalina via EaterIn today's Diner's Journal, Frank Bruni reports that it's not easy to make a reservation at Daniel Boulud's latest restaurant, Bar Boulud. Not since Per Se, almost four years ago, has poor Frank had so much trouble reaching a human being. In Per Se's case, he waited. In Bar Boulud's case, he hung up in frustration after 15 minutes. [Update: The next day, he finally got through.]He should have tried just walking in, which a friend and I did yesterday. At 6:00 p.m., we were seated at the bar without a wait. Three doors down, Josephina was full. Go figure.Like most Michelin-starred chefs, Daniel Boulud isn't content to have just one restaurant, but he hasn't opened them as promiscuously as Jean-Georges Vongerichten or Alain Ducasse. Bar Boulud is his first New York opening in at least four years. The location across Broadway from Lincoln Center has long needed some more serious restaurants. I yawned when I heard that Bar Boulud was going to be focused on wine-who needs another wine bar? It turns out the real star is Sylvain Gasdon's charcuterie menu.Though yesterday was the official opening to the public, Boulud has been serving friends and family for a few weeks now. Grub Street responded with \"dumbstruck awe,\" adding that \"this kind of charcuterie has almost never been available in this profusion and variety in the United States.\" Ed Levine gushed, \"Simply put, Gasdon is making the best charcuterie Americans have ever seen and tasted on these shores.\" But he wondered, \"are Americans ready for this kind of food?\"If you sit at the bar, as we did, you'll have the massive terrines, pâtes and sausages right in front of you, a gorgeous sight incomparable to anything else in New York. If charcuterie isn't your cup of espresso, Bar Boulud also has a more conventional bistro menu that takes its cues from Boulud's native Lyon.We had actually come in only for drinks, but there was no way I could leave without tasting the charcuterie that refined meatheads like Cutlets and Levine are raving about. So I tried the Pâte Grand-mère ($8), made with chicken liver, pork and cognac. It was a nice hunk, half an inch thick, and about 3 inches by 5, with a dollop of spiced mustard on the side and two bowls of bread (with soft butter). I ignored the bread and just ate the pâte with my fork. It had a luscious buttery taste, the liver pungent but not overwhelming. There's much more where that came from, and I can't wait to return.The wine selection was disappointing. There were just four reds and four whites by the glass, far less than one expects at a purportedly wine-themed restaurant. Bar Boulud needs to do better-far better-than that. Servers were gracious, and the mise en place everything you'd expect in a Boulud restaurant, but the staff was too busy to pay us sufficient attention. We had trouble flagging down a server to order a second glass of wine, and we were there for about 45 minutes before they came with water glasses.It is too soon to the judge the service, as this was only Bar Boulud's first night. It will also take more than one pâte to reach a judgment on the food, but Bar Boulud certainly looks promising.Bar Boulud (1900 Broadway near 63rd Street, Upper West Side)

The Payoff: Barbuto

***CONTENT
Yesterday, I suggested that there were two possible reasons why Frank Bruni would review Barbuto. The first is that he thinks it has improved since Eric Asimov's review four years ago. The second is that he is bored. It turns out his reason was none of the above, in awarding one star:The chicken is Rule No. 1, No. 2 and No. 3 of eating at Barbuto. It's Rule No. 4 as well.Bruni was so transfixed by the chicken that he had hardly anything else to say. The rest of the food is just as uneven as Asimov originally said it was.

I think the REAL reason Bruni reviewed Barbuto is that it's apparently someplace he eats at recreationally all the time. That's actually not a bad reason, is it?

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni returns to his favorite pastime, Italian cuisine. The victim, er, beneficiary will be Jonathan Waxman's Meatpacking-adjacent Barbuto. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 50-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Barbuto received a mixed $25-and-under review from Eric Asimov in April 2004. Those were the days when that column regularly covered real restaurants, but even then I thought that Barbuto deserved a rated review. With entrees in the mid-twenties nowadays, Barbuto is squarely in Bruni's price range.Historically, most of Bruni's promotions from $25-and-under have received two stars (Freemans being the notorious counter-example). The rationale, I suppose, is that if a restaurant is merely average-which is the current de facto meaning of one star-it makes little sense to waste space on a place that has already been reviewed.Another Brunitrend® is that restaurants usually aren't re-reviewed unless there is something substantially new to say. If you take Asimov's review as the rough equivalent of one star (though Asimov never expressly said that), then two stars is a likely outcome, given that Barbuto is highly unlikely to get the goose egg.Bruni has been extremely kind to Italian restaurants-though there are a few notable exceptions. It also seems to be his default cuisine, which he reviews when he can't find anything else. That could mean that Barbuto is in line for a two-star bouquet, but it could also mean that Bruni is bored.The main argument for one star, as Eater notes, is that Barbuto is notoriously uneven. It also carries one star on this blog, for whatever that's worth.The Bet: We don't have a strong feeling about this one, but most of the Brunitrends® point to the higher rating, so we are betting that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Barbuto.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill.Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill has recently opened in the Thompson Hotel at 6 Columbus Circle. It's the latest in a chain of eight sushi houses, brasseries, and bakeries in Manhattan and Brooklyn.Blue Ribbon Sushi on Sullivan Streeet in SoHo is an intimate place, to which Ruth Reichl awarded two stars in 1998. It does not accept reservations. Eager beavers line up around the block for one of the few, coveted seats. Its late hours make it a beloved haunt for chefs all over town.But Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill is a cynical affair built to capitalize on the name, dressed for the big dance and tricked out in a slightly smaller version of the modern big-box Asian style.Ryan Sutton, reviewing for bloomberg.com, counted 168 items on the menu. Bravo for Sutton, as he saved me the trouble. All I know is that we were overwhelmed. My son and I each ordered a selection of rolls ($28; photo above), my girlfriend the sushi deluxe ($29.50). We found both dishes competently prepared, but underwhelming. \"Pedestrian\" was the word that came to mind. With 166 other choices remaining, who's to know whether this is typical? The choice of sakes was impressive, but expensive.The address is a tease, by the way: you'll search in vain for the hotel on Columbus Circle: it's actually on 58th Street, across from the mall, several doors down from the circle.Blue Ribbon Sushi Bar & Grill (308 W. 58th Street in the Thompson Hotel, 6 Columbus Circle)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

My mother, girlfriend and I had a quiet weeknight dinner at Vince and Eddie's about a month ago. My mom described it as \"the typical restaurant you imagine in New York.\" She meant that it's one of the many places that's on the ground floor of a townhouse, and about eight times deeper than it is wide.In a one-star review over seventeen years ago, Marian Burros admirably summarized the place: \"The cooking at Vince and Eddie's is being compared to Grandma's, or Mother's, depending on your last birthday. No matter. The comparison conjures up feel-good adjectives like hearty, simple, warm, comforting.\" Burros also found a good deal of unevenness back then, a problem not evident to us, though I'll admit our sample was small and unscientific. My mom and I tried some of the tenderest calf's liver we've had anywhere (above). But that's not good enough for Vince and Eddie's, which piles on the onion rings, baked apples, bacon, and gravy. I've forgotten my girlfriend's entree, but I recall that it too was a mountain of rich, uncomplicated food, enjoyably prepared.The restaurant was not crowded, and I suspect that it seldom is. But it has done well enough to survive as a solid neighborhood place and occasional pre-Lincoln Center standby. The world needs more like it.Vince and Eddie's (70 W. 68th Street between Columbus Avenue & Central Park West, Upper West Side)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Kaiseki is a Japanese tradition from Kyoto that features long multi-course meals in which beautiful presentation is as important as the food on the plate.Until a year ago, Sugiyama, which carries three stars from the Times, had the Manhattan Kaiseki market almost to itself. It is getting more crowded. Rosanjin opened in late 2006 in TriBeCa. Later this year, David Bouley plans to open Brushstroke just a few blocks away.Rosanjin doesn't call much attention to itself-a problem you can rest assured Bouley won't have. Paul Adams and Frank Bruni were the only mainstream critics to review it. Bruni awarded two stars-relegating it to the indiscriminate scrum of earnest neighborhood joints, pizza places, and steakhouses that have caught his fancy. Forbes awarded four stars, calling it \"[one of] the most divine Japanese meals you'll ever experience in New York.\"Dinner at Rosanjin moves at a quiet and leisurely pace, with the $150 prix fixe meal unfolding over many hours. There are only seven tables, and I get the idea that they are seldom fully booked. There were just two other parties when we were there, and that was on a Saturday night.The owner, Jungjin Park (who is from Korea) choreographs a tiny staff, who could be part of a ballet. Every plate, no matter how tiny, is placed or retrieved individually with two hands. Mr. Park is the only one who speaks, which he does in such quiet tones that one feels almost obligated to whisper, even when he is not within earshot. There is no menu. You are served whatever Mr. Park is offering that day.Mr. Park's collection of sake decanters belongs in a museum. For us, he produced a sphere resembling a tea-pot, with a removable center core that he filled with ice. At another table, the decanter looked like a tall vase. We asked him why he chose one or the other. He replied, \"It is according to my mood.\"I felt that flash photography would be inappropriate, and unfortunately the photos don't do full justice to the beautiful creations that come out of Rosanjin's kitchen. The first course (above left) had three contrasting dishes: 1) monkfish liver with tofu and sesame paste (lower left of photo); 2) Japanese clam with brocolli rabe, white asparagus and brussels sprout (top); 3) grilled fresh scallop in a squash puree (bottom right). All three were impeccably assembled and gorgeous, with the monkfish liver especially standing out.I didn't photograph the second course, which came in a lovely black bowl decorated with painted pink flowers. Inside was a fish broth with lobster, fried tofu, two pieces of string bean, and orange rind.The third course (above right) had pieces of raw snapper, medium fatty tuna, squid and codfish on a bed of shredded radish and shiso leaf. Alongside was a bowl of fresh salmon roe, which Mr. Park advised us to drink like fruit juice and two contrasting sauces for the fish. The sushi course (above left) presented the evening's only choice: fatty tuna or eel. Mr. Park commended our judgment when we both chose the tuna, which was heavily marbled like a ribeye steak. He told us it was a rare variety from the cold waters between Japan and Russa that is seldom available in New York. According to Mr. Park, 99.5% of it goes to Japan, Boston, Spain, and Croatia.Next came Kobe beef tempura (above right), spinach salad with walnuts and pecorino Romano. This course was one of the evening's few duds. Kobe beef feels like a default luxury, but I hardly tasted much beef at all-Kobe or otherwise. Next, a slice of baby yellowtail teriyaki (above left) came with a blade of \"shishito\" bean and two ginko nuts (\"break with your hands and enjoy\"). It was impeccable and beautiful, like everything else, and we enjoyed the texture of the warm fish against the cool lima bean. But I didn't feel that cooked fish was the kitchen's strength.Waves of flavor and contrast washed over us, and I don't recall any specific impression of simmered codfish (above right) with a radish, Japanese spinach and ginger. The savory portion of the meal ended with a striking soup (above left) of egg white, vegetable and turtle (\"which is very much a delicacy in Japan\"), with pickled vegetables. Dessert (above right) was yet another striking combination - crème brûlee, chocolate ice cream and mango juice - though none of these items alone would have been especially memorable.As this was our first kaiseki experience, I don't have anything to compare it to, except for the long tasting menus in Western restaurants. But there was only one clear miss (the tempura) dampening the parade of truly exquisite creations, served in a serene environment that almost makes you forget you're in Manhattan. We will certainly be back.Rosanjin (141 Duane Street between West Broadway & Church Street, TriBeCa)Food: ***Service: ***½Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Top Restaurants of 2007

In the last couple of weeks, Frank Bruni, Adam Platt, and Moira Hodgson have all filed their \"Best of 2007\" restaurant lists. The three didn't quite follow the same rules, but still it is useful to compare what they came up with:BruniPlattHodgson1. Momofuku Ssäm Bar2. Soto3. (tie) Anthos4. Insieme5. Park Avenue _____6. Resto7. 15 East8. Allen & Delancey9. Pamplona10. Mai House.InsiemeAnthosSotoPark Avenue _____BLT MarketHill CountryResto15 EastAllen & DelanceyMarket TablePark Avenue _____Soto15 EastInsiemeAltoL'ImperoFiammaAllen & DelanceyPamplonaAnthosIliliTailorThe Monday RoomMorandiCafe ClunyThe Waverly InnA couple of Bruni's choices actually opened the prior year. We'll allow an exception for 15 East (which is on all three lists), as it didn't open until December 2006, clearly too late for consideration last year. But Momofuku Ssäm Bar was a 2006 restaurant by any definition, even if its current menu bears no resemblance to the original one. Eater summarized the situation perfectly:Bruni's bigger, less explicitly stated, point is that 2007 was dull. Ssäm Bar is 2007-eligible on a technicality: the menu overhaul heard 'round the world happened days into 2007, a full three months after the restaurant opened... With all due respect to sweet goodness that is Ssäm Bar, if better restaurants had opened in 2007, and a Best crutch was not needed, it would have been relegated to the ranks of 2006.Dull indeed. Bruni rates on a four-star system, but no restaurant on his top-10 list was rated higher than two stars. Bruni issued no four-star ratings last year, and his only three-star ratings were re-reviews of older restaurants. Platt was even worse: he issued three stars to nobody, and indeed, I cannot recall his last three-star review. That's despite the fact that Platt rates on a five-star scale.Though I often disagree with Bruni's ratings, I do agree with the core conclusion: 2007 wasn't a great year. Anthos was the only truly new-in-'07 restaurant that won three stars on this blog. Insieme and Soto barely missed, and I don't think there were any other reasonable candidates.Bruni and Platt both suffer from the same disease: they are hostile to luxury restaurants. That explains why neither of them awarded three stars to the new restaurant I would rate as the year's best, Anthos. Ironically, though they much prefer casual restaurants, neither critic has loosened the criteria for three stars. Thus, you have the paradox that they don't award three stars to the places they truly like, but they seldom award three stars to the restaurants that truly deserve them.A case can be made for Gordon Ramsay, which like 15 East opened too late in 2006 to be counted in last year's roundup. I had a considerably more favorable impression of it than the mainstream critics. The fact that Ramsay had to fire the chef de cuisine is clearly not a factor in its favor, but if you count it as an '07 restaurant, then it was the best new place that opened.I would also award an honorable mention to Rosanjin, which also opened in late 2006, but did not start serving its exquisite sit-down Kaiseki until December. Frank Bruni awarded it two stars, but perhaps he felt that Soto and 15 East (also two stars, according to him) had used up his quota of Japanese restaurants. I can't comment on 15 East, but I would rate Rosanjin higher than Soto, by a nose.The only restaurant listed that's in serious disagreement with my own experience is Park Avenue ______, to which I awarded no stars. But as all three critics included it, I have to assume we caught it on an off-night. It's now on my \"return-to\" list. I haven't yet made it to 15 East or Resto, but I am now eager to try both. (Resto remains awfully tough to get into, which is the main reason I haven't gone yet.)Bruni's other unusual choice is Mai House, which no other critic included. But based on my four visits, I agree with Bruni that it deserves a spot in the top 10.Platt had three choices listed by no other critic: BLT Market, Hill Country, and Market Table. I can't comment on the latter, but BLT Market and Hill Country were two of my favorites in 2007. Bruni relegated BLT Market to the \"Dining Briefs\" treatment, once again showing that he often under-appreciates the best places. And as Hill Country was covered in the \"$25 and Under\" beat, Bruni never reviewed it.Hodgson had some of the oddest choices, listing restaurants that no other critic was especially excited about, like Tailor, Cafe Cluny, and Morandi. Hodgson didn't limit herself to ten choices, and she said they were in \"no particular order.\" She also included restaurants with new chefs, even if they weren't new in '07. (Bruni and Platt considered \"transformed\" restaurants, but not in their \"top-10\" lists.)In his year-end retrospective, Bruni once again sounded the themes that have defined his tenure: as he sees it, the younger diners-\"food adventurers,\" he calls them-have rejected the traditional trappings of luxury dining:The restrained size (along with the tight focus) of so many of these ventures speaks in part to the desire of young chefs to call their own shots and do their own thing, even if it means downsizing the settings in which they work.It speaks to economic factors as well: high rents, exorbitant start-up costs, a local economy with less swagger than in the past.But I suspect it also taps into wider cultural dynamics, into the anxieties of a country, overextended abroad and self-doubting at home, that has lost some of its appetite for grand plans and grand gestures, that would prefer to play things safe.Bruni, as always, misjudges the market for high-end dining. Just try getting a last-minute prime-time table at Alto, Aureole, Babbo, Country, Cru, Daniel, Del Posto, Eleven Madison Park, Felidia, the Four Seasons, Gramercy Tavern, Gordon Ramsay, Gotham Bar & Grill, Jean Georges, La Grenouille, Le Bernardin, the Modern, Per Se, Union Square Cafe or Veritas-to name a few. These places are generally full, which suggests that the market for the luxury experience is not truly on the wane.Now, you're probably not going to find young foodies dominating these restaurants' clientele, but these are expensive places. They don't cater to young people on tight budgets, except perhaps as an occasional splurge. These diners naturally will gravitate to places like Allen & Delancey or Resto, where you won't find three-star food, but where you can eat well without breaking the bank. A restaurant that's relatively good is not \"best\" in the absolute sense.Bruni needs to distinguish between reporting on trends and influencing them. Anyone considering a new luxury restaurant will be aware that it's tough to get a fair shake from him, unless the cuisine is Italian. Gordon Ramsay made it over the hump, but others might not be so fortunate. So far, 2008 once again shapes up as a year of humbler ambitions, pending the arrival-or not-of Paul Liebrandt's mysterious four-star wannabe.

Another New Year's Eve...what to do? Most restaurants serve a less interesting version of their normal menu, while at least doubling the price. The only exception I've found is WD-50, but as we tried that last year, I wanted something different.Enter Bite Club, the \"French Laundry of dinner clubs.\" With raves on Grub Street and eGullet, I knew it was for real, and that owners Daniel & Alicia would turn out another of the fantastic menus they're quickly becoming famous for.But first, there were a few hurdles. You don't just call Bite Club for a reservation; you have to become a member. Then, a 50% deposit was due (that's $200), payable in cash, hand-delivered either to Daniel's or Alicia's workplace. Three days before the event, clandestine instructions came by e-mail, cautioning us to \"maintain silence\" in the apartment building where the dinner was held, until were in the apartment itself. \"Should you be in the elevator with someone, it is imperative that you NOT mention Bite Club. Even if you suspect they are fellow diners for the evening, please wait until you are both brought into the apartment to confirm that.\" My girlfriend wondered if we should have brought payment in small, unmarked bills.There are reasons for all of that secrecy, as Bite Club's operation is something between a restaurant (with all the laws and regulations that implies) and a just dinner party amongst friends. It isn't quite clear on what side of that line Bite Club falls. Initially, it really was just Daniel and Alicia throwing dinner parties for their friends. It has clearly become something a bit more commercial over time, though the party atmosphere still lurks in the background.I was surprised at the size of the crowd, as I'd been led to expect somewhere around a dozen guests. There were nearly 30, at tables mostly for 6-7 guests, although there was one two-top. We were seated with a party of four, but we quickly built a rapport and enjoyed our four-hour meal together as if we were old friends. One of Bite Club's advantages is that you know you'll be eating with people who really appreciate great food and wines. With Daniel and Alicia serving plenty of both, you won't lack for conversation.There were printed menus for everyone, describing both the food and the wines in some detail. Daniel and Alicia's style is modern, not clearly beholden to any particular cuisine. They relish combining ingredients in unexpected ways. What comes out on the plate is generally spare and uncluttered, though the preparation may well have been complex. Daniel told us they started cooking at 7:00 the night before.We noted that there were hardly any vegetables on the menu; we weren't sure whether this was a preference, or if they had reached the limit of what two people could accomplish in such a small space. I don't know what they have at home-this was not their own place-but we were in a standard Manhattan apartment, with a fairly small kitchen clearly not designed to turn out 7 courses for 30 diners. Assisting were a dish-washer and two servers-the place couldn't have accommodated any more helpers, even if Daniel and Alicia had wanted them. What they produced was a marvel.Besides preparing all the food, Daniel and Alicia also have an impressive battery of stemware and china. Given the length of the meal and the number of guests, they needed all of it. As they raise Bite Club to new levels, they might want to consider a small investment in flatware. A few times, we were given utensils that weren't quite right, or asked to re-use utensils from a previous course. Butter knives would have been helpful. But this was the only small complaint we had, with what was otherwise flawless service.Dinner was seven courses with paired wines. I wasn't sure about the etiquette of taking photos, and in any case I didn't want to risk disrupting such a festive occasion, but check out Off the Broiler if you want to see what some of Daniel and Alicia's creations look like.We began with a sparkling Spinetti Moscato d'Asti, followed a short while later with a crazily good amuse-bouche, venison loin with Thai chili and goat cheese. Two breads were served, along with two contrasting spreads, a soft butter and a liver pâte. Soft, warm onion rolls came later.The first savory course was called Egg (truffled egg custard, vodka cream and caviar), paired with a Casa Ferrienha Esteva 2002. The custard and caviar came inside of a hollowed out egg. The combination was terrific.Next came Lobster (cream of lobster, black truffle pastry), paired with a Tissot Les Bruyeres 2004. Though described as cream of lobster, there were actually several solid chunks of butter-poached lobster with the pastry on top, in a small dish that you'd normally use for crème brûlee. The presentation didn't quite work, as you couldn't really navigate your knife inside of the dish to cut the lobster. The wine was a Chardonnay with an unusual smoky flavor.After that, Sweetbreads (JG raisin caper emulsion and cauliflower puree), paired with Rosenblum Viognier 2005. Three hunks of sweetbread each rested on a dab of cauliflower, with the raisin emulsion splashed between them, in the middle of the plate. The lusciously tender sweetbreads and the cauliflower puree complemented each other perfectly, but we felt that the raisin caper emulsion didn't really add anything.The main savory course was titled \"Pork & Beans\", a sly name very much in the French Laundry style. Two juicy slices of caramelized pork belly were bathed in a cranberry bean puree and pomegranate reduction, paired with Castell'in Villa Chianti Classico 2003. This was a highlight for everyone at our table, though I have to admit that I've hardly ever seen a pork belly dish go wrong: with all of that fat, there is bound to be decadence on the plate.The Cheese Flight offered five raw (i.e., unpasteurized) cheeses, which I believe Daniel and Alicia import from Canada. There was a contrast of cow, goat, and sheep's milk cheeses, arrayed in order of increasing intensity. I found one of them a bit dull, but the other four were first-class; overall, it was a well judged selection. The paired wine was Brovia La Brea Barbera 2005.In perhaps their most daring choice of the evening, as well as the most complex, the last savory course was Foie Gras (also a Canadian import) with poached pear, ginger snap, cacao nibs, and star anise caramel. Foie gras is normally served early in the meal, so I was surprised to find it after the cheese course. But foie gras is a versatile ingredient: serve it with poached pears and caramel, and it becomes a dessert. Brilliant! The paired wine was Rasmussen Late harvest Gewurztraminer 2003.Midnight approached as the foie gras plates were being cleared, so everyone pitched in to get the champagne poured (Roederer Anderson Valley NV Methode Champenoise), and we counted down the seconds to midnight.The final course, captioned Chocolate, was the only one that really misfired: a chocolate cake bedecked with a frosted scotch bonnet (a kind of chili pepper). Despite its time in the freezer, the pepper packed serious heat, and I was the only one at my table who ate all of it. It was a four-alarm fire in my mouth, but it felt great afterwards. After that adventure was over with, we were left with a dull mound of chocolate that wasn't worth eating. After four happy hours and seven wine pours (several with refills), nobody at my table was paying much attention to the chocolate anyway.The overall quality of the meal approached the level of the better tasting menus in town. Wine pairings were all lovely, and some of them even witty. It is all the more remarkable when you consider that (as I understand it) Daniel and Alicia are self-taught. They also don't have the advantage of trying everything out in a test kitchen: every meal they serve is unique, based on the ingredients available and their own whims. And in another week or so, they'll have to go out and do it all again. (Bite Club events are generally on weekends, since Daniel and Alicia have day jobs.)Daniel and Alicia richly deserve all the accolades that have come their way. They are also gracious and gregarious hosts, and love to talk about the food. I suspect that even greater things are to come, and I hope to be at Bite Club again to enjoy them.

In tomorrow's Times, the animal-sex imagery abounds, as Frank Bruni pays homage to Prime, the mighty steer who sires the porterhouse at Primehouse New York:And Primehouse New York, on Park Avenue South? It's the seminal steakhouse.It's also an estimable one, with virtues that will rightly earn it the affection of many discerning carnivores and give it a solid chance in a competitive field.[D]essert doughnuts ... come in the form of hollow balls, accompanied by three plastic syringes of a sort containing chocolate, butterscotch and strawberry. You use the syringe of your choice to, um, fertilize each one. He loves the steaks, but uneven service, an over-priced wine list, and a shortage of recommendable non-steak dishes, all add up to one star, as both Eater and New York Journal had predicted.

Now might not be the best time for a re-review of The Harrison, given that executive chef Brian Bistrong is leaving at the end of the month, with Amanda Freitag replacing him in January.Owner Jimmy Bradley says, \"We're going to go in a new direction. We were doing French cookery in a New American style, but with Amanda the menu is going to be lusty, soulful, rustic Mediterranean-inspired cookery.\"Be that as it may, I chose The Harrison for a holiday dinner, because I knew (from past visits) that it would be rock-solid-and it was. Freitag has a lot to live up to.I gave the restaurant's fascinating background the last time I reviewed it, so let's get straight to the food: Just like last time, flavors and textures were perfectly judged. Fried Oysters ($12; above left) rested on coleslaw and bacon mustard sauce. Local Trout ($25; above right) had lovely crisped skin, overshadowing the haricots verts and the red cabbage puree. Everyone raved over the Fall Squash Risotto ($12; above left), which must be the side dish served at the gates of Heaven. One of my colleagues had the Warm Chocolate Cake ($9; above right), while the rest of us supped on after-dinner drinks.The Harrison seems to be one of the few serious restaurants where the wine prices are still reasonable, meaning that there is are respectable bottles under $60, and very good ones not far above that amount. To boot, The Harrison offers over a dozen half-bottles, something far more restaurants should do. I settled on a 2005 St. Michael-Eppan Gewürztraminer from Alsace that all of us loved.Service remains a problem at The Harrison. Our server disappeared for long intervals, and it was hard to get his attention. A colleague ordered Dewar's & Soda, but she was quite certain that she wasn't served Dewar's. Whatever it was, the server spilled a bit of it on me while passing it over my head.As we say goodbye to the Brian Bistrong era at The Harrison, it will be interesting to see how this great restaurant evolves.The Harrison (355 Greenwich Street at Harrison Street, TriBeCa)Food: **½Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: **

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Primehouse New York, Stephen Hanson's contribution to Manhattan's over-saturated steakhouse industry. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 3-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 50-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Bruni loves steakhouses. It's his second favorite cuisine, after Italian. The trouble is, his steakhouse reviews are unpredictable. With Italian cuisine, you know he will rate the restaurant one star higher than it would receive if the chef were French. With steakhouses, there's just no telling.He awarded two stars to: Peter Luger, Craftsteak (re-review), Keens, and Wolfgang's. He awarded one star to: Craftsteak (first review), Harry's Steak, Porter House, Robert's Steakhouse and V Steakhouse. He awarded zero stars to Kobe Club and STK. Numerous others-including some clearly better than those that won full reviews-got the Diner's Journal treatment: BLT Prime, Capital Grille, Chemist Club, Quality Meats, Staghorn Steakhouse. (Phew! Am I leaving any out?)That brings us to Primehouse New York. The two available data points are my review and Adam Platt's. I hesitate to admit I have anything in common with Adam Platt, but both of us are confirmed carnivores, and both of us awarded two stars. Cutlets also likes it. Weighing against Primehouse are its steep prices and Bruni's general hostility towards chain or \"chain-like\" restaurants.There's virtually no doubt that Primehouse has superlative cuts of meat and knows how to prepare them. Bruni's rating will come down to his assessment of everything else: ambiance, service, and the non-steak dishes. My sense is that Bruni has gotten tougher on steakhouses-Wolfgang's (reviewed less than a month into his tenure) might not get the same two stars if it opened today. His other two-star steakhouses have a \"destination\" appeal that Primehouse, despite its merits, does not really offer.The Bet: We've vacillated all day, but it's almost review time, so we have to make a decision. We agree with Eater that Bruni will award one star to Primehouse New York.

The Master Class at Gordon Ramsay

A year ago, Gordon Ramsay at the London opened to outsized expectations. The city's major critics quickly pronounced it a dud, with both Adam Platt and Frank Bruni awarding just two stars to a restaurant that was vying for four. I was more impressed than they were, awarding three stars, though I agreed with Platt and Bruni that the restaurant didn't quite live up to the hype.Ramsay fired chef de cuisine Neil Ferguson, replacing him with Josh Emett, who had cooked for Ramsay at the Savoy Grill. Neither Platt nor Bruni has been back since the change, which is understandable, given their hostility to upscale European (non-Italian) cuisines, even when it is executed well. But Ramsay was redeemed when the restaurant earned two stars in the 2008 Michelin Guide, making Gordon Ramsay at the London one of the top ten restaurants in town, in at least one informed opinion. It also earned the top rating of four stars in the annual Forbes survey.I received an e-mail promotion for a Master Class at Gordon Ramsay, offered weekdays for parties of four to eight guests. Chef Emett demonstrates the day's menu, and then you have a multi-course lunch at the Chef's Table. My girlfriend and I thought it would make a great Christmas present for our parents. We made it a surprise, so they knew only that we were going to the London Hotel, with no idea what was to come.The day went far beyond our expectations. We arrived at 10:30 a.m. After coffee and continental breakfast, Chef Emett spent ninety minutes demonstrating three complex recipes and explaining how the kitchen worked. We then sat down to a luxurious six-course lunch with wine pairings, finishing at around 2:30 p.m. All of that was only $195 per person for our party of five. This is a bargain when you bear in mind that it included what amounted to a private cooking lesson with a Michelin-starred chef and four bottles of wine.The Master Class photos are in the previous post.After the master class, we sat down to lunch at the Chef's Table, which is in a nook facing the kitchen. We began with a bottle of champagne. First we were served two canapes: a crispy cod fish with salmon roe, and a fried mushroom (above left). Then came the amuse-bouche, a light butternut squash soup (above right).Another bottle of wine came out, as we watched the ravioli plated at the pass: Above: Ravioli of Tiger Prawn with Fennel Cream,Shellfish Vinaigrette and Chervil Veloute It's hard to tell from the photo, but the ravioli were plump and generously filled; two of them would have been excessive, especially given how rich they were. This was a four-star dish, easily the best ravioli I've had in a long time. It's a popular dish, too: we saw many plates of it leaving the kitchen.Another bottle of wine arrived. We watched the complex operation of plating of the Beef Wellington, and Chef Emett came by to check on us: And the pièce de resistance:Above: Short Rib of Kobe Beef; Fillet of Beef Wellington with Madeira JusThe Beef Wellington entree was outstanding, and puts to shame every other preparation of this dish that I've ever had. There were something like a dozen separate ingredients on the plate. The Kobe beef short rib practically melted at the touch. The beef was beautiful, perfectly aged and tender, the crisp puff pastry shell offering a gorgeous contrast.By the way, the Beef Wellington is not currently on the regular menu, although Emett told us it has been offered in the past.It was time for dessert:The palate cleanser was a passion fruit crème with coconut foam and mint granata (above left). I must admit that I had doubts about whther the rice pudding (above right) could live up to the culinary fireworks of the rest of the meal, but there was far more to it than I expected, with a raspberry jam, mascarpone ice cream and pecans. It came with a dessert wine, followed by petits-fours that we could barely touch.This was among the best meals we have had in New York. It is difficult to rate a meal like this, bearing in mind that most guests won't experience the restaurant under these conditions. But recent reviews seem to confirm our impression that Gordon Ramsay is now one of the top handful of restaurants in the city.Gordon Ramsay at the London (151 W. 54th Street between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, West Midtown)Food: ****Service: ****Ambiance: ***Overall: ****

Does $195 include tip? Isn't this essentially a 3 course lunch with wine pairing? In the dining room it would be around $98: $45 + $25 (wine) + 20 (champagne) + 8 (coffee and bon bon). Is it fair to say the master class is basically $100 a person?Did you get to do anything in the kitchen or only watched during the master class?

Thanks for the question. I would more accurately describe it as a 5 or 6-course meal, counting all of the amuse courses. I am fairly certain that the dining room is not offering all of that and four paired wines for $98. On top of all that, they also served us continental breakfast. If I had to estimate, I’d guess that the food + liquor value was around $140. It’s hard to say, because I don’t think they serve that meal at lunch (other than the master class), and at dinner it would clearly be much more.Besides the master class, the other thing you’re paying for is the right to sit at the chef’s table. Even at dinner (with no master class), they charge more to sit there than in the main dining room. You have to decide for yourself what that’s worth, but for the purpose we had in mind (a Xmas gift for our parents) it was perfect.The $195 does not include gratuity. Yes, we did get to “help” make some of the food. Among other things, we discovered that making ravioli is a lot harder than it looks.

Note: The background of our visit and the meal itself are in the next post.We all donned aprons and joined chef de cuisine Josh Emett in the kitchen, where he demonstrated the Ravioli of Tiger Prawn, Beef Wellington, and Rice Pudding. Besides being a master chef, he was a patient teacher and a true gentleman, spending close to ninety minutes with us.I was encouraged to take photos liberally, which I did: He said, \"We're very laid back about that, contrary to popular belief.\" He also said that he speaks to Ramsay almost every day, but that he has complete freedom to design the menu.We began with...Ravioli of Tiger Prawn with Fennel Cream, Shellfish Vinaigrette and Chervil VelouteFirst, Emett makes the pasta by hand:There's enough leftover for a heavenly linguini, which was not actually part of the planned menu. We ate right out of the skillet it was prepared in:The ravioli are filled with a shrimp and tiger prawn mousse, then assembled and trimmed into a circle. They are extremely delicate and prone to puncture, in which case the whole operation must be repeated:Now it was onto... Fillet of Beef Wellington with Madeira Jus The beef had been seasoned and pre-seared in a hot pan. A chicken, mushroom and shallot mousse was spread onto a light crepe:Then the fillet was wrapped inside, and the edges sealed:Then, a flat puff pastry was brushed with an egg wash, and the crepe containing the fillet rolled inside:Lastly...Rice Pudding with Raspberry Jam & Mascarpone Pecan Ice Cream I've not much to say about the rice pudding, which was the most straightforward part of the demonstration, so I just offer the photos:And some scenes from the kitchen:Left: A line cook prepares venison loin for the dinner service; Center: There are two massive French stoves, which cost $750,000 apiece; Right: Emett is proud of an Apple Tarte Tatin, which is offered as a dessert for two.It was time to sit down to lunch...

Today, Neil Ferguson wins vindication, in the form of a rave two-star review from Frank Bruni:In its unusual marriage of setting and style, his new restaurant, Allen & Delancey, makes a striking bid for attention. But that's not all it has going for it.It's easily one of the prettiest, most comfortable places I've been introduced to in a while, a reminder of how crucial to an evening's enjoyment the right visual trappings, the right amount of elbowroom and the ability to have a conversation without shouting can be...And the food at Allen & Delancey is at once sophisticated and accessible, reliant on fail-safe luxuries deployed in a modestly creative and occasionally playful manner. It's not entirely unlike what Mr. Ferguson was doing uptown, but context is everything.While his approach seemed too tame and uneventful in one milieu, at one price point, it plays differently in another. At Allen & Delancey the vibe is relaxed, and all the entrees are under $30. You don't typically get polish like this at prices like these.We win $4, while Eater loses $1, on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 5-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 7-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Bruni awarded two stars to Gordon Ramsay at The London, with Ferguson running the kitchen. For a restaurant of that calibre, it was a serious smackdown. If we take that review as a general indictment of Ferguson's talent, then it doesn't bode well for Allen & Delancey, where the overall mise en scène can't compete with Ramsay's uptown palace.But I didn't read the Ramsay review that way. The Times star system, particularly as Bruni interprets it, weighs price very heavily. All Bruni was saying was that, at these prices (among the highest in town), he expected more culinary fireworks. Now, I thought that Bruni missed the boat at GR, even allowing for his price-weighted grading curve. But even allowing for that, it doesn't necessarily follow that Ferguson will get slammed at Allen & Delancey.The other way of seeing it is that, at a much gentler price point, you get a chef whom Gordon Ramsay thought was capable of earning four stars-for there is no doubt that Ramsay intended his New York restaurant to compete with the city's very best. All of the entrees at A&D are below $30, which in this era is practically bargain pricing for a chef with Ferguson's pedigree. Of course, that's still no guarantee that Bruni will like it, but I'm betting that A&D's hearty rusticity will appeal to him.At any rate, I liked it, and while Bruni's tastes and mine don't always coincide, I can't help using my own reviews as a tie-breaker-clearly not a fool-proof betting strategy!!The Bet: It's a close call, but we predict that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Allen & Delancey.

In tomorrow's Times, Frank Bruni awards one star to Grayz, as I had expected. He actually loved the food-there have been three-star reviews that weren't this rapturous-but ultimately the restaurant's \"befuddled and befuddling\" concept is its undoing:These dishes demand fuller attention than the setting allows, and the prices - $39 for the short ribs - only make total sense if eating is the point of a visit. There's an awkward mix of signals that distracts you from the kitchen's efforts, which are noteworthy nonetheless. I also stand by what I said earlier today: Grayz cannot coherently get two stars while Cafe Gray is also carrying two stars. Bruni's version of the star system has its quirks, but I thought this review simply had to be one star. Now, if this had been a double-review, with Cafe Gray upgraded to the three stars it arguably deserves, then Grayz might have had a chance at two.We win $4, while Eater loses $1, on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

I hate to argue about star ratings when I don't even believe in them, but I view Cafe Gray as a failed three-star and Grayz as a successful two-star. So it wouldn't seem incoherent to me to give Grayz two stars.

That's the same rating he gave Cafe Gray, and no one-not even Gray Kunz himself-would tell you that Grayz is meant to be, or that it is, as good a restaurant as the mother ship.Now, Bruni has been known to turn the ratings hierarchy on its head, but he's not likely to do it for a glorified bar that serves only three entrees (all fairly expensive), and that's basically only a money-spinning sideshow to the chef's main restaurant.Besides that, I don't think anyone so far is particularly thrilled with the food at Grayz.The Bet: We predict that Frank Bruni will award one star to Grayz.

That's forgetting the fact that the food at Grayz is actually BETTER than the food at Cafe Gray. The menu is too limited, for sure -- but Grayz is a two-star restaurant.

We’ll know what Bruni thinks in a few hours, but I did not find the food at Grayz better than Café Gray.I also think it has the Tailor problem: when there are so few options, a very high percentage of them (like all) need to be knockouts.

I overlooked Riingo when it opened almost four years ago in the Alex Hotel. My girlfriend is a fan of the chef/owner, Marcus Samuelsson, who also runs the Swedish restaurant Aquavit, so I figured a visit was past due.The restaurant is Samuelsson's take on Asian Fusion, which was no longer a new concept when Riingo opened. It garnered mixed reviews: Amanda Hesser delivered a two-star rave in the Times, but Adam Platt in New York (in his pre-star system days) was less impressed.Amuse-bouche: Mystery MackerelIt's possible to see why Hesser liked the place, as everything we tried had potential. But alas, the execution was truly incompetent, and it was coupled with some of the most bumbling service we've seen in a long time.The menu offers the standard appetizers ($5-14), salads ($10-16), entrees ($23-32) and side dishes ($5-6), along with a Japanese menu offering sushi, sashimi, and rolls. All the categories have an eclectic mix, so \"tuna foie gras\" appears on the sushi menu, and the entrees accommodate interlopers like steak frites. As it is located in a hotel, Riingo also serves breakfast and lunch, along with weekend brunch.The room is decked out in the expected style, but the rear dining room, in which we were seated, is surprisingly cramped, and servers struggled to negotiate the space. The host made the odd comment that we had the best seats in the house. Our small table with overlapping placemats seemed like nothing of the kind.The amuse-bouche seemed to be mackerel something-or-other; the explanation was inaudible. The bread service included stale rolls and something much better: a spicy ruffly potato-chip like substance along with a guacamole-like dip (all offered without explanation). As the server took the amuse plates away, he put our dirty forks back on the placemats, as one would do at a cheap diner. They can't afford clean forks? Don't adjust your television set: Roasted Beet Salad ($12; above left) came in an odd-shaped bowl that tilted slightly to the right. The kitchen forgot the goat cheese that was supposed to come with it. The chicken that was supposed to be in Chicken Dumplings ($10; above right) was scarcely a rumor, as it was overwhelmed by a sour broth.There was no false advertising about Rare Tuna ($26; left). As you can see in the photo, it's as rare as can be, but the accompanying pumpkin puree was lukewarm and tasteless. Bok choy was warm, but had been left in the steamer too long.My girlfriend had the Chili-Roasted Chicken ($23), which was dry from over-cooking.We ordered wine along with our food. When I pointed to the item I wanted, the server asked, \"By the bottle?\" I thought this was peculiar, as the menu didn't indicate that it was available by the glass.Matters only got stranger, as half-an-hour (and our appetizers) came and went, but no wine appeared. When it finally came, the server muttered that they had trouble locating my selection in the cellar. By that time we no longer wanted it, so I asked for two glasses; naturally, that wine wasn't available by the glass, so I substituted an undistinguished pinot noir.The couple at the next table overheard us, and mentioned that their wine too had not arrived until after the appetizers. We started watching the dining room, and sure enough, at least two other tables had the same experience, with wine delivered after-and in at least one case, long after-the appetizers had been served, consumed, and taken away.For the usual petits-fours, Riingo had a couple of small oatmeal cookies, which naturally were stale. Perhaps Riingo was once a fine restaurant, but the kitchen and serving staff are have become sloppy, veering on incompetent. I can only hope that Samuelsson will rattle the trees, fire a few people, and get this restaurant back on track.Riingo (205 E. 45th Street, east of Third Avenue, East Midtown)Food: mediocreService: sloppyAmbiance: acceptableOverall: sad

Note: This is a review of Irving Mill under chef John Schaefer, who has since left the restaurant. His replacement was Ryan Skeen, formerly of Resto. Skeen is leaving the restaurant effective June 7, 2009. He'll be replaced by his chef de cuisine, Erik Ramirez. I expected a lot from Irving Mill. It's the first solo venture by John A. Schaefer, who was executive chef at Gramercy Tavern for six years, including the period when it won a Michelin star. Early reviews have been mixed, but I figured a former Gramercy Tavern guy would offer a menu with more hits than misses. Alas, we were underwhelmed at Irving Mill. Most of what we had was merely adequate. I have to figure that better things are in store here, but our meal there offered little reason to go back. And that's really too bad, because the service was as good as I've seen at a casual restaurant in a long time. We know Schaefer is a Danny Meyer alumnus, but the front-of-house must be too. I had to pinch myself when they offered to seat me before my girlfriend arrived. At most busy restaurants below three stars-and Irving Mill is very busy-the usual line is, \"You're welcome to wait at the bar until your party is complete.\" And when my girlfriend ordered a Whiskey Sour \"not too sour,\" the server checked back twice to ensure it was exactly the way she wanted it. The decor is rustic chic, but not in a cynical way: you feel instantly at home. Like Gramercy Tavern, there is a front room that doesn't take reservations. Tables in the main dining room have been tough to come by lately, but I think the novelty will wear off if the food remains this undistinguished. The seasonal menu, which I suspect will become more expensive over time, offers appetizers ($10-16), entrees ($25-28), side dishes ($7), and a so-called tasting menu ($54) which is really just a four-course prix-fixe. There are 21 wines by the glass, most of them $12 or less. I started with the New Zealand Cockles Stew ($12; above left), which I don't recommend. The cockle shells yielded tiny flavorless pea-sized chunks of meat, the chorizo was tough as leather, and the broth insipid. My girlfriend had the Cauliflower Ravioli ($15), which I didn't taste, but was the meal's only true highlight. Roasted Arctic Char ($28; above right) was somewhat better. I liked the contrast of the crisp skin and the tender flesh underneath, but lentils, cabbage, and a red wine reduction added nothing to the dish. My girlfriend's Grilled Pork Chop ($26) seemed under-sized, and it wasn't much improved by accompaniments of red cabbage, spaetzle and mustard seed. I would very much like to think that Schaefer can do better. In such a lovely setting with such polished service, I certainly hope so.

Masturbation is strictly forbidden at Kenka. That's just one of many rules at this East Village Japanese restaurant. I hesitate to imagine the unruly patrons it must attract, but the food is surprisingly good.In Japan, Kenka would be called an izakaya, or drinking establishment. I don't recall seeing another one like it in New York. The tables are low-slung, with chairs about eighteen inches above the floor. Instead of a coat check, there are piles of open wicker baskets; you take one to your table,and put your coat inside it. The glossy menu is covered with shiny photos of the food, described in Japanese with English translations that are often unhelpful, misspelled, or grammatically incorrect. There are about fifty sakes on offer, all with photos, all inexpensive, and all available by the glass. The decor is unfancy, but authentic, including a row of Japanese pinball machines (above, left). You might have trouble finding the restrooms, as the only signs are the Japanese pictograms for a man and a woman. My friend Kelly guessed that the one that looks like its legs are crossed would be the ladies' room.Then, there are the rules: The restroom doors. Can youguess which is the ladies?In case you can't read them, here are the highlights, all transcribed literally:No sake-bomb at all.20% of S.C. will be includes company more than 7 peopleGrafitti or tagging only in japanese. No other language at all.No fighting, masturation, having sex or drugs, you will get ejected.In the event that a customer breaks any dish or glass on purpose, we will be forced to charge that customer $5 for each thing brokenIn the event that a customer has had too much to drink and vomits outside of the restroom, we will be forced to charge that customer $20 for the cleaning up and inconvenience to our other customers.Follow Kenka's regulation!! Break our regulations or you'll be thrown out.Sure enough, both restrooms were full of grafitti, all in Japanese.The menu has about a hundred items, most of them small plates, representing just about every variety of Japanese cuisine, including pig intestines, bull testicles, and turkey penises. (The linked version-the only one I could find online-is incomplete.) We weren't feeling quite that adventurous, and ordered a more conventionally.<br // Large, fresh oysters (above left) were a salty delight. We paired them with deep-fried oysters (above right), which were just as enjoyable. The next item we had was, I believe, the grilled rice balls (above left). We enjoyed their candied sticky flavor, but they were tough to handle with chopsticks. I barely managed it by \"stabbing\" mine, and eating it like a lollipop on a stick. Fried rice (above right) had a bounty of fresh-tasting ingredients. The yakitori platter (above left) was the only mild disappointment, as all of the meats seemed tough and overcooked. But everything on the sashimi platter (above right) was first-rate, including a grade of luscious fat-laden tuna (roughly 11:00 on the photo) that I hadn't seen before.Service wasn't fancy, but it was more than adequate for a casual restaurant of this calibre, and all of the food was attractively plated. I didn't note individual prices, but the total for all of the food shown, plus one drink apiece, was $77 before tax.As we were leaving, the server gave us a small dixie-cup of pink sugar. Outside the door, there's a make-it-yourself cotton candy machine. That tiny helping of sugar didn't make much cotton candy (nor was I hungry for it), but it's yet another quirk that puts Kenka in a category by itself.Kenka (25 St. Marks Place near Second Avenue, East Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: one of a kindOverall: *

***CONTENT
This week, Frank Bruni awarded three stars to yet another Italian restaurant, Fiamma. Perhaps sensitive to the fact that it seems to be the only cuisine he likes, Bruni tries to argue that it's not really Italian:Would you find these entrees in Italy, even up north? Maybe, in a very fussy restaurant. In most others, no. And who cares? They're prepared with finesse and they're the definition of luxury, no matter the geography, no matter the language... Fiamma is about as Italian as a poodle in a Prada scarf. [Say, what???]The review once again uses Frank's favorite insult, \"fussy\". Somehow, Fiamma managed to overcome that liability. It doesn't happen often. Bruni insists that the cuisine \"owes its classically indulgent soul to France.\" Somehow I suspect that if a northern European chef were in the kitchen-Gabriel Kreuther, for instance-two stars would be the maximum.One never knows with Bruni, but based on other reports I've read, I can't quarrel with the rating, although Eater and I had forecasted two stars, and thus lose $1 on our hypothetical bets.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Fiamma, the one truly serious establishment in Stephen Hanson's galaxy of crowd-pleasing one-star restaurants. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 5-1 Two Stars: 3-1 √√Three Stars: 4-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: This is technically a re-review, as William Grimes had awarded three stars to Fiamma's predecessor, Fiamma Osteria, with Michael White at the helm. Earlier this year, White decamped to run the kitchens at Alto and L'Impero (three and two stars respectively, per The Bruni), and Hanson hired Fabio Trabocchi to replace him. Fiamma is the only restaurant in Hanson's portfolio that critics have taken at all seriously, and he is surely itching to keep all three of his stars.I haven't been to Fiamma, but Bruni often telegraphs where he's headed. In a blog post just one week ago, he complained about the custom of covering tablecloth stains with a fresh napkin, which he called the Napkin of Shame. And yes, he had been \"shamed\" at Fiamma. (I still don't get what's \"shameful\" about it, but hey, that's The Bruni: the rituals of fine dining are lost on him.)Anyway, he didn't have much to say about the food, but what he did say wasn't promising:The meal progressed, a rich, saucy meal, because Fiamma's new chef, Fabio Trabocchi, cooks in a rich, saucy style. One course departed, another arrived, and so on and so forth. We'll delve into this deeper when review time comes around.I don't remember eating with particular abandon. In fact I remember eating in a restrained fashion, wary of the cumulative effect of all this richness and all this richness and all this sauciness.My take? Those aren't the words of a critic who was really enjoying his meal. If Frank is obsessed about napkins, he's not loving the food. That's why a three-star review is looking like a real long-shot.But he didn't imply it was awful either, as it would have to be for a former three-star restaurant to be double-demoted to one star. So Eater's two-star prediction is looking pretty good.The Bet: We predict that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Fiamma.

***CONTENT
Bondi Road and The Sunburnt Cow are a pair of Australian-themed restaurants operated by chef/owner Heathe St. Clair. They are both fairly casual, with nothing on either menu above $16. Bondi Road, the newer of the two, opened on the Lower East Side sixteen months ago to fairly positive reviews (New York, RG).I get the sense that Bondi Road was meant to be a bit more ambitious than it is now. Restaurant Girl mentioned a $30 tasting menu that no longer seems to be on offer. The restaurant does not take reservations, but we had no trouble getting bar seating at 8:15 p.m. on a Saturday night. The space was already starting to clear out by 9:30, which is not a good sign, and may explain why I received a publicist's invitation to dine there. Fried foods are the kitchen's strength. My son loved Coconut Shrimp ($9; above left), and everyone was dipping into my order of \"Salt N Pepper Squid\" ($9; above center). The breading was just light enough to add flavor without overwhelming the squid. But Tuna Tartare ($12; above right) was a real dud. The tuna was not sushi quality, and an unattractive lump of it wasn't rescued by a mango chilli yogurt sauce or an olive tapenade. My son thought that an order of New Zealand Mussels ($10; above left) were \"just okay.\" My girlfriend and I both ordered the Barramundi ($15; above right), which comes grilled, breaded or fried, and with your choice of side dish. I asked for it grilled, but it came out fried anyway, and I decided to give it a try. I thought they nailed it, but my girlfriend found her order too greasy. However, everyone agreed the french fries were excellent.Blue curaçao figures in several of the mixed cocktails. I had one called the Wipeout ($9), a mixture of blue curaçao, sprite, and several white liquors, served in a tall glass. One or two more of those, and they would have needed to carry me home. My girlfriend was less impressed with Sex on Bondi Beach ($9), which sounded like fun, but tasted like a bland orange-grapefruit juice.The food at Bondi Road is fun (if a bit uneven), and some of it is even very good, but the format works against it. The space, dominated by the bar, is cramped and dark, and the small, high tables would be more suitable for an ice cream parlor. Australian waitresses and a loop of beach videos playing on a projection TV are the only real reminders of \"Down Under.\" However, with $9 appetizers and $15 entrees, it's a good budget-conscious choice if you happen to be nearby.Bondi Road (153 Rivington Street between Suffolk & Clinton Streets, Lower East Side)

***CONTENT
In a city flooded with big-box Asian-themed restaurants, Koi arrived relatively late. As Frank Bruni put it in his zero-star review 2½ years ago:Koi recreates a popular, buzz-bedecked establishment with the same name and same principal owner in Los Angeles, and it belongs to a well-worn Japanese genre that includes, in Manhattan, Megu, Geisha, Ono, Matsuri and En Japanese Brasserie. These restaurants invest in flashy design, mix colorful cocktails and construct menus that hedge any daring bets with the safety of sushi rolls and versions of dishes popularized by Nobu, the less flamboyant, more dependable sire of this expanding brood. I didn't bother with Koi back then, but when I was looking for something new to try in Madison Square Garden's general vicinity, suddenly its moment had come.Our visit to Koi almost didn't happen. I booked on OpenTable for 5:30 p.m., but the restaurant was closed when we arrived: the Bryant Park Hotel staff told us that Koi wouldn't open until 6:00. We took a twenty-minute walk, and when we returned they were open. The snafu was never explained, but we headed off to our table and were out in plenty of time for a 7:30 show.Early critics complained about a \"you need us more than we need you\" attitude and music so loud you could barely think straight. Thankfully, none of that was on display last Friday evening, either because management actually learned something from the reviews, or because Koi's fifteen minutes of hotness are up. I suspect it's the latter. We saw families with small children, and our server asked, \"Where y'all from?\" I suspect that most of the patrons now are tourists.As at Nobu and other restaurants of its ilk, the menu at Koi is mostly \"small plates,\" which you're encouraged to share, along with standard offerings of sushi, sashimi, and rolls. Our server was well informed about the menu and provided patient guidance.We started with a trio of appetizers. Tuna Tartare ($15; above left) with avocado and crispy wontons was as good a preparation of that dish as any in town. Our server steered us to Crispy Rice topped with spicy tuna ($16; above center), but we weren't as wowed by it as he was. I believe the third appetizer was the Creamy Rock Shrimp Tempura ($17; above right), which had a nice cruncy-spicy texture. The so-called \"signature rolls\" at Koi avoid some of the usual cliches. My son was pleased with a shrimp roll ($16; above left), which had the shrimp outside the rice, instead of the opposite. A Baked Crab hand roll ($9; above right) had a doughy wrapping, rather than the usual rice paper, but it was a bit bland.The better items on the menu are good enough to make Koi a solid standout in the neighborhood, but it's not really distinct enough to be a destination.Koi (40 W. 40th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Note: Click here for a review of the casual front room, Halfsteak. Craftsteak had a tough start, with most of the reviews citing the same peculiar flaw: the kitchen didn't know how to cook a steak. With prices running about $10-20 per steak higher than the going rate in Manhattan, that wasn't going to fly. I visited Craftsteak 1.0 twice (here, here). Frankly, I might not have bothered to return after the first time, but I was so sure Tom Coliccio would right the ship that I figured it was worth another look. The second visit was, if anything, even worse than the first. I was still sure that Coliccio would fix it somehow, but I wasn't going to rush back. Tom Coliccio got busy. He fired his chef de cuisine, bought new kitchen equipment, and continued to tweak the menu. His efforts finally paid off with a rare re-review from Frank Bruni, elevating the restaurant to the two stars that I'm sure Coliccio intended it to have. More than a year after my last visit, I thought it was time to give Craftsteak another try. Craftsteak 2.0 is much improved, though not without its flaws. The menu is still far too sprawling, with 20 different steaks and 35 side dishes. Ten of those steaks are variations on the New York Strip - corn-fed, grass-fed, or Wagyu; 10, 12 or 18 ounce; aged anywhere from 28 to 65 days. Who needs so many options?. Coliccio should offer New York Strip the two or three ways he thinks are best, and ditch the others. The amuse-bouche was a bit of a dud: a thin pâte buried too deep in a cast-iron bowl, with just three skimpy crackers to mop it up with. Parker-house rolls were much more successful, and it was all we could do not to eat all six of them. Our favorite steak is the ribeye: naturally, there are two versions: 14-ounce grass-fed ($55) or 18-ounce corn-fed ($52). We chose the latter, as it's four ounces heavier and three dollars cheaper. And finally, Craftsteak served a steak for the gods: tender, beautifully charred, evenly marbled, full of mineral flavor. There was no need for four steak sauces: they were first-class, but why offer only two spoons? Rounding it out was a plate of gnocchi ($11), soft, light and creamy enough to make you forget every other gnocchi you've ever had. The dining room was full, but we had no trouble getting walk-in seating at the bar. The tables there are just as big, and it's the same menu. Servers aren't quite attentive enough. I would almost be tempted to award three stars for the food, if I did not suspect that a menu as vast as Craftsteak must have some duds, and perhaps we were just lucky enough not to order any of them. But on the strength of this visit, it appears that Craftsteak is finally delivering on its promise.

Marche de La VilletteRounding out our Montreal journal are two casual places along rue St. Paul Ouest where we had breakfast and lunch.Marche de La Villette has only been in existence for about four years, but it has the look of a comfortable bistro that has been there forever. There's a take-out counter featuring an array of salads, quiches and terrines, but there's a full-service all-day menu too. We've been there several times, but only for breakfast/brunch. It's not exactly a bargain, with breakfast for two coming to around CA$40, but you don't leave hungry, and everything is prepared to a high standard. Pictured are: Crèpe with ham and brie (upper left), Cheese platter (upper right), Omelette with salad (lower left), and your humble correspondent (lower right). La Bouchees GourmandesIt's a pity I didn't have my camera the first day that we visited La Bouchees Gourmandes, which is just down the street from Marche de La Villette. It's primarily a sweet shop, but there's a breakfast and lunch menu too. The crèpes were outstanding - if anything, lighter, fluffier, and more textured than those at La Villette. We went back the next day for hot chocolate and a tart.The place appears to be operated by a husband-wife team, with no one in the front-of-house except the wife. She moves at her own pace: that tart took her quite a while to produce, even though it was already in a display case and needed only to be plated.But as long as you're in no hurry, it is well worth a visit.Marche de La Villette (324, rue St. Paul Ouest, Montreal)Les Bouchees Gourmandes (310, rue St. Paul Ouest, Montreal)

Although we would have but two evenings in Montreal, one restaurant from our last visit impressed us enough that we were determined to go again: Au Pied de Cochon, literally \"The Pig's Foot.\"Chef Martin Picard has a cult following that almost any chef would envy. I cannot find a single negative review of the place. Maybe it's because Picard is bribing diners with the most fattening foods imaginable, and serving them in eye-popping combinations no one else would dream of.I wrote a fairly detailed eGullet post the last time we visited, so I won't repeat the background. The only thing that's new since then is that Martin Picard now has his own cookbook. Like everything else at Au Pied de Cochon, Picard did it his own way, and published the book himself.And the restaurant is, if anything, even harder to get into. We booked our table a few weeks in advance, but all they could offer me on a Saturday evening was 6:00 p.m., and we had to vacate the table by 8:00. This didn't deter us: for all of the restaurant's charms, it is really not a place to linger. The space is cramped, loud, and not especially comfortable.We had the same server as last time, and once again he advised that an appetizer to share would probably be ample, given the vast portion sizes. I didn't take note of our wine selection, but the list seemed more expensive than last time. We settled on a respectable red for $65. We started with the Plogue à Champlain ($23; above), a hunk of foie gras with a buckwheat pancake, bacon, onions, potatoes, and maple syrup. The server explained that a friend of Picard had served this to him at breakfast, and he was so thunderstruck that he added it to the restaurant's menu. And it was good enough to make you think that God made foie gras and maple syrup to be eaten together every morning. Pot-au-feu ($60) is one of the few dishes actually advertised as being a portion for two. It's traditionally a fairly humble dish, but you can count on Picard to spruce it up with foie gras, prairie oysters, and Guinea Hen, along with typical ingredients like boiled beef, bone marrow, and vegetables. We thought that the beef and vegetables turned out especially well, while the Guinea Hen didn't really repay the effort to pry off the bone what little meat was left.When we visit Montreal, there's always a feeling of \"so many restaurants...so little time.\" But with much of the menu at Au Pied de Chochon still unexplored, it will probably still be a must-visit the next time we come to Montreal.Au Pied de Cochon (536, rue Duluth Est, Montreal)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: **

Interior shot (left); Chefs Marc de Canck and Olivier de Montigny (right)My girlfriend and I spent a fun long weekend in Montreal last year. We enjoyed it so much that she suggested a return visit to celebrate my birthday. The question was: where to eat? Last time, we had a terrific meal at Toque, and we wanted another meal in that class. An eGullet contributor suggested La Chronique.The restaurant, located well apart from the central business district, occupies a fairly humble-looking space that belies the ambitious food. Belgian chef Marc de Canck has been at the helm since it opened in March 1995, joined more recently by his assistant Olivier de Montigny. It has garnered a mention in various international publications, including a favorable write-up from New York Times critic Eric Asimov in 1999.The à la carte menu offers appetizers from CA$15-25 and entrees $34-45; there are only about half-a-dozen of each. We chose the seven-course degustation for $100 per person, with wine pairings another $50 or $100 (we had the latter). The explanations of the wines were unusually detailed, extending at times to full-blown tasting notes à la Wine Spectator.I present the menu selections and paired wines below in French, followed in each case by our notes: La mise en bouche en surprise du moment [above left]La Lotte farcie de homard, crème de ptd et pois verts à la truffe [above right]France, Saint-Aubin 1er Cru Les Frionnes, Hubert Lamy 2004The amuse-bouche was a small daub of gravlax with crème fraîche. The first appetizer was a fairly complex presentation of monkfish stuffed with lobster, with a potato foam, green peas, and purple basil. The lobster had a nice sweeness, balanced by peach and almond notes in the paired wine. Bar de ligne rôti, ravioli d'artichauts et sa vinaigrette tiède aux tomates sechees [above left]France, Sancerre, Les Culs De Beaujeu, François Cotat 2005La noix de ris de veau aux cèpes, foie gras et courge musquee [above right]Amerique, Santa Rita Hills, Foley Pinot noir, Foley Estate 2005Next came artichoke ravioli with red peppers and dried tomatoes, accompanied by the very smooth François Cotat Sancerre, which offered hints of grapefruit, green tea, aged in oak. I'm no great fan of artichokes, but I could appreciate the artistry of the dish.After that, sweetbreads and foie gras in a chocolate and butternut squash puree. If you put so many ideas into one dish, the result could very well be mush. Instead, our note at the time was: \"This is incredible.\" The accompanying pinot noir offered hints of cherry and vanilla. Le duo de boeuf Angus, endive caramelisee et girolles [above left]Italie, Bolgheri, Ornellaia, Tenuta san Giudo 2002Le plateau de fromages fermiers d'ici et d'ailleurs [above right]Italie, Monferrato Rosso, Pin, La Spinetta 2003The last savory course was a filet of black angus beef, with a braised beef tail, braised endive, onion, and veal jus. This seemed less memorable than some of the other dishes. The accompanying Italian wine came with a tasting note that almost defied detection by mere mortals: black olives, leather, plum, blackcurrant, strawberry, and cherries.The server brought around a cheese platter, from which we chose six, all of which were wonderful, including a couple of unpasteurized cheeses that could not legally be served in the U.S.. The tasting note for the wine: tobacco, coffee, chocolate, red fruits, and blackcurrant. La clafoutis aux peches, caramel sale et glace vanilleFrance, Barsac-Sauternes 1er Cru, Château Climens 1995Dessert was a light pastry with peaches, salted caramel, and vanilla ice cream, along with a sauterne. Tasting note: pineapple, mango, fig, and honey.Service throughout was first-rate, and the timing of the courses-always tricky with a tasting menu-was just about right. The food at La Chronique has a bit less of the \"wow\" factor than at Toque, but it must surely be one of the top handful of dining experiences in Montreal.La Chronique (99 rue Laurier Ouest, Montreal)Food: ***Service: **½Ambiance: **Overall: **½

This week, Frank Bruni concluded the review cycle for Sam Mason's Tailor, awarding a very weak one star. Although a one-star rating supposedly means \"good,\" this was one of those reviews that actually sounded like it meant \"not-so-good\":Mr. Mason's personal vision trumps your pleasure. His conviction matters more than your response. This, I suppose, is the very definition of artistic integrity. But it's not the prescription for a great restaurant.Tailor is certainly an ambitious restaurant, and an interesting one. It has the courage to showcase the kind of experimental cooking - eccentric, provocative flavor combinations; unusual textures like foams, powders and that most appetizing of au courant coinages, \"soils\" - that's been a tough sell in New York...Mr. Mason, who made his name as the pastry chef at WD-50, belongs to a group of brainy iconoclasts (Will Goldfarb, Pichet Ong) who are challenging the usual segregation of savory and sweet. At Tailor, for example, the ice cream with a rum-braised banana is the flavor of mustard, and not even honey mustard at that.But his infatuation with his own imagination doesn't leave room enough for a self-appraisal of the results, for dissent from collaborators who might flag the foolhardy creations among the clever. Tailor winds up with an intermittently exhilarating but ultimately frustrating mishmash of the two.Bruni's review came late enough to take notice of recent menu changes at Tailor, but those changes are too new to evaluate. Ultimately, Tailor could turn out to be a much better restaurant, but for now it is saddled with a bunch of reviews that are largely mixed to negative.Eater and NYJ both win $3 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Tailor, the first solo venture of the offbeat former WD-50 pastry chef, Sam Mason. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 6-1 One Star: 3-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 750-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: It has been a rough ride for Tailor. Mason's first mistake was chronicling his project in a Grub Street featurette called The Launch, thereby guaranteeing that the inevitable delays would make him look foolish, and ensuring the the restaurant would be so over-hyped that it could never live up to expectations.Then the reviews started coming in, and frankly, no critic yet has been wowed. Indeed, the two stars I gave it might even have been too generous. The problem was a menu limited to about half-a-dozen smallish savory courses and an equal number of desserts. When you give the customer so few options, practically all of them need to be knockouts. And that's a tough mark to hit when you're playing with flavors in funky ways that people aren't used to.According to Tailor's eGullet supporters, the menu has grown, which may be too little, too late. Bruni's impressions will likely have been based on the original menu, which in the view of most critics, didn't offer enough for a serious restaurant. The best items on Tailor's menu are surely worth two stars (if not more), but too many of Mason's best ideas are still in his head.Eater is taking the one-star odds today, which seems smart. Bruni seldom rates a place higher than the rest of his colleagues, and he has been no great fan of avant-garde cuisine.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Tailor.

Harry Cipriani sucks. Who knew? Today, Frank Bruni uncorks just the second POOR rating of his tenure:1Over the years the Cipriani restaurant family and its employees have faced charges of sexual harassment, insurance fraud and tax evasion, the last leading to guilty pleas by two family members in July.But the crime that comes to mind first when I think of the Ciprianis is highway robbery...and:But what I remember most vividly about that particular night is the potatoes. And I hasten to add that I'm taking it on faith that they were potatoes.That's what they visually suggested, those desiccated yellow-beige coins that had somehow acquired the texture of Brillo and could almost have been used to scrub whatever pan they had emerged from.We might well have expected this takedown, if only an online price list had been available. $66.95 for sirloin? $36.95 for lasagna? And what's with those prices that end in \".95\" when dinner costs as much as a car payment? The word that comes to mind is tacky.Eater and NYJ both thought that Frank Bruni would award one star, and we both lose a dollar.

Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Harry Cipriani, the home of Italian cuisine for Upper East Side lovelies with trust funds, and also home to the worst restaurant website in the Western World. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 50-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: It seems the Bruni is running out of new restaurants to look at, as this is his second re-review in three weeks. He thought to himself, \"What do my readers want? [Pause for reflection.] Aha! I have it! An Italian restaurant.\" So for what feels like the 40th time this year, Bruni is reviewing his favorite cuisine.The Times last reviewed Harry Cipriani in May 1991, when Bryan Miller awarded two stars. When Bruni re-reviews, there's usually a rating change. No one has suggested that Harry Cipriani has gotten better in the last sixteen years, and lately its owners have been more worried about a conviction for tax evasion than with running a restaurant.I can't find an online menu, but even in 1991 most entrees were priced above $30. At those prices, Bruni demands excellence, and he probably won't find it here. I agree with Eater that the Four Seasons, which Bruni demoted to two stars, and which is the better restaurant, sets the ceiling that Harry Cipriani cannot pierce. On top of that, Bruni has awarded two stars recently to L'Impero and Insieme, and he won't rate Harry Cipriani equal to those standouts.Will it fall all the way to zero? It would be a very real possibility, but for one thing: it's Italian food, which means Bruni surely will find something to love.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Harry Cipriani.

***CONTENT
Note: L'Impero closed on June 29, 2008, re-opening in mid-July as Convivio.L'Impero is the Italian restaurant that put chef Scott Conant on the map, when in 2002 Eric Asimov awarded three stars-a remarkable accomplishment for a non-Italian chef. Three years later, Conant and his partners created Alto, which was supposed to be the next step up. Asimov liked it, but Frank Bruni, the man in charge of the stars these days, did not. He gave Alto a disappointing two stars in 2005, finding it \"haute and bothered.\"Conant and the two restaurants parted company in 2007, with Michael White (formerly of Fiamma) taking over. This gave Bruni the chance to correct his mistake, and Alto was finally given the three stars it deserved in the first place. But the laws of Newtonian Mechanics as applied to restaurants dictate that every star given must be taken away, so L'Impero was simultaneously demoted to two stars.To be sure, L'Impero needs to work harder for our affections. It's located in a small elevated enclave called Tudor City on the far east side, a block west of the United Nations. It's not convenient to mass transit, and if you're walking (as I was) you could very well miss it. When Tudor City was built in the 1920s, there were slaughterhouses on the land the U.N. now occupies, which is why the three-square-block area is so isolated. Today, it seems like a city within a city.The decor gives the impression that it's about twenty years too old. Bruni found it \"lugubrious,\" while my sense was that I'd missed a party that was hip and cool a long, long time ago. The pleated curtains along the wall could use a spring cleaning; the light blue chairs are comfortable, but decidedly un-stylish.The staff at L'Impero provide generally fine service, but they could use some polish. When a runner dropped off the amuse-bouche, his description was almost incomprehensible (except that it was a sweetbread something-or-other). We were twice asked for our wine order, even though we didn't yet have menus in our hands, and didn't know what we'd be eating. After I chose a wine, the server instantly replied, \"Oh, we're out of that.\" However, the wine steward suggested a substitute at around the same price, and then decanted it.The dinner menu is available à la carte, or $64 for four courses. Judging by the portion sizes we saw, you'd better have a big appetite if you order the prix fixe. If ordered separately, all menu categories are quite reasonable for the quality and quantity given: antipasti are $14-17, pastas $23-27, entrees $29-42 (most in the low $30s). In contrast, the four-course prix fixe at Alto is $79, and the top prices there are all proportionately higher. Amuse-bouche (left); Polenta with house-made pork sausage (right)We started with a grilled sweatbread, which was more substantial than one normally gets in an amuse-bouche. Creamy soft polenta ($15) topped with a house-made pork sausage ragu and pecorino cheese was rather unmemorable. But substitute orecchiette for polenta, and you've got the pasta dish my girlfriend ordered ($24), which was the hit of the evening. Loin and sausage of lamb (left); Dry aged beef (right)Both of the entrees we chose were unadventurous, but impeccably prepared. I had the loin and sausage of lamb ($34). My girlfriend had the dry-aged beef ($42), which was that rare example of beef outside a steakhouse that is actually worth ordering.Despite the slightly inconvenient location, L'Impero appeared to be doing well. The restaurant was full on a Friday night, with a good mix of young people and Upper East Side elders. Just about everything we had was prepared to a high level, but the pasta stole the show.L'Impero (45 Tudor City Place at 42nd Street, Tudor City)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Kalina via EaterI'm late to the party with a review of Soto, the new Sushi temple in Greenwich Village. Nearly all of the critics in town have already weighed in with the most enthusiastic reviews of the season so far. Ed Levine found it possibly \"the best Japanese restaurant in New York\" (though he admitted he's not tried several of the major candidates), and Frank Bruni awarded a fairly enthusiastic two stars. Adam Platt was the only mildly dissenting voice, finding it \"good but not fabulous.\"Soto's menu of composed sushi plates (top) and cooked items (bottom)Sotohiro Kosugi served his inventive omakase for eleven years in an Atlanta strip mall, drawing a nationwide reputation before deciding to try his hand on New York's grander stage. He engaged Hiromi Tsuruta (Momofuku, Jewel Bako) to design the space in a Sixth Avenue storefront so unassuming that you could quite easily walk right by without realizing it is a restaurant.The menu, reprinted daily, has two pages of composed dishes, half of them from the sushi bar, the other half from the kitchen. They're anywhere from $10-28, with most around $18-20. You won't get out of Soto cheaply, as it takes at least four or five of these to make up a full meal.The composed items vary quite a bit in size, and we were somewhat on our own to figure out how much to order. The back page of the menu has standard sushi pieces and rolls at standard prices, and I agree with Frank Bruni that these are competent, but unremarkable.Levine reported an omakase, which ran $300 for two (tax and tip included), but when I visited last week, the menu stated that the restaurant \"will be serving our Tasting course and Pre fixe [sic] menu in the future.\" So we ordered à la carte, a mixture of the composed plates and standard sushi items.Top marks go to uni ika sugomori zukuri, a sea urchin wrapped in thinly sliced squid and shiso, served with a quail egg and soy reduction. My colleagues and I agreed this was the dish of the evening, if not the dish of the century, though it is $24 and was gone after a few bites. We also loved salmon citrus, which offered cured fresh Scottish salmon on a scallion pancake in citrus sauce, but again, it was $18 for only a few bites. Among the hot dishes, tempura ($18) was light and delicate, and with six pieces one of the better values on the menu.The standard sushi items were, as I have mentioned, unmemorable. However, the back page did offer a terrific Tuna Tartare roll ($16), made with asian pear, cucumber, avocado, sesame, and pine nuts, with a visually striking wrap of white kep.Service was first-rate, with fresh plates delivered with every course, and all of the composed dishes were presented beautifully. However, those dishes are labor-intensive, and there were often long pauses between courses. The wine list, as you'd expect, has an ample selection of sakes, but oddly enough, just as many Western wines. We selected a sake, of course, and the server ensured our glasses stayed full-which served our purpose, as well as hers.I found the space somewhat sterile, but it certainly didn't matter once the food started grabbing our attention. I'd love to come back and explore more of the menu, but I must say that at these prices it will have to wait until I am in the mood to splurge.Soto (357 Sixth Avenue between Washington Place and W. 4th Street, Greenwich Village)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: *½Overall: **½

Today, Frank Bruni awards two stars to Pamplona:The publicity pitch and chatter that attended the transformation of the not-so-old restaurant Urena into the not-exactly-new restaurant Pamplona boiled down to something like this: the chef Alex Urena gets real...Pamplona is Urena with an attitude adjustment, and I emphasize the word adjustment. Mr. Urena hasn't wholly reinvented the restaurant or himself. He's still interpreting Spanish cuisine, and - lucky for us - still indulging his fanciful impulses.Bruni has never been a fan of fine dining, so I'm not surprised that chef Alex Urena managed to hold onto two stars, despite dialing down the ambitions of the restaurant. Bruni's two stars are consistent with my own impression, when I visited a couple of weeks ago.The Eater oddsmakers are seldom off by much, but today's review was an exception, with Eater actually offering better odds on zero stars than two. On our hypothetical $1 bets, New York Journal wins $5 at 5-1 odds, while Eater loses a dollar. And for the first time in quite a while, NYJ's won-lost record has caught up with Eater's.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Pamplona, the downmarket follow-up to the wonderful, but alas unsuccessful, Urena. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: 50-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Bruni loved the food at Pamplona's predecessor, Urena, awarding two stars. Like almost everyone else, he hated the ambiance. I don't have a photographic memory for decor, but when I visited it certainly seemed like the space had been spruced up a bit. Against that, the food is no longer as ambitious as it was, though it is still a cut above your run-of-the-mill tapas bar.This situation will leave Senor Bruni in a quandary. If he awards two stars again, it implies that the dumbing down of the food doesn't matter. But if he awards one star, he condemns Pamplona to the ratings never-never-land, for despite the nominal definition, one star never truly means good. This is one of those days when Bruni probably wishes he could award half-stars.The Eater oddsmakers have concluded that a review at the low end of one star is a virtual certainty, offering just 2-1 odds on that outcome, and rating the chance of zero stars higher than two. I think Bruni will be truly torn between one and two stars here. He adored Urena's cooking the last time, and he is always rooting for earnest family-owned restaurants to succeed.The Bet: We're on the fence here, and wouldn't mind if we were pulled away from blogging by an emergency phone call, which would spare us from having to place a bet. But place one we will, on two stars.

[Kalina via Eater]The so-called Mexican food we eat in America is nothing like the real McCoy: that much I learned on a business trip to Mexico City a few years ago. Bulls' testicles, corn fungus, and fried worms were among the items on order. (I tried the first two, but gave the third a pass.)At the new midtown restaurant Toloache (pronounced to-lo-AH-chay), you can order Tacos Chapulines, which feature sun-dried grasshoppers. Reviewers Paul Adams and Andrea Strong tried them, and you'll find a photo here. My girlfriend and I weren't about to touch them with a ten-foot pole, but ironically, it was this menu item-along with the foie gras tacos, which I did have-that made me think that Toloache was worth a visit.It's a striking space on two levels, in a neighborhood that's normally dead to fine dining. The restaurant has white tablecloths and cloth napkins, but a theater district vibe and hustling waiters who call you a caballero. We arrived without a reservation at around 6:30 on a Friday evening and managed to secure one of the few tables not spoken for. I started with a drink advertised as a pumpkin margarita, but my girlfriend and I agreed there was no perceptible taste of pumpkin.The menu is in multiple sections: guacamoles ($11), ceviches ($10-17), appetizers from the brick oven ($8-13), tacos ($8-14), small plates ($8-10), entrees ($18-26), and side dishes ($3-7). We weren't that hungry, and settled on a ceviche and a taco order apiece, with a side of rice & beans. Our server insisted that wasn't enough, and talked us into ordering a mid-course, which was more than we needed, although his suggestion was the best item we had. Ceviche Atun (left); Mini pumpkin with crabmeat (right)Chef Julian Medina throws a lot of ingredients together; it doesn't always work. Ceviche Atun had spicy yellowfin tuna, key lime, vidalia onion, radish, and watermelon. I like spicy food, but the tuna was overwhelmed. In my girlfriend's shrimp ceviche, the flavor balance worked better.The next dish was the item our server \"upsold\" us. Lump crabmeat and pumpkin came served inside a hot miniature pumpkin, with tortilla chips on the side. This inspiration looked like orange guacamole. There were some cool spots inside, suggestive of uneven heating, but it was still the best thing we had at Toloache. Foie Gras tacos (left); Rice & beans (right)Foie gras tacos seemed, too, to suffer from too many ingredients: foie gras, refried beans, mango, red onion, and chipotle salsa. There was nothing wrong with the dish-how far wrong can you go with foie gras?-but it felt like a gimmick. Our side of rice & beans was fairly standard, and we didn't finish it.The restaurant is geared up to serve lots of people in a hurry. We noted tables turning fairly rapidly. There are probably some quality issues in the kitchen: in addition to our crabmeat salad not quite fully heated, we noted that a dish was sent back at the table next to us. There are a lot of clever ideas at Toloache, but you might need a bit of luck to put together a fully satisfying meal.Toloache (251 W. 50th St. between Eighth Avenue & Broadway, Theater District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

There's no mystery behind the name 26 Seats: it's the capacity of a sweet little East Village restaurant. It's the kind of quiet French bistro that we like to think the Parisians have on every street. New York ought to have more like it. In the Times, Eric Asimov liked it too, when he reviewed it for $25 and Under in April 2001.A friend and I had a leisurely dinner there last week. The menu had few surprises, but it's nice (for a change) to walk into a place where you're not greeted by a hostess at a computer terminal, where the person seating you remembers your reservation without having to look it up in a book, and where an 8:00 table is yours for the evening.It's friendly on the pocketbook too, with appetizers $6-8, entrees $11-16.50, and desserts $6.50. Wines, I believe, were around $7 a glass for a generous pour, and the server happily accommodated us when, near the end of the evening, we asked to split a glass.I ordered a duck confit (around $14), which was nothing special, but at that price one can hardly complain. Service was professional and friendly. The space is cozy, but perhaps that is part of the charm.26 Seats (168 Avenue B between 10th & 11th Streets, East Village)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: *

F.illi Ponte

***CONTENT
This week, I dined at F.illi Ponte for the first time in over three years. It was a business dinner, and I wasn't focused on reviewing, but I felt it would be worth recording my impression.A bit of history is in order. In 1967, Ponte's steakhouse opened in what was then a remote corner of TriBeCa. The restaurant needed signs visible from the West Side Highway to lure diners, who must have felt a bit brave about even venturing into the neighborhood. A colleague mentioned the other night that, twenty years ago, he could have had a condo in the area for $90,000. Today, it would cost millions.In the mid-1990s, the grandson of the original owner remodeled the space, stripping down the walls to reveal the original brick, and installing broad picture windows facing the Hudson. Rechristened F.illi Ponte (meaning \"Ponte Brothers\"), in 1995, it won an enthusiastic two stars from Ruth Reichl in the Times. But by 2002, Eric Asimov served up a double-demotion to \"Satisfactory,\" noting that the restaurant was \"coasting.\" I rated it at 1½ stars on my last visit.The last time I came this way, most of the old warehouses nearby were in the process of being converted to condos. Most of those conversions are now completed. Though the surrounding streets still don't get much foot traffic, F.illi Ponte no longer feels like it's in no-man's land. The neighborhood has caught up to the restaurant.The space is on two levels, but a bar on the ground floor seems to be unused, except for special events. I noted a large display of pumpkins, then went upstairs to the main bar area, which is large and comfortable, with plush sofas that could be a friend's living room.After drinks, our party of eight moved to the dining room, which is beautifully appointed, with spectacular Hudson River views at night. The staff suggested a selection of appetizers and pastas served family-style. Their choices were mostly old-school, but updated for the season. A pumpkin ravioli was the highlight, but old standards like a plump searee scallop, or tomato salad with mozzarella, were executed perfectly.A salmon entree came with a crunchy herb crust, but the sauce pooled on the side wasn't quite enough to compensate for a fish that was slightly dry. That error may have been an anomaly, though, as I heard no other complaints at the table.With all entrees at $30 and up, pastas at $25 and up, the cost of dinner at F.illi Ponte can mount rapidly. There are some bargains on the wine list, though-at least in relative terms. I found a great 2001 Barolo at $100 a bottle. In many Italian restaurants, you can't touch the Barolos for less than $150.Service was excellent, but with the dining room well under half full on a Tuesday evening, the staff were able to give us their full attention. There were none of the service glitches that I noted on my earlier visit, or that Asimov noted in his 2002 re-review.F.illi Ponte isn't one of the city's pathbreaking Italian restaurants, but it won't disappoint you either, and it offers one of the best views in the city.F.illi Ponte (39 Debrosses Street at West Street, TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: **½Ambiance: ***Overall: **

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni does the do-se-do with Alto and L'Impero, taking a star from the latter and giving it to the former:L'Impero and Alto remain vital restaurants, worthy of the attention of anyone who cares about serious Italian cooking. Alto, in fact, is better than ever...L'Impero is now the restaurant with the more lugubrious air, all of that pleated drapery along the walls evoking the upholstered interior of a very large coffin.I can neither agree nor disagree with Bruni here, as my visit to Alto dates from the Conant era, and I have never yet visited L'Impero. These are Italian restaurants, and from Bruni one naturally expected the stars to be twinkling this week. Coincidentally, I made reservations at L'Impero for a week from Friday-before knowing that Bruni would be reviewing it. Could there be a paranormal psychic channel between us? The mind shudders.On our hypothetical $1 bets, Eater and I win $2 at L'Impero and $3 at Alto, for a whopping $5 payoff this week.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni gives us an haute Italian two-fer: L'Impero and Alto. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): L'ImperoZero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 5-1 Two Stars: 2-1 √√Three Stars: 4-1 Four Stars: 10,000-1 AltoZero Stars: 9-1 One Star: 5-1 Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 3-1 √√Four Stars: 8,000-1The Skinny: L'Impero was the restaurant that put Scott Conant on the map when Eric Asimov awarded three stars in December 2002-a rare accomplishment for a non-Italian chef, to say the least. In 2005, Conant opened Alto, this time focusing on northern Italian cuisine. Frank Bruni gave it a brutal two-star review. It was a devastating takedown for a restaurant that was supposed to be more upscale than L'Impero. Not long thereafter, Eater put Alto deathwatch, but defying the odds, it has remained open-thriving, even. Earlier this year, Conant left both restaurants, with Michael White, formerly of the three-star Fiamma, replacing him.This week's duo is tough to assess, but I am leaning towards the same conclusions as Eater. L'Impero flies well below the radar these days, which suggests it is no longer among this town's elite. Bruni loves Italian, but he has given three stars to a lot of places. At some point, he's got to make distinctions, and L'Impero may be the one that doesn't make the cut.Normally, a re-review brings a change of rating. It's hard to imagine him liking Alto any less than last time, which suggests it has nowhere to go but up. Of course, White's arrival may be reason enough for the re-review, with or without a change of rating. But I thought that Bruni woefully mis-rated Alto last time, so this gives him the chance to right a wrong.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to L'Impero and three stars to Alto.

[Kalina via Eater] Note: This is a review of Allen & Delancey under chef Neil Ferguson, who abruptly left the restaurant in 2008, citing \"moral and personal reasons.\" His replacement is Kyle Bailey, who has worked previously at Cru and Blue Hill at Stone Barns. It will not be easy for the restaurant to hold on to its Michelin star, but the selection of Bailey suggests they want to try. The new restaurant Allen & Delancey had one of those star-crossed births that give restaurant owners nightmares. It was announced for the Fall of 2006 with former Craftbar chef Akhtar Nawab at the helm. Then, an investor pulled out, and the project seemed dead...or was it? A year later, Allen & Delancey has finally opened, with Neil Ferguson in the kitchen. Ferguson is the chef that was canned after the critics demolished Gordon Ramsay at the London. Ramsay is still alive and kicking with a new chef de cuisine, while at A&D you can enjoy, at less than half the price, the chef whom Gordon Ramsay thought was capable of earning four stars. The space has been beautifully decked out, but it's so dark you should bring a flashlight to read the menu. Ferguson keeps things simple, with just seven appetizers ($12-18) and seven entrees ($22-29). The similarity to the menu at Gordon Ramsay is striking: not a lot of fireworks, but simple things are done well. Terrine of Guinea Hen (left); Cabbage, Beef and Onion (right) My girlfriend and I both started with the Terrine of Guinea Hen, Smoked Ham Knuckle, Foie Gras, and Beetroot ($18). It takes a sure hand to make all of those ingredients work, but Ferguson managed it. I probably wouldn't have chosen Cabbage, Beef and Onion ($29), had not the server recommended it. This is the kind of dish that got Ferguson in trouble at Gordon Ramsay. It's a technically impeccable presentation that doesn't have much oomph. I was pleased with it, but perhaps some people will say that it doesn't deserve to be a nearly $30 entree. The major critics have yet to weigh in on Allen & Delancey. The staff, who are all excited about the restaurant, mentioned that both Adam Platt and Frank Bruni visited earlier in the week. I can only hope that Ferguson gets a fair shake this time. Allen & Delancey deserves to succeed. Allen & Delancey (115 Allen Street at Delancey Street, Lower East Side) Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

San Domenico

***CONTENT
Note: San Domenico has closed. The owners plan to re-open the restaurantin 2009 in a new location, and under a new name, SD26.I've always been a little hesitant about visiting San Domenico. It advertises more than most restaurants. You can hardly see anything at Lincoln Center without running across the distinctive San Domenico logo in your program. Now, I've nothing against advertising, but I figured a place that needs to sell itself so aggressively must not have enough adoring regulars. And that's a bad sign.On OpenTable, you can book San Domenico any day of the week, at almost any time you want-especially after 8:00 p.m., when the pre-theater crowd has departed. Another bad sign.But San Domenico gets respect in the local press (New York rates it a critic's pick), and many a fine Italian chef has passed through its kitchen. So I figured it was finally time to give it a try.San Domenico has been offering luxe Italian cuisine on Central Park South for almost twenty years. It earned an adoring three stars from Bryan Miller just six weeks after it opened in 1988, with a celebrity chef that had earned two Michelin stars in Italy. Two years later, that chef was gone, and Miller demoted it to two stars in 1991. Ruth Reichl, always generous with her ratings, bumped it back up to three stars in 1993.Owner Tony May (center), daughter Marisa May (left),and Chef Odette Fada (right)Since 1996, Odette Fada has been in the kitchen. William Grimes demoted San Domenico back down to two stars in 2003, finding that Fada \"continues to perform marvels,\" but that \"the dining room is working from a different script,\" noting a tourist atmosphere, \"aggressive salesmanship,\" and servers who \"begin calculating their tip almost as soon as they approach the table.\"Grimes also noted that sometimes \"the B team was at work\" in the kitchen, and we seem to have chosen such an evening to dine at San Domenico. But maybe something more fundamental is wrong here, because no restaurant charging as much as San Domenico should be as clueless as we found it.We began with drinks at the bar, served up by an old-school Italian bartender who took a while to notice we were there. When our table was ready, the service team insisted that my girlfriend's unfinished drink would follow, but it took more than five minutes to arrive.On the way to our table, the host was suddenly stopped by a more senior colleague, who berated him in Italian-for what sin I couldn't perceive. We were offered fresh cut vegetables and olive oil immediately, but the bread it was meant to go with (excellent, I should note) didn't arrive till quite a while later.The waiters who served us were Indian, and they had a huckstering quality about them that belonged on Restaurant Row in the theater district. Our main server kept bumping into things. Others would come along and ask the same question (more bread? tap or bottled water?) we'd already answered. Did we want wine by the bottle or by the glass? It's a crucial question, as there are separate menus for each option. I asked for wine by the bottle, and they brought both menus anyway. Bargains on the massive wine list are few, but I did find a great nebbiolo for $75, though with no help offered from the staff.The dinner menu comes, and it's a confusing jumble, with a lot of dishes to consider, and two loose inserts with additional choices, some of which are duplicated. One of those inserts is a white truffle menu. The server brings two truffles by our table, so we can see what they look like. If you go that route, you choose your food at the usual (very high) prices, and truffles are \"$9 per gram\" on top of that, with five grams recommended.Who among us knows what a gram of truffles looks like? In 1993, when truffles were only $5/gram, Florence Fabricant reported that they actually bring the scale to your table and weigh the truffle before and after. It sounds like a procedure more appropriate at a gas station.The pasta menu warns that dishes may be split, at an extra charge of $2.50. It seems almost churlish, when most of the pastas are around $25. Candlestick pasta in spicy sausage sauce (left); Suckling pig (right)To start, I had the nightly pasta special, described as \"artisanal candlestick shaped pasta with a reduced spicy sausage sauce and green peppers\" ($23.50). I was struck by the laziness of the plating, which would be unappetizing even at a diner. The pasta was undercooked and tough. The spicy sausage sauce packed some nice heat, but I didn't see any green peppers. And for the life of me, I couldn't perceive a \"candlestick\" shape; it just looked like large penne.My girlfriend was even more disgusted with a similar-looking pasta, likewise undercooked, that was supposed to include lobster, at a price of almost $30. There were just two dinky pieces of lobster in there, which hadn't been detached from their shells.We both ordered the suckling pig, an entree that's tough to screw up, but was somewhat dull in light of a price point north of $35, and again unimaginatively plated. (To be fair, I had already eaten a bit of it before I remembered to snap the photo above.)After all that, we weren't going to take any chances on desserts, which at around $14 apiece struck us as exorbitant, even by this restaurant's standards. After our meal, the server dropped off a plate of petits-fours, which were probably the best thing we had.The room seems a bit dated, but I suppose it could be charming if only the food and the service lived up to it. San Domenico is surely capable of doing better than this. Then again, maybe not. We certainly don't plan on trying it again anytime soon. At $300 (including tax and tip), we have better ways of spending our money.San Domenico (240 Central Park South between Seventh Avenue & Broadway, West Midtown)Food: unsatisfactoryService: classlessAmbiance: the perfect setting for a good meal that never arrivesOverall: disappointing

I missed the Mr. Chow moment. That was almost 30 years ago, when Michael Chow opened Mr. Chow in East Midtown, building on successes in London and Beverley Hills. It was supposed to be haute Chinese reinterpreted for a modern audience, but it was always more about people-watching. Mimi Sheraton was unimpressed when she awarded one star in the Times. When Mr. Chow opened a fourth branch last year in TriBeCa, Frank Bruni turned in a devastating zero-star review. Not that it mattered. Mr. Chow is still there.For 26 years, Philippe Chow (no relation) was the executive chef at Mr. Chow in midtown. Last year, he opened his own place just a few blocks away, and christened it Philippe. He hasn't waited long to expand, with an outpost in Mexico City, and branches in Miami and Las Vegas to come.Philippe was basically ignored by most of the critics in town. I believe Adam Platt was the only one who bothered, awarding zero stars. The menu is basically a clone of Mr. Chow. Philippe Chow's aim in life is not to challenge us with anything new, but simply to get a piece of the gravy train that the other Chow has been feeding on for so long. Nevertheless, Philippe does have some advantages: It is not as hideously over-priced as Mr. Chow. Chicken Lettuce Wrap (left); Whole Crispy Duck (right)To start, we had the Chicken Lettuce Wrap ($15), which my friend Kelly remembered fondly from Mr. Chow. I assume the mystery meat we were served was indeed chicken, but it had that bland generic taste of the take-out place down the street. Kelly said that it was nowhere as good as the wraps at Mr. Chow.Nearly all of the entrees are priced for two persons. We ordered the Crispy Duck ($54), served with the traditional pancakes, duck sauce, lettuce and scallions. Unlike the traditional Peking Duck (which Philippe also offers, at $65), this duck is deep-fried. It was presented whole, then dissected table-side. We were mightily impressed with the textural contrast between the crisp skin and the succulent, fatty duck meat. It was so tender that the server only needed two spoons to pull it off the bone.We also had an order of pork fried rice ($8) to share. It was gorgeously presented in a gleaming silver crockpot, but it wasn't warm enough, and it tasted like it had come out of the microwave. There is a tendency to upsell. We didn't finish anything we ordered-and, in the case of the duck, I was sorry to leave any of it behind. Nevertheless, our server tried his best to persuade us to order a second appetizer, which would have been truly a waste. After the duck was cleared, he brought a tray of dessert samples to our table, a practice normally encountered only at low-class restaurants.Nevertheless, we did take the plunge on dessert, and I wasn't sorry we did. Kelly was happy with a chocolate eclair (right), and I enjoyed an orange-carrot tart (left), both beautifully plated.It's hard to rate Philippe, because the duck was first-class and the desserts were very good, but our appetizer and fried rice were no better than mediocre take-out. But plenty of places in town are less expensive and more consistent.Philippe (30 E. 60th Street between Park & Madison Avenues, East Midtown)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awards one star to Moim, a four-month-old Korean restaurant in Park Slope:Moim does a tempered, tweaked version of Korean cooking that's still rarer - still more of an exciting discovery - than you'd expect, given all the Momofuku mania. Many of its dishes, distinguished by a beautifully modulated and lingering heat, are compelling. Most are at least satisfying...And the prices at Moim - $4 to $10 for small plates, $8 to $22 for larger ones - amply reflect its liberation from Manhattan rents.This is Bruni at his best, calling attention to a good restaurant without resorting to star inflation. And, in a rarity for him, discovering a place not already discovered by others.Eater and I both win at 3-1 odds on our hypothetical $1 bets.

When the restaurant Urena opened last year, it quickly earned a place in the hearts of adoring foodies, but not, alas, their pocketbooks. Stuck on a drab block without much foot traffic, chef Alex Urena closed earlier this year, re-opening after a brief makeover as the more downmarket Pamplona. Gone are the foams, the foie gras, and the degustation menu. A tapas menu and hearty comfort food replace them. Salt Cod Croquettes and Dates wrapped in Bacon (left); Confit Suckling Pig (right)I started with a couple of tapas. Salt Cod Croquettes ($5) were were delicate and not at all heavy. Dates wrapped in Bacon ($4) offered a well judged mixture of sweet and savory. None of the tapas were over $6, and on a list of appetizers none were over $12.Among the entrees ($18-24), I was intrigued by the \"Hamburguesa,\" evidently a hamburger made with beef and suckling pig. However, there are several entrees for two, and we were drawn to the Cochinillo, or config suckling pig, a tender brick of braised pig at $35 for two-Urena had offered a similar dish at $25 for one.Like the rest of the menu, the wine list at Pamplona is fairly priced. I forgot what we paid for the wine pictured at right, but it was reasonable, and as it went well with our food, I thought I'd show the label. The restaurant was full on a Saturday night. Everything we tried was prepared to a high standard, but it is hearty, uncomplicated, and not likely to challenge diners very much. That just might be what Alex Urena's customers want right now. We'd rather see him succeed at something-even if it's not the ambitious restaurant he had before.Service was competent, but it felt a bit rushed. The decor at Urena was much scoffed at. Even after the makeover, no one would call it a romantic spot, but the hard edges of the lighting seem to have been smoothed, and it is now a perfectly pleasant inexpensive restaurant.Pamplona (37 E. 28th Street between Park & Madison Avenues, Gramercy)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

I found out about TBar Steak & Lounge via an Eater post, which lampooned the place for its dorky decor. I wouldn't normally go to the Upper East Side for a steakhouse, as there are plenty of great ones in my neck of the woods, but hey, I was feeling adventurous.The good news is that it's nowhere near as dorky-looking in real life as it looks in that Citysearch photo. And the restaurant seems to be doing well. When I walked in at around 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday without a reservation, they could seat me only in the lounge. That was just fine: the lounge is spacious and comfortable.The bad news is that they're serving USDA Choice at a Prime tariff. I took one bite of my Ribeye Steak ($42), and I knew immediately it wasn't headed for the pantheon. The conversation with my server was almost surreal.\"Excuse me. Is this prime or choice?\"She looked at me with a puzzled stare. \"In terms of...what?\"\"Have you heard of Prime beef, versus Choice beef?\"\"Uh, no.\"\"Can you ask the kitchen if it's Prime or Choice?\"By this point, I already knew the answer. At any restaurant serving Prime beef, the servers know it. Her response, a few moments later, was just a formality: \"It's Choice.\"For a Choice steak, it wasn't bad. But it was $42, which is as much as, or more than, many restaurants charge for aged Prime. Any steak-lover will instantly know the difference.I also ordered the Potato Cake ($12), a luscious creation made with potatoes and gruyère (upper left in the photo). Servers were young and friendly. And obviously not schooled in the difference between Prime and Choice.TBar Steak & Lounge (1278 Third Avenue between 73rd & 74th Streets, Upper East Side)Food: SatisfactoryService: Satisfactory, but the servers aren't meat scholarsAmbiance: GoodOverall: Overpriced, for what they're serving

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Moim, the four-month-old Park Slope Korean. The Eater oddsmadkers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 3-1 √√Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 50-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: This week's Bruni target is something of a wild card. The owners, Kiho Park and Saeri Yoo Park, were featured a couple of months ago in a New York Times piece about their Park Slope brownstone, but I could not find a single review of their restaurant. The chef, Saeri Yoo, has some serious credentials, with stints at Spice Market, Cafe Gray and The Modern.Bruni has never issued a zero-star review outside of Manhattan. Given the rarity of his outer-borough visits, it would be silly to write a review only to say, \"Don't bother,\" especially for a restaurant that the other critics had already ignored. So you can bet that Bruni is going to be fairly enthusiastic. The only question is: one star or two?Bruni definitely has a two-star bias when he reviews an earnest out-of-the-way family-owned place. It has happened over & over again. You can bet that when he walked in the door, he was itching to pull the trigger on two stars. Is Moim good enough? Eater seems to have a good point: if it were that good, surely it couldn't have flown under-the-radar for so long.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award an enthusiastic one star to Moim.

Today, Frank Bruni loves the fried food at Centro Vinoteca, but there's enough wrong with everything else to knock the restaurant down to one star:Here's the ordering guide you need for Centro Vinoteca: if you see the word fried, or if you see any apparent derivation of the Italian word fritto (which means fried), or if you see a word that calls to mind either of those other ones (e.g. fritter), get whatever it's attached to. And get anything else that you suspect may be fried.For quite a while, you're sure Bruni has boarded the two-star train. He loves the piccolini (which means \"very small things\"), though he's irritated that they're listed on a separate menu:An annoyance in addition to the deafening commotion is the presentation of that piccolini card apart from the rest of the menu, so that you can't evaluate your interest in these snacks, which take on a compulsory air, before you've seen your other options. Is this method designed to guarantee larger aggregate food orders and higher tabs?The complaints mount, and we realize Centro Vinoteca doesn't have the angels on its side:Ms. Burrell went overboard with a sloppy, heavy amalgam of lamb Bolognese, fried onions and fried gnocchi - it's the fried exception that proves the fried rule. Her judgment erred as well with overly bitter broccoli rabe and Swiss chard ravioli.Eater made the very reasonable guess that a Mario Batali protegee would get a sloppy, wet, two-star kiss from Frank, but it wasn't to be-proving that even a Batali connection is no guarantee of Frank's undying love.

Recently, a friend suggested dinner in the iconic Oyster Bar & Restaurant at Grand Central Terminal. I'd never dined there, and I suppose this is one of those experiences-like a walk in Central Park-that everyone must have, at least once. The walk in Central Park is an experience you'll more likely repeat. Here, the fabled Guastavino ceiling is instantly impressive, but I don't understand why they spoil the atmosphere with red-and-white checked tablecloths that would look cheesy even in Red Lobster.Oyster Bar's Long MenuThe Oyster Bar has been around since 1913. I didn't do an exhaustive search for reviews, but I noted that Bryan Miller of the Times awarded one star in 1989, and William Grimes demoted it to Fair (two notches below one star) in 2002. Miller noted an earlier two-star review in 1985, which I didn't try to find. Its most recent write-up was a Diner's Journal piece by Sam Sifton in May 2004, after a strike had shuttered the restaurant for 112 days during the preceding winter and spring, finding a bit more to like than Grimes did.The menu is about three times longer than it should be. Reprinted daily, it comes on a broadsheet that takes about 20 minutes to read. No restaurant could possibly offer so many items, and expect to excel at all of them. A month of dinners at the Oyster Bar wouldn't be sufficient to get through it all.Both Grimes and Sifton agreed that the bar is superior to the tables, but we were ignorant of that advice, and sat in the dining room (which, in any case, was better suited to our party of three). While we waited for the third in our party to arrive, my friend and I shared the completely forgettable Fried Oysters with Tartar Sauce ($8.95; above left). The Smokehouse Sampler ($23.95; above right) features Atlantic Salmon, Pacific Sturgeon, Brook Trout, horseradish cream and capers. Once again, I was struck by the blandness of it.One of my friends ordered the New England Clam Chowder ($5.75), which she loved. The other ordered the Trio of Cheeses ($8; pictured left), which he enjoyed. There are probably some wonderful things among the 100+ choices at the Oyster Bar, but I wouldn't recommend either of the ones I tried.Service was not particularly attentive, but everything we ordered came out fairly quickly. There are some unusual bottled beers, and in his review Grimes had good things to say about the wine list. We contented ourselves with some port after dinner.Oyster Bar & Restaurant (Lower Level, Grand Central Terminal, East Midtown)Food: BlandService: AcceptableAmbiance: It's a train stationOverall: Ho-hum

The Oyster Bar is actually one of the easiest places in New York to develope a strategy for: do NOT order flat fish. Do NOT order prepared foods, except as stated hereinafter. Order ONLY: from the raw bar or soups, stews, and pan roasts.If you follow that advice, you can actually eat quite well there.

Agreed on all accounts. This place seems reliant on its past and the volume of individuals coming through. Its never pretty when people are resting on laurels. I do love the ceiling though. You really can't get a more New York space that is dynamic.

You could easily walk right by Smith & Mills, and I nearly did. I was actually on my way to another restaurant when I saw a tiny little space I'd never noticed before. I had no reservation that evening, so I changed my plans and gave this new spot a try. I had no trouble getting seated immediately when I wandered in at around 7:00 p.m., but later on the place filled up.The space, which was formerly a garage, and was a stable before that, is decorated with faux rusticity that is persuasive enough that you'd think the place had been there forever, but it has only been open four months. It earned two stars from Randall Lane in Time Out New York, and a strong write-up from Peeter Meehan in the Times. I suspect most of the clientele is local. There is no sign on the outside. The couple seated next to me said that they, too, had found it only by accident. Even the name is cloaked in mystery: it's not printed on the menu. When I asked, the server said there's no one involved that's actually named \"Smith\" or \"Mills\"; someone just liked those names.The server said that the cuisine was \"Rustic European.\" I suppose that's accurate. House cured salmon ($13) was quite respectable, and I very much enjoyed the seasonable vegetable soup ($6).I'm afraid I've forgotten the dessert ($6): an apple cake, I believe, with cheese drizzled on top. The skimpy wine list was short on specifics, but the house sancerre ($12) and bordeaux ($14) were just fine.There doesn't seem to be a kitchen. All of the food is prepared behind the bar, which explains why most of the offerings (everything but the soup) are served cold. There are only seven tables, but service was almost excruciatingly slow, even in the early part of my meal, when most of the seats were still empty. It's a pleasant space to kick back and relax, but be prepared to wait.I don't normally comment on bathrooms, but this one had to be mentioned. It's built into the original freight elevator, and like the rest of the restaurant, is made to look like it has been there forever. The toilet is kept clean, but the \"tilt\" sink is arguably a bit gross.Smith & Mills doesn't break any new culinary ground, but it's a welcome casual addition in a neighborhood where most of the dining options are expensive. Three courses and two glasses of wine set me back just $51 (before tax and tip). Credit cards aren't accepted.Smith & Mills (71 N.

Today, Frank Bruni is smitten with Park Avenue Autumn, turning in a quite enthusiastic two-star review.It's not often that I have the feeling that Bruni and I dined at different places. If I've dined there at around the same time, I usually feel like he's describing the same experience as I had. When my rating is different, it's because I weigh the value of that experience differently, not because I feel he's describing something alien.But today, Bruni's enthusiasm for Park Avenue Autumn is truly unrecognizable in relation to the very mediocre meal we had there not long ago. I can only assume that we caught the restaurant on an off-night: such things can happen.Unfortunately, it means I am a loser today, and Eater is a winner on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater wins $4 at 4-1 odds, while I lose $1. Eater NYJBankroll$49.50 $53.67Gain/Loss+4.00 -1.00Total$53.50 $52.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost21-5 19-7

So sorry - I usually agree with you but on this one Bruni is spot on; same with eater. I have been to park ave three times now and while the service on the first day of the change over was slightly jumbled the rest of the experience on all three accounts was very good.Agreed that the food has hits and misses. Changing the menu this often seems to bring that risk. I mostly had hits with the food though. Not a fan of the truffle though which is priced high.Your take on the design of the space felt waaaaaay off. Again, I am with Bruni on this one. The space was very inventive and fresh, but also comfortable. That means a lot to me. I felt this again with the Fall design. This is the restaurants biggest asset and is incredibly well done, but also thoughtful which is rare.

Note: As of May 2008 Abboccato was apparently searching for a new chef de cuisine.For me, Abboccato was a \"when I get around to it\" restaurant - a place that looked interesting, but not enough to make it a special priority. Well, I finally got around to it, and it turns out Abboccato is terrific. I should have tried it a lot sooner, and so should you.Abboccato comes from the Livanos family-the same folks that run Oceana and Molyvos. It's not a bad trio to be associated with. The chef is Jim Bostacos, who has bounced around town, and earned three stars at Molyvos. But he's half Italian, and he made the hop to Abboccato, where the Livanos gave him more creative control.In October 2005, Marian Burros of The New York Times (subbing for the vacationing Bruni) awarded a fairly enthusiastic two stars, finding considerable potential, but a few dishes over or under-salted. In New York, Adam Platt (in the days before he awarded stars) liked the place too, but found the menu overly long and complicated-a problem many Italian restaurants seem to have these days.The menu seems to have undergone some editing since then; it is now a more focused document than Platt found it. There are the obvious categories of antipasti ($14-16), primi ($22-26), secondi and whole fish ($32-38), and side dishes ($8). There is also a pre-theater prix fixe (we arrived too late to sample it), and a pasta tasting menu at $55 per person.Whether Marian Burros's complaints have been addressed is harder to judge on one visit, but everything we tasted was without fault. To start, we shared an order of the ravioli ($22). Silky-smooth pasta pillows were lined with wild greens, and glazed with a riccotta and bone marrow butter sauce. We moved on to the branzino for two ($70). The server presented the whole fish for inspection, then whisked it away to be filleted. There was nothing complicated here, but there didn't need to be. The fish was simply grilled, with olive oil and rosemary, and served with a garnish of crushed olives.We finished up with the Mascarpone Cheese Cake ($9), topped (improbably) with a strawberry-pink peppercorn sauce that managed to work, despite the odd name.There were a couple of odd service issues near the beginning of the meal: a too-eager server taking our wine order before we'd even been shown menus; bread served without butter or olive oil. But things settled down after that.The restaurant was not even close to full at prime time on a Saturday night, and that's too bad: Abboccato deserves much more attention.Abboccato (136 W. 55th Street between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, West Midtown)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Much as I disagree with Bruni sometimes, our ratings have seldom been more than one star apart. That alone would incline me to take the one-star bet.On top of that, Bruni is seldom enthralled with \"scene-y\" places, which this unquestionably is. And he also tends to punish (as he should) high-priced restaurants with uneven performance, which I also think this is.The Bet: We are betting that Frank Bruni will award one star to Park Avenue Autumn.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Grayz.Whatever he does, Gray Kunz seems to take his time. After he left the four-star Lespinasse, it was six years until he opened a new restaurant, Cafe Gray, which was much delayed-the last to appear of the originally announced restaurants in the Time-Warner Center.Then, Grayz was announced. The Times featured it in their September 2006 fall dining preview section. In October, the Post broke the story that plans had been scrapped, apparently due to a dispute with the construction company. In January, it was back on again. Two weeks ago, Grayz finally opened in the former Aquavit space, in the landmarked 19th-century Rockefeller townhouse.I have never warmed up to Cafe Gray. While no one would dispute Kunz's talent as a chef, the restaurant is crowded, loud, and distinctly unpleasant. I dined there twice, and wasn't happy either time. For his next venture, I hoped that Kunz would open the kind of refined restaurant that his breathtaking talent deserves, but with Grayz he has gone in the opposite direction. It's mainly a catering place, with a lively bar that serves finger food. Kunz's finger food may beat everyone else's, but Grayz is still a place for...well, grazing, not dining.Frank Bruni previewed Grayz in a June blog post. He included a sample menu, which is fairly close to what Grayz is offering now. He described it as \"a theater for fancy private parties.\" The dinner concept, according to a publicist, is \"one big cocktail party.\" The lunch menu is supposed to be more traditional (which would be wise), but Bruni had no lunch menu to show, and as far as I know the lunch service hasn't yet begun.Bread service I was seated immediately when I walked in at around 6:00 p.m. on a Thursday evening, but an hour later the place was packed. Kunz's catering strategy had already paid dividends, as the downstairs room was booked for a private party by the accounting firm KPMG-not bad for a restaurant that had only been open for 10 days.The menu offers nine appetizers, captioned \"Small Plates and Finger Food\" ($13-22) and just three entrees ($16-33). Included among the latter are Kunz's famous short ribs, which are also a mainstay on the Cafe Gray menu (and were offered at Lespinasse, as well). I asked the server how many small plates would make a meal. She cautioned, \"They are small!\" So I ordered three of them, after asking her for suggestions. Homemade bread sticks came, with a wonderful yogurt dipping sauce that tasted like a soft goat cheese. I finished all of it, and could probably have eaten more. (I apologize for the quality of the photos, but note the elegant silver tray-typical of the service at Grayz.) Salt Stone Grilled Prawns (left); Crisped Calamari (right)Grilled prawns ($18) were served on a hot stone, with a kaffir remoulade seasoning. This appeared to be the most popular dish, as I saw more prawn orders coming out than anything else. The Crisped calamari ($12) with a lemon-honey chutney was much more delicate than the usual deep-fried calamari. (As New York revealed, Kunz makes it with Nabisco graham crackers and Cream of Wheat.) It was the largest portion of anything I ordered, but I got bored with it about halfway through. Pasta Fiori and Tomato Concassee (left); Cheese and marinated vegetables (right)Pasta Fiori ($15) in a lemon thyme broth was the best item I tried. A soft pillow of silky pasta in a delicate tomato sauce, it would be at home in any four-star restaurant. Good as it was, it seemed out of place at Grayz, as the portion was far too small to be shared, and it certainly wasn't finger food.The cheese course ($11), which I ordered from the dessert menu, was a miscalculation. The marinated vegetables at the corners of the plate were miniscule, while the pile of shaved cheese in the center tasted like supermarket provalone. (It also came with bread; not shown in the photo.)Service was first-rate, with beautiful platings, and fresh silverware delivered for every course. It almost seemed overwrought and a little too precious. Every plate was left in the middle of the table, as if to be shared with an imaginary companion (I was there alone).The total for three appetizers, a cheese course, one cocktail, and two glasses of wine, came to $100 before tax and tip. That's a high total for finger food. The menu could evolve considerably as Kunz figures out what works, and what doesn't. For now, I'd say that it's worth dropping in if you're in the neighborhood, but it's nothing I'd rush back for.Grayz (13-15 West 54th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: *½Service: **½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

It was only a matter of time before Stephen Hanson, that past-master of formula restaurants, opened the ultimate formula restaurant, a steakhouse. David Burke's Primehouse opened in Chicago last year, and now comes Primehouse New York, sans Burke, but with a very similar steak program. Primehouse has a more modern vibe than the average steakhouse: a quieter version of BLT Prime. Booths and tables are more generously spaced than at BLT, and there are soft surfaces to absorb the sound. The space feels \"dressy\" by steakhouse standards. You could bring a date here, and have a conversation without shouting. There weren't any tables available when I walked in at around 6:00 p.m. on a weeknight, but the bar area is large and comfortable, with soft, high-backed chairs. Bar dining must have been planned from the beginning, as these are about the plushest bar seats you'll find anywhere in town. Once you sit down, you'll want to stay a while. The menu offers typical steakhouse starters ($8-18), a raw bar (platters from $16-79), seven cuts of steak ($34-49) plus porterhouse for two ($86), eight other meat and fish entrees ($21-42), and side dishes ($9). At $46 for a ribeye and $48 for a New York Sirloin, Primehouse sets the high water mark for NYC steakhouse pricing (though the now-closed V Steakhouse was worse). Are those stratospheric prices worth it? If the 20-ounce \"Kentucky\" bone-in ribeye aged 28 days (which my server recommended) was any indication, they just might be. The mineral tang of the dry aging was all you could ask for, and the marbling was as even as on any ribeye I've encountered. The kitchen executed without fault, with a deep char on the exterior and a perfect medium rare inside. I also tried the Smoked Bacon Brussels Sprouts (top right corner in the photo). I liked how the musky taste of burned bacon enhanced the sweetness of the Brussels Sprouts, but the bacon bits themselves were tough and tried out. The wine list is a large tome, and only high-rollers will be pleased. The reds go on for many pages, but I counted only seven bottles under $60, and only two under $50. None of the California Cabernets were under $60, and none of the French Bordeaux were under $80. If Cafe Boulud can offer an entire page of red wines under $60, it's hard to believe that the prices at Primehouse are justified. I was glad to see a page of half-bottles, which one seldom sees at a steakhouse; more restaurants should have them. Is Primehouse New York for you? It depends on whether you mind spending a few dollars more for a commodity item. But if future visits confirm that the ribeye I enjoyed was no fluke, then Primehouse just might be a top-tier steakhouse. Update: Since this review, Brian O'Donohoe has replaced Jason Miller as chef. We doubt that this will make a tremendous difference to the average diner, but it is worth noting that O'Donohoe has stints at Le Bernardin, Barça 18, and Fiamma on his resume. Perhaps seafood dishes here will be worth a closer look. Note: Click here for a review of the burger at Primehouse New York.

Today, as expected, Ian Schrager is eating goose eggs and bagels for breakfast, as Frank Bruni dropped the hammer on the over-hyped Wakiya. Bruni has his bad days, but here he delivers a delicious takedown:[T]here's a crushing sense of letdown ... an experience in which pleasures are flickering and unreliable, in which the slickness of the gleaming red-and-black setting and the poise of the best servers are undercut by inconsistent cooking and dishes that too often look three times as good as they taste.Out comes the \"fiery pepper hunt chicken,\" one of Mr. Wakiya's signature dishes. It's a glittering hillock of bright red Chouten peppers, there to infuse the chicken with a tingly heat but not to be eaten, as your server playfully warns you. You tunnel with your chopsticks to the buried chunks of battered, wok-fried meat, and what's your reward? Nuggets no more tender than those you retrieve from many a drive-through window.Eater and I both both win $4 at 4-1 odds on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Wakiya, the new haute Chinese place in the Gramercy Park Hotel. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 √√One Star: 3-1 Two Stars: 10-1 Three Stars: 750-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Wakiya had a star-cross'd birth. It was originally supposed to be run by Alan Yau, whose Michelin-starred Hakkasan is one of the hottest restaurants in London. When Yau backed out of the project, the Nobu team stepped into the breach, including chef Nobu Masuhisa and his protege Yuji Wakiya, for whom the restaurant is named.Early reports suggest that the place is long on attitude and short on results. Wakiya managed the rare feat of getting panned by both Andrea Strong and the Restaurant Girl, the city's two most easily-pleased critics, as well as the not-so-easily pleased Adam Platt in New York. In Time Out New York, the star-happy Randall Lane handed out four of them, while the Post's Steve Cuozzo (under \"idealized p.r.-massaged conditions\") thought Wakiya had promise. On the BruniBlog, Frank complained about the restaurant's reservations policy. He gave no hints about his view of the food, but he wasn't happy about the sky-high prices.You can never discount the possibility of a one-star review, as Frank Bruni has given a singleton to plenty of mediocre places. But with Platt, Strong and RG giving zero, or the equivalent of zero, we aren't tempted to take that bet.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award no stars to Wakiya.

Outside Accademia di Vino, with stretch limo completeAccademia di Vino opened last month on the Upper East Side, in a cursed space that was home briefly to the Chinese restaurant Mainland, and even more briefly Ollie's Brasserie. The new owners are the team from 'Cesca on the Upper West Side. Eager to ensure a success where previously there was none, they've taken no great risk here. What could be more trendy than an Italian restaurant/wine bar?They have also attracted plenty of critical attention, most of it favorable, including a feature piece in the Sun, and reviews from Adam Platt, Gael Greene, and Andrea Strong. Restaurant Girl dissented, awarding just one star (the equivalent of zero in other publications). So far, the Times has given it only the Dining Briefs treatment (per Marian Burros). Could it be that Frank Bruni would pass on the chance to review another Italian restaurant?The space has received a smart-looking makeover. There are bars on two levels and a large dining room in dark woods, with wine storage almost everywhere you look. The formula is working so far: 6:15 p.m. was the only reasonable reservation time I could get on a few days' notice. The bar was already full when I arrived at 6:00-naturally, they wouldn't put me at a table until after my friend Kelly arrived. Every table seemed to be taken by the time we left two hours later.The menu is dizzyingly complicated, with appetizers in ten categories, pizzas, pastas, and entrees. I suppose there could be worse problems than overly attentive service, but something like four different servers approached our table within the first three minutes, and we hadn't yet gotten our bearings on the lengthy menu. We eventually settled on three starters and two entrees to share.The wine list has about 500 bottles, with a good selection by the glass-as you'd expect at a wine-themed restaurant. After discussing our interests, the server recommended a 2006 Bastianich Rosato Refosco by the glass ($10), which was excellent on a warm evening, and nicely complemented the food.Salmon Carpaccio (left); Crudi Flight (right)Roasted CauliflowerSalmon Carpaccio ($14) was beautifully prepared, with tomato, basil, scallions, olives, capers, and oregano basil-and no, I didn't remember all of that. A flight of crudo ($24) was almost as brilliant, including an unexpected sliver of Wagyu beef that crashed the all-fish party. My friend Kelly got more of a thrill out of Roasted Cauliflower ($4) than I did, but it certainly seemed competent enough.Somewhere along the line, fresh bread came. Later on we wanted more, but by then the restaurant had filled up, and servers were much harder to come by-though we eventually flagged one down.We ordered two entrees to share, but oddly enough they brought both at the same time. I assume it was a considered choice, as there was no apology made for it, but it seemed a strange way to serve dinner.Linguini Pescatore (left); Pork Chop (right)Linguini Pescatore, or seafood pasta ($21) was nicely done. The pork chop ($27) came out whole, but when we sent it back to be divided, they made good work of it-making it look as if the chop was meant to be ordered for two. The preparation was entirely respectable, if not exactly inventive, but this time it was Kelly's turn to be underwhelmed.The final bill for two, including two glasses of wine apiece, came to $132 before tax and tip, which is a relative bargain for the amount of food we had. Accademia di Vino may not be breaking any new ground, but it's a welcome and dependable entry on the Upper East Side dining scene. Service will surely get smoother over time, and the menu could use some serious pruning.Accademia di Vino (1081 Third Avenue at 63rd Street, Upper East Side)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

My girlfriend and I had dinner at Per Se a few weeks ago for her birthday-my third visit to the restaurant, her first. (For an earlier review, click here.) We found Per Se still firing on all cylinders. When I alerted the staff that this was a birthday celebration, all I expected was a cake at dessert, but we got several additional freebies beyond that.We ordered champagne to begin, which was no bargain at $25 per glass, but they refilled us something like three times apiece, by which time it was quite the bargain, and it also meant we were feeling no pain before we got into the bulk of our meal.Amuse-bouche: Salmon cones and gougèresThey asked if we'd like a kitchen tour before the meal-we could have had the tour afterwards (which is more the norm), but by then the service would have been mostly over with, and our server suggested it would be more interesting to see while the chefs were still working. We were impressed at the enormous expanse of the place. It's the only restaurant I've seen with more room behind-the-scenes than in the dining room. We also saw the much-rumored live video link with The French Laundry. Everything was, of course, impeccably clean. As my girlfriend so often points out, the cleanest kitchens usually produce the best food. Dinner at Per Se is nine-courses prix fixe at $250-either the Chef's Tasting Menu or the Tasting of Vegetables. Several of the courses do have choices, but you're on the hook for at least $250 (including service) regardless. The recommended wine pairing is $175, though there is some flexibility below that amount if you ask for it. Unlike many other restaurants, there is no \"standard\" wine pairing at Per Se; the sommelier customizes a wine pairing based on your requests and budget. This wasn't an evening for note-taking, and in any case we were plenty inebriated by the time most of the food came, so I've structured this post as a photo-essay with light comments, beginning with day's menus (above): the Chef's Tasting Menu (left) and the Tasting of Vegetables (right).\"Oysters and Pearls\" (left); Truffle Custard (right)The menus at Per Se change daily, but a few things are constant. The Salmon Cones are always the amuse-bouch, and the first course is always \"Oysters and Pearls\" with caviar. Both have been well described by others, so I'll let the photos speak for themselves. After that, the kitchen sent out an extra course: a \"truffle custard\" in a hollowed-out egg, which was outstanding-probably the highlight of the evening.Hudson valley moulard Duck Foie Gras \"Gâteau\" (left); Grilled \"Pave of Atlantic Bluefin Tuna (right)On the Chef's Tasting Menu, the second course always offers an option of foie gras ($30 supplement). In my three visits, it has never been done the same way, and this preparation might have been the best yet. The menu described it as a Foile Gras \"Gâteau,\" with peanut butter and grape geleee. The server called it \"our version of peanut butter & jelly.\" I can't imagine anything better.The first entree (tuna) came next; see photo, above right. Soft Boiled Squire Hill Farm's Aracana Hen Egg (left); Butter Poached Nova Scotia Lobster (right)The next course on the Chef's Tasting Menu is traditionally lobster. It's the one item that many diners find unexciting. I'd already had it twice, so I asked for a substitution from the Vegetable menu. I got the Soft-Boiled Hen Egg with mushrooms, which was wonderful. My girlfriend had no complaints about the lobster, but I still think it suffers in such a miniscule presentation.All Day Braised Hobbs Shore's Pork Belly (left); Elysian Fields Farm's \"Selle D'Agneau Rôtie Entière (right)Braised pork belly (above, left) is always a dependable dish in these settings. I believe I was a bit more fond of the lamb (above, right) than my girlfriend was. For the record, the alternative was a Wagyu beef, carrying a $100 supplement.Desserts follow, without comment:Cheese courses: Meadow Creek Grayson (left); Tarentais (right) Yogurt Sorbet with Carrot Cake (left); Finally, birthday cake (right) Crème brulee (left); Granny Smith Apple Consomme with Ginger Ice Cream (right)Petits-fours The staff seemed totally at ease with the fact that we were making a photo-document of our meal. After a while, they started leaving the wine bottles on our table so that we could photograph the labels, of which a few are shown below. We especially loved the 1962 Madeira, which was served with one of the dessert courses:Service throughout was as polished and professional as one would expect at such a restaurant. We left with the sense that we had experienced the best meal this city has to offer.Per Se (10 Columbus Circle, Time-Warner Center, Fourth Floor, West Midtown)Food: ****Service: ****Ambiance: ****Overall: ****

Today, as expected, a clearly bored Frank Bruni awards one star to Gemma:These are the makings of Gemma, a cheat sheet of a restaurant whose proprietors take fewer risks than a hurricane-insurance agent in Nebraska. They've turned to a fundamentally earnest cuisine for calculated purposes, and they know that many diners sprinting to the newest hot spot don't really want to find anything new. They want reassurance that they've mastered what's worth knowing.That applied to knockoffs of French bistros and brasseries in past decades and it applies to post-red-sauce evocations of Italian enotecas, osterias and the like in this one. The moment-conscious diner now talks of salumi, not charcuterie, and if he or she is feeling blue, it's for Gorgonzola more often than Roquefort (with Cabrales making inroads).You've got to remember that at least 80% of diners actually prefer \"formula restaurants,\" although they tend to bore the critics. Gemma probably wouldn't have been reviewed, but for the pedigree of its owners. Frank actually found a few dishes he liked: an \"impeccable\" chicken, a \"buttery\" branzino. And he loved the space, with tables spaced more generously than usual. All that added up to one star.Eater and I both both win $1 at even-money odds on our hypothetical one-dollar bets.

The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: EVEN √√Two Stars: 9-1 Three Stars: 75-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: First of all, we need to pop some caffeine pills, to keep ourselves awake as Frank Bruni reviews yet another Italian restaurant. Why doesn't he just move to Italy? Oh, I forgot. He did that already.The leading indicators aren't in Gemma's favor. The same crew's La Bottega (also in a hotel), earned a goose-egg from Amanda Hesser 3½ years ago, while the Waverly Inn managed an unenthusiastic star from Frank Bruni nine months ago.Early critical reports on Gemma aren't exactly raves. In New York, Adam Platt tossed out one star, \"half a star for the food, and another half for the space.\" Restaurant Girl had 1½ stars in the Daily News, which on her scale means \"hit or miss,\" noting that it is \"certainly not a serious culinary endeavour.\"We dismiss any chance of two stars or above. Frank Bruni isn't going to be under-cut by the Restaurant Girl. Won't. Happen. The only question is: one star or zero? If this wasn't an Italian restaurant, we'd be on the zero-star train faster than Frank Bruni can say crudo. And I have to say I'm sorely tempted, given the low odds Eater is offering this week at the one-star level.Then again, this is Italian, which nearly always carries a one-star premium in Bruni's version of the star system.The Bet: Until we see Frank Bruni give zero stars to an Italian restaurant, we have to assume it can't happen. We agree with Eater that Bruni will aware one star to Gemma.

It's rare that a restaurant opens in this town to instantaneous, unanimous acclaim. But that's what happened to Hill Country, which opened this summer in Chelsea. It captures New York's barbecue moment just about perfectly. Every reviewer has been smitten. Everyone. Including me.I'm not a great barbecue conoisseur. I can't tell you the differences between Memphis, Kansas City, and Texas barbecue. But I know what I love, and Hill Country is it. The meats are unsauced. What comes through is pure smokey flavor that lets the food speak for itself-or perhaps I should say \"sing\" for itself.Though I can't vouch for it, the barbecue style at Hill Country is supposed to be the spitting image of what you get in Lockhart, Texas. Service is bare-bones, but no one should care. When you come in, the host hands you a \"meal ticket.\" You carry a cafeteria tray to ordering stations-a counter for meats, another for side dishes, another for beverages. An attendant marks down what you've ordered. After the meal, you present your meal ticket to the cashier, who rings up the bill.Meats come piled on a sheet of wax paper; side dishes come in cardboard cups. But if the service is nothing fancy, the servers clearly love what they're doing. Their advice is both enthusiastic and reliable. At the bar, for instance, the bartender wisely steered us towards the moist brisket-the restaurant's signature dish. At the meat counter the server dished out just the right amount of food for two people, when we were really unsure just how much we needed. It's hard to see from the photo, but this is really a lot of food. The moist brisket is hidden underneath two enormous beef ribs and a couple of jalapeno sausage. To the side is macaroni and cheese (upper right) and corn pudding (lower right). It was more than two hungry people could finish.The brisket comes in two varieties: moist and lean, the former being a euphemism for fat. We love fatty meats, so we tried the moist brisket ($17.50/lb.), which was extraordinary. Beef ribs ($9/lb.) were wonderful too; more barbecue places should serve them. We were less impressed with the jalapeno sausage ($5.50 ea.), which seemed too dry when compared to the other things we tried.There are several other meats available, incluidng spare ribs, pork chops, game hen, chicken, beef shoulder, and prime rib. We were full, so they'll have to wait for another time. And rest assured, there will be another time. The two side dishes we tried-mac & cheese and corn pudding ($4.50 ea.)-were terrific. I especially recommend the corn pudding, as it's an unusual dish that few other barbecue places offer.The food is the star at Hill Country, but the bar shouldn't pass unnoticed. There's a terrific selection of tequilas, and I even noticed a vodka from Iceland. The specialty drinks are wonderful, and reasonably priced (around $10 ea.).One of them features a remarkably smooth vodka from Austin, TX. When I asked about it, the bartender gave me a bit of it on the side-yet another example of how the servers at Hill Country are truly enthusiastic about what they serve.The space is large, with tables on two levels, and there is live music several nights a week. It's not too far off the path of my commute home, and I could well imagine that it will be one of my regular haunts when I have a barbecue craving. In this town, you can't do much better than Hill Country.Hill Country (30 W. 26th Street between Sixth Avenue and Broadway, Chelsea)Food: **½Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: **

***CONTENT
Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awarded a weak two stars to Peter Luger Steakhouse, a downgrade from its former rating of three stars. The review practically wrote itself. Simply put, the restaurant doesn't deliver excellence as consistently as it used to. With a multitude of Luger clones in Manhattan that are as good or better, one can no longer turn a blind eye to the restaurant's many faults. Indeed, from the text of the review, Bruni could easily have justified just one star, rather than the two he gave.Bruni's timing is certainly open to question. The review mentioned that renovations are in progress. As there was no particular urgency for this review, would it not have been better to wait until the remodeling was complete? The only thing that has really changed since Ruth Reichl's 1997 review is the addition of a rib steak to the menu (which Bruni loved both times he tried it).With Luger's demotion, New York is now without a three-star steakhouse. Given Bruni's obvious affection for the format, I have to wonder if he's looking for an excuse to award the third star to his own personal favorite of the bunch. I'm not sure which steakhouse it would be, as there is no obvious front-runner for the title. I also know that some people feel that steakhouses are too formulaic, and shouldn't qualify for three stars no matter how good they are, but I don't buy that argument.Eater and I both took the two-star bet at 2-1 odds. We both win $2 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater NYJBankroll$42.50 $46.67Gain/Loss+2.00 +2.00Total$44.50 $48.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost18-5 17-6

As of today, it carries a three-star rating from the Times (per Ruth Reichl in 1997), the only steakhouse so honored. It also carries a Michelin star, the only one given to a steakhouse.There are two main data points from Frank Bruni. In June 2004, he awarded two stars to Wolfgang's Steakhouse (a Luger clone). As part of his research, he also tried the Luger porterhouse, which he found superior. In February 2005, he made the trip out to Williamsburg for Luger's burgers (which are served only at lunch), and was not impressed. It got another mention, albeit briefly, in his one-star review of Robert's Steakhouse. This time, he found \"real depth, along with the muskiness and mineral quality that often come with dry aging, but on this occasion the meat lacked its usual char.\"There are now a good half-dozen Luger clones in New York City, most of them doing pretty much what Peter Luger does, in a more pleasant atmosphere, with better service, and with a more varied menu. Ultimately, they all rely on the same raw material-aged prime beef. Luger could not go on forever getting the best specimens, and preparing them better than anyone else. If Luger has an edge in that department, at this point it is probably microscopic. Against that are the well known drawbacks: the beer hall decor, the limited menu, the brusque service, the refusal to take credit cards, the trip out to Williamsburg, and the difficulty of scoring a table.Given that this is a re-review, the overwhelming likelihood is that Luger will not keep all three of its stars. Even allowing for Bruni's love of steakhouses, it would be hard to justify the re-review just to re-affirm its current rating. The only question is how low Bruni will go. My sense is that he will accept the conclusion of every past critic, which is that Luger is all about the porterhouse. And given his past enthusiastic comments, I suspect he will grudgingly award two stars for the one thing Luger does well, even if the restaurant has lost a step.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Peter Luger Steakhouse.

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awarded one star to Bar Stuzzichini, finding the Italian small-plates joint flawed but worthy:The restaurant's agents of tantalization include creamy sheep's milk ricotta seasoned with saffron and drizzled with honey; ethereal buffalo's milk ricotta stuffing involtini of thinly sliced eggplant; fried meatballs, each consumed in one crunchy, happy bite; and a tangle of astonishingly tender octopus, poached and then grilled, which is a smart way to treat an octopus.On a given night there are some 25 stuzzichini in all, each priced between $5 and $10. Only a fool would order them individually because $22 buys any combination of five, and that's a deal that gives Bar Stuzzichini something to crow about, a hook in a city and era of determined grazers.Eater and I both took the one-star bet at 2-1 odds. We both win $2 on our hypothetical one-dollar bets. Eater NYJBankroll$40.50 $44.67Gain/Loss+2.00 +2.00Total$42.50 $46.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost17-5 16-6

This restaurant is poison.We had to wait 75 minutes after our original reservation time. The management blamed us for having 6 people in all, 3 couples. They were unfriendly and rude.Our table was not set up in full when we sat down, and the waitress didnt mind shoving her hands in between everyone without permission to finish it up.Then we get the food... some might call it tasty; perhaps it would have been... IF IT DIDNT MAKE US ALL TERRIBLY SICK.We all ate there, and we ALL got SICK.Terrible stomach cramps, bowel movements, headaches later on in the night.The service is terrible, the people are rude, and hte food is bad!DO not Go to Bar Stuzzuchini and expect a good experience. DO NOT GO THERE AT ALL!

The exterior, clearly unfinished. Across the street, the no-photo rule clearly doesn't apply!! Note: Click here for a more recent review of Tailor. Sam Mason is the latest pastry chef to open his own restaurant, following in the footsteps of Will Goldfarb at Room 4 Dessert (now closed) and Pichet Ong of p*ong. Mason's solo act is called Tailor. The website says that it's \"named as an ode to the skills of a seasoned craftsman.\" Tailor shares with R4D and p*ong a creative approach to desserts. This is no cherry pie and vanilla ice cream place. Mason's former gig was as at the avant-garde WD-50, of which Tailor's cuisine is strongly reminiscent. For a while, I wondered if Tailor would open in my lifetime. Grub Street had a recurring feature called The Launch, chronicling Mason's pre-opening adventures. As of last December, Tailor's debut was expected in \"late February or the beginning of March.\" After a while, the delays became almost comical, and Mason wisely stopped posting. Well, Tailor is finally here, and eGullet is ecstatic. I was happy to find that Tailor is only about 5 minutes' walk from the subway station I use to get home, so I thought I'd drop in after work. The bi-level space is modern chic, but nicely done. There is an ample bar area downstairs with a dining room on the ground level. The dining room is arguably more comfortable than WD-50, and it is certainly more so than p*ong or the late lamented Room 4 Dessert. Service was as polished as at just about any three-star restaurant. Although there are no tablecloths, there are cloth napkins. Silverware was promptly replaced. Empty glasses and finished plates were promptly whisked away. My bar tab was transferred to my table without complaint. And when I asked the bartender about an unusual pear cider in one of the specialty drinks, he volunteered a free taste of it. The food has three-star potential, but with some serious limitations. At the moment, only six savory courses and six desserts are on offer, making Tailor's menu the skimpiest of any comparable establishment. None of the items individually is very expensive (sweets $11; savories $12-15), but as the servings are small, the costs can mount in a hurry. Mason made a considered decision to feature cocktails, rather than wine. The cocktail menu features twelve very clever selections by mixologist Eben Freeman, but only five wines by the glass (none by the bottle). Freeman's offerings ($12-15 each) are excellent in their own right, but they are small, and they overpowered the food. Frank Bruni thrives on the unpredictable, but if he is unwilling to award three stars to WD-50, it seems unlikely he'll do so here, as Tailor is in many ways far more limited. Two stars seems to me about the best Tailor could expect, unless the menu choices expand and a real wine list is added. It seems almost a crime to have such a polished service brigade, and so little to serve. Although the dining room was empty, the staff insisted that I not take photographs. Why Thomas Keller can permit this with a full dining room at Per Se, while Mason won't allow it in an empty one, is beyond me. Apparently he wants to keep the food a secret. I will therefore accommodate him by not describing what I had. I'll say that there was an amuse-bouche. Of the two dishes I paid for, one was very close to the best thing I've had all year; the other one wasn't. I had planned to order more, but after the no-photography edict I decided to go home. What's the deal with the no-photo rule? Gordon Ramsay was the last jerk to pull that stunt, and look where it got him?

Chika Tillman of Chikalicious was the first Pastry Chef in America to have opened her own place way back in 2003. Difference is that she did it \"herself\", unlike the gentlemen you mention. Four years later, it remains the #1 choice for most. Zagat.

what are you, paparazzi? why should he let you or anyone take photos? the guy is trying to carve out a new genre - and you complain that its not like other places (full menu/full wine list) and bitch that he wont let you behave like a bridge and tunnel tourist snapping picts. bloggers have been running around town terrorizing hardworking, inventive restuarants with inept \"reviews\" based on one time dining, often without sampling more than a few things, and sometimes during the first few days of service, all things that no real food critic worth his/her salt would ever do. who are you people?
Marc Shepherd
2007-09-26 00:00:00
Well, pk, the reality is that the blogosphere exists, and the reviews are going to be written. Ninety-nine percent of chefs seem to recognize this. Whether they like it I'm not sure. When the reviews are favorable, they tend to like it.I have no illusions about the influence or expertise of what I write. Those who don't see value in this blog are welcome to look elsewhere for dining information. But whatever the merits of it, I doubt that Sam Mason considers himself \"terrorized\" by a little old blogger like me.My position is that if a restaurant is open to the public and charging full price (as Tailor is, and was at the time of my visit), then it is fair game to be reviewed. I was certainly not the first on-line reviewer to do so.As far as the skimpy menu and wine list, those clearly are factors that deserve to be mentioned. No one who follows this blog could possibly suggest that I only like conventional things. But at the same time, just because an idea is new, doesn't mean it's necessarily good.

The host asked me not to take photographs of any kind, flash or not, which a server separately confirmed. They may well have been confused, or they may have changed their minds afterwards. I have indeed seen photos on other blogs and message boards, but one never knows if it was expressly permitted, or if those photographers simply managed to evade the host's eye.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Bar Stuzzichini. The Eater oddsmakers (after a hiatus last week) have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 75-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Yawn. Another review, another Italian restaurant...Bruni's favorite. Yet again, it's one of those earnest neighborhood places that probably belongs in the $25-and-under column.Adam Platt gave the place two stars this week, but he admitted he was biased:Bar Stuzzichini is in my approximate neighborhood. It is modestly priced (off-duty restaurant critics tend to be cheap), and as the name indicates, you can dine by yourself (off-duty restaurant critics also like to be left alone) at one of two long, convivial bars.I give Platt credit. At least he admits that he is reviewing based on criteria that no responsible critic should depend on. Bruni is less self-conscious about doing the same.Though Platt's tastes tend to track Bruni's rather well, in this case I don't think Bruni will be quite as generous. He's going to want to let Franny's bask in the glow of the big wet slathering two-star kiss he adminstered a couple of weeks ago. To do it again so soon would dim the luster of that review.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Bar Stuzzichini, though probably on the higher end of one star-it is Italian, after all.

***CONTENT
When I heard about Park Avenue Summer, I didn't know if the concept was ingenius or the world's dumbest gimmick. Craig Koketsu is the chef, and I love what he's done at Quality Meats. You figure the former chef de cuisine at Lespinasse can't go too far wrong. AvroKO handled the decor, and they hit a home run just about every time (Quality Meats, Public, and many others).Amuse-bouche: Watermelon topped with yogurtThe idea is that the restaurant will change its name four times a year. With mid-September approaching, the place will close any day now, and re-open as Park Avenue Autumn with a brand new menu.The wall panels-right now a summery yellow, adorned with sea shells-are removable, and there are three other versions of them, so that the restaurant can re-invent itself with each change of the seasons. But many restaurants change their menu seasonally, or indeed more often. Is the seasonal makeover really necessary?The menu is no bargain. Appetizers are $11-18, entrees $28-45 (most in the 30s), side dishes $4-12. At those prices the restaurant has to be more than merely ordinary, and alas, we weren't impressed.The amuse-bouche was one of the better tries: a square of watermelon with a swirl of yogurt on top. The kitchen also did right by Maine Sea Scallops ($15), garnished with peaches and almond granola. The scallops were nicely seared, and the ingredients worked well together. But my girlfriend's ravioli ($14) really misfired. It was slightly cold and definitely under-cooked. Maine Sea Scallops (left); John Dory (right)John Dory ($34) came with summer truffles and a poached egg. The fish was competently done, but the truffles weren't integrated into the dish. They seemed to be an afterthought, there to impart a faux elegance. My girlfriend ordered the Fire-Roasted Lamb Chops ($39), but she tasted no fire in them at all. There was no sear, and they tasted rather bland.Heirloom tomato risottoThere was a printed specials menu with an heirloom tomato theme. We ordered a side of the heirloom tomato risotto, which we found to be the best thing that came out of Koketsu's kitchen. It was a sign that better things are possible at Park Avenue Summer.We weren't much impressed with the AvroKO decor, which seemed cheesy-like something out of a cruise ship. The traffic pattern is awkward, with food runners frequently passing through the lobby area. Strangely, the bar has no seating. There is a small lounge with only a few seats, where (as the story goes) you get to mix your own drinks, but we didn't investigate it further.We found the wine list way over-priced, much like the rest of the restaurant, with few bottles of interest below $50. Service at the beginning of the meal was a bit rushed, as if they wanted us out of there, but at the end our server disappeared, and it was hard to find someone to bring us a check. The twenty-something hostesses seemed clueless.Chef Craig KoketsuThe crowd was very Upper East Side, youngish, and 100% caucasian. So far, it's a tough table to book, which may say something about the paucity of alternatives in that neighorhood.The restaurant has been largely ignored by the major critics, perhaps an act of kindness. The closest thing to a mainstream review came from the always generous Randall Lane in Time Out New York, who awarded an inconceivable five stars out of six.I have to think that Craig Koketsu is capable of doing better. But as of now, alas, Park Avenue Summer is the world's dumbest gimmick. Save your money, and go elsewhere.Park Avenue Summer (100 E. 63rd Street at Park Avenue, Upper East Side)Food: UnevenService: AverageAmbiance: Cruise shipOverall: Needs work

My family and I wandered into Bellavitae on a whim at about 10:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening, after a performance at the Minetta Lane Theater next door. It was simply the nearest source of nourishment that looked at all promising. But Bellavitae offers far more than mere sustenance: it is truly a gem.The menu, which changes frequently, lacks the traditional split between appetizers and entrees. Most of the items are small plates that are suitable for sharing. There are a few conventional main courses, but they are in the minority. Most items are under $20, and there are some real winners under $10.The focus is on ingredients from Italian artisanal farmers. The owner, Rolando Beramendi, supplies imported ingredients to many of the city's Italian restaurants. After doing that successfully for 15 years, he decided to branch out into a restaurant of his own. It opened in January 2005 to mostly rave reviews. Frank Bruni was impressed, but gave it only the Diner's Journal treatment.We ordered five small plates to share, and there wasn't a dud among them:Crostini carpaccio ($14), thinly sliced raw beef with a home-made (slightly spicy) mayonaiseSformatino di Melanzane ($8), baked layers of baby eggplant with mozzarella and tomato sauceCrostini con Salmone e Robiola ($13), smoked salmon with robiola cheese and caperberriesFichi Colavolpe all Griglia ($9), grilled figs wrapped in pancettaPolpettine Fritte ($8), little fried meatballsAny of these dishes could easily be a disaster in less skilled hands. The meatballs were breaded and deep-fried, but without a hint of grease. The grilled figs wrapped in pancetta had just the right balance between the two ingredients, with neither dominating the other. The home-made mayonaise lent just the right amount of spiciness to the crostini, without upstaging the beef. And on this showing, crostini could displace the bagel as the proper home for salmon and cream cheese.The name, Bellavitae, is a made-up word that's a cross between \"beautiful life\" and \"beautiful vines.\" Wine, indeed, is a focus. The list focuses on small Italian producers, with about 150 bottles available and a wide selection by the quartino. My mom and I were quite pleased with the two reds we sampled, very reasonably priced at $14, considering that a quartino yields about two glasses' worth. House-made bread, naturally served with olive oil for dipping, completed the package.The bill for five small plates and two quartinos of wine came to $80 before tax and tip. Service was prompt and courteous, though by this hour the restaurant was not crowded. A \"beautiful life\" indeed.Bellavitae (24 Minetta Lane at Sixth Avenue, Greenwich Villege)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

Note: This is a review of Bouley at its former location on West Broadway. In November 2008, the restaurant moved to a new space at 161 Duane Street, one block away. My mom and I had dinner at Bouley last week. I had already been to the restaurant twice before, including a visit last summer, when two colleagues and I were most impressed with the tasting menu. This time, we ordered à la carte. I loved my appetizer, described on the menu as \"Organic Connecticut Farm Egg Steamed with Black Truflle, Serrano Ham, Parmesan Reggiano and 25-Year Old Balsamic Vinegar\" ($22). This is typical of a Bouley dish, with a large number of ingredients and a cooking style not anchored to any one region. It all fits together, and never feels too busy or over-engineered. The entree was Baby Pig ($42)-not currently listed on the website, so I can't quote every ingredient. If a little less clever than the appetizer, I was nevertheless pleased with the careful preparation, with the crispness of the skin contrasting the tender flesh underneath. Dessert was excellent: \"Tahitian Vanilla-Nishiki Rice Pudding with Tropical Fruit Compote and Yuzu Sorbet\" ($13). On top of that, there were several bonus courses: the amuse bouche (a tomato gazpacho), pre- and post-dessert, and petits-fours. We were, of course, sent home with the signature sponge cake, which I enjoyed for breakfast the next morning. The wine list is lengthy, expensive, and generally French. The Saint Domingue we ordered ($90) was excellent, and the staff kept our glasses filled without my ever having to touch the bottle-a degree of pampering worth mentioning only because it is so rare. A few years ago, there was a sense that the front-of-house at Bouley was letting down the kitchen. Several lapses-unforgivable at a restaurant purporting to offer a four-star experience-were cited in Frank Bruni's demotion review three years ago. I myself had noticed some minor infelicities in two previous visits, but on this occasion the staff had it just about perfect. There is, I suppose, a certain sense that David Bouley is no longer innovating-that he is too busy opening new places to really focus on his flagship restaurant. But there is a certain sense of refinement and polish at Bouley that very few restaurants can match. Update: A few weeks later, I was back at Bouley with a colleague. We had the tasting menu with wine pairings. All of the food was polished and refined, but there really wasn't any \"wow\" in it. I once again felt that the service was rushed, as it had been the last time I had a tasting menu here. Given the track record over multiple visits, I've at last concluded that 3 stars is the correct rating, not the the 3½ stars I had awarded previously.

BLT Market postcard, based on art work displayed in the restaurant Note: Click here for more recent visits to BLT Market. You would have every reason to be a little cynical about the opening of yet another \"Bistro Laurent Tourondel\" restaurant. In a matter of three years, Tourondel has launched almost a dozen of them, the majority being clones of the very first one, BLT Steak. To date, the best of the brood has been BLT Fish, which earned three stars from Frank Bruni, as well as a Michelin star, which it promptly lost. Main Menu Now comes BLT Market, which occupies the former Atelier space in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel at the corner of Sixth Avenue and Central Park South. To Tourondel's credit, this is his first restaurant in quite a while that isn't a mindless clone of a previous endeavour. The idea of a restaurant focused on seasonal ingredients is hardly original, but Tourondel's version of it could become one of the better ones. I walked in on impulse at around 6:30 p.m. on a weeknight. The dining room was booked, but I got an outdoor table immediately with a nice view of Central Park. Typical of a BLT restaurant, the server presented me with several loose sheets of paper: a menu, a specials menu, and a wine list supplement. (I didn't ask to see the full wine list, but they have one.) I ordered a cocktail called the Apricot-Mint Caiproska ($14). Like other cocktails I've had at BLT restaurants, it was too small, and almost all ice. I felt like I had paid about $1 per sip. I wasn't shown the full wine list, but the paper supplement showed ten selections by the glass and bottles from a variety of regions. It included eight choices from New York state, something you do not normally see. With bottles priced mostly above $60, there were few bargains to be had. Specials Menu The menu is focused and not unduly long. There are seven appetizers ($12-25), one soup ($12), two pastas ($14-24 as appetizers; $23-38 as entrees), six entrees ($26-43), six desserts ($10-11), and a cheese course ($14). A sidebar lists all of the vegetables and fish that are in season. The specials menu added an additional appetizer, two entrees, and one dessert. While the prices are obviously expensive, they are all-inclusive, unlike the other BLT restaurants, where the side dishes cost extra, and drive up the bill considerably. I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered two appetizers. Grilled Octopus ($18) came with a fresh cranberry bean salad and bergamot dressing. The octopus was nicely charred, and thick enough to have the consistency of a steak, but it upstaged the accompanying salad, which was dull. Raw and Confit Big Eye Tuna ($18) came with a tonnato sauce, garnished with avocado and fresh heart of palm. This was a lovely dish, attractively plated. The raw tuna was especially good, but the confit version seemed not as flavorful. The amuse-bouche was a riff on \"pigs in a blanket\"-a small slice of frankfurter wrapped in a pastry shell with a mustard and relish dressing. It was a cute idea, but a bit messy to eat, and the hot dog didn't seem fresh. The bread service was spectacular: a long hot garlic bread, served in a paper bag. Say what you want about Tourondel, but the breads in his restaurants are great. The space is a bit more elegant than the other BLT restaurants, but with many informal touches. Tables are bare wood, with cloth napkins but paper placemats. Servers wear striped aprons, but the captains wear suits. The artwork, which I understand Tourondel selected himself, consists of large pastel paintings showing fruits and vegetables, such as the tomato still life shown at the top of this post. Service was friendly, but slow, with a rather long gap between my first and second appetizer. The amuse and bread courses left my placemat festooned with crumbs, but they didn't replace it until after the meal was over. I wasn't smitten with BLT Market, but the restaurant shows promise. With the menu still technically in previews, I assume there will be refinements, and some of the service glitches will be smoothed out.

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awarded two stars to Franny's, giving the kind of rave review we've come to expect when he runs into a quaint, family-owned Italian restaurant that doesn't take reservations:Other restaurants have honorable pies, admirable lettuces or noteworthy salumi. But take it from a cranky Franny's doubter, now a besotted Franny's believer: not many do all three with as much joy and distinction as Franny's.Eater took the one-star odds, while NYJ guessed correctly that Frank would give Franny's a two-star smooch. We win $6 on our hypothetical $1 bet, while Eater loses a dollar. Eater NYJBankroll$41.50 $38.67Gain/Loss-1.00 +6.00Total$40.50 $44.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost16-5 15-6

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Franny's, the acclaimed Park Slope pizza joint that was infamously Banned on Chowhound. The Eater oddsmakers have set the action as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 75-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Frank Bruni has been on a pizza kick lately. He even managed to get the Times to spring for a trip to L.A. so that he could review Pizzeria Mozza-a restaurant genre not normally on his beat.We know that just about any type of restaurant can get two stars from Frank Bruni. So why not a pizzeria? Franny's has all the trappings of a two-star special: it's in Brooklyn, it's Italian, and as Eater notes, Bruni does have \"an undying love for small, earnest restaurants.\"My guess is that after dining at Mozza, Bruni wanted to find the best pizza in town, and if he could give it two stars, he would. New York's Underground Gourmet says Franny's has the best pizza in New York. And Eater says that Franny's \"has turned it up a notch in the kitchen of late,\" an assertion I cannot verify, but which would certainly explain the timing of this review.The Bet: Lately, we've been spanked anytime we disagreed with Eater. Nevertheless, we're going to roll the dice on two stars for Franny's.

It's hard to know when you can trust Frank Bruni. He seems to give a one-star premium just because a restaurant is Italian. And he seems to give a one-star premium wherever Mario Batali is involved. In just three years on the job, he has awarded nine stars to Mario Batali's restaurants, a remarkable total.So when Frank Bruni promoted Esca to three stars (his predecessor had awarded two), I had to wonder: was it really that good? Or was Frank just up to his usual mischief? Luckily, there was a parade of almost exclusively favorable comments on the eGullet boards, which persuaded me that I really must try Esca.Bruschetta to startIt wasn't easy. Esca fills up in a hurry. Several times I tried to reserve, only to find that 10:00 p.m. was the only time slot available. And no, I wasn't that desperate to eat there. Last night, finally, I had an 8:00 p.m. slot. But even in late August, Esca was packed.I agree with Frank Bruni about one more thing. The key to Esca's success is that its chef and co-owner, David Pasternack, hasn't over-extended himself. According to Bruni, whenever he's called the restaurant for an interview, Pasternack is nearly always there. These days, when a restaurant is as successful as Esca, the chef starts to become an industry. Pasternack has dallied a little, but Esca remains his home.Esca-the name means bait-introduced crudo, the Italian version of raw fish appetizers, to New York. Bruni, at least, credits Pasternack with the innovation. It was sufficiently obscure that William Grimes, in his 2000 review, had to explain what it meant. Nowadays, it's all over town.The menu's crudo selections are followed by standard appetizers, pastas, and fish entrees. A solitary veal dish is the lone concession to the meat-lover. There's no obligatory strip steak or roast chicken for the patron who was dragged along, but really doesn't like seafood. If you can't or won't eat sea creatures, there's probably no point in visiting Esca.According to the website, the menu changes every two weeks. The menu currently shown there is quite a bit different from the one we saw-and also noticeably less expensive. I don't know if it's a very old menu, or if the prices were jacked up after Bruni awarded the third star. Nowadays, I think a restaurant in Esca's class ought to have a reasonably current menu on its website.While we pondered our order, a sommelier came over to offer assistance. The wine list is of medium length, and nearly all Italian. There's an ample number of good options below $60. I asked for a red wine under that figure that would go well with the entrees we were considering. He instantly offered a fine suggestion at $54.After pouring the first taste, he took the bottle away and put it on a serving table out of sight. Only a few restaurants in New York do this, and I find it a bit annoying. I don't need someone to pour my wine for me, and I don't like having to look around to signal for another pour. My request to have the bottle put back under my control was granted without complaint. Orange Marlin (left); Verdura Mista (right)I started with one of the crudo selections, Orange Marlin ($16). It was perfectly seasoned-just delightful. By the way, the restaurant offers a two-flight crudo tasting for $30 per person, and I've made a mental note to try one of these days. My girlfriend started with a salad of Verdura Mista ($16), and the kitchen did a superb job with this deceptively simple dish. Squid ink pasta with cuttlefish and garlic (left); Whole orata (right)The menu offers about a dozen pasta dishes, orderable as a main course or as a mid-course to split. We shared the Squid ink pasta with cuttlefish and garlic ($24). We were again impressed, as the contrasting flavors seemed to be so perfectly judged.The menu offers several whole fish, in addition to a larger number of composed dishes. I ordered the Orata ($33), a kind of sea bream, served whole. The preparation was straightforward, but the flesh was tender, sweet, and just slightly lemony. It came off the bone without difficulty. My girlfriend was less impressed with Merluzzo ($34), a kind of cod. She found it a bit dull, and even had to ask for salt to make it more lively-and that is not something she often does.BiscottiAt Esca, both the space and the service occupy that middle ground between casual and formal that Mario Batali has mastered at his flagship restaurant, Babbo. There are white tablecloths, and an alert service brigade stays on top of things, but you could show up in jeans, and not feel out-of-place.On the whole, we left Esca quite impressed. Three courses apiece, plus a $54 bottle of wine still came to under $200 before tip, and in this town it's difficult to get such a good a meal at that price.Esca (402 W. 43rd Street at Ninth Avenue, Hell's Kitchen)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: ***

The River Room, practically deserted.With its gorgeous unobstructed river views, Riverbank State Park would seem the ideal place for a romantic restaurant. That was the premise when Earl Monroe's Restaurant, named for the former New York Knicks guard, opened a couple of years ago.The park is located along the Hudson River. It's built atop a waste treatment plant, though you wouldn't be immediately aware of that. Designers did a terrific job turning an otherwise desolate stretch of waterfront into a gorgeous public space. Its location in West Harlem might at first seem inaccessible, but it's only about a ten-minute walk from the 145th Street stop on the #1 train.Earl Monroe's drew a reasonably favorable Diner's Journal piece from Frank Bruni in the Times. Later on, Earl Monroe severed his relationship with the owners, and they renamed the restaurant River Room. It's on something like the third chef in two years, clearly not a sign of success.The photo on the website (right) leads you to expect a bustling crowd. The reality (above) is quite a different thing. On a Friday night, the place was practically empty. It's open only four nights a week. There is live jazz on Friday and Saturday nights (for which there is a $5 surcharge), but it's not a draw.The location isn't the problem. A couple of weeks ago, we visited Hudson River Cafe, also located on the riverbank in Harlem, also offering have live music on Friday nights. It was packed. River Room is actually closer to the subway than Hudson River Cafe, but it's a ghost town. The reason, I suspect, is that the food just isn't that good. Frankly, the jazz was mediocre too.The website describes the cuisine as as \"a unique fusion of Southern, Caribbean, Latin and African influences.\" It is rare that a chef trying to do so many things will produce a memorable result. Usually, it just seems like the chef can't make up his mind. Deep-fried oysters (left); Deep-fried calamari (right)We hadn't planned it, but both my girlfriend and I ordered deep-fried appetizers: calamari for her ($8), oysters for me ($9, as I recall). The kitchen is skilled with the deep fryer. Breading wasn't overbearing, nor was either dish overly greasy. The oysters were great, but the calamari came lukewarm. Caribbean Crab Cakes (left); Mexican Spiced Duck (right)My girlfriend's Caribbean Crab Cakes ($21) seemed to have been deep-fried, and on their own would have been just about perfect. But they came swimming in a gloppy cole slaw that was drowned in mayonaise. Mexican Spiced Duck ($24) seemed neither Mexican nor spicy to me. It was over-cooked, though partly rehabilitated by a nice layer of crisp fat. It came on a bed of braised collard greens, which were almost inedible.The restaurant has neither a wine list nor a beverage menu, a peculiar omission that almost certainly dampens alcohol sales. When we asked about wine, our server recited a list of two reds and five whites, and steered us to a very respectable Sauvignon Blanc at $34.I've seen a lot of message board posts taking River Room to task for poor service, but we didn't have that issue at all. Actually, we found our server quite helpful and professional. We felt rather sorry for the guy: with the place so empty, his tip income can't be very good.The space is attractive, and though not really apparent from the photos, the seating is quite comfortable. The view takes center stage, and while I know the old adage about restaurants with views, there's no reason why the food couldn't be better. With some more focus in the kitchen, this could be one of Manhattan's truly romantic getaways. But until they bring in Chef #4, I won't be going back.River Room (145th Street west of Riverside Drive, at Riverbank State Park, West Harlem)Food: MediocreService: *Ambiance: *½Overall: Can't Recommend

Quite predictably, he found its broad geographic reach a drawback:It's a beautiful, fascinating, frustrating place, its cosmetic showiness echoed by dishes that are also all over the map, in terms of their appeal as well as their geographic and ethnic tethers, and in the way they throw ingredient upon ingredient and seasoning after seasoning at you.

***CONTENT
Note: This is a review of Gilt under chef Christopher Lee, who left the restaurant at the end of 2008 to take over at Aureole. This is bad news for Gilt's owners, as the restaurant will almost certainly relinquish at least one of its two Michelin stars, and it was only just promoted to two stars in the 2009 guide. Justin Bogle, one of Lee's sous-chefs, has replaced him. As Grub Street notes, he probably will not change the menu dramatically. Gilt was one of the most hotly anticipated restaurant openings of the 2005 season. The chef, enfant-terrible Paul Liebrandt, delivered a menu that lived on danger's edge. It was at times dazzling, and probably exceeded the legal limit for ingredients per square inch. In the Times, Frank Bruni wasn't wowed, awarding two stars. I was a little more enthusiastic than Bruni, and awarded three stars. Yet, I can see why Gilt v1.0 ran into problems. Much as I appreciated what Liebrandt was doing, I wasn't dying to try it again. I suspect others felt the same. And no restaurant can survive solely on first-time visitors. I also suspect that in that neighborhood, and in the same space that once hosted Le Cirque, a more conservative style was called for. In late 2006, Chris Lee replaced Paul Liebrandt. Prices, though still expensive, were reduced somewhat. The three-course prix fixe that was $92 under Liebrandt now sells for $78. A seven-course tasting menu that was once $160 is now $135, and there is also a five-course tasting menu for $105. Bruni was more impressed with Gilt v2.0, though it received only a \"Dining Brief,\" not a full re-review. Last week, I took a friend to Gilt for her birthday dinner. Truth be told, I was planning to order the standard three-course menu so that I could try Lee's best known dish, the Tuna Wellington. But my friend rather liked the five-course tasting menu line-up ($105), and as it was her evening, that's what we ordered, along with the sommelier's wine pairing ($65). This was the menu: Wild Japanese Hamachi SashimiWatermelon \"Margarita\", Cucumber, Jicama, Anise Hyssop Dressing Soft Shell Blue CrabSweet Yellow Corn, Avocado, Lime Crème Fraîche, Spicy Tomato Broth Crispy Black BassPiperade with Chorizo, Red Bliss Potatoes, Garlic Aioli, Saffron Mussel Broth Smoked Prime Beef TenderloinCreamed Corn, Pickled Vegetables, Pancetta, Bourbon Sweet Potatoes Chocolate Ice Cream ConesPeanut Butter Chocolate, Mint Chocolate, Banana Brownie There was a consistent quality level that could almost be called dull. I liked everything we tried, without loving any of it. There wasn't any \"wow,\" but there were no duds either. Most tasting menus I've tried have a wider variety of extremes, both good and bad. This was a menu that could have offended no one. The smoked tenderloin was particularly good, and that is somewhat unusual at this type of restaurant. The wines, too, seemed to be chosen for their ability to blend with just about any diner's sensibilities. The early courses came out a bit too quickly. My friend and I are both fast drinkers, but when the third glass (of six) arrived, we hadn't yet finished the first or the second. To their credit, when we asked them to slow down, they did. That point aside, the service was as professional and seamless as you'd expect for a restaurant in Gilt's price range. While I would have preferred a bit more sense of adventure in Lee's choices, clearly he was hired as the conservative antidote to Paul Liebrandt, and he appears to have given Gilt's owners what they wanted.

I'm on a mission to try all of the steakhouses in town. The other day, it was Staghorn Steakhouse's turn.Before I even tasted a morsel, I was struck by the austere decor. Frank Bruni (on his blog) thought that it was built on-the-cheap. I took it as a considered decision to break out of steakhouse cliches, and I'm glad they did. The blonde wood floors, white walls, and generously spaced tables made the space feel more relaxing than most other restaurants of its kind.Service, however, was right out of the steakhouse playbook. Bread rolls were cold and stale. When I asked about wines by the glass, the waiter blurted out a list of grapes (merlot, shiraz, cabernet, pinot noir, chianti), but there was no printed list so that you'd know which shiraz they were serving. No other restaurant in its price range would be so cavalier about wines, but nearly all steakhouses seem to do it.The meat entrees were the usual items, at the usual prices. I ordered the prime bone-in ribeye ($36), which was nicely charred and a perfect medium rare, but not quite as tender as some other ribeyes I've enjoyed, and marred by gristle in a couple of spots. I don't hold the restaurant entirely accountable for this, as these days there are too many buyers chasing not enough beef. The server informed me that the steak was aged on-site for 28 days, which seemed believable.The seafood menu (though I didn't sample it) looked a bit better than some other steakhouses, including a Dover Sole and a Grilled Whole Branzini.The restaurant wasn't particularly crowded, although on a Thursday night in mid-August I wouldn't draw any conclusions. However, the location isn't in its favor. I've walked by a number of times, and it never seemed full. As Eater noted, Staghorn probably does good business before Knick and Ranger games. I don't know if that's enough to stay in business, but as it's on my way home, I'll probably be back.On the strength of one visit, Staghorn Steakhouse seems a notch below the city's better steakhouses, but it's certainly respectable, and its calmer ambiance might be just right for some occasions.Staghorn Steakhouse (315 W. 36th Street between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: *Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: **Overall: *

Yesterday wasn't much fun, as my girlfriend was at the NYU Hospital for Joint Diseases having shoulder surgery. (She's doing just fine, but it's a painful operation.) The day's lone bright spot was lunch at Posto Thin Crust Pizza.I can't compare Posto to other places, as I don't eat pizza on a regular basis-my waistline just won't tolerate all those carbs and calories. But if I were a pizza guy, I have to think that Posto would be near the top of my list. A number of other bloggers evidently think so (Mona's Apple, Lulu Loves Manhattan), and it's had good write-ups in New York and the Village Voice. The folks at 10best.com rate Posto the city's 10th-best pizzeria.The rustic decor festures a tile floor, wooden tables, exposed brick, and a low tin ceiling. There is also outdoor seating in the summertime. Service was just fine, but I was there at an odd hour, so it wasn't very busy. They deliver anywhere between Fifth Avenue and the East River, from 14th-26th Streets. The same team also own Gruppo on Avenue B between 11th and 12th Streets, and Vezzo at 31st & Lex, both with substantially the same menu.The main event here is thin-crust pizza, which means crust the thickness and crispness of a Ritz cracker. You can start with a 9-inch ($6) or 16-inch pie ($12) and choose your toppings ($1.00-2.50 each for the smaller size, $2-5 for the larger). Or, you can choose from one of the special house pies ($9-11 in the small size, $18-22 in the large). There are also salads and appetizers ($5-12). Iced tea and lemonade are home-made, and I counted around a dozen wines by the glass.I chose a pizza called The Big Pineapple ($10 in the personal size), which comes with marinara sauce & cheese, fresh pineapples, fresh tomatoes, smoked bacon, and fresh basil. It had a fresh, lively taste, and thanks to the thin crust, I didn't feel over-stuffed after I'd finished it. The thin-crust pizza cooks quickly too, so I wasn't kept waiting for very long.Posto is pretty far away from my usual stomping grounds, but I'd gladly go back if I'm ever in the neighborhood again.Posto (310 Second Avenue at 18th Street, Gramercy/Stuyvesant Square) Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: ½

Frank Bruni and the Fine Dining Deathwatch, Part 2

***CONTENT
Six months ago, I wrote about the Fine Dining Deathwatch since Frank Bruni became the New York Times restaurant critic. I noted Bruni's overwhelming bias against traditional \"fine dining\" restaurants, unless they happen to be Italian or Italian-influenced. Over and over again, you find in his reviews that he is actually offended by restaurants that pamper him. He not only doesn't give credit for high-end service; he actually penalizes it.Later on, I posted about Frank's repeated use of the word \"fussy\" in his reviews to describe traditional formal service. He never means it as a compliment. This must weigh on restauranteurs and investors as they plan new openings. The presence of tablecloths, all by itself, costs you half-a-star before Frank even walks in the door. Some restaurants can overcome that handicap, but it is difficult.As we approach another fall season, it's worth taking a look at the year just past. Between September 2006 and August 2007, Frank Bruni awarded three stars to the following restaurants:FelidiaL'Atelier de Joel RobuchonPicholineEleven Madison ParkBar Room at the ModernEscaGramercy TavernCafe BouludAll but L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon were re-reviews. Hence, in the last year, only one new restaurant in New York City earned three stars. (None earned four.) Leonard Kim, the star-system historian over at eGullet, confirmed that this has not happened since 1995-96, when Ruth Reichl handed out eleven three-star reviews, ten of which were re-reviews.In Bruni's defense, I cannot think of another restaurant that opened in the last year that clearly deserved the third star. It so happens that I awarded three stars to Gordon Ramsay at the London and Anthos, but I can't definitively say that Bruni got them wrong. There were plenty of critics that disliked Gordon Ramsay, and my visit to Anthos came after it had been open a while, and perhaps some of the early flubs had been worked out. So, it may simply be that this was an unusually lean year for high-end restaurants.There's no question that dining has become much more informal than it used to be. Frank Bruni never misses an opportunity to remind us of the fact. But many of the city's high-end restaurants are regularly booked full, which suggests there remains untapped demand for that kind of luxury. Restauranteurs may be leery of making a big commitment, knowing that as the size of the investment goes up, the room for error goes down. Are they giving the people what they want? Or, do they feel that the city's two main critics (Bruni and New York's Adam Platt) are not going to give that kind of restaurant a fair shake-even when it's done well.But ironically, even among the casual restaurants that Bruni loves, the only new restaurant that merited three stars was a chain restaurant imported from France.

The Payoff: Café Boulud

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awarded three stars to Cafe Boulud.As I predicted, Bruni included a backhanded slap at Boulud's flagship, the four-star Daniel, saying that Cafe Boulud is \"the most consistently enjoyable\" of the chef's restaurants. Daniel is the only four-star restaurant in New York that Bruni has not yet reviewed. The comment certainly suggests that it might not retain its lofty perch when Bruni finally gets around to it. Indeed, I suspect the only reason he hasn't done so is that he has no other restaurant to replace it with, and he doesn't want the four-star club to dwindle below its current five members.The review was one of the few times Bruni has been able to visit this type of restaurant without bitching about the elegant service that top-tier restaurants offer. Unlike most people, Frank is actually offended when you pamper him. But the best he could say, was that Cafe Boulud is \"no less fun to visit in this informal dining era.\" Though that's a compliment coming from Frank, I doubt the Boulud empire will be pulling it as a teaser quote.And isn't it just typical that it was a pasta dish that sealed Frank's opinion that Cafe Boulud still deserved the three stars it earned from Ruth Reichl? Both Eater and NYJ win $3 on our hypothetical $1 bets. Eater NYJBankroll$36.60 $33.67Gain/Loss+3.00 +3.00Total$39.50 $36.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost15-4 13-6

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni sharpens his knives at Cafe Boulud. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 8-1 One Star: 7-1 Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 3-1 √√Four Stars: 5,000-1The Skinny: \"Rolling the Dice\" returns this week after a two-month hiatus. Sorry to say, we don't have much by way of original analysis. As Eater noted, Frank Bruni is already on record with the view that Cafe Boulud is the most enjoyable of Daniel Boulud's three New York restaurants. I wasn't enraptured when I visited last year, but a friend whose opinion I respect assured me it must have been an off-night.I also agree with Eater that CB has flown under the radar in recent years, and there's really no reliable way of telling whether the new chef, Bertrand Chemel, has his act together. And there is always Bruni's well known aversion to French cooking. But I have to agree that three stars is the most likely outcome, given Bruni's already-documented affection for the place.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Cafe Boulud. Regardless of the rating, look for Bruni to include a back-handed slap at Daniel, the only one of the four-star restaurants he has yet to review.

Note: Bette closed in June 2008.There is no particular reason to visit Bette. Proprietress Amy Sacco, who had made her name in the nightclub industry, tried to transfer her success to a restaurant, which she named after her mother-the name rhymes with \"sweaty.\"That was two years ago, when Bette was a hot ticket. Today, you can get a table anytime you want. Bette's proverbial fifteen minutes are up. We were half-an-hour late, but it might have been half-a-day. It really didn't matter. On a Saturday night in August, we nearly had the place to ourselves. I suppose Amy and her friends had decamped to the Hamptons.In the New York Times, Frank Bruni awarded a remarkably generous one star, but he admitted it was mostly about the celebrity scene. \"Bette clearly means to make a splash, its food isn't remotely splashy.\" He got that right.The kitchen has gotten lazy in its old age. The whole menu was something like half-a-dozen appetizers and an equal number of entrees-all rather ordinary stuff. Frank Bruni found \"a bevy of interesting selections\" on the wine list, but that list has now shrunk to about two pages. For the record, we settled on a sangria-like rose (label below), at a budget-friendly $30. Asparagus salad (left); Pork chop (right)An Asparagus Salad ($12) was totally forgettable, as was a Pork Chop ($26). My girlfriend had the same reaction to a Hamachi Ceviche ($16) and Short Ribs ($25). While all competently prepared and unobjectionable, nothing at Bette really rose above the ordinary.The service hit two of my pet peeves. After we sat down, the server asked, \"Will you be having bottled watered this evening?\" It's a minor point, but do they really think you'll forget that tap water is an option?Bread rolls had no doubt been baked the night before, but they were served without separate plates or knives. After the appetizer plates were cleared, the server had to come along and clear up all the crumbs. There was nothing particularly bad about Bette, but when you're spending almost $120 for dinner (including tax, before tip), you want to taste at least something that goes beyond the ordinary, and Bette didn't have it.Bette (461 W. 23rd Street just east of Tenth Avenue, Chelsea)Food: SatisfactoryService: SatisfactoryAmbiance: *Overall: Satisfactory

Anthos

***CONTENT
Anthos is the latest creation of Greek wonder-chef Michael Psilakis. For a self-taught chef, Psilakis has made a remarkable name for himself in just a few years. First he opened Onera on the Upper West Side. I loved the place, but the space was admittedly a bit dismal, and the location worked against it. And maybe the Upper West Side wasn't ready for an offal tasting menu.Then, he opened Dona, an Italian/Greek hybrid with comely restauranteur Donatella Arpaia. I wasn't quite as infatuated with Dona as some other people, but there's no question it was a big success. But then, Psilakis and Arpaia lost their lease, and Dona was no more. Around that time, he closed Onera and re-opened it as the more casual Kefi, and it's now a hit. Then came Anthos (\"blossoming\"), which was meant to propel Greek cuisine to the three-star heights that Onera and Dona both missed.The question is, did they succeed? Both Adam Platt in New York and Frank Bruni in the New York Times didn't quite think so, both awarding two stars, though Bruni thought Anthos came awfully close to three. He pronounced it better than either Onera or Dona-both of which had won two stars from him-and several of his complaints seemed petty: \"fussy tics\" and \"self-consciousness\" (both recurring turn-offs for him), as well as \"drab\" decor (a complaint several critics have noted). He added, \"Pauses between courses are too long, and not everything that arrives is worth the wait.\"We found Anthos to be just about everything a Greek restaurant could hope to be. Perhaps some of the early rough spots have been smoothed out. Or perhaps a Saturday in August, with the restaurant only half full, didn't provide an indication of what service would be like when traffic is busier. We had no complaint with the purportedly drab decor, which seemed to us comfortable and appropriately restrained.Canapes came first (above, left), followed by an amuse bouche (above, right). The server describing them had a heavy accent, and was difficult to understand. The latter-a smoked Halibut, I believe-was about one inch square. My girlfriend didn't much care for it, but I thought it was successful. In any case, it must have set a record for most ingredients in a small package.The menu at Anthos is re-printed daily. Both the appetizer and entree I ordered aren't shown on any of the online menus, and I don't have exact descriptions. A Skate Salad (above, left; $16) was excellent, but I was especially impressed by Cod wrapped in zucchini (above, right; $33). To start, my girlfriend ordered Sheep's Milk Dumplings ($16), which were beautifully executed. But the highlight for her was the Roasted Chicken (above; $28), which was impeccably prepared, tender, and very attractively plated.The wine list is a tad over-priced, but we found a wonderful Greek white wine at $55 (label pictured above). Curiously, the sommelier tried to steer us away from Greek wines-we weren't sure why-but the choice we finally landed on was excellent.Mileage may vary, but we left Anthos more impressed than we have been with any restaurant in quite some time.Anthos (36 W. 52nd Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: ***Service: **½Ambiance: **½Overall: ***

Hudson River Cafe

***CONTENT
Hudson River Cafe caught my attention, in the first place because well publicized openings north of 125th Street are fairly rare, and in the second place, because it opened just in time for my big move uptown. It's a beautiful bi-level space, with ample space both indoors and out. So far, it seems to be attracting mainly a local crowd. With live music on Friday nights, the bar resembles a bustling Caribbean resort, while the indoor dining room is a bit more sedate.From the restaurant's name, you might expect river views. But you'd be wrong. The only views are an elevated viaduct on the restaurant's west side, and Fairway Market to the south. The architect and designer did the best they could with the hand they were dealt, but it almost seems a pity to have a restaurant with no view of the river it's named for. We initially requested outdoor seating upstairs, where I thought we might have a decent view. Once we realized that a cement wall was all we could see, we asked to go indoors.The only mainstream media review so far is from Randall Lane in Time Out New York, who calls it a \"Harlem oasis\" and awards three stars out of six. The cuisine is difficult to classify. Savory New York calls it \"New American,\" but Lane's \"Nueva Latina\" might be nearer the mark. The menu offers several ceviches and paellas, and the choice of spices has a distinctly Caribbean feel. But there's also an emphasis on locally sourced seasonal ingredients, like Blue Point Oysters and Bell & Evans Chicken. Some of the items are generic, like the raw bar, pastas, and steaks.Arctic Char Ceviche (left); Crispy and Spicy Buffalo Shrimp (right)My girlfriend started with the Arctic Char Ceviche ($12), which was absolutely spectacular-one of the best ceviches either of us has tasted. The photo doesn't show the depth of the serving bowl, but it was actually a quite sizable portion. We were also surprised at the bounty of Crispy and Spicy Buffalo Shrimp ($12), but the preparation was rather pedestrian and unsubtle.Whole Branzini with Garlic Mashed Potato and Garlic Chimichurri SauceAs one so often sees these days, the entrees are divided into composed plates ($20-34) and \"simply grilled\" items ($18-26), for which there is a multiple choice of side dishes and sauces. The Whole Branzini ($26) was in the latter category. It was beautifully done, and perfectly satisfying on its own; the garlic chimichurri sauce (which the server recommended) was redundant, and the garlic mashed potatoes (also a server recommendation) didn't do much for me either. My girlfriend ordered the strip steak ($32), which was competent and unremarkable.The beverage menu didn't list the sangria, which is an odd omission, as it is terrific. We saw it on another table, so that's what we asked for, and we were glad we did.Hudson River Cafe is off the beaten path. The travel time from our Hudson Heights apartment turned out to be quite a bit longer than it appeared on the map-about 45 minutes. It's a hike from either of the two nearest subway stops (125th Street or 137th Street on the #1 train). Some might be a bit skittish about the neighborhood, especially at night. While there's plenty of activity in the immediate vicinity, the streets nearby are a bit desolate. We didn't mind it at all, and will probably return, but I can't yet call Hudson River Cafe a destination restaurant. With some judicious editing of the menu, it very well might become one.Hudson River Cafe (697 W. 133rd Street at Twelfth Avenue, Manhattanville/West Harlem)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

***CONTENT
Smith & Wollensky isn't quite the dean of New York steakhouses, but at thirty years old, it predates most this city's beef emporiums. There are now S&W's in nine cities. In New York alone, the same restaurant group also owns Post House and Quality Meats, in addition to the flagship at 49th & 3rd.I believe I paid my first visit to S&W around fifteen years ago. My only recollection is the after-dinner cigars we enjoyed at the bar, an experience that couldn't be reproduced today. A few weeks ago, a friend visiting from out of town was in a steakhouse mood. We chose S&W, as it was near his hotel.S&W offers the same generic menu, at the same generic prices, that you find at most New York steakhouses. We both ordered the filet mignon, which came in a huge double portion. It was charred, nicely aged, and prepared to the correct temperature. The server was no doubt aware that it came with an ample helping of vegetables, but he didn't mention that as we ordered an entirely unnecessary side order of creamed spinach.The decor is unremarkable. When I wandered around looking for the restroom, it struck me that the upkeep was a bit sloppy, with various carts and trays left lying around in a hallway.Smith & Wollensky has enjoyed four full New York Times reviews-a remarkable achievement for a formula restaurant. In December 1977, shortly after it opened, Mimi Sheraton rated it \"Fair.\" The format has apparently changed over time, as Sheraton described Smith & Wollensky as an \"Italian steakhouse,\" and there certainly is no vestige of that today. For the record, there never was anyone named Smith or Wollensky; the founder, Alan Stillman, chose those two names at random out of a Manhattan telephone directory.In 1986, Bryan Miller upgraded the restaurant to \"Satisfactory,\" and then again in 1990 to one star. In its most recent review, in 1997, Ruth Reichl called it \"A Steakhouse to End All Arguments,\" awarding two stars. It was a peculiar headline, given her admission that she preferred Peter Luger (to which she had awarded three stars). To her, the difference was that at Smith & Wollensky you could order a fish entree, and not feel like it had been an afterthought.In the last several years, there has been a glut of new steakhouses. Many of them mindlessly follow the traditional format, but a few have actually improved on it, such as BLT Prime, Porter House, and S&W's sister establishment, Quality Meats. I suspect even Ruth Reichl would agree that, these days, a traditional steakhouse needs a little something extra to win two stars. These newer restaurants have it; Smith & Wollensky does not.Smith & Wollensky (797 Third Avenue at 49th Street, East Midtown)Food: *Service: FairAmbiance: *Overall: *

My friend Kelly and I paid a visit to Mint a few weeks ago. The decor has a cool, modern vibe that's calculated to appeal to the East Midtown lunch circuit. At dinner time, it was not particularly busy.The menu is a mix of Indian standards and a few original dishes. I shot photos, but didn't take notes at the time. Our general sense was that the appetizers (top row of photos) were better than the entrees (bottom row). Kelly particularly raved about the Crispy Cauliflower tossed in Tomato Garlic Sauce (top right). The platings, however, are rather humdrum and might even be called careless. Prices don't break the bank, with all appetizers at $12 or lower, and entrees at $20 or lower.Service was a bit confused. There are different drinks menus at the bar and the tables. Our server had trouble understanding that, although we were seated at a table, we wanted one of the drinks from the bar. I cannot recall another restaurant with such a peculiar arrangement. Our bread order also flummoxed them.Mint is a slight cut above the usual Indian restaurant in New York City, and certainly acceptable if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but not worth going out of the way.Mint (150 E. 50th Street in the San Carlos Hotel, between Third & Lexington Avenues, East Midtown)Food: *Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: *½Overall: *

Felidia

***DATE

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a more recent review of Felidia. Felidia is the gold standard for Italian restaurants in New York. If the arc of New York Times reviews can be believed, it has only gotten better since it opened in 1981. Just three months after it opened, Mimi Sheraton awarded one star, finding the food \"disappointingly inconsistent.\" By 1988, Bryan Miller found it \"more consistent,\" bumping it up to two stars. By 1995, Ruth Reichl found it \"charming and professional,\" promoting it to three stars, which Frank Bruni re-affirmed last year. Bruni said that Felidia \"hasn't changed all that much\" since Ruth Reichl's review, which only shows how careless he can be. Reichl referred to \"the bare upstairs dining room.\" Judging by the photo (which is almost exactly the view we had from our table), the restaurant has been renovated since then. Reichl also referred to \"great wines (at great prices),\" which today is only half true. The enormous wine list is still terrific (and hard to navigate), but no one would call it a bargain. More importantly, Felidia got itself a new executive chef a year after Reichl's review was published. Fortunato Nicotra has helmed the kitchen since 1996. With owner Lidia Bastianich busy running a restaurant empire, writing cookbooks, and hosting TV shows, it's safe to say that Felidia's three-star laurels rest on his shoulders more than anyone else's. I dined at Felidia with a colleague about a month ago. Everything we ordered was absolutely first-rate. Fortunato makes a terrific appetizer with asparagus, prosciutto, and a sunny-side-up fried egg. At $24 it's rather pricy, but well worth it. (The rest of the appetizers range anywhere from $7-30.) Pastas range from $20-36, but the restaurant will gladly divide an order at no extra charge. My colleague and I shared the duck pappardelle ($24), which was again excellent. Entrees range from $24-38. Crusted blue-fin tuna ($34) didn't knock my socks off the way the appetizer and pasta did, but it was very solidly executed. Tables are rather tightly spaced-at least upstairs, where we dined. However, it was not crowded, and there were none of the service issues that one occasionally hears about when this restaurant is busy. Service was polished, if perhaps not quite living up to the elegance of the food. A couple of years ago, Lidia Bastianich teamed up with Mario Batali to open Del Posto, which was supposed to be the first all-out attempt at creating a four-star Italian restaurant in New York. We all know the story: Del Posto garnered only three stars from Frank Bruni, and many people thought he was being generous. Having now dined at Felidia and Batali's flagship, Babbo, my sense is that Del Posto was less than the sum of its parts. Babbo and Felidia are the royalty of Italian dining in New York, and Del Posto is their bastard child.

Chinatown Brasserie is another of the high-concept big-box Asian palaces that have opened in recent years. But my girlfriend and I found it more pleasant and less cynical than many of its brethren. It's owned by the same team as Lever House and Lure Fishbar, and once again they seem to have hit the mark.The restaurant's specialty is Dim Sum (various items, $8-22). We ordered a selection, of which I'm afraid I don't have a specific recollection. The pièce de resistance was the traditional Peking Duck for Two ($48), which fully lived up to the better preparations of it that I've enjoyed elsewhere.

Sorry about the long absence. Buying a co-op, and the subsequent renovations, moving, and unpacking, have pretty much swallowed all my free time over the last two months.A number of restaurant reviews have gone unwritten. Several of the next few posts will be rather sketchy, as in some cases I have photos and/or vague recollections, but not enough detail to write a full review.Now that I'm settled in, reviews should start appearing again at the usual intervals.

We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Francophobe Frank reviews the newly re-imagined SoHo bistro, Provence. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet): Zero Stars: 6-1 One Star: 3-1 Two Stars: 7-2 √√Three Stars: 25-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: For the second week in a row, Eater is practically on the fence, with only a smidgen separating the favorite (two stars) from the runner-up. Once again, there's a reasonably good case for either outcome.The case for two stars? As Eater notes, Marc Meyer and Vicki Freeman have already cracked the two-star code at Cookshop. And Bruni seems to have a soft-spot for husband-wife teams. Something about a small, family-run business appeals to him. A number of quaint restaurants run by married couples-usually Italian-have received two stars from him.Eater also notes that this is technically a re-review-the restaurant received one star from Ruth Reichl, which Eric Asimov re-affirmed-and re-reviews usually come with a change-of-rating. That factor is probably less important here, as any Meyer/Freeman restaurant would pretty much demand a review. And when the review is driven by market events, Bruni doesn't necessarily feel compelled to justify the effort with an upgrade or downgrade.The case for one star? Well, the reviews of Provence have been decidedly mixed, and Bruni has never had much of a liking for French food.The Bet: We're two games behind in the pennant race, and we'll never catch up without taking some risks. But we just don't have a strong enough feeling about this one to bet against the odds. Two stars it is.

Momofuku Ssäm Bar and the New Paradigm

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Momofuku Ssäm Bar. On February 27, eGullet's Steven A. Shaw (handle: \"Fat Guy\") launched a discussion thread called, \"Where to get the haute-cuisine experience, cheap.\" The premise was Shaw's observation that, these days, you don't need to go to a \"fine dining\" restaurant to get haute cuisine.Another eGullet member (handle: \"Nathan\") dubbed this phenomenon the \"New Paradigm\" (\"NP\"), and it stuck-at least with Shaw, Nathan, and one other eGullet member who bought into the idea (handle: \"Sneakeater\"). Shaw would later claim that it was Bouley Upstairs that got him thinking along these lines, although the discussion thread was launched just six days after Frank Bruni's two-star review of Momofuku Ssäm Bar.What exactly is the New Paradigm? The very small band of people who believe in its existence chose a most peculiar lodestar - Frank Bruni himself - though Bruni has never acknowledged a \"paradigm\" in any review except the one that launched it:[Momofuku Ssäm Bar] has emerged as much, much more than the precocious fast-food restaurant it initially was. By bringing sophisticated, inventive cooking and a few high-end grace notes to a setting that discourages even the slightest sense of ceremony, Ssam Bar answers the desires of a generation of savvy, adventurous diners with little appetite for starchy rituals and stratospheric prices.They want great food, but they want it to feel more accessible, less effete. They'll gladly take some style along with it, but not if the tax is too punishing. And that's what they get at Ssam Bar, sleek, softly lighted and decidedly unfussy. Most of its roughly 55 seats are at a gleaming dark wood counter that runs the length of the narrow room, though these seats afford more elbow room than exists at the much smaller Noodle Bar.Many of the remaining seats are at communal tables, and reservations aren't taken...There's a good deal in Bruni's description that's patently offensive. Who's to say that people who want to make a reservation and sit at a table are \"effete\"? Who's to say that those who are \"savvy\" about fine food have \"little appetite\" for rituals that Bruni finds \"starchy\"? Bruni's error, of course, is that he projects his own prejudice onto everyone else. He doesn't like these things, so he just assumes nobody does-at least, nobody that knows what they're talking about.eGullet's Nathan, who apparently counts mind-reading among his many skills, says that the purported phenomenon \"especially appeals to a youthful but knowledgeable demographic.\" We can readily believe that Nathan knows at sight who is youthful-although the clientele at Meatpacking District bars, and for that matter the McDonald's across the street from Stuyvesant High School-seems pretty youthful too. How he discerns that the clientele are knowledgeable is beyond my comprehension. It's Bruni's error all over again: he counts himself as knowledgeable, and simply assumes that those dining where he does must be as smart as he is.Shaw, perhaps realizing that restaurant critics shouldn't be mind-readers, calls the alleged phenomenon, simply, \"haute cheap.\" Shaw mined an article (and a paycheck) out of his invention, with an article in the March 19 issue of Crain's New York Business. He chose five restaurants to illustrate the concept: Momofuku Ssäm Bar, Bouley Upstairs, Degustation, Room4Dessert, and the Bar Room at the Modern.I've dined at all five. Their points in common are not at all new, and can easily be attributed to other explanations. For many years, fine-dining restaurants have been offering casual dining at the bar to walk-in patrons. In a number of places, the \"casual front room\" takes on the identity of a separate restaurant, though clearly still affiliated with the \"mother ship.\" Bouley Upstairs and the Bar Room are two of the many examples of this. I love Room4Dessert, but it fails the first test: it may be haute, but it ain't cheap-bearing in mind that it only serves dessert.Degustation's similarity to the others is only skin-deep. Patrons there sit at a bar (as they do at Ssäm Bar and Room4Dessert), and the menu there is \"tapas-style\" (hardly a novelty these days), but in most other respects it is fairly conventional. Even Shaw had his doubts about it: \"Whether Degustation fits the pattern is an open question. I think the food, while quite good, is weaker and less haute than what's available at Momo-Ssam, Upstairs and certainly the Bar Room at the Modern. Visiting Degustation between Momo-Ssam and Upstairs really emphasized that it's operating at a lower level...\"Because the New Paradigm is such a tenuous concept, its three advocates have continually struggled to redefine it. Skeptics point out the many holes in their theory, and it morphs into something else. For instance, a no-reservations policy was allegedly a keynote of the paradigm, but three of Shaw's five examples take reservations. Another canard was \"no dress code whatsoever,\" but in an age when only about 10 restaurants in town still have a dress code, that hardly narrows it down.MenuI paid another visit to Momofuku Ssäm Bar on a weeknight a couple of weeks ago (first visit here), to try to get my arms around this alleged paradigm. As I was by myself, I had no trouble getting a seat at around 7:00 p.m. (Couples who had arrived before me were still waiting, since there weren't two adjacent bar stools available.) I actually had a pretty good seat, facing part of the open kitchen.I decided to order two dishes at the opposite end of the Ssäm Bar spectrum: something funky, and something totally conventional. I started with the Veal Head Terrine ($13), mainly because I was alone, and my usual dining companions would have been totally grossed out. If you ignore where it came from, there's nothing gross about the Veal Head Terrine (photo here). Its bark is worse than its bite.The terrine is served warm, in a roughly 6\"×8\" portion sliced as thin as tissue paper. Frankly, I think that if it were sliced thicker, but with a smaller surface area, it would pack a heftier flavor punch. At first, I spread it on the toasted bread provided, but the terrine was overwhelmed. I ate the last half of it without the bread. It had a slightly spicy taste, but was not anything special.Then I ordered the Milk-Fed Four Story Hill Farm Poulard ($26). For the curious, Frank Bruni had a blog post about this recently. It was a follow-up to his review of Resto. (The Gang of Three have not admitted Resto to the New Paradigm club, despite its similarity to the other restaurants mentioned.) Four Story Hill Farm is, of course, an impeccable poultry source, and Chang's kitchen knew what to do with it. It was nearly as juicy and tender as you could want chicken to be, but nothing special was done with it. It was just chicken on a plate over a bed of warm leaf greens.Actually, it struck me that if you ordered the chicken at Blue Hill, this is almost certainly what you'd get. I never had the chicken there, but I've dined at Blue Hill often enough to know the style. It would be the same quality of ingredients, and the same style of preparation. They do indeed offer a similar dish on their menu, and according to the website, it's $30.This anecdote helps to debunk the idea that Momofuku Ssäm Bar is \"haute cheap.\" For what is almost certainly the nearly-identical entree, Blue Hill charges only $4 more. When you consider that dinner at Blue Hill has all of the traditional restaurant amenities, while Ssäm Bar has almost none of them, you could even argue that Ssäm Bar is over-priced. I can't make any direct comparison of the Veal Head Terrine, because Blue Hill doesn't serve anything like that. However, Blue Hill's appetizers are in the $10-16 range, and the terrine was $13.(I am prepared for the David Chang Army to advise that Chicken isn't what Ssäm Bar is about. Too bad. They serve it; I ordered it. It was an experiment to see what Chang does with something conventional. It was pretty good chicken, but something I'm sure dozens of other restaurants are offering. Perhaps this section of the menu is meant to be \"Ssäm Bar for Wimps,\" but it wasn't labeled that way.)Before tax and tip, the total cost of my meal was $55, including two glasses of the house sake at $8 each. Obviously if you think Ssäm Bar is serving four-star food (which it isn't), you could call it \"cheap\" in a sense. But objectively $55 isn't a cheap meal, and of course Ssäm Bar isn't serving four-star food anyway. It's pretty close to what you'd pay for dinner at Blue Hill, but a whole lot less pleasant. It turns out that \"haute cheap\" isn't really that cheap.Beverage and Wine ListThe wine list has improved since my last visit to Momofuku Ssäm Bar, and there seemed to more serving staff behind the counter. Both of my selections were delivered without silverware. Neither one could reasonably have been eaten with chopsticks (though those weren't offered either). However, my requests for a knife and fork were quickly granted. The sound system played music at a noise level I found annoying.You might have wondered whether the New York Times review affected business. The server I asked said it had. He said people come in \"all the time\" and mention the NYT review. As far as I could monitor, most of the orders coming out of the kitchen seemed to be pretty conventional stuff. I did see one additional order of the Veal Head Terrine. In that case, I happened to overhear the server steering a couple towards that choice. It appeared that only the guy could stomach it.David Chang does some very good cooking, although you have to be willing to put up with a setting that is far from ideal, and verges to the unpleasant. In terms of comfort, it is probably the least appealing of the purported \"New Paradigm\" restaurants, and the quality of the food doesn't quite overcome its many disadvantages.Eating out, like most other things we do, has gotten progressively less formal since about the 1960s. There's really nothing new about that, and it's astonishing that a seasoned critic like Steven Shaw thinks so. One expects that from an arriviste like Frank Bruni, but not from Shaw. Momofuku Ssäm Bar, in its radical rejection of amenities we have come to expect in a restaurant, could be called a Paradigm of One. It really has no competitors. And frankly, I'm not aching for more of its kind. I'd rather pay the extra $4 for a table and a reservation.Momofuku Ssäm Bar (207 Second Avenue at 13th Street, East Village)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: FairOverall: *½

Did everyone else in town know that the Bubble Lounge is a champagne bar?It seems obvious now, but I've walked by it for years, and never went inside, or even made the connection that bubbles = champagne. Well, I was meeting a friend for drinks after work, and I picked The Bubble Lounge simply because I'd always been curious. So now I know.The Bubble Lounge is actually a mini-chain, with outposts in both San Francisco and New York, and if the website is correct, more to come in other cities. The speciality is a menu featuring over 300 varieties of champagnes and sparkling wines. The food menu is strictly hors d'oeuvres.The vibe is cool and dark, the seating comfortable. My friend and I found a couple of soft, wing-backed chairs right next to the jazz band. We spent an hour or so talking, but once the band arrived there wasn't much hope of conversation. That's not the bar's fault, and the jazz at least was excellent.The sparkling wines are a better bet than the cocktails. I tried two of the latter, neither of which impressed me, but the champagne we tried was very good. However, there aren't many bargains to be had: the bill was $98 for six drinks (including tax, before tip). We only drank, so I can't comment on the food.The Bubble Lounge (228 West Broadway between N. Moore and Franklin Streets, TriBeCa)

I paid my first visit to Industria Argentina in the winter of 2006, a couple of weeks after it opened. I imagined I'd be back sooner, but only last night did I finally get around to it. Most of what I said in the previous review still stands, so I'll keep this recap brief.Unlike last time, there was no amuse bouche, but there was a terrific bread service, with warm sourdough bread and soft butter mixed with spices that carried just a bit of extra heat.I had the suckling pig entree ($27; served only Wednesdays and Thursdays). The menu states that the pig is only 21 days old, which the squeamish might find a turn-off. The portion was ample, and the kitchen did a fine job with it. It was served with bones and tasted more like chicken than suckling pig usually does, although I particularly enjoyed the skin. The accompanying sweet potato puree and broccoli rabe were up to snuff, and the whole stack was topped with two crisp oven-roasted potato skins.The restaurant wasn't crowded, which goes to show that a storefront on the gold coast of TriBeCa is no assurance of success. Industria Argentina is a bit more expensive than Gaucho Steak Co., the Argentinean steakhouse we tried last weekend, though it is still quite reasonable, with most entrees priced in the $20s. The food here is prepared with more care, and the space is considerably more inviting. For a casual night out, Industria Argenina deserves more attention than it seems to be getting.Industria Argentina (329 Greenwich St., between Reade and Jay Sts., TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

The Payoff: Gramercy Tavern

***CONTENT
Today, Frank Bruni awarded three stars to Gramercy Tavern. A good deal of what we predicted yesterday came true. As expected, it was a \"yes, but...\" kind of review:There are restaurants with more shimmer, and there are certainly restaurants with more spark. There are restaurants that take bigger chances and stake bolder claims to your attention.They steer clear of anything too challenging, and if tameness is a consequence, so be it. Gramercy has never been a destination for the most adventurous or jaded gourmands.Bruni reiterated his view that Gramercy Tavern is no longer the flagship of the Danny Meyer empire:It doesn't scale peaks as high as those at Eleven Madison Park, currently the most exciting restaurant in Mr. Meyer's collection. But like a solid marriage rather than a heady love affair, it has stood the test of time, righting itself when it starts to go wrong, knowing that what's at stake are a great many warm memories, some yet to be made.As we imagined, Meyer nailed the balance between casual and formal that Bruni finds lacking-the casual part, that is-at many high-end restaurants:The service is back on track, with its trademark blend of coddling and unpretentiousness, a mix that Gramercy nailed well before other restaurants and that explains a lot about diners' loyalty to the restaurant. They find comfort in rooms with well-spaced tables and one rustic touch for every two elegant flourishes. Gramercy Tavern is a homey retort to the slickness of some fine-dining peers, and minor changes to lighting and art have made it look fresher, less where your grandmother goes after needlepoint class and more where your aunt goes after Italian for the Umbria-bound.But having correctly predicted all of that, we failed at the one prediction that counted: the rating. Frank Bruni awarded three stars, and we predicted two. We don't like losing, but if it has to happen, we're glad it happened this way. In Frank Bruni's three years on the job, this was one of the few times he awarded the correct rating to a restaurant, simply for doing classic things well. We would not be so foolish as to suggest Frank has actually learned something. We expect him to be back up to his old tricks again soon.We lose $1 on our hypothetical wager, while Eater wins $3.50 at 7-2 odds.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the newly-retooled Gramercy Tavern, with Blue Hill alumnus Michael Anthony now in the kitchen. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 9-1 One Star: 8-1 Two Stars: 3-1 Three Stars: 7-2 √√Four Stars: 400-1The Skinny: Eater is clearly as conflicted about this wager as we are. Only a half-point separates the most probable outcome (3½-1) from the next-most probable (3-1). To the best of our recollection, the Eater odds on two different outcomes have never been so close. Indeed, the careful Brunomics watcher can put together a quite compelling case for two stars or three.The case for two stars. In Bruni's infamous six-star double-review of Eleven Madison Park and the Bar Room, posted just five months ago, he drew a highly unfavorable contrast to the other restaurants in Danny Meyer's empire:I prefer them to Tabla, to Union Square Cafe and definitely to Gramercy Tavern, whose luster had dimmed some even before the chef Tom Colicchio officially severed his ties in August. It's anyone's guess how it will emerge from its current state of transition, which isn't pretty. During a meal there last month a fillet of cod was a mealy catastrophe. Servers tried to deliver another table's entrees to ours, then tried to deliver the same desserts twice.Restaurants seldom get a second chance with Frank Bruni. Once he gets a negative impression, it tends to persist. His comments in the double-review are significant for another reason. The whole premise of the review was that the torch had passed from the former flagships of the Meyer Empire-Union Square Cafe (for which Meyer's corporate umbrella is named) and Gramercy Tavern-to the Bar Room and Eleven Madison Park. If he gives three stars to Gramercy Tavern, he can't help but admit that the whole premise of the earlier review was, if not wrong, at least premature.On top of that, Bruni loves to slay sacred cows, and few restaurants are more sacred than the perennial Zagat leader, Gramercy Tavern, which is currently tied for the best food in New York City-as it usually is-at 28 out of 30. And lastly, a number of critics have been less-than-wowed by the current incarnation of Gramercy Tavern, suggesting that Michael Anthony simply hasn't maintained the magic of the the Tom Colicchio era.The case for three stars. Frank Bruni is a man of predictable habits and predilections. And he definitely has a predilection for Michael Anthony's food-or at least, the kind of food Anthony is known for. He awarded three stars to Blue Hill at Stone Barns, when Anthony was sharing the helm there with Dan Barber. And he did it again last summer, awarding three stars to the original Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. Anthony was gone by then, but by all accounts he has brought the same cooking style with him to Gramercy Tavern.And the smart money says that, with a few months to work on it, Danny Meyer surely will have smoothed out the service glitches that Bruni complained about in January.Our conclusion: The three-star case definitely seems weaker. On top of that, Bruni is seldom wowed by the luxury service that high-end restaurants like Gramercy Tavern offer. He is liable to give no credit for service (unless it is absolutely pitch-perfect and unfussy), and then to penalize a $76 prix fixe, on the grounds that substantially the same food is available at Blue Hill for considerably less money.If Bruni does award three stars, we suspect it will be with significant reservations, and not the exuberant three stars that the Bar Room and Eleven Madison Park (or, more recently, Esca) receivedThe Bet: We hate to do it. We really hate to do it. We are kicking ourselves for doing it. But we just can't bring ourselves to believe that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Gramercy Tavern-much as it may deserve it. We are placing our money on two stars.

Alex Garcia sure has been busy. This month, he's opened two restaurants: Carniceria in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn (replacing the failed Porchetta); and Gaucho Steak Co. in Hell's Kitchen. The Food Network chef's growing empire also includes Calle Ocho on the Upper West Side, Novo in SoHo, and another Gaucho Steak in New Jersey.Gaucho Steak Co. has opened in a neighborhood that was once considered rough, but nowadays Tenth Avenue buzzes with bars, restaurants, and new condos. It's a bit of a hike to the subway, but we took a walk south after dinner and found plenty of nightlife in this formerly desolate area. Things get pretty bleak once you get to 42nd Street, but you can see the potential if the #7 train is extended west, and Mayor Bloomberg's West Side Yards project takes off.The focus here is Argentinean beef, though Garcia's menu includes a number of generic nueva latina specialities that I suspect would be at home in any south-of-the-border country. Garcia must have gotten a sweet deal on rent, as nothing is above $20, which is remarkable for a steakhouse. Portion sizes are all generous. The restaurant had been open only three days when we visited. Both the service and the cooking suffered from some glitches that we presume will be rectified.As yet, there are no wines by the bottle, though we were assured there eventually will be. In any case, we probably would have ordered the excellent sangria. A large pitcher ($24) yielded eight tall glasses.We suspected that one appetizer to share would be ample, which indeed it was. The Ceviche ($9) came in a tall soda glass, studded with shrimp, lemon oil, jalapeno and fresh lime. We thought it was a perfect summer dish, but expected it to be a bit more spicy.Steaks are $14-20, depending on the cut of meat, but we both chose the Combination ($18), which comes with grilled sausage, skirt steak, short ribs, grilled onions, and a choice of side dish. The sausage, with a bold, spicy taste, was the best of the three meats. The kitchen did fine by the skirt steak, but it was undistinguished. The short ribs, served on the bone, were a bit over-cooked.Neither of our side dishes ($4 apiece if ordered separately) quite measured up. Mushroom Rice wasn't warm enough, while Gaucho Fries were a bit too greasy.There were assorted problems with the service, none of which seriously inconvenienced us, especially for such a low-priced restaurant. For instance, none of the servers offered us water, and the credit card machine broke down just before we left, forcing us to pay cash. Then, the new cooking equipment blew a fuse, and the power went out for about 15 minutes. However, the management gave us a free pitcher of the sangria while we waited, so I am not complaining.The decor vaguely suggests an Argentinean Wild West (if there is such a thing). There are only about 30 seats, and the restaurant doesn't take reservations. When the word gets out, I suspect there will be long waits.Gaucho Steak Co.

Salt is a delightful little restaurant on the left edge of SoHo that you could easily overlook. It is neither large nor pretty, and the block on which it resides doesn't get a lot of foot traffic. But chef Melissa O'Donnell does wonderful things with her seasonal menu-enough to overcome a slightly unpleasant space.The MenuThe restaurant opened as Stella in the summer of 2001, which turned out to be an inauspicious time to be starting a business in Manhattan. After 9/11, two of the three owners left, leaving O'Donnell to re-fashion the place, which she re-Christened \"Salt\" (one-word names having been in vogue back then). As of 2007, she appears to have a success on her hands, judging by the brisk Friday night traffic. A companion restaurant called Salt Bar on the Lower East Side offers small plates to go with wine, beer, and mixed drinks.The space at Salt is dominated by three long communal tables running the length of the restaurant, with only a few two-tops in the front, by the windows. We were lucky enough to have one of those, but they're squeezed pretty close together, and it's not easy to maintain a conversation. The wooden tables are painted a bleached white, which at least makes the everthing bright and cheery.Appetizers ($6.00-12.50) and side dishes ($6) are on the left side of the menu, entrees on the right. The latter are divided into two groups, \"protein + 2\" ($25.50-28.50) and \"chef's entrees\" ($19.00-28.50). The \"protein + 2\" category offers a fish or meat course, with your choice of any two side dishes-not a bad concept, even if the category name is ugly.The appealing bread rolls, brought to the table in a ceramic planter, were large and doughy. They weren't warm, but at least you could tell they weren't the generic dinner rolls many restaurants settle for. Butter was soft and easily spreadable.Goats cheese brulee, leeks, radish sprouts, cantaloupe, raspberry vinegarI was torn between a number of appetizer choices, but when we saw the \"goats [sic] cheese brulee\" delivered to an adjacent table, our minds were made up. It's an enormously clever idea, with the warm fried goat cheese contrasting the cool vegetables. This was a a dish so well judged I would have been happy to have it in a four-star restaurant.Whole grilled Dorade Royale, balsamic reductionWhole grilled Dorade Royale ($26.50) was a hit too, with the balsamic reduction giving the skin a delightfully tangy flavor. I had to work a bit for my supper, but the impeccably prepared fish flaked off the bone without great difficulty. I chose asparagus and the Yukon Gold potato puree for my two side dishes, but with the fish sitting on top of them, they weren't easy to get to. My girlfriend had the Alaskan King Salmon ($25.50) with the same two side dishes, and she too seemed pleased.I suspect we may have hit the jackpot at Salt. There were two major reviews in 2002, Adam Platt in New York and Eric Asimov in the Times ($25 and Under). Those were the days when the $25 and Under column reviewed real restaurants. Anyhow, Platt thought the composed entrees were better, while Asimov preferred the \"protein + 2\" (while hating the name as much as I do).The wine list isn't long, and it offers a reasonable number of choices below $50 (always the litmus test at a mid-priced restaurant). We had the Ridge 2004 from Three Valleys, California ($48), mostly a Zinfandel, which has a nice peppery taste.The servers did their job and left us alone with a carafe of tap water, which on a warm evening should have come with ice. But aside from that, the service was just fine for this type of restaurant.I didn't expect much from Salt, but Melissa O'Donnell's kitchen delivered a fine performance. Perhaps the overall level of the menu can't match what we had, but the goat cheese brulee and the grilled Dorade made about as good a meal as I've had in a long time.Salt (58 MacDougal Street between Houston and Prince Streets, SoHo)Food: ***Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: **

Today, Frank Bruni awards one star to Katz's Delicatessen. This is Frank at his best, reviewing the casual, fatty-greasy food he likes:Let's do something we don't do often enough. Let's take the occasion of the most recent rumors, which swirled just a few weeks ago, to pause and appreciate Katz's. To take its measure in a format that grants it the kind of recognition typically reserved for restaurants more proper but no more deserving.To revel in its pastrami sandwich, one of the best in the land, with an eye-popping stack of brined beef that's juicy, smoky, rapturous. To glory in the intricate ritual of the place: the taking of a ticket at the door; the lining-up in front of one of the servers who carves that beef by hand; the tasting of the thick, ridged slices the server gives us as the sandwich is being built; the nodding when we're asked if we want pickles, because of course we want pickles.There's part of us that says Katz's deserves its place in the pantheon of starred restaurants, and Frank was exactly the guy to do it. Another part of us wonders why Frank is so bored with the high-end restaurants he's supposed to be reviewing. Today makes 3 out of the last 5 Bruni reviews that really should have been \"$25 & Under\" restaurants. But if Frank is going to slum it, Katz's was at least a worthy subject.We were nervous about disagreeing with Eater once again, given that we've been hammered the last three times we did it. But this week, virtue was rewarded. We win $4 on our imaginary $1 bet at 4-1 odds. Eater, who had predicted zero stars for Katz's, loses $1.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews a New York institution, Katz's Delicatessen. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 2-1 √√One Star: 4-1 Two Stars: 8-1 Three Stars: 75-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: I guess Frank is formally auditioning for the $25-and-under beat. For the second week in a row, he's reviewing a place that probably doesn't even belong in the fine dining critic's territory. Eater thinks Bruni will award zero stars, which would be a harsh verdict indeed. What are we to make of this? In the first place, zero-star reviews are fairly uncommon-as they should be-and we're only four weeks removed from Frank's last bagel, Max Brenner.In the second place, this is clearly not a review that's demanding to get written. Katz's was founded in 1888, and as far as I know, has never been given a rated review. Frank normally doesn't pick review targets out of nowhere, only to trash them. Actually, when Frank chooses the review target-as he clearly has done here-it is usually a rave. (Max Brenner was the exception to that rule.)In the third place, Frank is a confirmed carnivore, and he clearly prefers casual food to formality and luxury. When Frank is reviewing one of his favored cuisines, a positive review is usually the outcome.And lastly, does Frank Bruni really have the balls to give the goose-egg to a revered institution like Katz's?The Bet: Lately, we've been getting clobbered whenever we bet against the oddsmakers. Nevertheless, we once again think Eater's got this one wrong. We predict that Frank Bruni will award one star to Katz's Deli.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Le Perigord. In a town where a five-year-old restaurant can seem old, Le Perigord is a survivor. Open since 1964, it is one of the city's few remaining classic haute French restaurants. Actually, if you're looking for a certain kind of French elegance, Le Perigord and La Grenouille are your only options. I found La Grenouille fair-to-middling when I visited a few months ago, so I thought it was time to give Le Perigord a try. For the record, Le Perigord currently carries a two-star rating from The New York Times, per William Grimes in 2000. An oft-reviewed restaurant, it has ranged between one and three stars, depending on the critic and the year. First one critic would find Le Perigord over-the-hill; then, a new chef would arrive, and shake things up. Jacques Qualin, the chef when Grimes reviewed it, left in 2003, replaced by Joel Benjamin, whom I assume is the man in charge today (his name is not on the menu). The space has never been as lovely as the rival Grenouille. Grimes found it looking much better after a 2000 renovation, but it nevertheless seems a little dull. The curtains don't quite have the sheen that they should; the lighting, neither bright nor dim, doesn't help. There's an \"old smell,\" as if the space hasn't had a good airing out. But the banquettes are comfortable, the tables set elegantly. The Friday before Memorial Day was probably not a typical evening. No more than eight tables were occupied, most of them with patrons not younger than 70. The captain assured me that there's normally a more varied dinner crowd, as I expect there would be with the United Nations located just a few blocks to the south. Only a skeleton service staff seemed to be on duty on this holiday-weekend evening, but they were attentive and friendly. The menu for dinner is $65 prix fixe, about $30 less than La Grenouille, although numerous dishes carry supplements. Many of the menu choices are classic French staples. A few choices break that pattern, such as a Kobe-style ribeye. The wine list wasn't nearly as over-priced as I expected, but there were very few half-bottles. Make that almost none. There were about a half-dozen choices by the glass, but I wanted a half-bottle, so I landed on a Pouilly-Fuisse basically by default. It turned out to be a wonderful wine to go with fish, so I was none the worse for the lack of choice. I wasn't very encouraged when the butter that came with the bread service was rock-hard, clearly sliced long before I arrived, and stored in the fridge. But the food turned out to be very good indeed. To start, smoked salmon in a pastry crust was beautifully presented, and the vegetable garnish was most enjoyable. I was especially impressed with the sea bass entree. The skin was crisp, and the flesh tender. The sauce was described as champagne and caviar. I detected no caviar, but with the fish prepared so immacuately, it hardly mattered. Four souffles are available ($6 supplement, and you have to order them before dinner): chocolate, black currant, grand marnier, and armagnac. I chose the armagnac souffle, which initially looked a lot prettier than the photo shows, before the server split it open and poured a hot armagnac sauce at the table. It's probably no accident that restaurants offering classic French cuisine are going the way of the dinosaur: it's a style of dining that no longer appeals to many diners. Truth to tell, I don't choose it very often myself. But when I'm in that mood, it's nice to know that places like Le Perigord are still there.

Frank Bruni resumed his assault on the star system yesterday, after a few months when most of his ratings actually seemed somewhat sensible. Resto won two stars (the same as The Modern and Gordon Ramsay), apparently because it has great lamb ribs, french fries with mayonaise, and perhaps one or two other good dishes.Those stars come with a \"forewarning\":Resto - the name is slang for restaurant [thank heavens he cleared that up] - doesn't take reservations for groups smaller than six, and on some nights there's a 45-minute wait by 7:30. It can be difficult to reach the bar through the crowd around it and even tougher to hear servers through the din.If that wasn't enough Bruni for one week, you can read his Critic's Notebook piece on Marc Vetri's pair of Italian restaurants in Philadelphia, Vetri and Osteria. It's nice to see Bruni branch out a bit, but why must it always be Italian?In the wagering department, NYJ absorbs another tough loss this week, losing $1 on our hypothetical bet, while Eater wins a whopping $5. We should have remembered our own advice: the restaurants Bruni chooses to review-as opposed to those he must review-are usually two stars.

Note: Click here for a review of the Tasting Room's hamburger and the 2008 menu changes. As of June 2008, the Tasting Room has closed. A new restaurant by former A Voce chef Andrew Carmellini will replace it, probably in early 2009. The Tasting Room opened in 2000 in the East Village, and was an immediate hit. Those were the days when the East Village hadn't quite \"arrived\" as a dining destination. But diners flocked to the Tasting Room anyway. William Grimes of the Times wasn't quite as impressed, awarding just one star. Chef Colin Alevras and his wife Renée eventually outgrew the 11-table space, and last year they moved to NoLIta, tripling the size of the restaurant. (The old space is now the Tasting Room Wine Bar and Café.) Was the move an improvement? Adam Platt of New York says yes, awarding two stars. Frank Bruni of the Times says no, awarding just one. Bruni endured sub-par service, but the early hiccups have now been worked out. We had a thoroughly enjoyable experience at the Tasting Room last Saturday night. Alevras may not hit a home run with every dish, but most of what he does is first-class, and the service team is on top of their game. The menu's main conceit—from which the restaurant draws its name—is that each dish is available in two portion sizes: \"taste\" and \"share.\" These basically correspond to appetizer and entrée portions. The menu is divided into two sections on facing pages—“To Start\" and \"To Continue”—and you can have either a taste or a share of any item, on either side. Got that? It gets more confusing still. Although the larger portions are labeled \"To Share,\" the server recommended ordering five or six \"Tastes,\" and sharing those. So, it turns out that the \"Tastes\" can be shared, too. If you longed for a simpler ordering system, you would be entirely justified. On the starter side of the menu, tastes are $11–16, shares are $18–28. On the entrée side of the menu, tastes are $16–25, shares are $28–46. The most expensive share is not what you'd expect: it's a serving of Morel & Porcini Mushrooms. The menu changes daily, according to market availability. There were many items that appealed to us, but we finally settled on five \"tastes,\" to share. Asparagus (left); Guinea Hen Terrine (right) The Tasting Room's creations tend to have a lot of ingredients. Asparagus ($14) came with spinach, crushed eggs, and a buckwheat crèpe. A Guinea Hen Terrine ($14) came with wildflower pollen mustard, a toasted English muffin, onion, and pickled beans. The asparagus was just fine, though I didn't think the buckwheat crèpe added anything. The terrine was wonderful, but we had never seen such red poultry, and we wondered if it were a mistake. The server assured us it was not. Once again, the English muffin didn't add much. Alaskan King Salmon (left); Lamb Meatballs (right) Since we had ordered five savory courses, one of them had to come by itself, and that was the Alaskan King Salmon ($22). The menu announced a bunch of accompaniments (chicory, comfrey, green onion, fava bean leaves, sorrel), but they could have been potato chips for all we cared. The salmon ruled here, and it was as tender as you could ever wish for. This was the one must-have dish that we tried. Lamb Meatballs ($17) came with another cavalcade of supporting actors: shiitake mushrooms, tatsoi, spring onion, grits. Notwithstanding all that, the meatballs seemed like a dish you could make at home—not bad by any means, but not that special either. Ossabow Island Pork Belly \"under Glass\" (left); Selection of American Farmhouse Cheeses (right) Curiously, the Pork Belly ($18) was the one menu item only offered in the smaller-sized portion. It came to the table with a glass \"bell\" over the plate, which the server removed in a \"Voila\" moment. As usual, the pork came with plenty of friends (mushrooms, buckwheat, ramps), but it didn't need all that help. It was a luscious serving, rich in fat and bountiful in flavor. We concluded with the cheese plate ($15) with walnut raisin bread, which was just fine, but didn't have the smooth-to-sharp progression of the better cheese selections we've had. Even in its original location, the Tasting Room was known for its selection of American wines, many from obscure producers. The present list is still mainly American, but there are ample selections from France and a few other places. Given the restaurant's emphasis on locally-sourced ingredients, we wondered why there weren't more Long Island wines on the list. But it was not an evening to solve that mystery, so we turned to California: Alder Grenache 2004, Alisos Vinyard, Santa Barbara County ($48), which went well with the rest of our order. I left with the sense that many of the dishes could do with one or two fewer ingredients, but Alevras has a sure-handed touch with poultry, fish, and meats. Out of our six choices, not one was disappointing. The King Salmon and the Pork Belly were especially impressive. The décor is a kind of \"barnyard chic\" that's appropriate for the neighborhood. We had a 6:30 p.m. reservation, and the space didn't really start to heat up until we were about ready to leave. We didn't find it overly noisy. Service was knowledgeable and attentive. I can't make comparisons to the old Tasting Room, which I never visited, but the current version seems to have its act together.

Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 2-1 Two Stars: 5-1 √√Three Stars: 75-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: In this week's game, jokers are wild. Anything can happen. As Eater points out, Resto would have historically belonged in the $25-and-under critic's territory, and wouldn't have had a starred review at all. But with Peter Meehan reviewing taco trucks these days, any restaurant with seating defaults to Bruni. With most of the entrees at Resto priced below $20, this is precisely the kind of restaurant Bruni loves.Bruni certainly hasn't hesitated to award two stars to unlikely candidates. But when he does so, it's usually only when the restaurant has already achieved a significant \"foodie following.\" Frank then swoops in, and his rating confirms what the experts already knew. Resto has flown mostly under the radar, notwithstanding a 4-out-of-5 rating on New York's \"casual scale.\" If any of the usual suspects have suggested that Resto was a NYT two-star restaurant, I must have missed it.Frank sometimes grades on a gentler curve when reviewing restaurants in under-served neighborhoods, but no one would seriously suggest that 29th Street at Park Avenue South is such a neighborhood.The Bet: Though we won't be surprised to wake up to a two-star review, we are going to bet conservatively this week on one star.

Note: p*ong closed in March 2009. After an underwhelming dinner at FR.OG, we didn't quite feel ready to call it an evening, so we headed over to p*ong, the new dessert place by former Spice Market pastry chef Pichet Ong. Actually, that's not quite accurate. p*ong has savory courses on its menu too, like a shrimp and mango ceviche ($12), bluefin tuna tartare ($14), or American wagyu carpaccio ($19). A ten-course tasting menu is $59, with six savory and four sweet courses. But it's for desserts that Pichet Ong made his name, and it's for desserts that we dropped in. The specialty cocktails looked interesting, so I gave the Bangkok Margarita ($12) a try. Made with tequilla, pineapple, ginger juice, agave, and aleppo pepper, it packed a hefty punch. For those who come only for dessert, there's a three-course tasting for $25, or a five-course tasting that includes cheese for $35. Most of the individual desserts are either $10 or $12. We were a little too full for a dessert tasting menu, but we ordered two of the items featured on that menu, and shared. Chevre Cheesecake Croquette (left); Malted chocolate Bavarian tart (right) Chevre Cheesecake Croquette ($10) came with pineapple, a walnut crust, and chocolate-coffee fudge. I lean toward the theory that the basic cheesecake is too perfect to fool around with, but in this case the walnut crust worked perfectly with a wonderful gooey cheesecake. The Malted Chocolate Bavarian Tart ($12) was topped with carmelized banana and served with Ovaltine ice cream on the side. This was less memorable than the cheesecake, but I'm not a choco-holic, so you can take that with a grain of salt. We weren't sure whether petits-fours or the plate they came on were the more interesting attraction, but we appreciated both. Service seemed a bit rushed to us. There was about a 15-minute wait for a table when we arrived at 10:00 p.m. By the time we were seated, the restaurant was clearing out, so we saw no good reason for the food to come quite as briskly as it did. We suspect that the rhythm of the place is geared to quick table-turning, as there are West Village rents to pay, with a menu that doesn't lend itself to large tabs. Still, two desserts and two drinks came to $55.27 including tax (before tip). We're in our 40s, and we didn't notice many patrons older than us. Long-term success will depend on drawing in diners who are willing to spend that kind of money on dessert. We weren't quite as enamored with p*ong as we were with Room 4 Dessert, but p*ong is plenty of fun. Both the signature cocktails and the desserts warrant more exploration, and I wouldn't mind giving the savory courses a shot. Make sure to look at a map before you go, as it's located at one of those West Village intersections where one can easily get lost. p*ong (150 West 10th Street at Waverley Place, West Village) Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Instead of being known as a dessert place it should be know for its cocktails they are amazing! The Bangok Margarita was good, but I tried another one that had Canton, a cognac ginger liqueur, and it was amazing!! Highly recommend it, specially if paired up with a salty dish, i had it with the carpaccio and it was to die for!

Update: Didier Virot left FR.OG in late 2007 to open a new restaurant in the Plaza Hotel. Jarett Brodie was his replacement. In a move of dazzling subtlety, the owners finally dropped the period from the restaurant's title, and added a new basement lounge called \"Origine.\" Did they believe that a mere period was enough to change this restaurant's fortunes? As of October 2008, it was closed. In December, it re-opened as FROG Cafe. Isn't it time the association with amphibious critters was dropped? FR.OG is the latest offering from Chef Didier Virot with partner Philip Kirsh, who also own the restaurant Aix on the Upper West Side. Aix had its share of pains, as Virot's upscale cuisine wasn't a good fit for the neighborhood, and the place was later re-imagined as a more casual brasserie. FR.OG doesn't appear to be off to a good start, either. It scored a rare pan from Restaurant Girl, and landed on the Eater Deathwatch just eight days after it opened (about a month ago, as I write this). Bread Service Cucumber Tomato SaladThe name, which is hardly appetizing, stands for \"France Origine.\" The theme is the cuisines of nations that have been inspired by the French, although the primary influence on display seems to be Moroccan. The decor is SoHo Chic, and could as easily be home to an ice cream parlor or a tapas bar. Eater justifies the early deathwatch with the explanation that no restaurant of this kind has survived. I'm not ready to write off FR.OG just yet, but it needs to get better. We were pleased with the bread service-warm sliced pita with dipping sauce-but the visual presentation left a lot to be desired. I started with the cucumber tomato salad with yogurt lime dressing and cilantro ($10). Consistent with the evening's theme, the dish was enjoyable to eat, but the plating wasn't pretty to look at. Braised Lamb shank with Roasted Duck Breast But that salad plating was worthy of Picasso compared to the entree, a braised lamb shank with roasted duck breast, with cinnamon, chickpea, red onion, and Moroccan couscous ($28). The shotgun wedding of lamb and duck seemed bizarre, and the distinctly unappetizing presentation on the plate looked like slop. Having said that, Virot did a terrific job with the couscous and the duck. The lamb shank tasted just fine, but there didn't seem to be any attempt to impart any flavor beyond what ordinary kitchen braising would produce. Platings are indeed the problem here. Restaurant Girl complained about the phallic-looking Colossal Shrimp, which looked just as absurd in person as it did on her blog. The wine list at FR.OG has some truly intriguing choices at good prices. We loved a 2003 Mas de la Dame 'Le Stele', from Provence, a region not often featured in restaurants. The appellation, Les Baux de Provence, was unfamiliar to me, but the 40/60 Cabernet/Syrah blend was the evening's highlight. The SoHo crowd was late to arrive, but by 9:30 p.m. or so, the space was nearly full, and by then we could only barely hear ourselves talk. Come to think of it, we were shouting and cupping our ears for most of the evening. FR.OG isn't particularly pleasant. The food has potential, but it needs some fine-tuning. At least, it is not terribly expensive. Appetizers are $9-18, entrees $24-36. We skipped dessert, and headed over to p*ong.

I've written about Harry's Steak twice now (here; here), and normally wouldn't have thought there was any more worth saying about the place.But the other night they were offering a special so unusual that I had to blog about it: a bone-in filet mignon. Filet is virtually always served off-the-bone, so I was sufficiently curious that I ordered it. Steaks cooked on the bone are usually more flavorful, and that certainly seemed true here. The combination wet-dry aging process left it with a cool mineral flavor. It was cooked with a nice char, to the requested medium-rare temperature.Harry's offers all of the usual steakhouse sides, but I ordered the Peas & Bacon ($8.50), which is a bit more offbeat. It was the kind of dish that could make me into a pea-lover (not an easy task), though I didn't taste much of the bacon.When the bill arrived, I was surprised to learn that the filet was $55. The other steaks at Harry's, including their off-the-bone filet, are around the $40 mark (the going rate in Manhattan), and I had no reason to expect the filet would be any different. Most restaurants don't recite the price of the specials unless you ask. But I do think they have an obligation to say something if one of the specials is significantly more expensive than the rest of their menu.In multiple visits to Harry's, I've never found it crowded. Servers are friendly and competent, but as noted here and on past occasions, they have a tendency to up-sell. However, for the pure steak lover, Harry's gives the better places in town a run for their money.Harry's Steak (97 Pearl Street at Hanover Square, Financial District)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

I previously awarded three stars to BLT Prime, based on two earlier visits-especially my first visit (the second wasn't so impressive). Three stars for a steakhouse? Was that irrational exuberance? Recently, I sampled the BLT experience yet again. Do Laurent Tourondel's steakhouses kick ass? Yes, they do. Does that accomplishment warrant three stars? Probably not. We visited on Mother's Day at around 7:00 p.m. without a reservation. The restaurant was perhaps a little over half full. That fact signals BLT Prime's limitation, for though the food is excellent, its heavy-handed informality is a deterrent on special occasions. (On most other nights BLT Prime seems to fill up easily-that's my unscientific observation based on periodic OpenTable scans.) Some aspects of the service remain incomprehensible. Given that the menu is a loose sheet of paper that obviously must be reprinted frequently-probably daily-why must the specials be printed on a separate piece of paper? And why drop off two copies of the menu, but only one of the specials? And why is the menu also displayed on large boards in a corner of the restaurant where perhaps only 20% of diners can see it? The BLT restaurants are a carb-o-phile's dream. First come two slices of country bread, with a terrific pâte to spread. Then come the legendary popovers with soft, creamy butter. At this point, anyone with a normal stomach is already feeling half-full, and the appetizers haven't even arrived yet. Knowing this would be the case, we didn't order appetizers and went streat to the steaks. We were both drawn to the five-pepper crusted bone-in New York strip ($42), one of the daily specials. The mineral taste from dry aging was superb, and the steak had a beautifully charred exterior, with just the right fat content. This was about as good a preparation of NY strip as they come. Horseradish sauce (one of nine offered) complemented the steak nicely. Potato skins ($8) were competently done, but a tad too dry. Two small petits-fours after dinner were a bonus not normally expected at a steakhouse, though we hardly needed any more calories at this point. As it was a Sunday evening, we didn't order a whole bottle of wine, but I noted there were no bargains to be had on the list, and wines by the glass didn't come cheap either. We each had a glass of the house pinot noir ($14). With Laurent Tourondel constantly opening new BLTs, he can't be paying much attention to the existing ones. I've paid about nine visits in total to his various restaurants, and they can be maddeningly uneven. Brasserie Ruhlmann, the only kitchen he runs that doesn't have his initials in the name, is an embarrassment. But at BLT Prime, he left a solid management team in place. It's a \"BLT\" still worth visiting, even if Tourondel is busy elsewhere. BLT Prime (111 East 22nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, Gramercy) Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **

The Four Seasons

***CONTENT
The Four Seasons is an iconic restaurant. Located in the Seagram Building at 52nd & Park, it opened in 1959 to immediate acclaim. Architect Philip Johnson designed the interior, which cost $4.5 million to build. Even today, that would be a large sum to invest in a restaurant. The space is landmarked-the only Manhattan restaurant to be so designated. (There are other restaurants in landmarked buildings, but no other restaurants that are landmarks themselves.) Reviewing for The New York Times on October 2, 1959, Craig Claiborne wrote: There has never been a restaurant better keyed to the tempo of Manhattan than the Four Seasons, which opened recently at 99 East Fifty-second Street. Both in decor and in menu, it is spectacular, modern and audaceous. It is expensive and opulent and it is perhaps the most exciting restaurant to open in new York within the last two decades. On the whole, the cuisine is exquisite in the sense that la grande cuisine française is exquisite. The Pool RoomThese days, the Four Seasons is mostly known as a power lunch destination. In the famous grill room, one may rub noses with Hillary Clinton, Henry Kissinger, Mike Bloomberg, or Sandy Weill. The serene pool room is one of the city's most romantic dining spots. Celebrities have flocked there from the beginning. John F. Kennedy had his 45th birthday party at the Four Seasons, of which the restaurant doesn't fail to remind you: a copy of the menu for that occasion is bound into the wine list. For many years, the kitchen at the Four Seasons turned out food that justified all that attention. eGullet historian Leonard Kim found numerous Times reviews from 1971 onward-generally three stars, although in 1979, its twentieth anniversary year, Mimi Sheraton demoted it to two. Her successor, Bryan Miller, restored it to three stars in 1985. He re-affirmed that rating in 1990, as did Ruth Reichl in 1995. The BarIn recent times, no one has suggested that the Four Seasons is a hotbed of culinary invention. Earlier this year, Frank Bruni demoted the Four Seasons to two stars, where it is likely to remain for a very long time. Christian Albin has been in charge of the kitchen for the last seventeen years, and though the menu does change with the seasons, Albin is not a risk-taker. He dutifully turns out the continental classics that the restaurant's conservative clientele demands. Bruni found, and I concur, that the cooking can be terrific, but it can be boring and sloppy too. Though I expected no pyrotechnic fireworks on the plate, I nevertheless craved a visit to the legendary Four Seasons, and my friend Kelly's 37th birthday provided the occasion. Frank Bruni warned that this is \"a restaurant that runs on two tracks - one for the anonymous, another for the anointed.\" As Kelly and I are clearly in the former category, I wondered how we'd be treated. I needn't have worried on that score. I requested a Pool Room table, and we were indeed seated there, close to the famous pool. The serving staff at the Four Seasons seem mildly bored with their lot in life, but they provided classic, efficient service. When I arrived a bit wet (it was raining, and I'd forgotten my umbrella), the host handed me a napkin to dry off with. I started the evening with a drink at the bar, and the tab was transferred to my dinner bill, as it should be at any fine restaurant. At no point were we made to feel anything less than special. The prices are eye-popping, with most appetizers $18-42 (not counting caviar at $140), and most entrees $37-56 (with lobster $75 and Kobe beef $125). Of sixteen entrees, eight are over $50, and only three are under $40. As far as I know, it is the most expensive à la carte menu in town. While we enjoyed almost everything we had, it was one of those celebratory occasions when price is really beside the point. Viewed in the cold light of day, very little that the kitchen produces can justify these prices. To start, I had the Beef Tartare with Osetra Caviar ($38), an assembly-line dish that had none of the tangy, spicy seasoning I was longing for. Kelly started with an assortment of oysters and clams ($25), with which she seemed satisfied. I was keen to have the duck, which was one of the few dishes Frank Bruni really loved. Fortunately, Kelly was of the same mind, since it's served only for two ($55 per person). As Bruni put it, the duck, carved tableside, \"emerges from a Peking-style sequence of many days and steps, is as astonishing as ever, a knockout of crunchy skin and succulent meat.\" Have I ever had duck better than this? Not that I recall. Kelly loves souffles ($15), so we ordered them for dessert: strawberry for her, Grand Marnier for me. We both thought the strawberry was a little better, though neither one matched the absurdly decadent chocolate souffle we had at Town. I alerted the management in advance that this was Kelly's birthday, and they brought one of the odder birthday cakes I've seen: a large ball of cotton candy with a candle on top. It was probably the most creative idea they had, but after a few bites the cotton candy quickly became cloying. There was an attractive selection of petits-fours, and we finished nearly all of them. For a restaurant of this calibre, I was surprised to find that the wine list was rather unimpressive. Indeed, more pages of the little book are devoted to photos from the restaurant's past than to wines. However, I was happy to find a wonderful 1999 Gewurtztraminer from Alsace for $76. At the restaurant's overall price level, I considered it a bargain. It arrived at our table before we were done with our champagne, and the server was astute enough not to pour it right away-a nice touch that many restaurants wouldn't get right. While I wouldn't visit the Four Seasons for the food alone, the whole package is certainly impressive. For the right special occasion, I'd be happy to dine there again.

As expected, Frank Bruni awarded the deuce to Anthos. It was as enthusiastic as Frank gets at the two-star level, and he implied that the restaurant fell only a whisker short of three:[Anthos is] the restaurant you might get if you triangulated between Onera and Dona. It has the former's resoundingly Greek soul. It has the latter's fussy tics and more sophisticated wine list, with sommeliers who can guide you through the impressive advances of Greek winemaking.It's better than its predecessors, although it doesn't come together quite smoothly or sharply enough to loft Mr. Psilakis and Ms. Arpaia to the level they clearly aspire to and will almost certainly reach.The review marks the return of Fussy Frank. As we've often remarked, Frank does not like fine dining-a peculiar deficiency in a critic assigned to cover high-end restaurants. And \"fussy\" is his favorite word when he feels he's been pampered too much.The precise reasons for the two-star rating border on incoherent. He says, \"Much of the cooking is inspired, and much of it is excellent.\" What's the Venn Diagram for that statement? Is some of the food inspired, but not excellent? Excellent, but not inspired? Later on, the servers' exuberance \"communicates a self-consciousness that only a few of the dishes are transcendent enough to justify,\" and \"not everything that arrives is worth the wait.\"Later still, \"the ratio of hits to misses is better at Anthos than at Dona\" (a restaurant he loved), but he wishes \"the kitchen's efforts\" were \"just a little more selective and straightforward.\" Good luck making any sense of that smorgasbord of \"almost...but not quite\" sentences. The one thing he makes clear is that he likes this restaurant better than any Arpaia/Psilakis production to date, but in the end, lands at the same two-star rating given to the rest of them.Eater and I both placed identical $1 winning bets on Anthos at 2-1 odds, so each of us wins a hypothetical $2.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews the haute Greek restaurant Anthos, the latest collaboration of chef Michael Psilakis with the comely restauranteur Donatella Arpaia. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 7-1 One Star: 4-1 Two Stars: 2-1 √√Three Stars: 7-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: All indications point to two stars. Frank Bruni has already awarded that rating to two other Psilakis restaurants, Onera and Dona, and he seems hopelessly besotted with Arpaia.At one point, we thought Anthos could be headed for a trifecta, which was no doubt Psilakis's intention when he closed Onera, and announced he was going for something more upscale. But no critic so far has been wowed by Anthos, and Bruni isn't the type who says a restaurant is better than everyone else says it is.We agree with the Eater oddsmakers that one star is more likely than three, but that would be a very significant slapdown. Bruni's affinity for Everything Arpaia will save the day.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award two stars to Anthos.

Brasserie Ruhlmann got on my \"ought-to-try\" list after I heard that Laurent Tourondel had taken over the kitchen. Perhaps I ought to have been suspicious.Laurent Tourondel has spread himself thinner than goose liver pâte. He has four other Manhattan restaurants in his BLT franchise (BLT Steak, BLT Prime, BLT Fish, and BLT Burger), a fifth opening this summer (BLT Market), and BLT Steak outposts in two other cities. He's built up that empire in just a shade over three years, so he can't be spending much time in any of his kitchens.Brasserie Ruhlmann was a quick rescue job. The restaurant opened in January 2006 with another executive chef, and Tourondel was named to the post just three months later. I assume Tourondel got a tidy consultant's fee to design a standard-issue French brasserie menu that he could hand over to a chef de cuisine, and never think about again. His name is on the menu and his cookbook prominently displayed, but there's none of the inspiration that make the BLT restaurants so impressive. (Update: Tourondel has yet another offspring: BLT Steak in the Westchester Ritz-Carlton.)Brasserie Ruhlmann is named for the art deco furniture designer Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann. Owner Jean Denoyer is a Ruhlmann collector himself, and he spent $5 million building out the spectacular space on Rockefeller Plaza, where the art deco theme is always at home. Denoyer knows a little something about restaurants too, as he also owns the Michelin-starred La Goulue on the Upper East Side (among other places).Alas, the kitchen just goes through the motions. You'll have a satisfactory meal at Brasserie Ruhlmann, but nothing you can't have at many other French brasseries around town, or indeed at La Goulue, where the food is better, and the atmosphere feels far less like a tourist trap.We arrived at around 8:00 p.m. on a Saturday night, with the restaurant nearly deserted. It seemed like a nice evening, so we decided to sit outdoors. Drinks-a sidecar for me, a whiskey sour for my girlfriend-took twenty minutes to arrive. The manager explained that they'd never heard of a sidecar, and had to look it up. After all that time, they served my girlfriend whiskey straight-up, rather than a whiskey sour. We sent it back.By now, it was 8:25. Though we had only just started sipping our cocktails, naturally they were keen to take our wine and food order instantly, but we were having none of that. When we finally did order, the wine came promptly, but the waiter struggled to uncork it. After a minor skirmish, he managed to push the cork into the bottle. With a sheepish look, he disappeared.Meanwhile, the rains had come, so we headed inside. A short while later (it was now 9:00), he returned to our new table with the wine in a decanter-\"very well filtered,\" he assured us.Complain all you want about Laurent Tourondel, but the bread service is always superb at his restaurants. Gougères (above, right) were perhaps the most original item we had at Brasserie Ruhlmann.Country Pâte (left); Beef Shortribs Bourguignonne (right)Country Pâte ($12) was competently prepared, although fairly ordinary. Beef Shortribs Bourguignonne ($28) were served in a generous portion, though the sauce was a bit heavy. (The photo doesn't do it justice-beef seldom photographs well.)After the comic mishaps with the drinks, the rest of the evening's service was just fine. On principle, we thought that the drinks should have been comped-but they weren't. The restaurant was nearly empty while we were there. It is probably busier and livelier at lunch, as at dinner time there's usually no reason to be in the area. So far, it doesn't look like Brasserie Ruhlmann will change that.Brasserie Ruhlmann (45 Rockefeller Plaza, 50th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Rockefeller Center, West Midtown)Food: SatisfactoryService: MediocreAmbiance: GoodOverall: Satisfactory

Note: Wild Salmon closed at the end of 2007, yet another failure for Jeffrey Chodorow. Wild Salmon is the latest offering from restauranteur Jeffrey Chodorow. His China Grill Management empire now spans twenty-five restaurants in ten cities-several of them mini-chains, such as Asia de Cuba and China Grill, both in five cities. The first opened in 1987, so it's clear he turns them out in a hurry. He's also a prolific failure. Just three months ago, Kobe Club received zero stars from Frank Bruni of the Times. It was a replacement for another failure, Mix in New York. Wild Salmon replaces the failed English is Italian, which replaced the failed Tuscan, which replaced the failed Tuscan Steak. Across town, there was the failed Rocco's (made famous in the TV series The Restaurant) and its successor, the failed Brasserio Caviar and Banana. All gone. The Upstairs Bar Wild Salmon, described as \"A Pacific N. W. Brasserie,\" looks to have a brighter future. A solid and moderately priced seafood restaurant, it should have no trouble drawing on an East Midtown corporate audience looking to eat well, if unadventurously. Chef Charles Ramsayer, who moved to New York from Seattle, flies in everything he serves from the Pacific Northwest. The menu offers the usual raw bar items, including several varieties of salmon, prepared every conceivable way. Or you can have anything from Penn Cove Mussels ($7) to a huge platter costing $160. Other starters are $11-26. Bread service (left); Smoked scallops cocktail (right) I started with the Smoked Scallops ($13), served with sour cream & chives and cocktail sauce-a happy riff on the more commonplace shrimp cocktail (also available). The bread was mightily addictive. The entree menu offers a range of composed dishes ($21-38), along with an à la carte section where you choose a protein, a cooking method, and a sauce. Just considering the à la carte seafood options (there's beef too), there are seven fish, five cooking methods, and eight sauces, making for a dizzying array of 280 combinations, before side dishes are considered. Cedar Planked King Salmon with Meyer Lemon Orange Hollandaise Sauce The server recommended the Cedar Planked King Salmon with the Meyer Lemon Orange Hollandaise sauce. At $37, it was $10 more than the next most expensive à la carte fish. It certainly was a solid choice, but there are 279 more options, and it could take a decade to try them all. If Wild Salmon lasts that long. Among the composed entrees, more than one server recommended the Black Cod ($28), but I doubted that Nobu's version of it could be improved upon, so I took a pass. Cheesecake I had cheesecake for dessert ($9), which wasn't particularly memorable. The restaurant is still in its first few weeks of business. It was not full at 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening. Nevertheless, as one would expect at a Chodorow restaurant, I was firmly commanded to retire to the bar until my girlfriend arrived. At least it is a comfortable bar that one doesn't mind retiring to. Everyone working at Wild Salmon is excited to be there, or they're putting on a damned good act. Bloomberg reviewer Alan Richman complained that they were too talkative, and I suspect other visitors will too, but we were merely amused. Lines like \"We have a plethora of side dishes\" or \"We have tons of appetizers\" aren't all that helpful. The wine list is reasonably priced in relation to the rest of the menu. A sommelier came over unbidden and steered us to a terrific pinot noir ($52), and probably not one I would have thought to choose. The space is attractive and comfortable. Built on two levels, the dining room is downstairs, the bar upstairs. Hundreds of little sculpted salmons hang above the dining room (they reminded Richman of sperm), reminiscent of Kobe Club's dangling samurai swords. But here, one needn't worry of imminent death should one of them fall. We enjoyed our meal, but wouldn't rush back. We suspect that'll be Frank Bruni's verdict, too. The bartender told us that, as far as they knew, Bruni hadn't been in yet. I suggest they simplify the menu. Frank doesn't like to have quite so many choices. Neither did we.

Spice Market

***CONTENT
A little over three years ago, Spice Market's arrival signaled a milestone for the Meatpacking District. For the first time, a serious restauranteur (Jean-Georges Vongerichten) was staking claim to an area that used to be a wholesale meat market and prostitution haunt. Indeed, in a much-ridiculed three-star review, Amanda Hesser of the Times advised Vongerichten to pump ginger aroma into the street, to overcome \"the stench of blood and offal from the surrounding meatpacking district.\" She added, \"It's hardly an olfactory amuse-bouche.\" Nowadays, your tender nostrils needn't worry about the stench of blood: the original meatpackers are long gone, and the area is a maze of clubs and mostly second-tier restaurants. Whether it has any restaurants worth your while is open to debate. I am probably in the minority, when I tell you that there are actually a few Meatpacking restaurants I like. Until yesterday, I'd never been to Spice Market, except for drinks. In the early days, it was one of the city's toughest tables to book, and I never bothered. However, when a friend suggested it, I was happy to accept the invitation, as it was the only one of Vongerichten's Manhattan restaurants I'd never been to. Things have settled down a bit, although Spice Market still does brisk business. On a Tuesday night, most tables were taken, and I noted that all of the luxurious private rooms downstairs were fully booked. The pan-Asian menu is divided into appetizers ($9.00-14.50), salads ($7.50-14.00), soups ($7.50-8.50), seafood entrees ($18-30), meat entrees ($16-36), and noodles/rice ($2.00-14.50). At the bottom comes the ominous warning, \"All dishes are served family style.\" That means they come out of the kitchen, and onto the middle of the table, when the kitchen is ready to serve them-not necessarily when you're ready to eat them. We weren't sure how much food we needed, and \"small plate\" restaurants like Spice Market tend to encourage over-ordering. For appetizers, we tried the Black Pepper Shrimp ($14.50), which was nicely balanced in true Vongerichten fashion with sun dried pineapples. Mushroom Egg Rolls ($9.50 for four) with a galangal dipping sauce were also excellent. We moved on to the Ginger Fried Rice ($7), which came topped with a fried egg, sunny side up, with ginger and garlic. This was so irresistible that we practically inhaled it, and didn't wait for any of the entrees to arrive. The kitchen also did well by a tangy Cod with Malaysian Chili Sauce ($19), which the waiter divided and served tableside. Both meat entrees disappointed. Pork Vindaloo ($19) and Red Curried Duck ($19) both tasted like they could have been simmering for a week, with generic sauces that could have come from any curry house on any back street. Amanda Hesser loved both, but they've lost whatever appeal they once had. In the end, we probably ordered one dish more than we needed, but I was glad to be able to sample a broader swath of the menu. Most dishes were spicy, but not particularly so. The server was about right, when he said that the heat of the Pork Vindaloo was \"5 on a scale of 1 to 10.\" I had recalled that Thai Jewels were the best of the desserts, and though we were quite full, we had to give it a try. Here we agreed with Amanda Hesser, so I'll let her tell it: Tiny bits of sweet water chestnut are glazed with tapioca, dyed candy colors like cherry red and lime green. These jewels are blended with palm seeds and slivers of jackfruit and papaya, then heaped onto a nest of coconut ice. It is fruity, nutty, cold and slushy, a wonderful mess of flavors, not unlike Lucky Charms. The wine list isn't long or complex, with reds and whites listed in each of three categories: smooth, bold, spicy. I chose a spicy red wine for $48, and we were quite pleased with it. Servers were well versed in the menu and gave reasonable ordering advice. The choreography of waiters and runners sometimes got a bit discombobulated. At the table next to us, they managed to spill a whole bottle of water. Nothing so alarming happened to us, but there were minor glitches. Yet, at other times the service was more polished than you'd expect for a restaurant in Spice Market's price range. Despite the \"family style\" menu, the pace was quite reasonable, and we spent around 2½ hours there. I don't know if we lucked out, or if they actually try to time the courses intelligently. Anyhow, it's a good thing we were never served more than one dish at a time, as our small two-top wouldn't have accommodated any more. What can you say about the Disney-meets-Thailand decor, and serving staff in orange pajamas? You'll love it or hate it, but it has no peer in Manhattan. I would guess that Jean-Georges Vongerichten spends no more than 15 seconds a month thinking about Spice Market. It runs on reputation. But there's just enough left that you can see what all the excitement was about. Spice Market (403 West 13th Street at Ninth Avenue, Meatpacking District) Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Today's review is a bit of a snoozer, confirming our hypothesis that Frank Bruni is bored. He arrives at the correct ratings for Craftbar and Craftsteak (one and two stars, respectively), but he doesn't have much passion for either restaurant. Maybe he banged it out on his laptop in between naps on his long flight back from Los Angeles, where he recently traveled to review a pizzeria. With apparently no NYC restaurants remaining that interest him, perhaps we can persuade Frank to take his discerning palate to the opposite coast, where no doubt they are hungering for a parade of Italian restaurant and steakhouse reviews.Eater and I both placed identical $1 winning bets on Craftbar (2-1 odds) and Craftsteak (3-1 odds), netting each of us a total of $5 for the week.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: After last week's gross dereliction of duty, Frank Bruni is back in action tomorrow with reviews of two real restaurants: Craftbar and Craftsteak. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):CraftbarZero Stars: 3-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 5-1 Three Stars: 20-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1 CraftsteakZero Stars: 7-2 One Star: 4-1 Two Stars: 3-1 √√ Three Stars: 12-1Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: All the critics in town pummeled Craftsteak after it opened last year, with Herr Bruni awarding just a measley star in July 2006. Tom Colicchio's steakhouse did everything right except the one thing at which it had to excel: steaks. I visited twice, and wasn't wowed either time. Colicchio publicly admitted that he had goofed, fired the chef de cuisine, and bought new cooking equipment-including a broiler, inexplicably not part of the original plan.In three years on the job, Bruni has just one self-re-review to his credit (Eleven Madison Park). I don't know what would possess him to re-review a steakhouse just ten months later, but the improvement must surely be significant. I suspect that in Colicchio's mind, Craftsteak is a three-star restaurant, and if he's finally got the steaks right, it's not an unreasonable aspiration. After all, it is built on a similar model to Craft, which has three stars. But two stars is the most that Bruni has given any steakhouse, and after a two-week losing streak, we aren't prepared to dare the Eater oddsmakers.Craftbar is getting its first rated review, after receiving the $25 and Under treatment from Eric Asimov in 2002 and a Diner's Journal piece from Sam Sifton in 2004. Since then Chef Akhtar Nawab has moved on to The E.U., and according to FloFab in the Times, the new menu is \"less elaborate and expensive.\"It's not unusual for restaurants promoted from $25 and Under to get two stars, and casual places like Craftbar are right up Frank's street. When train wrecks like Morandi and Cafe Cluny get one star, it almost seems like there's no longer any such thing as a \"good\" one-star restaurant, leaving two-stars as the minimum rating that represents any kind of compliment. But with Craftbar lurking pretty much under the foodie radar these days, we have to agree with the oddsmakers that a deuce is unlikely here. The Bet: Tomorrow could be a wild day, but we aren't taking any chances. We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to Craftbar and two stars to Craftsteak.

Over at the Bruni Blog, Marian Burros has a post about \"annoying restaurant practices.\" She leads off with paper tablecloth tops:If restaurants cannot afford fresh tablecloths made of fabric - and I know it costs money to clean them - it would be far better to have a bare table.I agree with that, but I have a few more pressing ones:\"You can have a seat at the bar until your full party arrives....\" I realize there are some legitimate economic reasons for this policy. But I've been shooed over to the bar even at restaurants that weren't full. It comes across as a cynical attempt to generate bar income, rather than a legitimate way to manage the reservations book. Needless to say, if you do begin your meal at the bar, any good restaurant should offer to transfer the tab automatically to your dinner check.\"Would you like still or sparkling water?\" This is a subtle trick by which the restaurant hopes you won't realize there's a third option: tap water. Bottled still water is the biggest rip-off in the industry. \"Would you like to start with a cocktail?\" There's nothing wrong with this question. But if you order pre-dinner cocktails, then the server should give you time to drink them. You shouldn't be asked for your wine order when full cocktail glasses have been dropped off just moments ago. \"Let me tell you about our specials...\" Any decent restaurant ought to be able to produce a written list of specials. If they're recited, rather than written, it should be no more than two or three items-otherwise, you can't keep them all in your head. Most annoying is when the server comes by to recite the specials after you've already had menus for 10-15 minutes. By then, you've already chosen something. The time to announce the specials is before the diner has decided what to order. Side dishes. Many restaurants offer separately priced side dishes. I don't object to the steakhouse pricing model, where everything is à la carte, but many restaurant menus fail to make this clear. The server should say something if you order a side dish, and your entree already comes with a substantial vegetable. This is especially annoying if the side dish and the included vegetable are similar-e.g., you order a side of mashed potatoes, and your entree comes with fries. Tapas-style dining. I've nothing against tapas, of course. But nowadays, \"tapas-style\" is a shorthand that means, \"The kitchen will send out the food as it's ready.\" Inevitably, this means that a pile of food is going to arrive all at once, since the kitchen is working according to their convenience, rather than yours. Butter knives. Any respectable restaurant should have them. And the butter should be soft and warm, not hard as a hockey puck.Replacement silverware. Any restaurant above the level of Chinese take-out should replace the used silverware after each course, without being asked. \"Can I tempt you with dessert?\" By all means offer a dessert menu, but servers shouldn't call it a temptation, nor should they try to change the diner's mind after a firm \"No, thank you\" has been delivered. (Of course, this pet peeve applies to all forms of up-selling, but for some reason it's most prevalent at dessert.) Depositing the bill too soon. No fancy restaurant should present a bill till you've asked for it. At other restaurants, I don't mind this practice. But the bill should never be presented when you're obviously still eating. When you're done, or very nearly so, the server may ask if you'll be having any more to eat or drink, and if the answer is no, I've no objection if the bill presented shortly thereafter.

Today's Dumb Stat: Most NYC Drivers Oppose Congestion Pricing
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
Today, Reuters reports that \"most\" NYC drivers oppose Mayor Bloomberg's proposal to implement congestion pricing for vehicles entering Manhattan (below 96th Street) during prime times. The polling margin was actually 51% opposed, which means that 49% of drivers either favor the proposal, or aren't sure.Well, duh! Obviously drivers don't favor paying an extra $8 for their daily commute. What the article didn't say, is that only about 10% of those employed in Manhattan drive to work. A poll showing a bare majority opposed, when the other 90% of the population is left out of the survey, doesn't mean much.Probably half of the 10% who drive to work in Manhattan would use mass transit, if it were available and convenient to the area where they live. And that's the whole point of Bloomberg's proposal - to use the congestion pricing fee to invest in mass transit. It's a needed corrective to almost 70 years of neglect.Since 1940, many new expressways, bridges, and tunnels have been built. But the city's mass transit capacity actually shrank, because many elevated lines were demolished, and the subways that were supposed to replace them - such as the Second Avenue Line - were never built. Many of the lines that do exist aren't in a state of good repair. And most lines could run more trains, were it not for antiquated signalling systems that are long overdue for replacement.Manhattan can't accommodate any more cars. But it can accommodate more transit lines. Building mass transit is the only way to get more people into Manhattan. It would also help the existing population, since transit is nearly always faster than driving, provided the starting and ending points of the journey are reasonably close to one's home and office.But Bloomberg's proposal is still going to be a heavy lift, as many politicians in the outer boroughs oppose it. The trouble is that congestion pricing would take effect almost immediately, but building new transit capacity takes years. Politicians are loath to vote for short-term pain, when the long-term gain probably won't materialize until after they're out of office.It will take plenty of political strong-arming to get congestion pricing approved. We simply must.

Gold St.

***CONTENT
Note: Gold St. closed on April 1, 2009. It will re-open as Harry's Italian. Has a diner ever had so much attention? Practically every newspaper, magazine, or blog in town that chronicles restaurant openings mentioned Gold St., the latest brainchild of Harry Poulakakos, who owns Harry's Steak, Harry's Cafe, and various other Lower Manhattan restaurants. To be fair, Gold St. isn't quite a diner. It has an executive chef (Patrick Vacciariello from the Smith & Wollensky chain), a chef de cuisine (Tony Landeros), and a sushi bar. It serves a few items not found at many diners, like Kobe Beef Sliders and Fries with brie fondue, to say nothing of the sushi. But in other ways, it's very much a diner, with the predictable burgers and meat loaf, on a menu long enough to include far more than any kitchen can execute well. Gold St. is also the Financial District's first 24-hour restaurant, located at the epicenter of a neighborhood now dominated by rental and condo conversions. It might not be the East Village, but the area has as much need of 24×7 food as any other, and now we have it. If you come to Gold St. expecting fine dining (as NYCnosh did), you'll be disappointed. If you come looking for a \"diner plus...,\" you'll probably conclude (as Bloomberg did) that Gold St. is \"just about right.\" Slow Roast Pork ($15), cooked on a rotisserie all day, had a nice pink barbecue texture. Peas and carrots were expertly done. There was nothing special about the fries, and the tomato salsa garnish seemed unnecessary. I had nothing else, aside from two diet cokes ($3.25 each, no refills) and a coffee ($2). I'm not going to recite the various menu categories, but the cheapest dinner item is a hamburger ($8), while the most expensive non-sushi choice is grilled shrimp ($22). The very long sushi menu has the usual suspects, and some creative ones, like an Angry Spider roll ($11.50) and a Yellow Tail Tasting ($12.50). Sushi combo platters run all the way up to $52. The breakfast and dessert menus have all of the expected items, and the back page of the menu lists a number of fruit smoothies. There is also a full bar and a modest wine list. There's nothing original about the vaguely retro 1950s decor, but the seats and banquettes are quite comfortable, and the waitresses wear short, short skirts. Service was attentive, although the restaurant wasn't very busy when I visited. I saw Harry Poulakakos himself nervously pacing around, which was unexpected on a Sunday evening. Be it ever so humble, I'm glad Gold St. has arrived. Most importantly, it means the Financial District as a residential neighborhood has arrived. Unfortunately, I'm moving way uptown this summer, so I won't be around long to appreciate it. Gold St. (2 Gold Street at Maiden Lane, Financial District)

Glad you had a better experience than we did. Just to clarify, we didn't expect anything approaching fine dining, just decent diner-style food. And for that, Gold St. got it about half right.

Today, Frank Bruni learns that he can take his niece and nephew out for dessert, and the New York Times will pay for it. At Max Brenner, critic-to-be Gavin, 6, pronounced \"Not everything should be made into dessert.\" No doubt Gavin will be on the Times payroll soon, as he seems to have the same discerning palate as his uncle.I hadn't thought that Bruni would pick out such an utterly irrelevant \"restaurant,\" only to give it zero stars. To be sure, it's overrun with tourists, suggesting that perhaps there's a large audience that needs Frank's advice about the place. But Little Italy and the Theater District are overrun with tourists too. Will Ferrara be next week's review?But zero stars it is. We took the one-star action, and lose $1, for our first two-week losing streak. Luckily for us, the odds on zero stars were only even money, so Eater wins just $1.

When Marco Canora and Paul Grieco opened Hearth in 2003, it was an immediate sensation in foodie community. Canora had been the executive chef at the much-loved Craft, and Hearth was his first solo venture. It won an enthusiastic two stars from Amanda Hesser in the Times, and has been on a roll ever since. I've visited Hearth twice, awarding 2½ stars after my most recent visit.Canora and Grieco are back with an encore: Insieme, which means \"together\" in Italian. It's bound to be the most mispronounced restaurant name in Manhattan. (For the record, it's \"in-see-EM-ay.\")A new restaurant from this team was bound to attract attention. It took Gourmet's Ruth Reichl only a week to pronounce that Insieme was serving the best lasagne in New York. The bloggers will no doubt come trooping briskly; there's already a rave on Off the Broiler.Insieme is located in the Michelangelo Hotel. Frankly, the style of the restaurant clashes with the style of the hotel, but that probably won't matter: Insieme has its own entrance on Seventh Avenue. It's actually a bit of a challenge to find the restaurant from inside the hotel. Located at the northern end of the theater district, it should draw on the pre- and post-show crowds. But it's close enough to the midtown business district to draw on the same clientele that patronizes Le Bernardin, just across the street.The cuisine has a more upscale feel to it than Hearth. The menu (PDF here) is on two facing pages. On the left are traditional Italian favorites, written in Italian with English translations. On the right are modern versions of the same or similar dishes, with the descriptions only in English. Each side has four antipasti ($12-18), three primi/mid-courses ($14-16) and four secondi/entrees ($29-36). Most of the primi are also available in entree-sized portions for $26. Side dishes are $9. A five-course tasting menu is $85.Hors d'oeuvresAfter we arrived, the kitchen sent out a wonderful plate of hors-d'oeuvres. Radishes were hollowed out, and stuffed with olives and anchovies. Crostini were topped with goat cheese. Fresh baked rolls came out, with a helping of soft, creamy butter.Egg-drop soup (left); Black olive fettuccini (right)The amuse-bouche was an intense egg-drop soup in a beef and chicken broth. To start, I had the Black Olive Fettuccini ($16), with duck ragu and a hint of foie gras. Although wonderful, I thought the portion size was a mite too small, even allowing that it was an appetizer. My girlfriend had the Lasagne Verdi Bolognese ($16), which is surely the dish Ruth Reichl raved about. Made with spinach noodles, it had an astonishingly light texture.Lamb chop, saddle, breast, sausage with lavender, spring garlic, morels, and mustard greensFagioli all' UccellettoWe were both drawn to an entree titled simply \"Lamb\" ($36), featuring four renditions of lamb: chop, saddle, breast, and sausage. \"Breast\" is an unusual description for any part of lamb, but I'm assuming it referred to the tender lamb belly (nine o'clock in the photo). The chop and saddle were both impeccably prepared. I was not wowed by the sausage, which seemed to have been stuffed inside of morel mushrooms, and didn't have enough spicy kick. A side dish of Fagioli all' Uccelletto ($8), or Cannellini beans, tomato, garlic, and sage, was terrific. In less accomplished hands, the tomato base would overwhelm the beans, but Marco Canora's kitchen had the balance just right.Baba au Rhum Petits-fours Whistler \"The Black Piper\" G.S.M. 2005For dessert, we shared the Baba au Rhum ($10), an unlikely dish in an Italian restaurant, but still well worth a try. I can't say that it eclipsed the legendary rendition of this dish at Alain Ducasse, but that would be an unfair comparison.The evening ended with petits-fours, all excellent, particularly the chocolate truffle in the middle of the photo.The wine list is a work in progress. At the moment, it's neither as long nor as interesting as the wine list at Hearth, but with Paul Grieco in charge of both, you can be sure that won't last. Grieco himself came over to our table, and offered to assist. After a discussion, his advice confirmed the choice I was already leaning to anyway: the Whistler 2005 Black Piper ($47), a fruity Grenache-Shiraz-Mourvedre blend. We loved it so much that I brought the label home.Service throughout the evening was first-rate. When I arrived, the maitre d' alertly noticed that our original table was too close to a baby in a high chair. Without prompting, he offered to move us.The dining room was never more than about half full. It cleared out considerably after 7:30, as the pre-theater crowd headed out. It started to fill up again around 9:00 p.m. I suspect that will be the rhythm of this place. I overheard Chef Canora telling a friend that the restaurant will stay open until 11:00 p.m. on weekdays, 11:30 p.m. on weekends. It's an experiment to try to attract a post-theater crowd, and Canora didn't sound positive that it would work. (Hearth closes at 10:00 p.m. on weekdays, 11:00 p.m. on weekends.)It's clear that Canora is trying to pitch Insieme at a higher level than Hearth. It's about $10 per person more expensive, and the decor feels more elegant. Yet, Canora was obviously wary of getting too fancy, given that the city's major critics tend to hold that against a restaurant. There are no tablecloths, and the tables are crammed rather close together.It's a familiar vibe that feels very much like two other recent successes, Perry St. and A Voce. But Insieme seems more sincere, and also more fun, than either of those two restaurants. At Perry St., Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the nominal man-in-charge, is too busy running 10 or 15 other restaurants to give the place more than passing attention. And at A Voce we found the service and ambiance seriously annoying.And the best part of it is that Insieme is only two weeks old. It can only get better from here.Insieme (777 Seventh Avenue at 51st Street, West Midtown/Theater District)Food: **½Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews chocolatier Max Brenner. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: EVEN √√One Star: 3-1Two Stars: 10-1Three Stars: 90-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: After his Morandi review last week, poor Frank must be either bored or exhausted. There's no other way to explain tomorrow's utterly bizarre choice: a breakfast/sandwich/dessert place so insignificant that it doesn't seem to have attracted a single review-anywhere-though it has been open since July of last year. It's not even clear which Max Brenner Frank is reviewing: a second outpost opened last November.Such places, if the Times reviewed them at all, would normally be covered in the paper's $25 and Under column. Tomorrow's review creates the topsy-turvy paradox that the city's best dessert restaurant, Room 4 Dessert, has only a $25&U mention to its credit, while Max Brenner gets a full rated review.Bruni doesn't normally pick a restaurant out of nowhere, only to trash it. Given last week's depressing review, he probably wanted some fun (or a week off). Morandi, which Frank pretty much had to review, showed us how bad a restaurant can be, and still earn a star. If he's wasting his time on Max Brenner-a restaurant no one expected him to review-I have to assume he found something nice to say.The Bet: We are crossing our fingers, and betting that Frank Bruni will award one star to Max Brenner.

Note: Dennis Foy closed in early 2009. We found it nearly empty when we visited in 2007, and business never really picked up. Dennis Foy deserved better than that, but his terrific food never really found a following at this location. Dennis Foy is a chef who has bounced around a bit, having run the kitchen in Manhattan at Mondrian and EQ (both long since closed), as well as a couple of New Jersey restaurants. Last fall, he opened the eponymous restaurant in the former Lo Scalco space, sprucing it up with his own landscape paintings, decorating the walls in gold leaf and the ceiling beams in bold, saturated colors. Its arrival was greeted with yawns. Frank Bruni relegated it to a double-review with an unrelated restaurant. Awarding one star, he called Dennis Foy \"a worthy but low-wattage addition to the New York dining scene: an 'if you happen to be' as opposed to a 'you have to try' restaurant.\" The only problem with Bruni's assessment is that Church Street between Walker and Lispenard Streets isn't an \"if you happen to be\" block. No one \"just happens to be\" there, which perhaps explains why we found Dennis Foy nearly empty. Only about one-fourth of its 60 seats were taken at prime time on Friday night. I fear an Eater Deathwatch cannot be far off. That's too bad, because Dennis Foy offers very respectable food in a serene, grown-up atmosphere. Prices are a bit expensive, though it's possible to spend plenty more in the neighborhood. The menu isn't very long, with just nine appetizers ($8-18) and eight entrees ($25-35) listed. I suspect Foy's prospects would be improved by lowering the average price of the entrees-say, from $30 to $25. Amuse-bouche (left); Crispy Veal Sweetbreads (right) The amuse-bouche was a seafood salad with toasted blini and pickled vegetables. We were also offered several choices of bread, all served warm. To start, my girlfriend and I both had the Crispy Veal Sweetbreads ($14), with roquette, hazelnuts, apple cider, and spring onion marmelade. We particularly liked the contrast of the deep-fried sweetbread and the light apple flavor. Rack of Berkshire Pork Rack of Berkshire Pork ($30) seemed over-priced, given that the all there was of it was a single lonely pork chop, deboned and sliced. The accompaniments-Serrano ham, ricotta gnocchi, and romaine lettuce-weren't especially memorable, and the pork was a bit too dry. My girlfriend was quite pleased with fettuccini with veal and foie gras, which was rich in texture, and served in a hearty portion. I tasted a bit of it myself, and it was excellent. Rhubarb Cobbler Rhubarb, now in season, is showing up on menus all over town. We don't usually order dessert, but perhaps out of sympathy, ordered a Rhubarb Cobbler ($10). We were glad we did, as it was a fine dessert indeed, served warm with heavy cream on the side. Service was top-notch, though with the restaurant three-fourths empty, it had better be. The beautiful space could be home to a three-star restaurant. It is perfect for a refined escape from a hectic week, though not too many people seem to have figured this out. Perhaps it's because the food, though strongly conceived and usually well executed, isn't quite dazzling enough.

My girlfriend, son, and I had a pre-theater dinner at Cascina last Saturday night. The menu, service, and attitude very much reminded me of Little Italy-and in case it's not obvious, that's not a compliment.The word \"Cascina\" refers to the farmhouse or lodging on an Italian vinyard. Wine, indeed, is the theme of the restaurant. There are several large images of vinyards and wine-making equipment. Many of the wine bottles are on display. We weren't in a drinking mood that day, but the wine list appears to be serious, with bottles anywhere from $35 to the thousands. Swordfish risotto (left); Pizza Caprese (right)The food turned out to be quite respectable, once they got around to serving it. Swordfish risotto ($19) was slightly runny, but in the end I had no serious complaint with it. My son, who is not easily pleased, raved about Pizza Caprese ($15), with buffalo mozarella, cherry tomatoes, and basil. My girlfriend seemed satisfied with Meat-stuffed tortellini in cream sauce with prosciutto ($16). Tiramisu (left); Italian-style cheesecake (right)Tiramisu ($8) was most impressive, so airy and light that one almost forgot it was dessert. Italian-style cheesecake ($8) was a bit too dry and crumbly.One might chalk it up to the pre-theater rush, but service was frenetic and impersonal. Perhaps things improve later on in the evening. The food was reasonable, but on this showing, I wouldn't rush back except as a friendly and inexpensive pre-theater dining option.Cascina Ristorante (647 Ninth Avenue between 45th & 46th Streets, Hell's Kitchen)Food: *Service: freneticAmbiance: *Overall: *

In today's Brunology lesson, Professor Frank hands out what must be the weakest one-star review in New York Times history. To be sure, we expected no better than a weak star for Morandi, but we never imagined that Keith McNally could be trashed this badly, and still escape with his manhood intact:Morandi's overworked Chianti bottles and its canopy of brick arches - no matter how old the brick - aren't whimsical; they're just cliched. Unlike Balthazar and Pastis, which Mr. McNally cunningly sculptured to look old before their time, Morandi can simply feel tired before its time, and not quite worth the struggle to get in and stay upright in the scrum.Frank did find a number of dishes he liked (which saved it from the goose-egg), but we don't recall a one-star review as harsh as this one. But then, Frank has never goose-egged an Italian restaurant, has he?We were prepared to take the long odds that Morandi would indeed get zilch, so we lose $1 on our hypothetical bet. Eater took the one-star wager, and wins $2. Eater NYJBankroll$20.00 $27.67Gain/Loss+$2.00 -$1.00Total$22.00 $26.67 * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *Won-Lost8-2 8-2

There are 2,146 restaurants in the online Zagat Guide for New York. Just 18 of them (0.8%) are Belgian. But eleven of those are outposts of a bakery/sandwich place, Le Pain Quotidien. Another four are branches of Petite Abeille. That leaves just three non-chain Belgian restaurants in the Zagat guide. It is, in other words, not a commonly encountered cuisine in this town.Markt, one of the city's three non-chain Belgian restaurants, was a Meatpacking District pioneer, back when the Meatpacking District was still cool. The owners lost their lease and moved a short distance away, to a smaller place in Chelsea that has hosted several failed restaurants. Markt arrives with an already successful formula, so perhaps it will be here to stay.The dinner menu-printed in French, Flemish, and English-includes soups ($7-10), appetizers ($8-24), pastas ($12-17), fish and seafood entrees ($18-36), meat entrees ($16-32), and half-a-dozen entrees with mussels ($16-18). Raw bar platters are available at $60 or $90. Many of the items are familiar French bistro fare, though the emphasis on mussels and beer is a distinctly Belgian touch.My girlfriend and I are rather predictable: we see pâte on the menu, and we order it. The Country Pâte ($10) comes with spicy Dijon mustard and red onion relish. It's rich and hearty, not fancy or complex. We each ordered it, but the portion size turned out to be quite generous. Two people could easily have shared.My girlfriend ordered the Steak Frites ($26), while I had the Red Snapper ($26), which came in a tomato-butter sauce. I thought the snapper was slightly more dry than it should be, but the sauce saved it from perdition, and in the end I was mostly satisfied.Many of the dishes come with stoemp (pronounced \"stomp\"), a Belgian rendition of mashed potatoes, often pureed with vegetables and herbs-in this case basil. In the photo, it's the big lump that looks like a green pear. I found it rather bland, but I don't know if that's my problem or the restaurant's.To drink, we ordered a perfectly acceptable bottle of 2002 Burgundy for $32. I have to applaud any restaurant that has a decent Pinot Noir at that price. Yet, I had an immediate twinge of regret, as the page-long list of beers-most of them seldom encountered in this country-should have commanded my attention. Oh well, it's something to do next time.The restaurant was not crowded at 6:30 p.m. on a Sunday evening, though I suspect they're plenty busy on weekends. The server showed obvious impatience that we didn't instantly know what we wanted to order. After we'd sent him away twice, he came back and said, \"Well, what'll it be?\" At the end of the meal, after we declined to order dessert, it took all of about 30 seconds for him to plunk down a check, although we clearly had quite a bit of wine yet to finish.Though it won't win any awards for service, the hearty Belgian fare at moderate prices and top-notch beer menu will probably to make Markt a hit in its new location.Markt (676 Sixth Avenue at 21st Street, Chelsea)Food: *½Service: decentAmbiance: *Overall: *½

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Morandi, Keith McNally's foray into Italian cuisine. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 5-1One Star: 2-1 √√Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 90-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Morandi had a shaky start, with many critics finding the food uneven, the service scattered, the crowds unbearable, the decor inauthentic and claustrophobic. I can only take Eater's word for it that things are getting steadily better at Morandi, because frankly, nothing I've read has made me eager to go there.The Brunologist loves Italian food, and some of his most generous ratings have gone to Italian restaurants. But it's the one genre in which Bruni can't be fooled. I have to think that when he wrote his love letter to Esca last week, it was with the certain knowledge that the Morandi review was up next. I therefore expect to find a noticeable contrast between the two, with Morandi earning a weak one star, at best.The Bet: We are inclined to agree with Eater that one star is the most likely outcome, and that is normally how we would bet. But with the oddsmakers offering only 2-1 odds for that choice, we are going to roll the dice on zero stars, which at 5-1 odds is the more attractive wager.

What is it with Carnegie Hill and small French bistros? About a year ago, the Times published a profile of the neighborhood's better restaurants. Three of the five mentioned were French bistros within a square block of 92nd and Madison. What also stood out was that, although this is one of the most expensive neighborhoods in Manhattan, it apparently does not suport expensive restaurants: none of the Times recommendations was particularly pricey.For now, the neighborhood's best known restaurant is Sfoglia, but thanks to Frank Bruni's rave review a few weeks ago, you can forget about getting in there on anything less than a month's notice. When I had an evening engagement in the area last week, I chose Table d'Hôte instead, partly because I knew my guest had a weak spot for anything French.Table d'Hôte is a tiny restaurant, with only about ten or twelve small tables. It appeals to a slightly older crowd: my friend and I, both in our 40s, seemed to be among the youngest patrons. There's nothing fancy about the decor, although it might remind you of about a hundred places you've seen on the side streets in European cities.The menu is a mixture of French and Moroccan favorites. If you order à la carte, appetizers are $8.00-$13.50, and entrees are available either in tasting portions at $14.00-17.50, or full portions of $19.00-26.00. A $26.50 prix fixe gets you a soup or green salad, a tasting portion of an entree, and dessert.We had a $23.50 prix fixe, offered only from 5:00-7:00 p.m. with more limited choices: green salad or puree of vegetable soup to start; chicken paillard, hangar steak, or seared salmon to continue; and crème caramel or ice cream for dessert. I probably had the better of it with the vegetable soup, which was creamy and delicious. But chicken paillard was a bit too dry, while my friend's hangar steak was rare and tender.The wine list, though short, had a number of bargains (comparatively speaking), and we were pleased with a Crozes-Hermitage for $38. The bill for two was $85 before tax and tip, which these days isn't bad at all.Table d'Hôte (44 East 92nd Street between Madison & Park Avenues, Carnegie Hill, Upper East Side)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

***CONTENT
Note: The Neptune Room closed in December 2008. Management has not confirmed it is permanent, but as of January 2009 the space is for rent. My girlfriend and I dropped into The Neptune Room for appetizers one night last week. The press mostly ignored the restaurant after it opened in 2004, aside from Steve Cuozzo of the Post, who awarded 2½ stars. I have to assume that the other critics in town at least tried The Neptune Room, but weren't enthralled enough to review it. I do recall having an enjoyable meal there in October 2004, but I wasn't wrting reviews in those days, and don't recall the details. That visit was a pre-Lincoln Center dinner, but I suspect Neptune Room doesn't draw much from that crowd - you have to be a bit of a sleuth to seek out restaurants twenty blocks away from the opera. At least Neptune Room has survived (never a sure thing on the Upper West Side) - largely, I suspect, on neighborhood traffic. We dropped by at around 6:30 p.m. and found it mostly empty, although for the area this is still early for dinner. The menu is virtually all seafood, with appetizers $4-15, entrees $19-32, and side dishes $7. I loved Lobster & Crab Ravioli ($14), with grilled corn, Roma tomatoes, tarragon, and a lobster reduction. The kitchen also did well by Fried Calamari ($12). I'm not going to issue a formal rating based only on appetizers, but we certainly made a mental note to try The Neptune Room again sometime soon.

Landmarc at the Time-Warner Center

***CONTENT
Everyone knows the story of the Restaurant Collection at the Time-Warner Center, right? Perhaps a brief recap is in order. The original idea was to gather the world's greatest chefs under one roof, for a set of restaurants that would all vie for three or four stars from the Times. Two of the restaurants, Per Se and Masa, were clear hits, while Cafe Gray received mixed reviews. Jean-Georges Vongerichten's V Steakhouse bombed, and the fifth major tenant, Chicago's Charlie Trotter, bowed out.The main miscalculation was that none of these restaurants appealed to a shopping mall clientele. Someone looking for a casual bite isn't going to pop into Cafe Gray for the $36 braised short ribs. Cafe Gray's breakfast and lunch service fizzled. The mall needed a casual dining option, and none of these places fit the bill. Bouchon Bakery filled in somewhat, but there remained a huge void between it and Cafe Gray.Porter House New York replaced V Steakhouse, and it appears to be a hit. While not exactly casual, it comes in at a gentler price point than Cafe Gray and offers a great bar menu for snacking. Landmarc, which opened last week in the old Charlie Trotter space, finally gives the mall the truly informal dining option that it needed.Landmarc at the Time-Warner Center is a near-clone of the original Landmarc in TriBeCa, which I've reviewed twice (here, here). Among the differences, the new Landmarc is about double the size, with a seating capacity of 200, plus 90 in private dining rooms, and a large bar. The decor is similar to the TriBeCa location's post-industrial chic, with the added bonus of a picture window facing Columbus Circle and Central Park.It's also open seven days a week from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m., and serves breakfast. (TriBeCa doesn't open till noon on weekdays, 9:00 a.m. on weekends). I'm a little skeptical that the weekday breakfast service will last. Except on weekends, most New Yorkers favor expediency over excellence at breakfast time. It's hard for me to believe that Landmarc's $12 pancakes are much better than anyone else's, but you have to go to the third floor of a shopping mall to get to them.At lunch and dinner, Landmarc's virtues will shine. The menu is a mixture of French, Italian, New American, and steakhouse favorites, but not overly long, and focused on items where the kitchen excels. A few of the items, like the roasted marrow bones and goat cheese profiteroles, are already classics, as are the desserts at $3 apiece. There's also the acclaimed wine program, with prices only slightly above retail, and an ample selection of half-bottles.Appetizers are $8-13, salads $7-21 (most with two available portion sizes), entrees $21-26, steaks $21-34, daily pasta specials $10-22 (two portion sizes), raw bar items $15-27, and house specialties $19-30. That probably seems like a lot, but it all fits on one page-as in TriBeca, on a sheet folded in sixths and waiting under your napkin when you're seated. There's also a kids' menu, with all items $6.Last week was supposed to be a \"soft opening,\" but as the management quickly figured out, there are no soft openings in New York, especially for a well known place like Landmarc. The bloggers and chowhounds quickly get wind of it, and within hours the whole food community knows. I ambled in around 7:00 p.m. on Friday night, and the place was close to full. The hostess said at first that there would be a half-hour wait, but then they seated me immediately at a two-top with a terrific view of Central Park. (As in TriBeCa, reservations aren't accepted for parties less than six.)I ordered the marrow bones ($12) and the calf's liver ($22), mainly because I was alone, and both dishes would gross out my girlfriend. The marrow bones (right) come with an onion marmelade and warm country bread. There are tiny wooden forks to prize the marrow out of the bones. It's a rich, gooey mess, but well worth the trouble. The amount of bread provided is about double what you need.The calf's liver came with two thick lobes, grilled with a nice char on the outside, and a smooth, rich texture more tender than filet mignon. The accompanying veggies were too greasy, and tasted like they'd been in the frying pan too long. Blueberry crumble for dessert was forgettable, but at $3, who cares?Best of all was a half-bottle of 2002 Saint-Georges Saint-Émilion at $26, which most restaurants wouldn't even carry, and certainly not at that price.The floor was amply staffed with servers and runners. Two different managers came over to inquire about my meal. There were a couple of very minor glitches, but for a place open for five days they were in pretty good shape. I suspect Landmarc is going to do very well indeed.Update: I've now been back several times. My original rating of two stars seems too generous. Much of the menu seems phoned in-merely competent. I haven't yet had a bad meal here, but the menu doesn't change, and it's designed to be turned out in volumes. The food is merely acceptable, but Landmarc deserves a star for the wine program.

You review restaurants during their soft opening??? Is that really fair?
Marc Shepherd
2007-04-23 00:00:00
I was actually not the first. These days, once a restaurant has opened its doors, it's not unusual for the first review to be up within hours, soft opening or not.Since the review is mostly favorable, I doubt that the Landmarc people mind. But my view is that if they're charging full price, the review is fair. After all, Broadway plays are typically reviewed on the first night.I also made clear the circumstances, and people can take that into account.

it's still a \"mall\". who wants to go into a mall in the summer except midwestern tourists maybe...? maybe not though. New York is all about in your face, on the street, with pretty people walking by on the street next to the crazy guy asking the cafe diners for change. sitting at the tables in the new Landmarc, you are looking into a mall and that is just not \"cool\". how are they going to get the walk-in business that they do downtown? Blue Ribbon is coming to the area (outside on the street) soon, so they better build their clientelle now, or all the walk in business will go elsewhere. and the prices aren't that cheap. I love the wine thing but the corporate attitude is showing it's ugly head and I wouldn't be surprised if the staff changes over quite frequently because they care more about numbers and themselves than anything else. expect the quality to vary. i'll stay on the street and hit up all the new places on columbus and amsterdam. Celeste doesn't have reservations either, but their food is homemade and the owner makes his own cheeses and brings them in from italy! that's a \"neighborhood' place! it's inexpensive, and the owner gives a damn. the upper west is coming along though, and Landmarc is an ok thing for now, until the corporate monster is exposed, that is...and until there are other late night options

The building it’s in is rather irrelevant. Per Se is in the same mall, and it’s booked solid. Some restaurants are in hotels. Some are in office buildings. Some are in retail buildings. Some are “outside on the street.” So what?I do agree that if you’re not ordering wine, the rationale for Landmarc becomes a lot less compelling.

October 20, 2006: To satisfy my weekly steakhouse craving, I returned yesterday to Nebraska Steakhouse, mainly because I knew I could eat at the bar and watch the Mets game. Since my original report, I've been there a couple of times. All the steaks are competently prepared, but still nothing beats \"The Steak,\" 32 ounces of ribeye heaven.The tables, which never seem to be full, are served by a waitstaff right out of central casting. But nowadays I usually dine at the bar, which is staffed exclusively by buxom barmaids in low-cut blouses, all of whom are from Romania. The most striking of the bunch is dressed like an advertisement for breast implants, and it turns out she owns the place. She started as a bartender, and bought the restaurant a year and a half ago. Her husband is a specialist at the stock exchange, so I have a pretty good guess where the money came from.Last night's crowd was in a festive mood. I stayed long past dinner and drank with a couple from Australia. They ordered the chili, which is prepared with chunks of filet mignon and comes with sour cream, cheese, and chives on the side - an impressive production that looks to be well worth ordering on a future visit.The restaurant is still open only on weekdays, although the owner told me she plans to start a Saturday service in November. With Lower Manhattan enjoying a mini-renaissance, her exuberance is understandable. But Nebraska Beef is well off the beaten path, and unless it starts advertising (it doesn't even have a website), it's hard to see how the weekend traffic will find it.Maybe I'll drop by in a couple of months for an order of the chili, and see how it's going.April 18, 2007: Rather than post a new review, I'm just updating my last report. I did indeed return a month or two later for the chilli (described above), which was as good as it sounds. And last night, I paid a return visit for another helping of The Steak. The marbling this time was more uneven than I remembered it, although it is still one of the largest ribeyes in town. They seem to have hired yet another barmaid with large breast implants.I'm changing my rating from 1½ stars to one star, not because I am any less enthusiastic, but simply because the earlier rating was out of whack. I will remind readers that one star means \"good,\" and is by no means a knock against the restaurant.Nebraska Steakhouse (15 Stone Street between Broad and Whitehall Streets, Financial District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *

Today, as expected, Frank Bruni awarded three stars to Esca. It was one of Bruni's best-written reviews, mercifully free of the irrelevant asides that sometimes divert him. He started praising the food in the 3rd paragraph, which must be a new record.I thought that three stars was the only likely outcome this week. Thanks to the oddsmakers' rather generous 3-1 odds, Eater and I both make an easy $3 on our hypothetical $1 bets.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Esca, the Batali-Bastianich seafood palace on the edge of the Theater District. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 15-1 One Star: 6-1 Two Stars: 4-1 Three Stars: 3-1 √√Four Stars: 10,000-1The Skinny: We needn't linger over this one, as Eater's logic is so compelling. Esca already carries two stars from the Times, and Bruni's re-reviews usually come with either an upgrade or a downgrade. Given Bruni's love-affair with the Batali-Bastianich empire, an upgrade is the only sensible bet.We also think there's a kind of Newton's Law at the three and four-star levels: every downgrade must come with an equal and opposite upgrade no more than a few weeks later. Bruni demoted The Four Seasons just a fortnight ago, leaving the gap that Esca will now fill.Lastly, we think that Bruni itches to pull the trigger on a major review every once in a while, and we haven't had a trifecta in over three months. The six-stars combined for Eleven Madison Park and the Bar Room, on January 10th, was Bruni's last trip into such rarefied air.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award three stars to Esca.

A matter of hours after the tragedy at Virginia Tech, this is what President Bush's spokesperson had to say:As far as policy, the President believes that there is a right for people to bear arms, but that all laws must be followed. And certainly bringing a gun into a school dormitory and shooting ... obviously that would be against the law and something that someone should be held accountable for. It's nice to know that, whatever happens, Bush is still in the NRA's pocket.

Blue Hill at Stone Barns

***CONTENT
A visit to Blue Hill at Stone Barns requires some advance planning, or a bit of good luck. On two previous occasions, I made the trek up to Tarrytown without a reservation and dined at the bar. The bar accommodations are comfortable, but if all the seats are taken, you could be waiting for a while. On another occasion, I meant to do the same thing, but on arriving, we found to our dismay that the whole restaurant was closed for a private party.Another barn on the premises. (This is not the restaurant,although it is similar.)If you want a reservation in the elegant formal dining room, you need to reserve two months in advance, to the day. I called about 45 minutes after the reservation line opened on February 14th. The evening of April 14th was already mostly sold out, with 5:30 p.m. and 9:45 p.m. being the only times available. Luckily, 5:30 suited our schedule, so I was finally able to dine at the restaurant with a proper reservation.No restaurant better exemplifies the label haute barnyard. The cooking, service, and ambiance are about as elegant as can be; but the restaurant is literally co-located with a barnyard. The mission statement on the website seems almost too precious:The cow logo is ever-present-even on the weather vane.Blue Hill at Stone Barns is a platform, an exhibit, a classroom, a conservatory, a laboratory, and a garden. The restaurant will reflect the spirit of the farm, the terroir, and the market. The kitchen will express the humanity and the fervor of the educators, preservationists, farmers, cooks, and servers who learn and work at the Center.Reading that, you wouldn't know whether to expect dinner or a lecture. Indeed, the staff are mighty proud of the farm. At some point in your meal, a server brings around a tray of greens, to show you all the seasonal herbs that are featured in the day's menu. But none of that would matter if the food didn't live up to the billing. Which it does.The restaurant is operated by the same team that run Blue Hill in Greenwich Village. I've now visited both restaurants three times. I don't know why, but the original Blue Hill in the city doesn't generate the same excitement as Blue Hill at Stone Barns. At Stone Barns, the menu is much more creative and eye-popping, the progression of tastes far more extravagant.The dining room is in a converted barn, elegantly appointed. When we arrived, there was still ample daylight shining through the windows. By the time we left, it was quite dim, with the only light coming from a handful of sconces and candles at each table. Most guests dress up to dine here, though we did see a few people in jeans.After we were settled in, the server recited a list of house cocktails, all based on the \"barnyard\" theme. I couldn't resist trying one made with carrot juice and hay-infused vodka, which was much better than it sounds. (In the photo, you'll notice that even the stirrer is a piece of straw.) We saw plenty of these coming out of the kitchen, so I wasn't the only one intrigued.A diner at another table noticed that the tall glass still had a price tag on it. We noticed this too, but considered it too minor a matter to point out. The other table mentioned it, and the server took the drink off both bills. (In the photo, you can just barely see a white price tag shining through the bottom of the glass.)The menu changes daily, to take advantage of the latest seasonal ingredients. There is a choice of three courses at $65, four courses at $78, or the farmer's feast-a tasting menu with six courses plus multiple amuse-bouches-at $110. As we so often do on such occasions, we ordered the tasting menu. Bread service (left); Cream of cauliflower soup(right)The bread service is spectacular. Each of the rolls (above, left) suggests a \"book,\" whose pages you pull apart. The soft butter it comes with is wonderful. The first amuse was a cream of cauliflower soup with a drizzle of basil olive oil. It also came with a tiny breakfast radish and two dried vegetable chips. One of these was a beet chip, which looked like a potato chip, but was about as thin as a human hair. \"Beet Burgers\" (left); Foie gras and chocolate (right)The next two amuses were extraordinary: \"Beet burgers\" (beet and goat cheese on a micro-bun) and bites of foie gras in a chocolate sandwich. Walnut bread with two salts (left); Mango-crabmeat cannoli (right)The last amuse consisted of two contrasting salts-the one at the top of the photo is \"carrot salt,\" with walnut bread. I had to admire the creative impulse, but the taste of salty bread wasn't really that intriguing.The first savory course was a crabmeat cannoli wrapped in mango so thinly sliced that it yielded instantly to the touch. This flavor combination worked perfectly. Green salad (left); Sturgeon (right)A green salad had enough herbs and vegetables to fill a botany textbook, but offered little excitement to the palate. Sturgeon was served over citrus braised fennel with a fig sauce. The sturgeon was impeccably prepared, but fish, fennel and fig were all overwhelmed by the tartness of the citrus-which was presumably grapefruit. Gnocchi (left); Venison (right)A delicate gnocchi was prepared with ricotta cheese, sweet potato, a roasted chestnut, and parmesan. Good as it was, we couldn't help admiring the serving bowl, which was large enough to be the conversation piece on our coffee table at home. We wondered where we could buy them?Venison was the final savory course. My girlfriend, who normally doesn't like venison, thought it was terrific, while I found it dull. Perhaps I was just over-fed by this point. Palate cleanser (left); Dessert (right)The palate-cleanser was house-made yogurt with citrus accompaniments; we noted that the citrus worked here much better than it did with the sturgeon. I don't recall the exact description of the dessert, but it was excellent. So too were the petits-fours (right), but I was far too full to taste more than one of them.Service throughout the evening was first-class. Water glasses were always promptly refilled. The wine was decanted, and our glasses kept full. The pacing of the courses was about right, with the meal unfolding over about 3½ hours. Servers were enthusiastic and well informed about the food.While a few of the courses weren't hits, the overall quality of the meal was quite high. Whether one liked a particular item or not, it was always clear that abundant thought and care had gone into its preparation. After three visits, I can say that Blue Hill at Stone Barns is one of my all-time favorite restaurants.Tarrytown, the closest Metro-North stop, is under an hour's train journey from Grand Central. The restaurant is about ten minutes' ride from the train station, and there are always taxis waiting. At the restaurant, just notify the staff about fifteen minutes before you are ready to leave, and they'll call a taxi for you. It's a bit of a schlep to get there, but well worth it.Blue Hill at Stone Barns (630 Bedford Road, Pocantico Hills, New York)Food: ***½Service: ***½Ambiance: ***Overall: ***½

Note: Matador Bistro Latino has closed as of October 2008. Sometimes I pick an unfamiliar restaurant on OpenTable without a lot of research, make a reservation, and take my chances. I've done well enough with that strategy, and in any case, it's usually an inexpensive place, so there isn't much to lose. That's what we did on Friday night, and we hit the jackpot with Matador Bistro Latino, a Spanish restaurant in the West Village. Matador has been open for about 2½ years, without attracting much critical attention. The neighborhood seems to know about it, though. We found a busy bar scene at around 8:00 p.m., and by around 9:00 the dining room was full. With tapas priced $3-14 and entrees $14-23, Matador won't break the bank. We ordered four tapas and a paella to share, along with a pitcher of sangria, and it was plenty. The whole bill for two was around $85, which in New York must be considered a bargain. Rice balls (left); Crab cake over rice (right) The kitchen sent out a plate of rice balls as an amuse-bouche. A crab cake was wonderful, with fresh corn adding a surprsingly effective contrast. Beef skewers with chimichurre sauce (left); Pita bread (right) Beef skewers with chimichurre sauce were tender and deftly spiced. Pita bread was soft and warm, though it didn't arrive early enough. Fried calamari (left); Grilled sardines (right) Fried calamari was also skillfully prepared, not greasy or oily at all. My girlfriend gamely indulged my request for grilled sardines. Eating a whole fish isn't for everyone, but I found them delightfully salty and crunchy. Chicken and sausage paella We weren't as happy with a chicken and sausage paella, which we found too greasy, and lacking the spicy \"kick\" the tapas had. Service was competent, but the tapas came out a bit too quickly, one after the other. I would have preferred a bit more time to breathe between courses. The space isn't large, nor are the tables. On a Friday night, it gets a bit loud. With those minor complaints aside, we thought Matador was a gem. The tapas were excellent, and at the price it was one of the better bargains we've seen.

Note: As of February 2009, Hawaiian Tropic Zone is closed for a three-month rehab. Apparently it will re-open with fewer seats, vacating the ground floor of the bi-level space for another tenant. Many \"temporary\" closures turn out to be permanent, but for now we'll take them at their word. Regular readers will recall that my first visit to Hawaiian Tropic Zone left me with no burning desire to return. However, I managed to win a free dinner-for-two, so I paid one more visit. I invited my friend Kelly, who was eager to give it a try. We started with the shrimp cocktail ($15) and the oysters ($13). You could fault HTZ for many things, but they know how to do justice to these raw-bar favorites. Veal Chop with lemon caper butter sauce, green beans and almonds They also did justice to a 16 Oz. Veal Chop ($39), with lemon caper butter sauce, though green beans were dull. Kelly was not quite as enamored with the bone-in rib steak, proving once again that steaks ordered outside of steakhouses are an invariably risky proposition. We were plenty full already, but as the whole meal was comped, we went ahead and ordered dessert. Kelly had heard wonderful things about the doughnuts, so she tried that. They came in a paper bag (why?), but they were soft, warm, and delicious. I ordered David Burke's Cheesecake Lollipops, a justly famous dessert he brought with him from davidburke & donatella. We didn't order wine, but we had cocktails. I especially liked the Espresso Martini (Van Gogh espresso vodka, Kaluha, chilled espresso). When we arrived, they initially had us seated at a noisy table near the bar, where we could barely hear ourselves talk. They had no problem moving us (there's a whole upstairs area, which was mostly empty), but insisted at first that I would need to close out the tab for the cocktail I had ordered at the original table. They must have realized how classless that was, and a few minutes later the new server said that the tab would transfer after all. Aside from that, the service was just fine, but I could have done without being addressed as \"sweetie\" or \"honey\" by the server. (She called Kelly that, too.) Hawaiian Tropic Zone isn't on my list of restaurants to return to. You're never going to go too far wrong with a David Burke menu, but there are far more pleasant ways to spend an evening. We weren't paying, but had it been on our dime, dinner would have been $203 including tax, before tip.

To be fair, we ordered at the expensive end of the menu, knowing that it was not on our dime.Still, on a previous visit, when I ordered a bit more modestly, the bill was about $75 for one person (incl. tax, before tip). On that visit, I had an appetizer, an entrée, two drinks, and no dessert.

Easter Sunday at Quality Meats

My girlfriend, son, and I had Easter dinner at Quality Meats. This was our second visit-see earlier review-and cemented our view that Quality Meats is in the top echelon of New York steakhouses.The most notable recent trend in Manhattan steakhouses-aside from the sheer quantity of them-is the rise of what I call \"chick-friendly\" steakhouses. It's probably an unfair term, since plenty of women go to the standard Peter Luger-style steakhouses too. But at most of the classic steakhouses, the clientele is very obviously male-dominated. There are other stereotypes too, such as the wood paneling, unimaginative menu, and old-school waiters who seem almost bored.Quality Meats, and others of its ilk, break this mold. They come across as fine-dining restaurants that happen to serve great steak, rather than as cookie-cutter steakhouses.It would take a far more scientific study than I have time for to rate Quality Meats for the steaks alone, but they're fairly close to the top of the heap, if not quite at the pinacle of it. There may be better classic steakhouses, but the supporting cast make Quality Meats a superior experience-from the excellent side dishes; to the homemade steak sauce, prepared tableside; and finally to the enjoyable AvroKO ambiance and first-rate service.My girlfriend and I were both pleased with the 24 oz. bone-in rib steak ($44), which came with a foot-long rib bone still attached. The steak had the appropriate dry-aged taste, was done to the correct temperature, and was nicely marbled. My son did well by the 12 oz. filet mignon ($39).We got the same side dishes as last time, the asparagus ($9) and the incredibly addictive crispy potatoes ($9), to which hot garlic butter was added tableside.The wine list offers plenty to explore at reasonable prices. A Santa Duc Quatre Terres Côte du Rhône at $45 was a happy choice to go with what we had ordered.For dessert, Quality Meats offers a great selection of ice creams ($6 for two scoops), so we all had that.The restaurant did a brisk Easter business, but wasn't full. Service was excellent, but for a repeat of the same upselling trick our server tried last time. We knew that steaks plus side dishes would be plenty, so we didn't order appetizers. The server said, \"Are you sure you don't want appetizers? The steaks are going to take about 25 minutes.\" Having been lured by this ruse last time, we politely declined. Sure enough, the wait for our steaks was more like 15 minutes.There are plenty of great Manhattan steakhouses on my hit parade. If I'm just hungry for a steak, I walk in, order a slab of meat (with nothing else), and go home sated. But for a steakhouse that offers the whole package, Quality Meats may be the best of them all.Quality Meats (57 West 58th St., east of Sixth Avenue, West Midtown)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

Second Avenue Subway Groundbreaking

***CONTENT
The MTA held a ritual groundbreaking today for the Second Avenue Subway (SAS). Depending on how you count, it was either the third, fourth, or fifth time since the 1920s that a subway line along Second Avenue has been proposed, but not built.In the 1920s, there were elevated lines along Second and Third Avenues. Those lines were torn down on the premise that the SAS would replace them. Without the SAS, the Lexington Avenue Line is the city's only rapid transit option on the East Side. The Lex is already over-capacity, and there are many parts of the city where there's a very long walk to the Lex.As now planned, the line is expected to be built in four phases. Phase I, which won't open till 2013, adds just four new stations to the service: 96 & 2nd, 86th & 2nd, 72nd & 2nd, and 63rd & Lex. That's six years to build four stations. It's actually worse than that, because the station at 63rd & Lex already exists: it's \"hiding\" behind a partition wall at the 63rd & Lex station.Phase II would extend service up to 125th & Lex, with stations at 106th Street, 116th Street, and 125th Street. This ought to be one of the easier phases to complete, because it uses two large tunnel sections that were built in the 1970s, the last time there was serious work done on this project.Phase III, the largest phase, would add stations at 55th, 42nd, 34th, 23rd, 14th, and Houston Streets. Phase IV would complete the line down to Lower Manhattan, with stops at Grand Street, Chatham Square, Seaport, and Hanover Square. When completed, letter would be used for the trains running the full length of Second Avenue. But there will be no until after Phase III, which could be decades from now.The catch is that funding is in place only for Phase I-and in fact, the project is still about $1 billion short. Given the history of this line, one has to be skeptical about where the funds for Phases II-IV will come from.There's another catch. A few years ago, transit officials argued that the extension of the to 96th Street was as far as the line needed to go. This initial plan was widely regarded as inadequate-skeptics called it a \"stubway\"-and that led directly to the current plan for a full-length SAS. But some have cynically suggested that the later phases are just a ruse. After Phase I is built, the MTA will announce, with crocodile-tear sadness, that alas there are no funds to complete the full line.Until now, State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, who represents Lower Manhattan neighborhoods that would benefit from the line, has been one of its strongest advocates. But Silver can only do so much, and at the glacial pace that transit projects usually take to materialize, he may no longer be around when it comes time to pony up for the later phases.Some transit advocates are skeptical about the spacing of the stations. The SAS will be the only north-south line in the city without express service. There are several particularly long gaps, such as 86th to 72nd; 72nd to 55th; 55th to 42nd; and 14th to Houston. The design is a hybrid, with stations closer together than the typical express, but farther apart than the typical local. There could come a day when transit officials regret that decision.For now, let's be happy that at least part of the SAS is on the way. Coming to a theater near you in 2013.

Yesterday, as expected, Frank Bruni awarded one star to The E.U.The headline-\"Where the Motto Is: Try, Try Again\"-isn't one of his better inspirations. It puts undue emphasis on The E.U.'s past troubles, which I must admit make an interesting story. But NYT reviews need to be written with a long shelf-life in mind. Even major restaurants (such as The Four Seasons, reviewed last week) go many years between reviews. A minor one, like The E.U., might never be reviewed again, making this the newspaper's (likely) final word on the restaurant-something that will turn up on google searches and be read for years to come.With that in mind, is this how the review should end?As a watering hole, the E.U. actually feels charmed, though I articulate that with my fingers crossed (a tough trick when you're typing), and in spite of my parting glance at the restaurant around midnight one busy, noisy night. I walked out as three grim-faced police officers walked in.Uh-oh.On a more positive note, his first mention of the food came in the sixth paragraph, a considerable improvement over Rosanjin two weeks ago, when the food wasn't mentioned till paragraph fifteen. And the review made me want to visit the restaurant, which is always a good sign.The review was also a useful reminder that one star, despite being near the low end of the Times rating scale, means \"good.\" Often, the restaurants awarded one star don't actually sound all that good: at that level, it usually seems like the critic is explaining why the restaurant isn't two or three stars, which can't help but convey a negative impression. Bruni's review of The E.U., although not without its negatives, actually reads like what a \"good\" one-star review is supposed to be.Eater and NYJ both took the one-star bet at 3-1 odds, winning $3 on our hypothetical $1 wager.

Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews The E.U., a restaurant best known for its eighteen-month odyssey to obtain a liquor license. In the kitchen is Ahktar Nawab, formerly the acclaimed chef de cuisine at Craftbar. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 3-1 One Star: 3-1 √√Two Stars: 8-1 Three Stars: 85-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: We don't really have much to go on this week. Bruni tends to lag the other reviewers, so by the time he gets to a place, there's a body of critical opinion already out there. That's not so for The E.U., but we rely on Eater's report that \"Chef Nawab's food has ranged from legitimately very good to wildly less so.\"The menu is also not in The E.U.'s favor, with its polyglot categories: raw bar, tapas, charcuterie, panini, along with standard appetizers and entrees. Bruni tends to think-and here I agree with him-that a restaurant trying to do so many things will usually misfire on some of them.If Bruni is grading on his \"downtown curve,\" there's an outside shot at two stars. On the whole, we think one star is the safer bet.The Bet: We agree with Eater that Frank Bruni will award one star to E.U.

Last in a five-part series (see part 1, part 2, part 3, part 4) A view looking up Lombard Street, the famous \"crooked street\" in San Francisco. We concluded our tour in San Francisco. Left: San Francisco harbor, with Alcatraz in the distance. Right: The view down Lombard Street. Left: We had just crossed the Golden Gate Bridge. The view looking back at San Francisco was hazy indeed, and a photo of the bridge itself impossible. Right: Just turn the camera 90 degrees to the left, and the view is a completely different story. * Muir Woods has some of the last old-growth Coast Redwoods near a major city. (The rest of them are much farther north.) By 1900, most of the original redwood forests had been cut down. Muir Woods remained intact mainly because it was extremely difficult to reach. Businessman William Kent bought the 295-acre site in 1905 and donated it to the Federal Government. President Theodore Roosevelt proclaimed it a national monument in 1908. Left: Entrance to Muir Woods National Monument. Right: A view of the redwoods from a distance (actually taken after we had left the park). Left: Yup, they sure are tall. Right: There are many downed trees in the park. Though the redwoods are among the longest-lived trees, they do eventually fall after 1,000 to 1,500 years, or so. Left: Note the odd growth pattern of the tree on the right. Right: Robert inside a \"fairy ring\" of related trees. Note the fire damage on the large center tree. There hasn't been a major fire at Muir Woods in 150 years, but many of the trees have lingering scars from past fires. Though fire damages redwoods, it seldom kills them. They actually benefit from occasional fires, which kill off less hardy species, opening the canopy to sunlight, and making room for new redwood seeds to germinate. Left: A waterfall. Right: Sometimes, a fallen tree blocks the path. Here, there was just enough space to squeeze through. Left: The bulbous structure is called a \"burl.\" Normally they are closer to the ground, but this one is up in the air. Eventually, a new trunk will sprout from here. Right: Father and son inside a hollowed-out tree trunk.

Ruby Foo's Times Square

***CONTENT
Ruby Foo's Times Square is part of the sprawling B. R. Guest Restaurant Group. The owner, Stephen Hanson, seems to have a Ph.D. in populism. Once called \"king of the one-star restaurant world,\" his empire now stretches to sixteen restaurants-some of them clones, and most of them in New York. They are usually riffs on popular genres. His lone failure, as far as I know, was the ill-fated Barça 18, which not even the services of Le Bernardin's Eric Ripert as consulting chef could save.The first Ruby Foo's (now called Ruby Foo's Uptown) sported a $3.5 million David Rockwell interior (an extravagant sum in 1999), but managed to keep dinner under $30 a head. An approving Ruth Reichl awarded two stars in the Times. It was an instant sensation, and the Times Square branch opened just a year later. The Times reported that the outdoor neon sign alone cost $1.5 million.The rhythm of the neighborhood is tied to Broadway. Most restaurants, whether good or not, are packed until about 7:30, when they abruptly clear out. Many of them do a brisk after-show business, too. We had no trouble getting a same-day 9:30 p.m. reservation, as it was early enough that most shows hadn't let out yet. We saw a steady stream of late customers coming in after us. The menu is well suited to \"grazing,\" making Ruby Foo's especially attractive for a late-night snack.Like many restaurants in the pan-Asian genre, the menu at Ruby Foo's is divided into multiple categories, with both creative and traditional takes on Chinese, Thai, and Japanese cuisine. The menu announces that \"the fun is in sharing - your server will guide you.\" We didn't get much guidance, and it was hard to tell how much food to order.Colossal Spicy Tuna Tempura Maki Roll (left); Thai Chicken Wings with Spicy Tamarind Glaze (right)There are almost 20 kinds of rolls in two categories: Ruby's Rolls ($7.00-9.50) and Monster Rolls ($9.00-10.50). The server advised that, despite the names, all rolls are the same size, except for the Colossal Spicy Tuna roll ($10.00), which is slightly larger. So I ordered that. The whole roll seemed to have been deep-fried, and while it wasn't really that spicy, it was enjoyable nonetheless.There are about 10 kinds of Dim Sum ($7.00-$10.50). We tried the Thai Chicken Wings ($7), which weren't a bad deal at all, although they were a bit too spicy for my son, who doesn't care for spicy food. I would have gladly eaten more of them, except that we had a lot more food to go.Pad Thai Shrimp & Chicken (left); Dim Sum Sampler (right)My son's main course was the Pad Thai ($19.50). The photo doesn't give a proper sense of depth. It was an enormous bowl, and I doubt anyone would finish it if they also ordered an appetizer. It tasted rather generic to me, but certainly acceptable.The Dim Sum Sampler ($13) came with two apiece of Shrimp Dumplings, Vegetable Dumplings, Szechuan Pork Dumplings, and Chicken Pot Stickers. The pork dumplings were the best of the bunch, while the chicken and vegetable dumplings were so similar in taste that I couldn't tell them apart.My main complaint with the service is that all of the food came at once. It also took a long while to arrive. Some of these dishes surely could have been ready sooner, and delivered to the table in stages, so that our meal could have had some pacing to it.The decor is a feast for the eyes. Even my 12-year-old son appreciated that the atmosphere was a cut above the typical Chinese restaurant. He was particularly taken with the restroom attendant, although he wondered about the purpose of having someone to turn on the faucet and put the soap on your hands, as if it were at all inconvenient to do this yourself.We had a mixture of hits and near-misses at Ruby Foo's, but all the food was at least reasonable, as was the bill. For quite a lot of food, it was just $63 before tax and tip (that included one mixed drink). At that price, I wouldn't mind giving Ruby Foo's another shot. And there's still plenty more of the menu to try.Ruby Foo's Times Square (1626 Broadway at 49th Street, Theater District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: *

Eleven Madison Park

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Eleven Madison Park. In 1998, Danny Meyer did the absurd. Within a month's time, he opened two contrasting luxury restaurants in a neighborhood not then known for fine dining. The location, a landmarked Art Deco building, ought to have been perfect, but it adjoined the dilapidated Madison Park, better known at the time for drug dealers, broken fences, and crumbling asphalt. The park was eventually rebuilt (Meyer himself contributed $60,000), and both restaurants were hits. Apparently, Meyer's original intention was to open just one restaurant on the ground floor of the old Met Life building, but the wall separating two dining rooms had landmark status, and couldn't be removed. So in the smaller of the two spaces, he opened the Indian-fusion restaurant Tabla; and in the spectacular former Assembly Hall, he opened Eleven Madison Park. Though both restaurants were a success, Ruth Reichl in the Times found Tabla more impressive, awarding three stars. To Eleven Madison Park, she awarded only two in a 1999 review, finding chef Kerry Heffernan's main courses \"disappointingly uneven.\" Six years later, for no apparent reason, Frank Bruni re-reviewed Eleven Madison Park, again awarding two stars, finding \"much of his food...unremarkable\" and \"some of it...poorly executed.\" My only visit to Eleven Madison Park under Chef Heffernan was on Mother's Day in 2005. I was impressed with a five-course tasting menu, especially bearing in mind that most restaurants under-perform on major holidays. But most observers didn't share my three-star assessment. By the end of the year, Chef Heffernan had departed, replaced by wunderkind Daniel Humm. Suddenly, the food community was buzzing that Eleven Madison Park was practically a new restaurant. The Gourmand Tasting MenuFrank Bruni took notice, issuing using the first self-re-review of his tenure to elevate Eleven Madison Park to three stars. (He then managed the peculiar feat of insulting the restaurant by absurdly awarding another three stars to the casual Bar Room at The Modern in the same review-in the process dissing the best restaurant in Danny Meyer's empire, the main dining room at The Modern.) Last week, my girlfriend and I returned to Eleven Madison Park, our first visit since Chef Humm took over. Nowadays, the restaurant offers a three-course prix fixe at $82, a four-course prix fixe at $96, or a Gourmand tasting menu, which we ordered, at $155. Counting hors d'oeuvres and petits-fours, that tasting menu weighs in at 13 courses, making it one of the city's more ambitious of its kind. A full description of 13 courses would extend this post to the length of a minor novel, so an impressionistic fly-by will have to suffice. The full menu is pictured above right (click for a larger image). Hors d'oeuvres (left); Maine Diver Scallop with caviar (right) The hors d'oeuvres were mind-blowingly good. From left to right, I believe they were a foie gras sandwich; a sweetbread; hamachi in a cucumber wrap; and sorry, I cannot recall the fourth. I loved the first savory course, a diver scallop with caviar. My girlfriend doesn't eat scallops, so they just gave her a version of the dish with the scallop omitted, which we thought was a rather unimaginative substitute. California Celery, Cappuccino with Celery Root, and Black Truffles (left); Peekytoe Crab Cannelloni (right) A celery and cappuccino puree with black truffles was topped with a fried quail egg. Peekytoe Crab Cannelloni was satisfactory, though it did not eclipse our memory of the crab salad we had at Daniel a couple of months ago. Foie gras with Venezuelan Cocoa and Quince (left); Mediterranean Loup de Mer (right) It's hard to go wrong with foie gras, but the torchon here was particularly dreamy. The accompanying soft brioche was wonderful-but also, in a way, superfluous. Chef Humm has a delicate touch with fish, and the Loup de Mer was wonderful. Scottish Langoustine (left); Four Story Hill \"Boudin Blanc\" (right) The next couple of courses didn't register as impressively. A Scottish Langoustine was slightly dull, as was the boudin (a kind of sausage), though I was a bit more fond of it than my girlfriend was. Three variations of Vermont Farm Suckling PigSuckling pig is apparently Chef Humm's signature dish. Frank Bruni raved about it. When he came out to greet diners late in our meal, he made sure to ask, \"How about the pig?\" My girlfriend was transported, though I found it a bit too dry. We overheard diners at the next table, and their views were exactly reversed: it was the lady who thought hers was too dry. I'd love to come back and try the full entree version of it. My sense was that this is precisely the kind of dish that suffers from being served in a tasting menu portion. You need more of it, to give the fat room to spread out, to give alternating crisp and gooey textures the chance to shine. Lynnhaven \"Chèvre Frais\" (left); Coconut sorbet with pear and parsnips (right) The next two courses are perhaps best classified as palate-cleansers. Nothing stands out about them, and I present them (above) without comment. Chocolate cake with Passion Fruit Bourbon Sour (left); Candied lollipops (right) The main dessert course was a wonderful chocolate cake with a passion fruit bourbon sour for contrast. I only wish I had had enough appetite left to enjoy more of the candied lollipops. Service throughout the evening was up the the standard you come to expect at a Danny Meyer restaurant. Given his success, I wonder why more restauranteurs don't emulate him? When I arrived, the host offered immediately to show me to the table-rather than insisting I wait at the bar until my date arrived, as so many restaurants do these days. The wine list is excellent, with a good selection of half-bottles. I was also pleased to see a decent selection below $60, an price level often not available at restaurants in this class. Our wine selection was unimaginative: a Barolo that I chose for no other reason than I was happy to find it at $89. The staff decanted it, a service few restaurants offer these days. Wine decanters are an Eleven Madison Park specialty, and you see them on display in a wide variety of shapes. The bread service, too, was excellent, with nice soft butter in a silver serving dish, and several home-made breads to spread it on. The whole meal took around 3½ hour, and I was never conscious of it being either too fast or too slow. The large space, with its soaring Art Deco ceilings, leave some people cold. We find it coolly elegant and understated, but it won't be to all tastes. We were happy to find that those high ceilings gave ample room for the sound level to dissipate, but the restaurant wasn't quite full, so we didn't have the acid test. We were seated at a table that could normally accomodate four, so we had a bit more space to ourselves than we normally would. A few of the courses on our Gourmand tasting menu misfired slightly, but I say this only in relation to the high expectations one has at a price level that puts Eleven Madison Park near the top of the heap in this already expensive city. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. I would be delighted to return. Eleven Madison Park (11 Madison Avenue at 24th Street, Flatiron District) Food: ***½Service: ***½Ambiance: ***Overall: ***½

Cannery Row, immortalized in the John Steinbeck novel, is now crassly commercial, as if Disney were operating it. The aquarium, at least, is entirely genuine.

***CONTENT
When Little Frankie BrunBrun was a young lad, his father used to take him to the Four Seasons, where he got \"a sweeping sense of the big money to be made and spent in this city.\" Yesterday, Big Frank Bruni returned to the stomping ground of his youth, and found that \"the restaurant, like so much else, isn't quite what it was.\" Some dishes transported him; others were but a shadow of their former decadent selves.Mercifully, Bruni spared us his usual assault on fine dining. He did not try to argue that contemporary \"savvy\" diners are no longer interested in classic luxury. The review included none of the insulting terms he usually applies to such places, like fussy, prissy, or highfalutin. He was, for once, perfectly happy to accept the restaurant on its own terms. He simply found it not up to its former glory.To the extent the restaurant cares-and it probably does not-the Four Seasons should consider itself fortunate to have escaped with just a three-to-two demotion. The review read at the low end of two stars. From the text alone, a singleton could very well have been justified. Did Frank give the second star for nostalgia? Quite possibly.We took the two-star bet at 8-3 odds, winning $2.67 on our hypothetical $1 wager. Eater took the three-star bet, losing $1.

Zeytin, a Turkish restaurant on the Upper West Side, has largely escaped critical notice since it opened in 2004. Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice named it Best Trendy Turk restaurant of 2006, which is funny, because I don't think there are many others.But Zeytin is indeed a fun place to visit, and a welcome addition to a neighborhood not renowned for fine dining. The space is quiet and classy. The photo above, cribbed from the restaurant's website, was shot during a Mother's Day party. We visited at 5:30 p.m. on Monday night, in advance of an opera at Lincoln Center, finding the setting far more muted than the photo would suggest.We both started with the appetizer that had the most unusual name: Pachanga Borek ($8), five lovely, thin, triangular pastries filled with sauteed tomatoes, cured veal, mushrooms, and kasseri cheese. For the main course, I had the whole boneless red snapper ($20), broiled in parchment paper with shitake mushrooms, asparagus, dill and tomatoes. I could find no fault with it at all: the snapper was tender and moist, and well paired with the accompanying vegetables.Several of the entrees feature lamb. My friend had the roasted lamb ($19), which wasn't as hearty a portion as the other items we tried. But perhaps it was just as well, as she reported it was \"a bit oily,\" although she liked the rice.Service was generally okay, although the serving staff shouldn't have had to be prompted to replace our silverware after the appetizer course. The warm, soft thick bread served with olive oil before the meal was wonderful.Zeytin is gentle on the pocketbook. Most appetizers are $5-10, most entrees $14-22, side dishes just $3. To drink, we found a quite respectable Shiraz for just $30. Coffee after dinner was just $2. The whole bill for two before the tip was $95.45, including tax. It is well worth a visit, and Lincoln Center is only 10-15 minutes away by taxi.Zeytin (519 Columbus Avenue at 85th Street, Upper West Side)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, His Frankness reviews The Four Seasons, one of New York's iconic restaurants. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 6-1 One Star: 4-1 Two Stars: 8-3 Three Stars: 5-1 √√Four Stars: 15,000-1The Skinny: Opened in 1959, The Four Seasons is one of New York's oldest continuously operating restaurants. Many celebrities are frequent diners, including Hillary Clinton and Henry Kissinger. Prices are astronomical, with the least expensive dinner entree priced at $37, and many above $50.Ruth Reichl awarded three stars in 1995, re-affirming Bryan Miller's three-star rating from 1990. I also found a two-star Mimi Sheraton review dating from 1979. (There probably were earlier rated reviews that my cursory search failed to uncover. It's hard to believe that Sheraton's piece, after the restaurant had been open twenty years, was the first.)I had a hunch that this week's Bruni target would be a re-review, but I didn't expect The Four Seasons. Classic elegance always seems to bore Frank Bruni, so it is surprising to find him dining at an established landmark that has mostly flown under the critics' radar over the last decade.Eater has framed the dilemma well. Most of us think of The Four Seasons as a restaurant that practically defines three-star dining. But Bruni's tenure has been marked with a strong undercurrent of hostility towards precisely this type of restaurant: classic, expensive, elegant, beloved of celebrities, and not especially adventurous. No such restaurant has received three stars from Frank Bruni, and we don't think tomorrow will be an exception.On top of that, Bruni's \"unprompted\" re-reviews-those not occasioned by a major event (new chef, new location, facelift)-have generally resulted in a rating change. As Bruni himself once said, it's usually not worth investing the multiple visits required for a full review, if the only outcome is to re-confirm a previous verdict.The Bet: Eater, for what he concedes are emotional reasons, is taking the three-star action. We are betting that Frank will do what he always does, slay the sacred cow, and award two stars to The Four Seasons. If we were inclined to be really adventurous, we'd bet on one star before we'd bet on three. But for now, two it is.

I first visited Public about three years ago, when it was still relatively new. My impression then was that the food didn't quite live up to the high-concept ambiance. Last night, I decided to give it another try. My verdict remains the same: Public is more about the \"scene\" than it is about the food.To be sure, it's no mean feat to remain relevant three years later. That's more than enough time for fickle diners to find a new favorite. Just as it always did, Public still seems to fill up, at least on weekends. We had no trouble getting a 7:15 p.m. reservation on Saturday night, but the next available was past 10:00 p.m. By the time we left, it seemed every inch of space was occupied.Typical of restaurants in its genre, Public would not seat me until my dining companion had arrived-either a sensible strategy for managing tables in demand, or a cynical way to run up the bar tab. So I went to the bar, where I struggled to get a server's attention. Once I did, I enjoyed both of the infused vodkas that I tried. Naturally, the tab wasn't transferable to our table.Public offers an Australian/New Zealand fusion menu that is really difficult to categorize.Cured wild boar with Garrotxa cheese, marinated olives, caper berries and crostiniCured wild boar ($13) sounded interesting, but was probably a waste of a good wild boar, as it didn't taste particularly distinctive. With the cheese and crostini, it was at least a tasty snack. My girlfriend had the lentil salad, which was just fine, but didn't launch any culinary fireworks.Manuka braised lamb shank and truffled swede mash with watercress, poached pear and pickled onion saladWe both had the braised lamb shank ($25.50), which was satisfying comfort-food, though as my girlfriend pointed out, the degree of difficulty is low. It's hard to screw up a braised meat. I thought that both the swede mash and accompanying salad were boring.Service was inconsistent, and one server spilled wine on my shirt. The decor, a public library cum post office circa 1940s, is one of design firm AvroKO's most stunning creations. The new-age sound track is too loud, and the exposed brick tends to amplify the sound.You won't eat badly at Public, but you won't be wowed either. Perhaps the best bet is to come for a drink, admire the design, then try somewhere else for dinner.Public (210 Elizabeth St. between Spring St. & Prince St., NoLIta)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Koca Lounge

Lower East Side newcomer Koca Lounge has had a rough start. It opened last fall, but initially without a liquor license. It has gone largely unnoticed by the critics, but the two who've reviewed it-Paul Adams in The Sun and Evan Mantyk in The Epoch Times-have been pleased.The name is also not in its favor. \"Koca\" comes from a Thai word for a boiling hot pot that you use to cook your own food. The Japanese version of it, shabu shabu, is considerably more familiar. But to Westerners, \"Koca\" suggests coffee or cocaine, neither of which is the image the owners want. The restaurant started with an even stranger name, \"Outlet Koca Lounge,\" which was simply bizarre. \"Outlet\" has now been wisely dropped.With that out of the way, we come to the food at Koca Lounge, which is not only wonderful, but also surprisingly inexpensive. The menu is in numerous categories, with \"snacks\" ($2-12), noodle dishes ($9-13), stir fry ($8-9), \"plates\" ($11-14), hot pots (four choices, $17), meat and seafood for the hot pots ($7-11), sweets ($6), and chocolate hot pots ($11).The category called \"snacks\" is roughly equivalent to appetizers. Thai Meatballs with Peanut Sauce ($7) came with two skewers of four deep-fried meatballs apiece, along with a peanut sauce for dipping. Cumin Grilled Baby Lamb Chops with Japanese Pepper & Cucumber Yogurt Sauce ($12) came with three pepper-crusted lamb chops and a wonderful dipping sauce.We saw the same dishes coming out of the kitchen over and over again, so obviously the other tables were as drawn to these choices as we were. Both were terrific, and the lamb must be one of the better bargains in town. Where else do you get three lamb chops for $12?Four hot pots are offered, named for the seasons. Each one comes with a bountiful plate of bok choy, enoki mushrooms, cauliflower, corn, seasonal greens, taro, egg dumplings and fish cakes. The server suggested that one additional meat selection would be ample, and indeed it was. We chose the prime ribeye ($8), along with the Winter hot pot, a heavy beef broth with Szechuan spices.Obviously this wasn't traditional shabu shabu (they don't serve Szechuan spices in Japan), but it had all the usual trappings. The hot pot was brought to a boil, then we added the vegetables, since they take a short while to cook. The ribeye was sliced paper-thin, and each piece cooked through in about 15-20 seconds. I thought the meatnwas sliced a little too thin, as some of the pieces fell apart inside the pot.After you're done eating, the remaining broth makes an appealing soup. This is the part I most look forward to, but there wasn't as much left as I would have liked. On past occasions, I recall the pot starting more full. At one restaurant, I remember the server coming by mid-meal and adding more broth, but that wasn't done here.At some shabu shabu houses, the cooking apparatus is built right into the tables. At Koca Lounge, each table has a built-in induction burner, which heats the pot without getting hot itself. Even the seats at the bar have the burners, so it is pretty clear that the restaurant considers the hot pots its main attraction. The tables are a bit small: ours just barely accommodated the hot pot, two plates of ingredients, our own plates, glasses, and a wine bottle.The decor is typical Lower East Side post-industrial chic. There's also an outdoor garden (sans induction burners). There's a sound track of pop favorites that doesn't add much to the atmosphere, but at least isn't loud or obnoxious. The restaurant doesn't take reservations, but on Friday night it hardly mattered: not a soul was there when we arrived (around 7:30 p.m.), and by the time we left only about six tables were occupied, plus another two outside.To go with our meal, we ordered a Rioja, which at $27 was the most expensive red wine on the menu. (There are also a number of sakes available.) The total bill before tip came to about $76 including tax, making Koca Lounge one of the better bargains we've experienced in a long time.Koca Lounge (76 Orchard St. between Broome St. and Grand St., Lower East Side)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Second in a five-part series (see part 1, part 2)The segment of California Highway 1 between San Simeon and Monterey offers some of the most spectacular scenery in the world. The road is two lanes for most of the route, twisting and turning through mountain passes. This was about a three-hour drive. Left & right: Not long past San Simeon, there's an outlook onto a beach where California Seals sun themselves. They didn't budge during the time we were there, except to spray sand onto themselves with their flippers. We were fortunate to see them, as it was the third week of March, and their beach season ends around April 1st. Left: I have to assume this is a father and pup. The larger individual seems too bulky to be a female. Right: No seals in this photo, but this is the view at the same stop, just a couple of hundred feet north.

***CONTENT
Second in a five-part series (part 1 here) We left Morro Bay for the 30-minute trip north to Hearst Castle, in San Simeon. William Randolph Hearst's family had, at one time, amassed some 300,000 acres of coastal property. When Hearst inherited the land from his father in the 1920s, he started construction on Hearst Castle, an enormous mountain-top mansion where he ran his media empire and entertained his friends. The castle was eventually donated to the state, although tens of thousands of surrounding acres are still owned by the Hearst Corporation. You arrive at a visitor's center at the base of the mountain. The castle is a long way in the distance. The photo above is as good a zoom shot as we could get. It's actually a close-up taken from the photo shown at right, which gives an indication of just how far away the \"castle\" really is. A tour bus takes you up the winding road to the estate.Four different tours are offered. We took the one recommended for first-time visitors. We had a shade more than an hour at the mountaintop, but allowing for the bus ride either way and the National Geographic film shown at the end, it turned into a 2½-3 hour visit. Left: The gothic spires of the main house. The grounds also have three elaborate guest houses, which we didn't photograph. We also didn't get any shots inside the main house (it was too dark). All of the rooms we saw were decorated in a gothic pre-renaissance style. One can appreciate the artistry of it, but it's not a style I would choose in my own home. Right: Around the grounds. Left: Around the grounds. Right: Egyptian statues on the grounds, the castle's oldest art works. Left & right: Mr. Hearst wanted his guests to appreciate the view, so we shall. Left & right: More of the view. Left & right: The massive Romanesque outdoor swimming pool. It was under repair at the time of our visit. Normally, it would be filled with water. Left & right: Architectural details around the outdoor pool. Left: The indoor pool is, if anything, more spectacular, though hard to capture through the camera lens. Oddly, though this pool is indoors, the guests had to go outdoors to reach it, as it has no direct entrance from the house. Right: One last look at Mr. Hearst's vast lands.

As expected, Frank Bruni awarded two stars to Rosanjin.It's hard to complain about this review. Yes, it displays the usual Bruni foible of dancing around the subject, instead of hitting it straight on. By my count, it's not until the 15th paragraph that Bruni actually says anything about the food. Once he gets there, he mostly loves it.But in other ways, I have to give Bruni some credit-which I've seldom had occasion to do. Until now, Bruni has mostly been known for smacking down sacred cows, and giving rave reviews to places the foodies had long ago discovered. Unlike the Duke of Plaza-Toro, Frank Bruni didn't lead fashions; he followed them. What kind of critic are you, if all you do is ratify other people's judgments? With Rosanjin, you could say he \"discovered\" a place that practically everyone else had ignored.I would add that I haven't been to Rosanjin, so I have no idea if the rave is deserved. But at least Bruni, for the first time that I can recall, actually led critical opinion about something, rather than just ratifying it.Eater and I both took the two-star bet at 5-1 odds, winning $5 apiece.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank \"Samurai\" Bruni reviews Rosanjin, the Japanese kaiseki restaurant in TriBeCa. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 5-1 One Star: 3-1 Two Stars: 5-1 √√ Three Stars: 30-1 Four Stars: 15,000-1The Skinny: As Eater notes, Rosanjin \"has generally flown below the radar.\" I found only one review. Paul Adams of the Sun enjoyed himself, but thought that Sugiyama was better at half the price. Price, indeed, is the issue. Rosanjin's prix fixe is $105-150, as opposed to $68 at Sugiyama. (When Adams dined at Rosanjin, he paid $150.)Sugiyama carries three stars at the Times, dating from a 1999 Ruth Reichl review. Bruni is highly price-sensitive, so he's not going to award three stars tomorrow unless Rosanjin is considerably better than Sugiyama. Adams didn't think it was, and Bruni generally follows other people's recommendations; he doesn't lead them. To put it another way, it's highly unlikely that there's a three-star restaurant in the shadows that all the other critics have missed.Yet, Bruni usually doesn't review restaurants everyone else has ignored, only to insult them. For a restaurant at Rosanjin's price level, anything below two stars would be an insult. On top of that, Bruni's discretionary reviews - the restaurants he chooses to review, rather than those he must review - are usually two stars.The Bet: No outcome below four stars would utterly surprise me, but I find three stars distinctly unlikely, and Eater hasn't made the one-star odds (3-1) sufficiently enticing. Therefore, we are once again making the same bet as Eater: two stars for Rosanjin.

I present them here with minimal commentary.Day 1 took us from L.A. to Morro Bay, a trip that would take about four hours by the inland route, but took us around six and a half along the slower Pacific Coast Highway, with ample stops for photo-ops and food breaks. Left: All of that L.A. smog you read about is really true.Right: Scrub brush along the way. Left: The vastness of the Pacific. Right: Robert and me. Left: Rocky outcrops like this one are common along the route.Right: So is scrub brush. Left & right: Rocks and mountains along the coastline. Left:We arrive at Morro Bay, known for the Morro Rock. It appears to be out in the middle of the bay, though in fact there is a man-made road to it. Climbing the rock is illegal, as it is home to endangered bird species. Right: Boats on the bay. Left & right: We don't find much excitement in Morro Bay, aside from the sunset.We leave this post with one more sunset shot over Morro Bay.

As expected, the Brunmeister awarded one star to Varietal. As expected, he found the food uneven. As expected, he found it \"a province of aggressive experimentation and eccentric, highfalutin name tags.\" (\"Highfalutin\" is one of Frank's favorite words to describe restaurants too clever for their own good.)He was less taken with the desserts than some other critics, which I should have expected. Bruni will lament that avant-garde cuisine doesn't have much of a toe-hold in New York, but when someone actually tries something, invariably he isn't enthused.

Varietal is primarily a wine restaurant. Frank doesn't know much about wine, so he is unlikely to appreciate the restaurant's main attraction. Varietal has white tablecloths, and Frank finds traditional formality a turn-off. The service at Varietal is, as Eater put it, \"fussy.\" Frank doesn't like fussy. Varietal is rather expensive, and Frank tends to hold expensive restaurants to a high standard. Lastly, most critics have not been wowed by the food-other than Jordan Kahn's desserts.So, why even one star? Only because we think Varietal is the kind of restaurant Frank would simply ignore if he couldn't find something good to say. Given that he's reviewing it, we don't think it will get goose-egged. Desserts will save the day. We do agree with Eater, however, that zero stars is more likely than two.The Bet: For the second week in a row, we agree with the Eater bet, which in this case is one star.

Klee Brasserie (the first word is pronounced \"Clay\") opened late last year in West Chelsea. Many of the dishes, like Chef and co-owner Daniel Angerer, hail from Austria. But Angerer has gotten around, working for Joel Robuchon, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, David Bouley, and others. The restaurant is not purely Austrian, but draws its influences from just about everywhere. The interior make-over is lovely. If only the food were more appealing. Black Bean Soup ($8) was more like bean-flavored water: it had practically no texture, and was over-salted. Swordfish Steak ($26) was dominated by barbecue sauce. Good thing too, as the fish itself was both ropey and cold. The bed of spinach was the best thing about the dish, but you don't pay $26 for spinach.My girlfriend ordered the Lamb Shank ($23). She was surprised to find that it didn't come with any shank. It seemed more like Lamb Osso Buco without the bone. That said, there was nothing else objectionable about it. I didn't note the description of the palate cleanser (pictured right, absurdly out-of-scale), but it was better than either of the dishes I paid for.The wine list was a definite asset, with a nice list of half-bottles available. We didn't want to drink much, so we had a nice half-bottle of Châteauneuf-du-Pape at just $27. The bread service was an asset too, with three warm home-made slices served on a warm stone, with a small jar of soft butter, probably also home-made.Service was mostly okay, but we had a seriously annoying waiter. His leering comment as he dropped off the dessert menus, \"Now, let me lead you into temptation,\" was typical. It also took him something like ten minutes to uncork the wine, a task that I shouldn't have thought was that difficult.Klee hasn't had many reviews. In a blog preview in the restaurant's early days, Frank Bruni also found the swordfish cold, so apparently they haven't solved that particular problem.This was a restaurant I wanted to like, but it was merely humdrum.Klee Brasserie (200 Ninth Avenue between 22nd & 23rd Streets, Chelsea)Food: fairService: okayAmbiance: goodOverall: fair

So, I had struck a deal on a 3 BR co-op on Cabrini Boulevard in Hudson Heights. The fun part was over: I had to apply for a mortgage.Every time I apply for a mortgage-and this is my fourth time-I am amazed at how painful a process it is. A full proctological exam would be more entertaining. Not since I was divorced did I have to disclose my finances in such detail.The mortgage broker took my application over the phone. I hadn't expected this, so I was answering questions according to my recollection. She asked for my SSN, and within seconds had my credit report on her computer screen. It was a little frightening to think how easily a stranger could find out so much about me.The good news was that my credit score is above 800, which is considered excellent. The bad news was that the report was showing me responsible for a bunch of credit card debt, as well as a house in Tampa, that I don't own. All of that extra debt is almost certainly my ex-wife's. Our names differ by only one letter. Many of those cards, as well as the home, pre-date our divorce.The mortgage broker sent the completed application to my apartment by messenger, and it was waiting for me when I got home. There was also a self-addressed stamped priority mail envelope, in which I would return the signed application and all of the disclosure materials they'd asked for. As I had answered questions off-the-cuff, there were quite a few errors. I also saw that, of the six credit cards listed, only one was mine. There were too many entries that would have to be corrected, so I just downloaded a new form and started over again.I had a week's vacation coming, and didn't want the application to languish for that long, so I stayed up till 4:00 a.m. gathering all my paperwork, so I could take it to work the next day and make photocopies. In case you're wondering, this is what they needed:Copies of my last three months' asset statements (checking, savings, stocks, mutual funds, 401(k), etc.)Copies of 12 months' consecutive cancelled rent checks (front and back)Copies of my 2004, 2005 and 2006 W-2's, 1099's, K-1'sCopies of my 2004 and 2005 Federal 1040 tax returns (and all schedules)Copies of recent pay stubs covering a one-month periodA letter from my employer breaking out my bonus/commission income for the last two yearsCopy of official government ID (driver's license or passport)A check or credit card authorization for $750, covering the application fee ($350) and the estimated cost of an appraisal ($400)Based on past experience, I'm sure they'll want more-e.g., proof that I no longer own the Tampa home; proof that my ex-wife's credit cards are not mine; and so forth.With that, I was ready to go on vacation.To be continued...

It was a Saturday night, and I was on my own. Where to dine? How about a place my girlfriend wouldn't care for. Like Hawaiian Tropic Zone.There isn't much Hawaiian in Hawaiian Tropic Zone, except that the servers are all in bikinis. Twice nightly (6:30 p.m., 8:30 p.m.), they participate in mandatory beauty contests, with the restaurant's patrons voting on the outcome. There's a huge platform above the bar (see photo) where the girls strut their stuff. The winning server gets $100. Yesterday was St. Patrick's Day, and most of the girls were in green bikinis.When HTZ first opened, the local serving staff was supplemented with imports from nationwide beauty contests, who were brought to New York and boarded rent-free in \"dorms.\" None of those interlopers seemed to be on duty last night. My server, who's from Buffalo, said she has worked at the restaurant since it opened last September. I thought she was easily the best-looking woman there, but she doesn't have much enthusiasm for the nightly beauty pageants. \"They make us do it,\" she said. And then shrugged her shoulders.When I got home, I suddenly realized that I'd seen her photo before. A little bit of googling, and I found it: she was the one featured in a Grub Street post about four months ago. What's it like working in a bikini every day? \"The most common issue is men asking myself and other waitresses if their boobs are real, which puts you in an uncomfortable situation. Mine are, but a lot of the other girls' aren't!\"As far as the food goes, there wouldn't be much to write about, except that a serious chef, David Burke, is in charge of the cuisine. Like a few other celebrity chefs, Burke has spread himself a little thin lately. His flagship restaurant, davidburke & donatella, is still tough to get into, but my last visit there was disappointing. Since DB&D, Burke has expanded to Bloomingdale's, a Chicago steakhouse, and now the Times Square Hawaiian Tropic Zone. A clone of the Hawaiian Tropic Zone and another David Burke restaurant are announced for Las Vegas. BBQ Chicken Spring Rolls (left); Coriander Crusted Tuna (right)The menu seems to be a mongrel, with no obvious theme that I can make out. BBQ Chicken Spring Rolls ($13) were lumpy and dull, but thanks to the accompanying barbecue sauce, were at least passable. Coriander Crusted Tuna ($32) was far more successful. The various accompaniments-vermicelli, peppers, scallions, napa cabbage, wasabi vinaigrette-seemed a lot more than were wanted, or needed.The server recommended the Bikini Punch ($12), made with Bacardi White Rum, Cruzan Coconut Rum, lime juice, passion fruit juice, pineapple syrup, orange juice. It was a great suggestion, and I had two of those. Cocktails at HTZ are a generous size, so that was all I needed.The decor at HTZ is glitzy and over-done. The clientele aren't all men; to my surprise, I saw plenty of women dining there. There were tons of empty tables at 8:30 on a Saturday night, but my server said it is usually busier. It was St. Patrick's Day. She speculated, \"Maybe they're all at the pub.\" She wasn't just a pretty face: service was excellent.The mainstream critics have pretty much ignored Hawaiian Tropic Zone, except for Bob Lape of Crain's New York Business, who awarded a rather generous two stars (PDF) in February. I find that Lape is usually about a star higher than all of the other critics, but I suspect HTZ wouldn't even get one star from Bruni or Platt.My visit coincided with one of the nightly beauty contests. The emcee said that the result would be tabulated in a half-hour or so, but when I left 45 minutes later, there was still no announcement. There's also a nightly drawing, with Dinner for Two as the prize. I was the winner, so it looks like I'll be coming back at least one more time.Hawaiian Tropic Zone (729 Seventh Avenue at 49th Street, Theater District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: Vegas-liteOverall: *

I tried to eat at Hawaiian Tropic Zone last Sunday. It took 20 minutes to get someone to take my order. After waiting another 35 minutes and being told twice my order would be out shortly, I was told the kitchen was out of my order and I needed to pick something else. Instead, I left. I saw another couple leave without even ordering due to the long delay waiting for service. This place is a high-priced clip joint and a service disaster.

We'd had a whirlwind tour of open houses on Cabrini Boulevard. One 3-bedroom apartment seemed virtually perfect. It met all my criteria, and on top of that, had just been totally renovated. \"Mint condition\" is an over-used word in real estate, but in this case it was entirely accurate. In Manhattan, where apartments not uncommonly sell above their asking prices, I felt that an offer 5% below the listing was reasonable. I called the agent who had shown us the place, and made the offer. Realtors in New York work in \"teams.\" The agent we saw was an underling. She had to pass the offer up the chain of command. The head of the team called me back about an hour later. After asking a bunch of questions about my income and assets-to satisfy herself that the offer was credible-she agreed to present my offer to the seller. And she had a surprising piece of news: if my offer was accepted, the sale wouldn't have to go through the co-op board, as long as I was putting 20% down, and the ratio of the mortgage payment to my monthly income was below 30%. In New York, about 80% of the apartments for sale are co-ops. Normally, co-0p buyers in NYC must go through a ritual that is virtually non-existent anywhere else: board approval. The co-op board can block a transaction for any reason, or no reason at all. In extreme cases, co-ops have gone unsold for months, or even years, as the board turned down one buyer after another. The most common reason for turn-downs is that the buyer's financial resources aren't solid enough. Co-op boards' financial requirements are often far more stringent than banks. There are some high-end buildings that don't allow mortgages at all: only all-cash buyers are accepted. There are many more that require down payments much higher than the typical bank. These days, you can get a sub-prime loan with as little as 5% down, but most co-ops require at least 20% (including the one I'm bidding on), and higher percentages are quite common. Sometimes the board decides they just don't want you as a neighbor. There are well known cases of prominent celebrities being turned down, because the board thinks the celebrity will bring a lot of commotion to the building. But there are plenty of cases where a seemingly innocent question (\"When was the lobby last renovated?\") is enough to make the board think you're a trouble-maker, and that's all it takes. Boards in Upper Manhattan aren't nearly as snooty as their counterparts further south. Still, board approval can never be taken for granted, and even in a simple case, it adds a couple of months to the process. Back to Cabrini Boulevard: When a building makes the transition from rental to co-op, by law the existing tenants can't be forced out. At the time 360 Cabrini Boulevard converted to co-op, the sponsor sold a bunch of tenant-occupied units to an investor, who has been collecting rental income and selling them one by one, as they become vacant. That investor obtained dispensation that his sales would be automatically approved, as long as the buyer met basic financial requirements. That's why the unit I'm bidding on doesn't have to go through the co-op board. So, I placed the offer on Sunday night, and started waiting. Nothing moves faster than a realtor who has a bona fide customer on the hook, so I was surprised when Monday came and went, and I did not hear from her. It wasn't till mid-day Tuesday that she finally got back to me with a counter-offer just $4,000 above where I had envisioned doing the deal. I wasn't going to quibble over $4,000, so I said \"done.\" I was buying an apartment! To be continued...

On Friday night, I found myself suddenly hungry after a visit to the Times Square Toys \"R\" Us. The area is pretty much the death valley of fine dining. The wait at Virgil's Real Barbecue was at least 45 minutes. Next door, a Mexican guy right out of Blazing Saddles was trying to attract patrons to Viva Pancho. I was hungry enough, so I decided to take the plunge.This was the peak pre-theater hour, and there were plenty of tables free, so I assume you can get into Viva Pancho anytime you want. The walls are covered with vintage Mexican photographs, which offer a respite from the usual Mexican restaurant decor.The menu is 100% Mexican standards, but I went for the grilled salmon ($16), an off-menu special. You don't expect much for an entree under $20, but the salmon was nicely done, and it came with a serving of peas that were far more sweet and moist than usual. Among people who know me, it's a running joke that I almost never finish the vegetables, but I really loved those peas. Rice was unremarkable, and black beans were too watery.Sangria comes by the glass, half pitcher, or full pitcher. A half pitcher ($12.95) was enough for four glasses, and the sangria, studded with brandy, was surprisingly good.I wouldn't make a special trip for it, but if you're in the neighborhood and have a Mexican craving, Viva Pancho is inexpensive and not bad at all.Viva Pancho (156 W. 44th Street, east of Seventh Avenue, Theater District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

My son and I are off to California to visit my brother's family. After a couple of days there, we'll take a long drive up the Pacific Coast Highway.Blog posts will be either scarce or non-existent for the next 10 days. So much for that! Our trip started out as a comedy of cancellations.In the first place, my son was supposed to fly from Tampa to New York on Friday night. Then, we would have flown together from New York to California on Saturday. His trip to New York was cancelled (JetBlue, natch!), so I spent another $280 to fly him on Delta from from Tampa to California direct.Then, my flight to California on American was cancelled too. Now, here's the rub: when there are a bunch of cancelled flights during a busy travel period, you're usually stuck for several days, because all of the later flights are pretty close to fully booked. So, I can't get out to California till Monday.Assuming no further snafus, we'll at least get most of the vacation we planned, although I'll only have one evening with my brother's family before we hit the road.

So, I was intrigued with Cabrini Boulevard in Hudson Heights. An ad in the Times showed an open house at 340 Cabrini Boulevard the following Sunday, so I decided to take a look.Here's what the listing said:340 Cabrini Boulevard, #603. Note the view ofthe Hudson outside the living room window.Simply priceless. Imagine drinking your morning coffee while watching the seasons change across the Hudson River along the Palisades. Imagine sipping a glass of wine from a private terrace and watching the sunset every night. Now imagine that it all belongs to you and that the terrace and views come with 3 bedrooms; a beautifully appointed kitchen with granite counters and stainless appliances; amazing closet space and 2 marble baths with a Jacuzzi in the master suite. This amazing home boasts one of the most spectacular views in Hudson Heights and in fact all of Manhattan! If you feel like expanding your universe, the roof deck is perfect for entertaining. Live steps from great restaurants and shopping, Fort Tryon Park and The Cloisters. This mint condition condominium is ready to move in today!!!Floorplan at 340 Cabrini BoulevardYou can't always trust a broker's listing, but this one turned out to be entirely accurate. The apartment (listed at $995,000) was owned by a couple of Connecticut guys who used it as a pied à terre. It was impeccably decorated, and seemed to be very lightly used. The building, which is relatively new, is in terrific shape. The floorplan (right) was obviously designed to ensure that all three bedrooms would have river views. But because of the \"angled\" layout on the right side, the living/dining area is somewhat cramped.The following week, I came back with my girlfriend. We had another look at the same apartment, and one with the identical layout two floors below. It was not as attractively decorated as the first one, and had a very lived-in look. However, it was listed for $50,000 less. As the agent put it, \"Go upstairs and steal their decorating ideas; then, come down here and buy this one for less money.\"Exterior at 125 Cabrini BoulevardWe weren't so sure, so we moved on to 125 Cabrini Boulevard, several blocks south. The building, Hudson Gables, is in the Tudor Revival style, one of the two dominant architectural styles in Hudson Heights, along with Art Deco.The common areas, however, are much more dowdy looking than 340 Cabrini. We were amused to find that you had to go up two small stairs to get to the elevator. What's the point of having an elevator, if you have to climb stairs to get to it? The broker conceded that the building had had \"management problems\" in the past, which she said have now been rectified. The building is on the odd-numbered side of the street, and thus does not have the spectacular panoramic views of the earlier apartment.Floorplan at 125 Cabrini BoulevardIt's worth looking at the layout, which in New York real estate parlance is called a \"Classic 6.\" The living room and dining room are both fairly large, but each of the two bedrooms has only one small closet. In the lower right corner of the floorplan is a \"maid's room.\" Nowadays, most people would use it as a child's bedroom or a guest room, but it is clearly much smaller than the others.We found out that the co-op itself owns the unit, and has been trying to sell it for a while. They did a partial renovation, but it's still very plain on the inside, and the bathrooms aren't very attractive. The washer-dryer hookup is a definite plus: something seldom encountered in apartment buildings from this period. (It's a converted shower stall.)360 Cabrini BoulevardWe weren't enthralled at 125 Cabrini, so we headed back up to 360 Cabrini, the last building on the side of the street facing the river, before you get to Fort Tryon Park.There was a brief snafu, and initially we found ourselves at the wrong open house. We saw a 1 BR that looked like a flophouse. It was so icky that we could barely stand to look at it. We couldn't imagine why someone who wanted to sell their apartment would leave it in such a filthy, cluttered condition. Wouldn't the broker read the riot act to that owner?We finally found the apartment we had really meant to see. The building has separate elevator banks serving the street side and the river side. The \"lobby\" on the river side is the fifth floor, because of the different elevation in back. The agent who showed us around was like Barbra Streisand without the singing voice. A real-estate version of Fanny Brice. Here's the listing:River view from 360 Cabrini BoulevardIncredible Views Of The Hudson River! Come home to this lovely, just renovated Pre-war classic 6 room in a fabulous Art Deco building. This apartment features a large foyer, step down living room three bedrooms, two windowed bathrooms, all rooms have views of trees & the river. Apartment also includes a spacious windowed eat-in kitchen, generous closets, 9 foot ceilings, inlaid hardwood floors and tons of pre-war charm. Cabrini Blvd is located in Hudson Heights, a charming neighborhood with the beauty of the Cloisters and the convenience of the A train.Floorplan at 360 Cabrini BoulevardIf anything, this write-up undersold the apartment. We were floored-especially after being so grossed out by the first unit we saw. It turns out the previous occupant was a long-standing tenant who pre-dated the co-op conversion. After she left, the owner did a gut renovation. It looks like it was built yesterday. The hardwood floors were completely replaced. The appliances still have plastic on them. The bedrooms are all full-size. There are eight closets, including two in the master bedroom.Had I done the renovation myself, there are some things I would have done differently. The bathrooms have pedestal sinks. I hate pedestal sinks, as they leave you with no room to store the kinds of things that belong in a bathroom, are too big for the medecine cabiniet, but that you don't want in plain sight. The owner also demolished the wall separating the dining nook from the living room. I would have left that wall intact.Still, it is one of the better 3 BR layouts I've seen, is essentially brand new, has unobstructed river views, is 5 minutes' walk from the 190th Street \"A\" station, and was listed at $995,000. I wasn't going to find a better deal than that.My girlfriend and I went for a long walk in Fort Tryon Park, then went downtown for coffee in Chelsea. After beating around the bush, I said abruptly, \"I'm making an offer.\" Just two weeks previously, I had no plans to buy anything for at least another year. Now, I was putting myself on the hook for almost $1 million.To be continued...

Note: Dani closed as of January 1, 2008. It's tough to make it in Hudson Square.If a restaurant is good enough, there's practically no such thing as a bad neighborhood in New York. Put differently, there's no neighborhood that diners won't trek to-for the right reasons.But some neighborhoods definitely have their challenges, including Hudson Square. Starting with the fact that many New Yorkers haven't even heard of Hudson Square. Roughly, it's the rectangular patch bounded by Canal Street, Houston Street, Sixth Avenue, and the Hudson River. Some sources quote slightly different borders. Others call it by different names, such as West SoHo, South Village, or best of all, HoHo (it's between Houston and the Holland Tunnel).There's not much to draw pedestrians to Hudson Square. The retail trade is practically nonexistent. Many of the buildings are stubby monoliths, occupying entire square blocks. They aren't a welcoming sight. The neighborhood has long ago shed its warehousing and manufacturing image, embracing the new economy and condo loft conversions. But it has none of the chic of TriBeCa to the south, SoHo to the east, or the Village to the north.Enter Dani, a Sicilian-Italian trattoria at the intersection of Hudson and Charlton Streets in Hudson Square. The opening was well publicized, and the restaurant drew a relatively enthusiastic one-star review from Frank Bruni. But I gather Dani still isn't drawing the traffic it needs, because recently they invited me to dine as their guests. The appetizers at Dani are in two groups: Per La Tavola ($7-19), mostly crudo selections arranged for sharing; and standard antipasti ($8-13). Cured meats ($14; above left) were top-notch, although what really had us hooked was the house made ricotta. From the antipasto list, grilled octopus ($13; above right) with oregano, parsley potatoes and sherry vinegar made a terrific noshing snack to start with.There's a recurring series of daily specials, of which the kitchen sent out three for us to sample:Carbonara con Prosciuto e Uovo di Anitra ($21; Mondays; above left). Spaghettini with house made duck prosciutto, duck egg, black pepper, pecorino. This rich dish was the hit of the evening.Porchetta di Coniglio ($27; Thursdays; above center). Whole roasted rabbit stuffed with rabbit and pork sausage. Also an extremely impressive dish.Polpettone di Pesce Spada ($20; Fridays; above right). Swordfish meatballs, marinara, neopolitan rigatoni. We found the swordfish meatballs a wonderfully clever idea. The dish packed a lot of heat, and I thought the rigatoni were too large.There's a standard list of pastas ($17-19), none of which we tried. The secondi include half-a-dozen composed entrees ($23-27), and several \"simply grilled\" selections ($20-32), which come with a choice of side dish. Seared Sea Scallops and Braised Pork Belly ($27; above left) were a combination I don't recall encountering anywhere else, but I couldn't resist two of my favorites on the same plate. They came with a garnish of cauliflower, capers, pine nuts, and raisins. I particularly loved the scallops, which were perfectly browned on the outside, sweet and moist on the inside.Alas, Grilled Sausage ($20; above right) was a dud, suffering either from over-cooking or not enough moisture.We weren't especially wowed by any of the desserts (all $6). A Frangipane Tart (above left) didn't yield easily enough to the fork. Mint Panna Cotta (above center) didn't generate much excitement. House Made Ricotta Cheesecake (above right) didn't have the creamy consistency of the better cheesecakes.The decor at Dani is post-industrial chic. The brick walls and hardwood floors reflect plenty of sound. Service was solid, though it must be noted the staff knew they were being reviewed.I was delighted to see a wine list with reasonable choices below $40. We chose a Colvecchio, Toscana 2000 Syrah from Castello Banfi ($75), one of several growers that Dani features. We thought it flattered the food extremely well.My girlfriend and I enjoyed most of what we tasted at Dani. The restaurant is operating well above the level of a neighborhood trattoria (a genre of which New York has more than enough entrants). There were a couple of soft spots, but enough highlights to make it well worth a visit to an unfamiliar neighborhood.Dani (333 Hudson Street at Charlton Streeet, Hudson Square)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

So, I had decided that My Apartment-if it existed at all-was likely to be found on Cabrini Boulevard in Hudson Heights. A little background is in order, as even lifelong New Yorkers might not have heard of the neighborhood or the street.Hudson Heights is the area bounded by 181st Street, Broadway, Fort Tryon Park, and the Hudson River. Like a number of Manhattan neighborhoods, the name is an invention of the real estate industry (think TriBeCa, NoLITa).Historically, all of Upper Manhattan north of Harlem-that is, north of 155th Street was called Washington Heights. Brokers created the name \"Hudson Heights\" in around the mid-1990s, to create a separate identity for a neighborhood that was considerably more upscale, and less crime-ridden, than Washington Heights as a whole.At the western edge of Hudson Heights is Cabrini Boulevard, formerly known as Northern Avenue. Some realtors call it the Park Avenue of Washington Heights. Most of the buildings along Cabrini Boulevard between 181st Street and 192nd Street are co-ops or condos. Many of them are built in the art deco style that pervades Washington Heights buildings from the ca. 1930s. The buildings on the western edge of Cabrini Boulevard all have unobstructed panoramic views of the Hudson River, the George Washington Bridge, and the Palisades.At the northern end of Cabrini Boulevard is Fort Tryon Park, located on the site of a 1776 Revolutionary War battle between the 2,400-man Continental Army and 8,000 Hessian troops. (The Hessians won.) In 1917, John D. Rockefeller, Jr., purchased the site and hired Frederick Law Olmsted, Jr., whose father had designed Central Park, to design a similar park for Upper Manhattan. There are 67 acres of winding pathways, with spectacular riverviews. The Cloisters, an outpost of the Metropolitan Museum of Art dedicated to medieval art, is located within the park's boundaries.No one would call Hudson Heights a culinary magnet, but a number of respectable restaurants have appeared in the area. The New Leaf Cafe, in Fort Tryon Park, is listed in the Michelin Guide. Most of the other restaurants are concentrated on either 187th or 181st Street. 181st Street is home to the only Starbucks above Harlem.On the map, Hudson Heights appears to be a long distance from midtown. But due to the unusually wide spacing of the express stops on the A Train, it is actually only a 20-25 minute ride, and seven stops, from 190th Street to Times Square.The uptown \"A\" subway stations themselves, unfortunately, are in deplorable condition. They are safe, but haven't been maintained since they were built in the 1930s. At 190th Street, the platforms are 240 feet below ground level. It is one of the few stations where you take an elevator to reach street level. The entrance to the 190th Street station, at the edge of Fort Tryon Park, was constructed at the same time as the park itself. A massive concrete and stone structure in the Tudor Revival style, it is listed in the National Register of Historic Places.Due to the psychological barrier of being so far uptown and the historically dubious reputation of the surrounding area in Washington Heights, apartments in Hudson Heights have always been priced well below comparable apartments downtown.When I entered my criteria-a true 3 BR apartment $1 million in a safe Manhattan neighborhood near the subway-into various real estate search engines, Cabrini Boulevard was what kept coming back.To be continued...

My girlfriend and I had dinner at Daniel last Saturday night, the first visit for both of us. Daniel (pronounced \"dahn-YELL\") is one of three French restaurants carrying the top honor of four stars from The New York Times. It is also the only remaining four-star restaurant not yet reviewed by Frank Bruni, the current critic.The only clue to what Bruni might think of Daniel came in a December 2004 Diner's Journal piece about one of chef Daniel Boulud's other restaurants, Cafe Boulud:I dropped by Cafe Boulud the other night. I went because I had recently visited the chef Daniel Boulud's other two Manhattan restaurants but not this one, which happens to be many of my acquaintances' hands-down favorite of the three. I can see why. It doesn't have the starched self-consciousness of Daniel or the cheeky swagger of DB Bistro Moderne. The reference to \"starched self-consciousness\" is entirely typical of Bruni, and suggests he doesn't find Daniel as exciting as his predecessors did. Given his many other comments about similar restaurants, it also suggests that he simply doesn't enjoy this style of dining.We found nothing starchy about Daniel, except for whatever the laundry put in the table cloths. We found it polished, professional, and nearly perfect. It is perhaps the most \"old school\" of the three four-star French restaurants, which may explain Bruni's hostility to it, and may also explain why Daniel received just two Michelin stars, while Le Bernardin and Jean Georges received three.I've got the time only for a whirlwind tour of our meal at Daniel. We started with a tray of petits-fours (above, right). We continued with the six-course tasting menu ($155) with wine pairings ($75). There were two choices for each course. We agreed on the first: Foie Gras Terrine (above, left), which was excellent, although not as special as the Foie Gras Brule we so much enjoyed at Jean Georges. But foie gras can't really be screwed up. We order the foie gras whenever a tasting menu offers it (which they usually do), and we're seldom disappointed.For me, next up was the Yuzu Marinated Snapper (above, right), which I found far too bland-the only dud of the evening. My girlfriend chose the Crab Salad, of which I had a taste. This was delightful, and put the marinated snapper to shame. At the risk of being boring, I've nothing to say about Wild Mushroom Ravioli (above, left), except again that it was excellent. So was Dover Sole, which we attacked so quickly that I forgot to photograph it.Last among the savory courses was the Due of Dry-Aged Beef (above,right). The \"duo\" is ribeye and short rib. It's evidently one of Chef Boulud's signature items, as it's always on the menu. I always say that even a four-star restaurant can't do steak like a good classic steakhouse, but this was one of the better \"fine dining\" renditions of steak that I've had. We diverged again for the desserts; mine is the one on the left, hers the one on the right. We were feeling plenty festive by this point, and I'm afraid the desserts didn't make much of an impression. You can see the photos and imagine them for yourself.A wonderful tray of sweets and a bowl of warm sugar puffs (both pictured at right) concluded our meal on a high note.I have not noted the wines, but this was one of the better pairings we've had, both as to the quality and the progression from one pour to the next.Throughout the evening, we were thoroughly impressed with the service. It was never pompous or obsequious, simply correct in every possible way.Daniel has a larger dining room than the other four-star restaurants, and there is a very large serving brigade. But they move through the room quietly and efficiently, never noticeable except when they should be.The room won't be to all tastes. We found it a bit over-the-hill, although we were impressed with the custom-designed bone china.Except in Frank Bruni's mind, there is nothing wrong-or at least, there shouldn't be-with doing classic things well. We won't visit Daniel every week, or even every year. When we are in the mood for that special kind of elegance, it's wonderful to know that it's there.Daniel (60 E. 65th Street west of Park Avenue, Upper East Side)Food: ****Service: ****Ambiance: ***½Overall: ****

My wife took me to Daniel for my birthday a couple of weeks ago. It was definitely a great experience, but I didn't think it was on the top of the ones we have had. Beautiful creations on the plate, but I felt they were missing something else. The best of them was my entrée, the Colorado Lamb saddle, perfectly executed (I always expect the amuse bouche or appetizer to be outstanding, but in Daniel that was not the case). Service was excellent during all the dinner, I agree. Beautiful Dining Room and Bar area.

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to the restaurant, now renamed \"Bouley Upstairs.\" Upstairs at Bouley Bakery is the casual cousin to David Bouley's eponymous Michelin two-star restaurant. These days, it's pretty common for high-end luxury restaurants to have an informal companion establishment serving less expensive fare. Jean Georges, The Modern, Country, and Gordon Ramsay all have versions of it (though the details vary). Usually, they are located in the same building. Upstairs is across the street. Unlike the luxurious mother ship, Upstairs doesn't take reservations. Everything about it screams informality. I've been hearing great things about Upstairs lately, and as I missed lunch at work today, I decided to drop in. At 6:15 p.m. on a weeknight, Upstairs is actually rather pleasant. There were only about five people there when I arrived, and it was still less than half full when I left. That's the best way to experience Bouley Upstairs. On weekends, the noise is deafening, and the servers need the agility of Romanian gymnasts to reach the tightly-packed tables. My last visit, on a Saturday evening, was so unpleasant that I really didn't want to return. The food is great, but at some point the surroundings are just too oppresive to enjoy it. Visiting early on a weeknight changed the whole experience. To start, I ordered the homemade gnocchi with gorgonzola in a cherry tomato sauce ($12). I was impressed with the pillowy softness of the gnocchi. It wasn't at all chewy, as gnocchi tends to be when a less assured kitchen is preparing it. Roast chicken ($15) came in a parsley root puree with grilled fava beans and a taragon sauce. I seldom order chicken in restaurants, but I wanted to see what Bouley's team would do with such a humble meat. It was everything you could ask, remarkably tender and full of flavor. The bread service is terrific, as you'd expect from a restaurant above a bakery. There are many three and four-star restaurants not serving bread as good as this (e.g., Jean Georges). The staff are not as attentive as they should be. Even with the restaurant more than half empty, they don't notice when your water glass needs filling, when your plate needs clearing, and so forth. The knife that I used to spread butter was left on my table for the appetizer course, and when I asked for a clean one, the server seemed flustered, as if it were an unusual request. David Bouley has announced that the size of the restaurant will soon double. His Bouley flagship restaurant will move into the Mohawk Building at the other end of the block; the bakery will move into the space the restaurant is vacating; and Upstairs will expand into the downstairs space now occupied by the bakery. Got that? Perhaps, once it has grown, Upstairs won't feel quite as cramped as it does today. In its current configuration, nothing would persuade me to dine there on a weekend. But on a quiet weeknight, I can heartily recommend it. The food is first-class, and it comes at a remarkably low price. I mean, there are probably diners that charge $15 for their roast chicken without doing it half as well.

So I had decided to buy. What was I looking for?A \"true\" 3-bedroom apartment...In Manhattan...In good condition...Reasonably convenient to mass transit...In a neighborhood that won't scare my 12-year-old son from Florida, or my 70-year-old mom from Michigan...For less than $1 millionIn most cities, those conditions could be met with money to spare. In Manhattan, I was looking for a needle in a haystack.Luckily, the search is considerably easier than the last time I went house-hunting, which was in the 1990s. Back then, you had to put yourself in a realtor's hands. What you saw was totally dependent on what they chose to show you. You had no idea if you were seeing the best properties, or merely what they wanted to \"push.\" And it was nearly impossible to get a feel for a property without actually going to see it, so the search took up a lot of time.Today, most of the major realtors advertise with The New York Times. Just go to the Times real estate page, and enter your search criteria (neighborhood, maximum price, number of bedrooms). The listings, too, are a lot more informative than they used to be. Besides the broker's narrative description, you can usually bring up a floorplan, photos of the property, demographic information about the area, maintenance costs, and a lot more. You quickly find out whether what you're looking for is realistic.Obviously the listings are marketing, and can't always be trusted. I mentioned that one of my requirements was a \"true\" 3-bedroom apartment. You might be wondering, what would a \"false\" one be? Well, in many cases what's marketed as a 3-bedroom isn't really. Perhaps the third \"bedroom\" is only a nook, which would require construction of a wall to become a real bedroom. Or perhaps it's just a \"maid's room,\" which means it's only about half the size of a conventional bedroom.Floorplan at 141 Attorney Street, #2CDThe listings also can't give you a feel for the neighborhood. I saw a great listing for an apartment on Attorney Street on the Lower East Side that appeared to meet my criteria. That was before I actually went and looked at it. The Lower East Side may be gentrifying, but Attorney Street has a long way to go. Also, the building had a bar on the ground floor, and the unit for sale was on the second floor. On weekends, you can forget about getting any sleep.After a while, you get accustomed to the standard euphemisms that realtors use to describe undesirable features. For instance, \"Bring your decorator\" means that the existing decor sucks. \"Junior 3-bedroom\" or \"Convertible 3-bedroom\" means that the third bedroom is less than what it should be.Closets are a problem in many Manhattan apartments. Apartments with just one small closet in the master bedroom are quite common. You wonder: would any architect actually believe that two people's clothes could fit here?Anyhow, I quickly figured out that My Apartment did not exist in Manhattan below Central Park. Listings that initially appeared to meet my criteria always had something wrong with them. Otherwise, they would be more than $1 million.Several listings in Harlem were compelling enough that I actually went uptown to look at them. Harlem is a beehive of upscale development. In 10 years, it could very easily be what Chelsea is today. But it isn't yet. Even where the apartments themselves are compelling, I just can't imagine bringing my 12-year-old son from Florida, or my 70-year-old mom from Michigan, to Harlem. It's a lot better than it used to be, but you still need a lot of faith to live in Harlem.One neighborhood consistently returned listings that met my criteria: Hudson Heights, and specifically, Cabrini Boulevard.To be continued...

I'm buying a co-op. Over the next few months, I hope to chronicle the experience of buying a home in the New York market.I live in a large studio apartment in Lower Manhattan. It actually looks like a 1 BR, as it has a \"home office\" (with a door that shuts) that I use as a bedroom. Legally, it isn't a bedroom, because it has no windows. But as the leasing agent put it when I rented the place in 1999, \"They're not going to bang down your door in the middle of the night to see where you're sleeping.\"A windowless bedroom isn't such a bad thing. It is very quiet, and if you ever want to get sleep at an odd hour, the sunlight will never get in the way. It also means that if you oversleep, there's no visual clue to whether it's daytime or nighttime.Lower Manhattan has been kind to me. With several subway lines within a few blocks of my apartment, I can be almost anywhere south of Central Park in under a half-hour. Amenities have improved considerably, as the Financial District continues its transition to a 24×7 neighborhood. For the amount of space I have, the rent has been reasonable by Manhattan standards, and it was quite good for the first few years after 9/11.Despite all of that, I always considered this apartment a stepping stone to something larger that I would own, rather than rent. I didn't expect to make that step for another couple of years. Then came the news that my apartment building is going condo, and it got me thinking.The \"insider price\" for my 843 sq. ft. studio is $740,000. If you don't live in New York, or haven't researched the market, it will be hard to believe that that's a good price. But it really is. For a unit that size, in good condition, in a doorman building near the subway, in a nice Manhattan neighborhood, you aren't going to do much better. In many neighborhoods, you would pay a lot more.However, buying a condo in Manhattan is a bit like buying a car: the instant you drive it off the lot, you've lost at least 10% of the value. For the car, it's because of depreciation. For the condo, it's because of steep closing costs on both sides of the transaction. Unlike a car, the condo eventually recoups that lost value. But unless the market is super-heated (which it isn't right now), you have to hold on a few years. Practically every block downtown has at least one condo conversion, so I suspect that high inventory will put a damper on price appreciation.I didn't have to buy my apartment if I wanted to stay there. The condo conversion has a \"no eviction\" clause, which basically means I can live there forever, as long as I'm willing to pay market rent. The law also prohibits \"unconscionable\" rent increases, although it does permit very steep increases that are at the high end of \"conscionable.\"With the very likely prospect of yet another rent increase this summer (when my lease is up), and very possibly a new and less friendly landlord (if I decline to buy the unit, and the sponsor sells it to another investor), I thought it was time to investigate my prospects elsewhere.To be continued...

This week, Frankie Fiveangels made a winner of both Eater and NYJ, awarding the predicted two stars to Nish. Bruni seemed to love the food-indeed, the tone was more enthusiastic than a few of his three-star reviews have been.The review trotted out more of Bruni's trademark assault on traditional fine dining:To trace the changes in upscale restaurants over the last few decades, you can survey the losers: Lutèce and white linens; servers in tuxedos and diners in ties. You can salute the winners: Nobu and filament bulbs; mix-and-match menus and polyglot cuisines.Or you can look at a place that doesn't quite fall into either category, a survivor that hasn't thrived, now relaxing its guard to restore its vigor. It's called March, or at least it was for 16 years, until the first week of January, when it was reborn as Nish, which is really March after a stint in whatever the opposite of finishing school would be.It's March minus some of the manners and mannerisms, March in (nicely pressed) jeans. It's also an interesting answer to challenges that currently face fine-dining establishments. How do you present a sophisticated experience in an accessible way? In a dressed-down era, what still qualifies as a relished indulgence, and what's just a prissy vestige of bygone days?Do those challenges really exist? I mean, the restaurant business is challenging in general, but is there any good reason to single out fine dining in particular? I mean, look at the successful high-end restaurants that have opened in just the last few years: Per Se, Masa, Asiate, Country, Del Posto, The Modern, Cru, Gordon Ramsay. To those, add a much longer list of those that have been open five, ten, fifteen or more years, and are still thriving: for starters, Jean Georges, Le Bernardin, Daniel, Bouley, Oceana, La Grenouille, Chanterelle, Le Perigord, L'Impero.The excerpt above is full of Frank's trademark phrases, betraying his hostility to traditional luxury restaurants, despite the fact that many of them are still doing land-office business: \"white linens\"; \"mannerisms\" (like what?); \"accessible\" (suggesting that many restaurants are not); \"prissy\" (the cousin of \"fussy,\" one of his favourite words).Yes indeed, Lutèce has closed. But so has the Second Avenue Deli. If you are determined to manufacture a story, you can cherry-pick whatever facts seem to support your theory, and ignore those which do not. It is undeniably true that high-end classic French restaurants in the Lutèce mold have become scarce. But fine dining itself has not. In a \"dressed-down\" era, sometimes people still do want to dress up.To round out the week, we present the running scorecard. Eater and NYJ both win our two-star bets on Nish at 4-1 odds.

***CONTENT
Degustation is the newest restaurant in Jack & Grace Lamb's East Village mini-empire, anchored by the Michelin-starred sushi emporium, Jewel Bako. The two restaurants are located at adjacent storefronts, and they are physically connected via a narrow passageway. But they couldn't be more unalike.The menu at Degustation is loosely reminiscent of a tapas bar, although many of the dishes are well adrift from their Spanish moorings. Small plates range from $4-15, and the server suggests that three or four is enough for a meal. There's also a tasting menu for $50, offering five savory courses plus dessert, and we went that route. (Click on the thumbnail at right for a full-size image of the menu.) Slow poached egg, rice cracker crusted asparagus (left); Scottish langoustine (right)The first course was arguably the best: a slow-poached egg with Serrano ham in a cheese foam, with rice cracker crusted asparagus. We were oohing and ahhing at the progression of flavors. Up next, a Scottish langoustine (shown on the menu as Cigalas) was split and cooked on the plancha. Nothing more was done with it, and it was gone after a couple of bites. Grilled Spanish Mackerel (left); Grilled Quail (right)Grilled Spanish Mackerel on a bed of apples had a crunchy crust, but was perfectly moist and tender inside. Grilled quail with pistachios and endive was delightful, yielding more meat than I expected from such a tiny bird. Grilled Ribeye (left); Apple Tart (right)For the last savory course, grilled ribeye was once again topped with foam, a needless repetition. Not much was done to the meat, but it was top-quality beef and perfectly prepared. The dessert, an apple tart, was not especially memorable.The restaurant is tiny, with just 19 seats at a rectangular bar that \"wraps around\" the kitchen. Three chefs and three servers struggle a bit to avoid tripping over each other, but most of what they produce is delightful. We were seated right next to the finishing station, and we received a miniature culinary education while watching many of the dishes receive their finishing touches.Most of the clientele are couples, as the bar line-up doesn't really work for larger parties. Degustation is sometimes listed as a romantic restaurant, but I wouldn't really think of it that way, unless you're plotting a foursome, as the next couple is only a few inches away.Not long after Degustation opened, Frank Bruni awarded two stars in the New York Times, in a double-review that conferred just one star on its older sister restaurant, Jewel Bako. There's other evidence that perhaps Jewel Bako is no longer the main attraction. While we were there, we saw servers carrying plates out of the bar area. It turns out that Jewel Bako takes Degustation's overflow.We had a terrific time at Degustation. At $50 for five courses plus dessert, the tasting menu has to be reckoned one of the better deals in town.Degustation (239 E. 5th St. west of Second Avenue, East Village)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: **

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Nish, the casual makeover of the former three-star March. Eater's official odds are as follows (√√ denotes the Eater bet):Zero Stars: 5-1 One Star: 8-3 Two Stars: 4-1 √√Three Stars: 90-1 Four Stars: 15,000-1The Skinny: For the first time in a while, almost any outcome is possible (except for four stars). March was a three-star restaurant. The last time he was there, Bruni loved the food, but he found the servers' cult-like reverence for chef Wayne Nish a little off-putting. He also thought that its \"dowager refinement\" was overdue for a makeover - precisely as Nish has now done. Bruni's track record is that he actually likes restaurants better when they're more casual. If the food is as good as Steve Cuozzo says, Nish could be headed for the trifecta.But Cuozzo also found irritating service glitches, and if Bruni found the same, he's likely to blow the whistle and march off a one-star penalty. I also suspect the cult-of-the-chef mentality-something Bruni seldom finds endearing-isn't totally gone. Indeed, given the name change, that factor could be even more prominent than before. If Bruni isn't as wowed by the food as Cuozzo, then there's no telling how low we could go.The Bet: Eater-betting against his own odds-is taking the two-star action. We think that the chances of a three-star payoff are a whole lot better than Eater says, making the 90-1 odds awfully tempting. But we think the chances for a singleton are very real too, so we will compromise in the middle, and bet on two stars.

The March 6th Village Voice carried an interview with Frank Bruni, in which he was asked what he would choose to eat for his last meal. His choices should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the Times restaurant critic's predilections: a porterhouse steak, toro-stuffed maki rolls like the ones they serve at Masa; and \"some buttery taglierini with heart-of-season white truffles shaved over it. Just like you'd get in the Piedmont region of Italy, which is one of my favorite areas in the world for eating.\"Steak? Check. Sushi? Check. Italian food? Check. Those are the foods Frank loves.But another phrase in the interview caught my eye: \"my final meal wouldn't be a fussy labor of extraordinary technique.\"Frank uses that word \"fussy\" a lot. I've found the word, in its various forms, in at least a dozen of his restaurant reviews. (He has also used it in articles about other subjects.) I thought this was a little remarkable, because \"fussy\" isn't all that common a word.\"Fussy\" is never a compliment: no one aspires to be \"fussy.\" And Bruni virtually always uses it to describe high-end luxury dining, a niche of the restaurant industry for which he has very little use. I don't think it's a coincidence that Bruni associates \"extraordinary technique\" with \"fussy labor.\" Perhaps there is extraordinary technique that Bruni doesn't consider fussy, but judging from his reviews you'd be hard pressed to identify it. Fussy, starchy, stuffy, effete, highfalutin' - those are the words Frank usually uses for fine food presented in luxurious surroundings.For those who wish to keep track, here are all the Bruni uses of fussy (and its variants) in restaurant reviews:Review of Anthos (16 May 2007):And with Ms. Arpaia he opened Anthos, the restaurant you might get if you triangulated between Onera and Dona. It has the former's resoundingly Greek soul. It has the latter's fussy tics and more sophisticated wine list, with sommeliers who can guide you through the impressive advances of Greek winemaking.Review of Momofuku Ssam Bar (21 February 2007):By bringing sophisticated, inventive cooking and a few high-end grace notes to a setting that discourages even the slightest sense of ceremony, Ssam Bar answers the desires of a generation of savvy, adventurous diners with little appetite for starchy rituals and stratospheric prices.They want great food, but they want it to feel more accessible, less effete. They'll gladly take some style along with it, but not if the tax is too punishing. And that's what they get at Ssam Bar, sleek, softly lighted and decidedly unfussy.Double-review of Bar Room at The Modern and Eleven Madison Park (10 Jan 2007):The Modern is divided into a fussy dining room and a more freewheeling bar area, where the food is less expensive, though not really and truly cheap.Review of Freemans (20 September 2006):[The server] said we needed to give our whole order at once, so our meal could be properly paced and we could have \"a much more pleasant experience.\" Of course that prohibition had nothing to do with our enjoyment and everything to do with the kitchen's convenience. It also had no place in a restaurant as studiously unfussy as Freemans, but it exemplified the real attitude here.Review of A Voce (10 May 2006):It was just a matter of time before the right financial backers beckoned and Mr. Carmellini struck out on his own. The only real question was what shape that venture would take.Would it be French and somewhat fussy? Mr. Carmellini had as much of that as of anything else in his background. Before Cafe Boulud, he worked at Lespinasse and Le Cirque.Review of Del Posto (1 March 2006):The ceremony surrounding main courses can indeed be fussy, with glistening slabs of flesh exhibited in their cooking vessels for adoration before being taken away and plated.Diner's Journal write-up of BLT Prime (24 June 2005):The L and T mean Laurent Tourondel, whose manifest destiny is to attach his monogram to a great many B's. The B means bistro, which none of the BLT restaurants really are. The word, or rather letter, serves to signal that an unfussy format accompanies Mr. Tourondel's very fine food.Review of Cookshop (30 November 2005):The food is amply portioned, fairly priced and completely sophisticated but not remotely fussy.Critic's Notebook, \"The Contemporary Dining Scene, Est. 1985\" (12 October 2005)About the same time [1985], a graduate of hotel and restaurant management school named Drew Nieporent and an emerging chef named David Bouley began their own experiment. Their goal was to recast the first-rate, fussy, uptown French restaurant as an affordable, approachable refuge with a downtown address, wines from California as well as France, and prices within reach of people who were not rich.Review of Cafe Gray (15 December 2004):The ambience doesn't really suit the food, much of which is more ambitious and fussier than cafe or brasserie fare.Review of En Japanese Brasserie (24 November 2004):Even En's identification as a Japanese brasserie suggests a have-it-all, connect-the-dots sensibility: it wants both the healthful allure of an ethnic cuisine in continued ascendance and the timeless appeal of an unfussy, teeming environment in which you can pass many a merry hour with copious drink as well as food.Diner's Journal write-up of The View (29 October 2004)Both were more successful than an oyster and clam plate and a goat cheese terrine, the fussy presentations of which were undercut by the humdrum reality of how they tasted.Review of Mas (7 July 2004)Mas is the kind of earnest, tasteful restaurant that this city -- that any city -- can always use. It nicely splits the difference between fussy and unfussy.The review of Mas, which contains his first known use of the word after becoming chief restaurant critic, is also the only time that he used the word \"fussy\" while making a compliment.

Barbès

***CONTENT
Barbès is a comfortable French-Moroccan restaurant in Murray Hill, named for a Paris neighborhood known for its North African immigrant population. It is less than a block from the Pierpont Morgan Library. Indeed, it was an evening concert at the PML that drew my friend and me to a pre-show dinner at Barbès. Tomate Montrachet (left); Couscous Royale (right)I started with the Tomate Montrachet ($9.75), a warm tomato and goat cheese salad in a red wine vinaigrette. It was competently done, if rather dull. For the main course, I had the Couscous Royale ($20.75), which comes studded with lamb, chicken, and Merguez sausage. Frank Bruni raved about this dish in his one-star review, but I found it a bit dry. It came out rather quickly, so clearly all the ingredients were prepped in advance, and perhaps had simmered a bit too long.My friend ordered two appetizers, which I didn't photograph, but I noted that either one of them could have been an entree in many restaurants. She particularly enjoyed the Confit de Canard, which Frank Bruni also liked. After the concert, we came back for dessert. I was rather lax in my note-taking, but I believe this was the Warm Apple Tart ($7), which was wonderful: the best thing I had all evening.The dining room was considerably busier later on, but on both visits the service was fast and attentive. Tables are rather closely spaced in the 50-seat dining room, and the sound track was a little too loud for our taste.Portions are generous and prices moderate, with appetizers $7.75-12.75, and entrees $17.75-26.75. There are an ample number of reasonably priced wines, including the Crozes-Hermitage we had for around $35.The food is uneven, but if you have a craving for Moroccan food, there isn't a lot of competition. For that, and for being a decent sensibly-priced option in its neighborhood, Barbès wins a star.Barbès (21 East 36th Street near Madison Avenue, Murray Hill)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

The Struggle for Survival at Colors

***CONTENT
An article in yesterday's Times chronicles the struggle for survival at Colors, the year-old restaurant co-op founded by former Windows on the World employees. The article notes, \"visits to Colors on several Saturday nights, which should be the busiest nights for most restaurants, show there is rarely a wait for a table. Getting a last-minute reservation is almost never a problem.\"A year ago, I rated Colors at one star. I was probably too generous. The colleagues I dined with, who are usually pleased with my recommendations, said it was the only bad suggestion I had ever given them. Other critics were apparently underwhelmed. As far as I recall, Colors didn't receive a rated review from any of the mainstream media, an omission I take as an act of kindness.To stay afloat, Colors has reduced staff, lowered the minimum wage, and kept the lid on overtime. The concept has also changed somewhat. The white tablecloths are gone, and there is no entree priced above $25. The same New York Strip that was $33 when we visited, is now $24. Monday nights are BYO.The staff remain perplexed by Colors' failure to catch on:Figuring out the reasons for the restaurant's troubles since the opening is difficult. It could be a combination of factors - prices, the location, competition, or merely the whims of restaurant patrons. The menu is deliberately international, with dishes including a Japanese-inspired bento box and South American ceviches, some based on workers' family recipes.Frankly, I still think that the mongrel menu is the culprit. When you are offering such a wide variety of dishes with no thematic connection, it's unlikely that any of them will be truly great. However, at its new gentler price level, perhaps Colors deserves a spot on my second-chance list.

His Frankness didn't let us down this week, awarding two stars to Sfoglia, as we expected. Eater made the very reasonable one-star bet, based on what the restaurant most probably deserves. But we strongly suspected that a small, casual, family-run Italian joint in an out-of-the-way neighborhood would float Frank's boat. And so it did.We win our $1 bet at 6-1 odds, while Eater loses $1.

Otto (pronounced \"Oh-Toe\") is the most casual of the Mario Batali-Joseph Bastianich series of restaurants. There is a large bar area (the Enoteca) that serves wine and bar food, and a dining area with table seating.The name of the website (ottopizzeria.com) indicates the restaurant's theme. The menu is dominated by eighteen kinds of pizza ($7-15), both \"classics\" and house creations. Antipasti include a wide variety of cheese, crudo, and salads. Only six pastas are offered (all $9). The place is family-friendly, and I saw many tables with children. As I wasn't very hungry, I ordered only the Penne con Noci e Zucca, with hazelnuts, butternut squash, and smoked ricotta. It was prepared with a light touch, with the flavors pleasurably balanced.Service was slow, although at 4:30 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon there was no good reason for it. After I sat down, there was a long pause before anyone came to my table; another long pause before water came; another before bread. The pasta also took its sweet time to arrive. The only thing the staff did quickly was to deposit a bill after I was finished.The bread service consisted of two slices of baked Italian bread wrapped in wax paper, and bread sticks still in their commercial wrapper. I think a server was supposed to pour some olive oil onto a plate for dipping, but none arrived.Otto must have the most serious wine program of any pizzeria. The wine list is substantial, and there are regular wine tasting classes on offer. I have some trouble imagining who orders the $375 Barolo to go with their $14 pizza. Indeed, quite a bit of the wine list seemed over-priced in relation to the menu, but who am I to question Mario Batali?A review based on one dish can only be provisional, but Otto is clearly a cut above most pizzerias, and the food prices are quite reasonable. With the money you save, you can do some serious supping on the wine list.Otto (1 Fifth Avenue, entrance on E. 8th Street, Greenwich Village)Food: *Service: slowAmbiance: *Overall: *

I love Otto. I was there tonight. Great food, even better food, and a hopping scene with killer music. Sure its loud and crowded on the weekends, what Cool place isn't?I always eat at the bar and the service is Amazing! I love those bartenders....Thats the best way to eat there.As far as a $375 Barolo with a $14 Pizza, isn't that what decadance is all about? If you can afford the wine, but are choosing to eat and spend your night at Otto, Thats what I call Good Taste!

I love Otto as well. I have eaten there many times at the bar and at the table. I never had a problem with the service, the food is excellent and the gelato is superb. The atmosphere is interesting because it combines the best of Italy with the best of the U.S. This is what Mario Batali is great at. On a couple of occasions I had a few hours to kill and sat in Otto with a glass of wine and a dish of pasta. I felt free to sit as long as I wished both at the bar and at the table. One time, along with an assortment of interesting adults at the bar, there was a little boy sitting at the end doing his homework and eating a dish of gelato. The bar tender was pleasant and professional. I could've sat there all day just enjoying the company and the good food and wine.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Sfoglia, an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side. Eater's official odds are as follows:Zero Stars: 4-1 One Star: 3-1Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 400-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Folks, this is a tough one. For the second week in a row, we are torn between one and two stars.Several times, Bruni has given two stars to small Italian restaurants. He clearly has a soft spot for the genre. He also has a soft spot for restaurants in neighborhoods where the fine-dining options are scarce, which is precisely the case at Lexington & 92nd. Like last week, this is a restaurant that opened quite a while ago. He doesn't have to review it; he's choosing to review it, and that usually means he has Something Important to say. Bruni's \"choose to\" reviews have been, more often than not, two stars.But Bruni already wrote a blog entry about Sfoglia over seven months ago, shortly after Adam Platt's rave review in New York. He found \"a mix of delights and disappointments,\" along with \"brusqueness and haughtiness.\" Indeed, I found similar glitches when I reviewed Sfoglia in September. Bruni noted that restaurants sometimes flounder when they can't handle the sudden influx of curious diners after a favorable review comes out.It is rare that a restaurant can overcome a mediocre first impression. But the fact that Bruni is choosing to review it now almost certainly suggests that things have improved - otherwise, why bother? Has Sfoglia improved enough to get over the two-star hump?The Bet: Adam Platt awarded three stars to Sfoglia. Bruni's ratings and Platt's have tracked fairly closely, and as far as I recall, they have never been more than one star apart. We are therefore, for the second week in a row, going out on a limb, and betting (against the Eater odds) that Sfoglia will receive two stars from Frank Bruni.

The outdoor garden at a quieter moment than we experienced itWhen Paradou opened in mid-2001, the Meatpacking District had not yet completed its metamorphosis from a seedy industrial district that was home to more prostitutes than restaurants, into the bastion of high-concept tourist dining that it has now become. It's hard to name many Meatpacking restaurants that can be seriously recommended chiefly for their food. Paradou, which means \"paradise,\" is one of the few.That's not to say that Paradou hasn't succumbed somewhat to the spirit of the neighborhood. When Eric Asimov of the Times reviewed it in January 2002, it was just a tiny Provençal bistro serving wine and sandwiches, with scarcely more than about half-a-dozen tables. It now has a large outdoor garden that's enclosed during the winter, turning Paradou into a full-size restaurant. That garden might be pleasant for al fresco dining in the summer, but it entirely lacks the charm of the intimate front room. Tables are scrunched together, and on a Saturday night the space got noisy indeed.Beet Tarte TatinSince the early reviews, Paradou has also added a new chef, Kfir Ben-Ari, who has expanded the offerings considerably. The menu changes seasonally, and prices are in a fairly wide range. Appetizers are $7 (soup du jour) to $30 (caviar). Entrees are $19 (chicken) to $76 (a thick-cut veal chop and a whole lobster for two). Side dishes are $6, desserts $6-9. There's a serious cheese program, presented on a separate menu, which we didn't sample.I started with the Beet Tarte Tatin, which validated my new addiction to beet appetizers. As usual, beets were paired with goat cheese, this time atop a puff pastry, with walnuts and other garnishes hovering near the edge of the plate. My girlfriend had the French Onion Soup, which I didn't try, but it looked hearty enough, and she seemed pleased.Poisson du JourMonkfish was the Poisson du Jour, here served on a bed of black beans and topped with carrots. I found the fish just slightly chewy, but the combination as a whole worked well. My girlfriend, who was in a steak mood, was happy with the Entrecôte with Potato Gratin.The kitchen managed to keep things moving well despite the Saturday night crowds. Servers and runners were attentive, but seemed a bit rushed, and several times dropped things (nothing important) on the floor, like silverware and menus.In an unusual arrangement, Paradou offers a considerable number of wines by the quarter or half-liter, in addition to a larger selection by the bottle, with a quarter-liter being good for about two glasses. In the Times, Eric Asimov found this format inconvenient, but the quarter-liter prices seem more than fair. We ordered a full bottle, which unfortunately didn't please us, but I don't hang that on the restaurant.Paradou has worked hard to remain relevant in a neighborhood dominated by fancier neighbors. On Saturday mornings, there are cooking lessons ($40) for children under 5 (Times story here). The weekend brunch special ($25) includes \"all you can drink\" Belinis, Mimosas, and Kir Royales. A Monday to Thursday weeknight special from 6:00-7:30 p.m. ($20.07) offers a plate of cheese, pate and salumi with a glass of red or white wine.I wouldn't say we were wowed by anyting we had at Paradou, but I suspect the restaurant is a lot more pleasant on weeknights, when it isn't overrun by the Meatpacking Crowd. The hearty Provençal fare may not be remarkable, but it deserves to be taken seriously, in a neighborhood where so little else can be.Paradou (8 Little West 12th Street between Ninth Avenue and Washington Street, Meatpacking District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: no stars for the garden in wintertimeOverall: *

***CONTENT
It's easy to get the idea that all SoHo restaurants are cynical ploys to separate gullible diners from their hard-won cash. That was Frank Bruni's take when he first visited Lure Fishbar in September 2004, not long after it opened. He awarded one star in a lukewarm January 2005 review, setting a new indoor record for most nautical puns per column inch. But in New York, Hal Rubenstein was \"Hooked,\" and the Post's Steve Cuozzo wrote, \"This is serious seafood.\"The restaurant was nearly shipwrecked in January 2006, when a fire engulfed the Prada store that occupies the same building. Most of the expensive teak wood was saved, but it still took four months for the interior to be restored. Version 2.0 features a new sushi bar and a remodeled lounge area.Lure Fishbar's owners, John McDonald and Josh Pickard, also own Lever House in midtown, which I visited last year. (I wasn't wowed.) The two restaurants share a similar design idea, but the nautical theme that Lever House only hints at has reached full bloom here, in a subterranean dining room fully transformed into a luxury cruise ship. All of this might seem like a gimmick, but it turns out the food is terrific.Reservations at Lure Fishbar seem to be readily available any night of the week on OpenTable, so I hadn't expected it to be quite so crowded. I arrived at about 6:45 p.m. to find a buzzing bar scene. Neither a seat nor any of the bartenders' attention were to be had. I did finally manage to order a cocktail, but it was so unpleasant (the service, not the drink) that I would not order another. The host had no intention of seating me in the dining room before my friend arrived, so I was left with nothing to do but pace the room. Fortunately, the service got much better after my friend arrived, and we were seated.As you might guess, the hard wood surfaces reflect sound, and on a Friday night there's plenty of it. This is not the place for a heart-to-heart chat, and I found myself cupping my ear to hear my friend speak. But for food this good, I'm willing to put up with the inconvenience.We started with the Bloody Mary Royale ($14) to drink. A standard large Bloody Mary is garnished with a piece of shrimp and a stick of olives. It comes with a shot glass on the side, with more Bloody Mary and an oyster shooter. This must be one of the cleverest drinks in town, and a bargain too, considering that some restaurants have already surpassed the $15 barrier for conventional mixed drinks. (Lure's other house cocktails are $11.)The menu is a bit overwhelming, with an extensive raw bar, sushi and sashimi, traditional appetizers, entrees, and side dishes. It is hard to know how much to order. My friend Kelly knew she wanted oysters, scallops, and the salmon tartare; she left the rest up to me. We gave our server a large order, and left the sequencing up to the kitchen.Four pcs. raw scallops (top left); yellowtail jalapeno roll (center); lobster tempura roll (bottom)First to come out was a plate of four raw scallops ($3.50 ea.), the yellowtail jalapeno roll ($16), and the lobster tempura roll ($16). All were fresh and beautifully presented, with the jalapeno roll our favorite.Salmon Tartare / Creamy Horseradish / Salmon Roe / DillThe chef must be proud of the Salmon Tartare ($16), since it is shown prominently on the restaurant website. That pride is justified, as this is one of the best raw fish dishes I've had. The only flaw is that the three small pieces of melba toast were insufficient, so we just dug in with our forks: we weren't going to let any of this go to waste.Medium Shellfish Platter (6 oysters, 4 shrimp, 4 clams, 4 stone crab claws, seafood salad)Three shellfish platters are offered, with the medium platter ($49) being an ample portion for two. There is not much preparation involved here. It comes down to the freshness of the ingredients, and in that respect we could find no fault.For a restaurant this busy, service was remarkably good. The timing of the courses was just right. Used plates and silverware were promptly cleared and replaced. We were given extra plates for the detritus of our shellfish, which were taken away when full. At the end of our meal, we received warm towels to wash our hands. These are small points, but often overlooked.I was also impressed with the warm, bread rolls and the soft butter that came with them.Lure Fishbar is clearly the product of a modern era in which restaurants feel they need eye-popping decor to get noticed. But despite the bar scene and the SoHo crowds, the fresh seafood here is worth the voyage.Lure Fishbar (142 Mercer Street at Prince Street, SoHo)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Although a little pricey for its size, the burger is definitely no joke. It is tough to pull the trigger and pass up on seafood at a fishbar, but splitting it and another entree is well worth it (lobster roll/burger surf and turf?)

Note: Mai House appears now to be closed. There has been no official announcement from Myriad Restaurant Group, but as of June 2009 the space has been shuttered for months, and it wasn't even open for the 2009 Tribeca Film Festival. If you're not open for that, then you're not open. Mai House never truly caught on, and it did not survive the departure of the original chef, Michael Bao Huynh, who is now cooking many of the same dishes at BarBao on the Upper West Side. To paraphrase the song, \"Mai House is a very, very, very fine house.\" But business appears to be slow, based on a Tuesday night dinner that found the restaurant sparsely attended. That's too bad, because I think chef Michael Bao Huynh's Vietnamese-inspired menu is terrific. I rated Mai House at two stars in November, a verdict I'm standing by today. In January, Frank Bruni of the Times awarded two stars as well, but a less impressed Adam Platt in New York awarded only one. As this visit was a mix of business and pleasure, I didn't snap any photos. We ordered a lot of food, of which I can only recite the highlights. We started with the Hot Spring Rolls ($11), the Wild Boar Sausage ($11), and the Frog's Leg Lollipops ($12). The sausage has gone through a number of re-designs. This time, it was served in meatball-sized pieces skewered with toothpicks. The frog's leg lollipops, each about the size of a large gum ball, came with an addictive hot sauce. The highlight was the Sweet & Sour Spicy Whole Red Snapper ($28). The body of the fish was fried crisp into the shape of a cylinder, so that it could be used as a serving vessel. This was so cleverly done that I didn't realize at first that I was looking at a dead fish. The meat of the fish itself, apparently removed before this operation, was deposited inside. Huynh balanced the spices to perfection, so that the sweet, sour, and spicy all had their turn. The fish itself was quite tender. It would be easy to be cynical about yet another big-box Asian restaurant, but at Mai House the decor doesn't overpower the food. Service was attentive and competent.

The other night, a friend suggested dinner at Vespa, a trattoria on the Upper East Side. I had never heard of it before, but a little research suggested that a lovely outdoor garden is its claim to fame. This being February, we dined indoors. It was Monday evening, and the restaurant was practically empty.Speck & Artichoke HeartsBeets & Goat CheeseThe menu changes seasonally; the winter 2007 menu is currently posted on the website. Appetizers are $8-11, pastas $15-18, meat and fish entrees $18.50-26.50, and side dishes $5. There choices are primarily Italian standards, but all prepared with a high degree of care. My friend started with the Speck (smoked prosciutto) & Artichoke Hearts ($9), which I didn't taste, but she seemed pleased with it. The Beet & Goat Cheese Salad ($9) was a nicely balanced dish, including bits of blood orange and walnuts, with aged balsamic dressing. Beet salad has become rather common around town, but I seldom order it. This dish made me realize I should re-assess that. Lasagna Bolognese (left); Pappardelle with Lamb Ragu (right)My friend swears by the Lasagne Bolognese with mushrooms ($17.50), and from the taste I had of it, I can see why. The flavor was hearty and intense. I thought that Pappardelle with Lamb Ragu ($17.50) tasted a little more generic. I had to remind myself that I was eating lamb, and not just standard red sauce. The space is appealing and comfortable, and the service was just fine. Vespa is a great place to have in the neighborhood. Indeed, I wish my neighborhood had one.

The two pasta dishes look like someone threw up on the plate. My grandmother would laugh at that, not the old school italian cooking of days gone by. I'm sure it tasted delightful though.

Against our better judgment, we took the long-shot bet that Frank Bruni would come totally unglued, and award two stars to Robert's Steakhouse. But Frank kept his clothes on, and awarded a journalistically defensible one star to the strip joint. Eater, who made the conservative one-star bet at 2-1 odds, wins $2, while NYJ loses a dollar.

Every week, we take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We track our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Robert's Steakhouse. Eater's official odds are as follows:Zero Stars: 3-1 One Star: 2-1Two Stars: 6-1 Three Stars: 25-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: There are restaurants that Bruni has to review (celebrity chef; high-profile opening; famous restauranteur), and there are those he chooses to review. Robert's is in the latter category. It has been open for a good long while, and is well off the foodie radar. Its inhospitable perch in the Penthouse Lounge at 11th Avenue and 49th Street is hardly likely to draw much walk-in traffic. It would therefore make no sense for Bruni to choose such an unexpected target, only to slam it, so we can expect a favorable review. The only question is: one star or two?Unless Bruni is totally unhinged, this should be at best a one-star review. Indeed, we stand by last year's zero-star rating. Great steak isn't hard to find in Manhattan. So why go to an ugly neighborhood and pay a high premium for what is essentially a commodity item? Of course, if what you really want is a strip club, it's nice to know a good steak is available, but Bruni reviews restaurants, not strip clubs.Yet, Bruni's discretionary reviews-the ones he chooses to write-have tended to bestow two-star ratings. There's a logic to this. There are probably hundreds of one-star restaurants that the Times will never get around to reviewing. Why pick a restaurant out of nowhere, just to award one star? There's also the Jeffrey Chodorow angle: show the man what a real steakhouse looks like.The Bet: We are going out on a limb, and predicting (against our better judgment and Eater's) that Bruni will award two stars to Robert's steakhouse.

I have an unwriten list of one-of-these-days restaurants. Oriental Garden landed on that list after Frank Bruni awarded two stars in the Times almost eighteen months ago, but I only got around to trying it last weekend.Say what you want about Bruni, but when it comes to recommending casual restaurants with great food, he's as good as they come. At Oriental Garden, Bruni got it right. He should review this kind of restaurant every week, and leave fine dining to the folks who actually enjoy it.At first, Oriental Garden can be a little off-putting. The large water tanks crammed with creatures awaiting their doom aren't as appetizing as the restaurant thinks. When the staff need to weigh a king crab, the scale sits on the floor in the vestibule. Reservations aren't taken, and there is practically no waiting space to speak of. Tables are crammed together, and the decor is not much better than any generic Chinese restaurant that you've seen.The menu is confusing, and far too long. Like many Chinese restaurants, Oriental Garden seems to serve every dish you've ever heard of, and it's hard to figure out what the restaurant really does well. Ordering felt like throwing at a dart board. Seafood in bird's nest (left); Lobster with noodles (right)The Seafood in Bird's Nest just sounded good, and so it was: a bounty of sea creatures - shrimp, scallops, conch, cuttlefish - all immaculately prepared without over-seasoning or additional distractions. We chose the Lobster with Noodles merely because we saw it at an adjacent table, and it looked good, and so it was. Two dart throws, and two hits.We marveled at the food that came out to other tables, including king crab, jumbo prawns, multiple preparations of lobster, and a grilled fluke expertly filleted tableside. We also marveled at the guy sitting by himself who ordered chicken with cashews. What was he doing here?We waited to be seated for about fifteen minutes at around 9:00 p.m. on a Saturday evening. The wait was not pleasant, but once seated the service was competent and fast. The wine list offers about a dozen reds and a dozen whites, none of them Chinese, but all of them quite reasonably priced.Oriental Garden (14 Elizabeth Street between Bayard and Canal Streets, Chinatown)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: MinimalOverall: *½

Note: Click here for a review of Kefi in its current location. This is a review in its former location. I was a big fan of Onera, Michael Psilakis's haute Greek restaurant on the Upper West Side. It was one of the few very good restaurants, in a neighborhood where great ones are in short supply. But I guess there's a reason why the Upper West Side isn't a fine dining destination: yuppies with strollers prefer casual cafes and take-out. The new interiorCuttlefish, Spinach & ManouriBraised Lamb Shank, Orzo, Root VegetablesWalnut Cake, Walnut Ice Cream So Psilakis converted the formal Onera to the casual Kefi. Anyone who visited Onera will recognize the space. But the white tablecloths are gone, and the decor is much more informal. Reservations are not accepted. Prices are astonishingly low, with appetizers $4.50 - 9.95, pastas $9.95 - 11.95, main courses $13.95 - 15.95, and desserts $4.95 - 7.95. Most wines by the glass are only $6, and cocktails are only $7. (I can't remember the last time I had a cocktail below $10.) Even at these prices, a three-course dinner for two, including drinks, is likely to go above $100 with tax and tip. So we were irritated to find that Kefi doesn't take credit cards, and we noted other patrons taken by surprise. If McDonald's can take credit cards nowadays, why can't Kefi? I started with the Cuttlefish ($8.95), which were grilled, stuffed with spinach, and perched atop warm tomatoes. It was an ample portion, and impressive at the price, as it must be a fairly labor-intensive dish. For the entree, I had the Braised Lamb Shank ($15.95), which was just as tender and flavorful as you could ask for. It compared favorably to versions of the same dish that upscale Greek restaurants sell for twice as much. I was also quite pleased with dessert, a moist walnut cake with walnut ice cream. We were sad to see Onera go, but there's no denying Kefi is more in keeping with the area. It's doing a brisk, if not crowded, walk-in business, and also offers take-out. I hope it survives and thrives. Meanwhile, the concept of Onera remains very much alive. Psilakis is planning a similar restaurant called Anthos at 36 West 52nd Street near Fifth Avenue, a neighborhood where high-end Greek dining should find a much warmer reception. Update: Kefi will be moving to 505 Columbus Avenue near 84th Street, sometime around July 2008. The new space will seat 200 and will accept both reservations and credit cards (the current restaurant takes neither). Chef Michael Psilakis hopes to open a new restaurant in the existing space - \"something I haven't done before.\" Psilakis gave the exclusive to a practically breathless Frank Bruni, who loves the place, although he never bothered to review it.

La Grenouille

***CONTENT
La Grenouille is the grandest and the oldest of the city's few remaining classic French restaurants. It's not an every-day restaurant (at least, not for most people), but for that rare special occasion, I'm glad it's there. My girlfriend and I paid a visit last week with my mom, on her 70th birthday.The death of this type of fine dining has long been forecast. In a January 1991 review (the last of three that he would write), Bryan Miller said:If you listen to some restaurant-industry pundits, La Grenouille is just the type of expensive, opulent institution that is slated for extinction as ineluctably as the dinosaurs. In this era of austerity and a return to more ingenuous foods, they say, the dining public is turning away from haute cuisine and embracing little pizzas, pasta, coq au vin and grilled chicken.So welcome to La Grenouille, Tuesday night, mid-January, traditionally the slowest time of the year for restaurants. The dining room is as packed as Bloomingdale's during a post-holiday clearance.That is how we found it last week, on a Tuesday evening. Nor was the clientele composed entirely of retirees and their families. To be sure, while the restaurant's center of gravity is clearly the 55-and-over set, I saw at least three tables with young couples that appeared to be under 35. I'm sure that some kind of special occasion lured them to La Grenouille.The experience here may have once been about the food, but those days are long since past. A book for sale in the vestibule, The Flowers of La Grenouille, hints at the restaurant's calling card. Even in 1980, when Mimi Sheraton awarded four stars in the Times, La Grenouille's annual flower budget was $75,000. The three-course dinner back then was $35.75. Today it is $95, so I would imagine that the flower budget has nearly tripled.Bryan Miller, probably the paper's toughest grader in recent times, demoted La Grenouille to two stars in 1985, and then just one star in 1987, before elevating it back to three stars in 1991. Ruth Reichl reviewed it twice (1993, 1997), awarding three stars on both occasions. In the latter review, she found it \"the most frustrating restaurant in New York,\" finding both \"flashes of brilliance\" and \"deep disappointment.\" She said, \"It could so easily be a four-star establishment.\"By all evidence, the current Times critic finds French food boring, so I doubt he plans to spend much time at La Grenouille. But were he to review it again, I doubt that it would retain its three-star status, as I can think of any number of better restaurants to which he has awarded only two. The overall experience is still one of gracious luxury, but the cooking has probably seen better days.I believe the amuse-bouche was a celery root soup - certainly competent, but not a patch on the sunchoke soup amuse we had the night before at Perry St. Sweetbreads (left); Le Choix des Hors d'Oeuvre (center); Lobster Ravioli (right)La Grenouille charges $95 for three courses, and it can easily be more, as many of the dishes carry supplements. Prices are in the range of the city's four-star restaurants, but there were no \"oohs\" and \"ahhs\" at our table, except perhaps for my mom's sweetbreads. I started with the plate of mixed cold hors d'oeuvres, an impressive portion, but entirely forgettable. Equally forgettable were my girlfriend's lobster ravioli, which carried a $15 supplement.My mom and my girlfriend had rack of lamb. With only two ribs offered, it was an ungenerous portion, and my girlfriend reported that one of hers wasn't warm enough. I ordered the Pike Quenelles, a classic French dish that few restaurants serve any more. I'm at a bit of a disadvantage to report on it, as I've never had this dish before, but like my girlfriend's lamb, it seemed not as warm as it should be, and the accompanying white rice tasted like Uncle Ben's.We all ordered souffles for dessert ($9.75 supplement). My mom and I had the grand marnier souffle, which was the best thing I had all evening. My girlfriend went for the chocolate souffle, which she found not as impressive as the one we'd ordered at Etats-Unis a few weeks ago.The wine list at La Grenouille is notoriously expensive, so I was happy to find a very good 2003 Châteauneuf-du-Pape for $95. The service had all of the traditional French trappings, beginning with the host's greeting, \"Bon soir, Madame,\" when we arrived. The bill had separate tip lines for the captain and the waiter, a distinction that has disappeared almost everywhere else. (I just tipped a bulk amount; how they divide it shouldn't be my problem.)If the food was not the superb experience that it could be or should be given the price, the room remains extraordinary, the service polished and courteous. New York has better restaurants, but for some types of special occasions, La Grenouille remains incomparable.La Grenouille (3 E. 52nd Street between 5th and Madison Avenues, East Midtown)Food: **Service: ***Ambiance: ****Overall: **½

After two previous visits to Perry St., I had mixed feelings. It's certainly a very good restaurant, but is it a great one? My mom was in town, and she hadn't been to any of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurants, so I thought it was time to give Perry St. another try.We had a 6:00 p.m. reservation on President's Day, and it was totally empty; even a couple of hours later, it was only a bit over half full. The menu at Perry St. remains short and focused, and it changes frequently. There are just nine appetizers ($10-29) and eight entrees ($24-45). The wide price range means that you can get out of Perry St. fairly cheaply; but if you want to spend a bundle, you can. (The most-expensive appetizer is poached eggs with caviar; the most expensive entree is poached lobster.)The amuse bouche was a sunchoke soup with a black truffle (above, right). Mixed Green Salad, Toasty Goat Cheese, Kumquat Vinaigrette (left);Toasted Barley Risotto, Parmesan, Dried Sour Cherries and Pecans (right)My mom loved the Mixed Green Salad with toasty goat cheese ($13), which came sculpted in a tall cylinder. I found Toasted Barley Risotto ($13) dominated by the taste of tomatoes, and couldn't really perceive the dried sour cherries that the menu promised. Sweet & Sour Glazed Short Ribs, Spaghetti Squash and Crunch Cheddar (left);Spicy Laquered Halibut, Grilled Broccolini, Clementine (right)My mom also had the better of the main courses. Sweet & Sour Short Ribs ($28) were wonderful, as was the accompanying side of spaghetti squash topped with cheddar. But I found the Spicy Laquered Halibut ($28) over-seasoned, with the taste of the fish literally lost in the sauce.The petits fours (photo, right) were excellent, although I'm afraid I didn't catch the explanation.The bread service remains a definite weakness. Over the course of three visits, this was the first time that bread rolls arrived slightly warm, but they were still hard enough to be lethal weapons in the wrong hands. After I'd used my knife to spread the butter, a server removed the used bread plate but left the knife behind for me to re-use on my appetizer.The wine list is brief and underwhelming. If I were being really picky, I would point out that we ordered a burgundy, and they served it in bordeaux glasses. I am not suggesting that this actually matters to me, but it does show Perry St.'s definite casual side. And in a restaurant that is so pleasant and comfortable, serving food that is as ambitious as this, can't they do better than brown paper placemats?Frank Bruni awarded three stars to Perry St. in September 2005, although his endorsement came with more caveats than he normally allows in a three-star review, calling it \"undeniably flawed and surprisingly inconsistent.\" Several of Bruni's complaints - the sub-par bread service, the paper placemats - remain unremedied, presumably because Mr. Vongerichten, is getting exactly what he wants.But what that is, is a two-star restaurant.Perry St (176 Perry Street at West Street, Far West Village) Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

Today, New York Journal introduces a new feature, Rolling the Dice, wherein we'll take our turn with Lady Luck on the BruniBetting odds as posted by Eater. Just for kicks, we'll track Eater's bet too, and see who is better at guessing what the unpredictable Bruni will do. We will keep track of our sins with an imaginary $1 bet every week.The Line: Tomorrow, Frank Bruni reviews Momofuku Ssäm Bar. Eater's official odds are as follows:Zero Stars: 5-1 One Star: 3-1 Two Stars: 2-1Three Stars: 6-1 Four Stars: 25,000-1The Skinny: Ssäm was reviewed in $25 and Under less than four months ago. There are no official statistics, but this must be the fastest transition ever to a rated review. Bruni wouldn't do it unless he had a Statement To Make. Besides, virtually everyone who's had the food at Ssäm has been wowed. A measly star is therefore unlikely-bearing in mind that, despite the official definition, one star almost never truly means \"Good.\"Bruni has shown, again and again, that traditional formality means nothing to him, but we just can't see him giving out a trifecta here. Even David Chang, the chef, said, \"It would be embarrassing for every other restaurant that actually deserves three stars to have some one-trick pony like us in the mix. For fuck's sake we don't even have silverware and we use paper napkins.\"The Bet: We agree with Eater that Bruni will award two stars to Momofuku Ssäm Bar.

Sammy's Roumanian

***CONTENT
There are some New York institutions for which traditional criticism is irrelevant. You accept them for what they are-or you don't. Prime among these: Sammy's Roumanian, the iconic Jewish steakhouse on the Lower East Side.This is the third Roumanian-Jewish restaurant at the same address. It was once called Parkway, before that establishment moved first to Allen Street and later to Restaurant Row. One of its waiters, Sammy Friedman, re-opened with the identical menu, and promptly failed. The landlord then leased the space and the name to Stan Zimmerman, a Romanian Jew from the Bronx, and in this form the restaurant has thrived ever since.In a September 1976 two-star review-the first of three she wrote-Mimi Sheraton of the Times reported that Sammy's attracted \"a cross section of serious eaters, including Gucci- and Vuitton- trimmed uptowners, devotees from Queens and New Jersey who pull up in white Cadillacs and black Continentals, blue-jeaned artists and bearded bohemian types, union officials, politicians, judges, out-of-town buyers with showroom models and theater personalities.\"By March 1978 (still two stars), Sheraton would report that Sammy's was a \"huge success, lively, Bohemian, with a mixture of customers that include judges and politicians, union officials and artists in blue jeans, uptowners dressed to the teeth in Gucci trademarks and a double-parked row of white Lincolns and black Cadillacs that can be seen almost any night of the week.\"Wanting a piece of this success, the original Sammy opened up a competing place in midtown, which he called the Original Sammy's Emporium. Zimmerman went to court, and obtained an injunction preventing Sammy from using that name. Counting Parkway, there were thus at least three restaurants in Manhattan following more-or-less the identical format, which was probably two more than New York needed. Those others are long gone, leaving Sammy's Roumanian as the city's lone entry in the genre. The restaurant is on two levels. On the Sunday night that we visited, the lower level was rented for a private party; we were seated on the upper level, which was doing a surprisingly brisk business, but was not full.The \"rec room\" decor is so kitschy that it demands multiple photographs. The walls are plastered with snapshots of past visitors. Many of them left their business cards in the interstices of the ceiling panels. The cards are mostly faded, and have probably been there for decades. The balloons and streamers seem like the remnants of an old Bar Mitzvah party. Even when it was new, Mimi Sheraton said that it \"could hardly be called attractive.\" A Jewish entertainer plays the synthesizer and sings a mixture of Jewish and pop standards. Some couples get up to dance, as if this were a cruise ship. One particularly loving couple must have been up five or six times while we were there. With his navy blue double-breasted suit, pink tie and matching breast pocket square, he looked like he had walked in from another era. I would tell you that Sammy's is only for Jews, but for the curious fact that many of the patrons appeared to be gentiles. The menu consists of a couple of mimeographed sheets stapled to manilla file folders. Except to raise prices, that menu surely has not changed for many years-if, indeed, it ever did. Then again, why should it? What Sammy's does, it does very well indeed. The home-made chopped liver before mixing ... and then afterwards. Chopped liver ($9.95), finished tableside, came with warm bread and was positively addictive. I would quite happily have finished the entire bowl, had it not been that I knew a huge steak was coming. The signature dish, Roumanian tenderloin (really a skirt steak), comes in three sizes. You're looking at the small portion ($33.95, if I recall correctly), which is larger than the photo suggests, as several inches of steak are folded back on itself at the left edge of the photo. It is easily double the portion that many steakhouses would serve, although no steakhouse I know serves a steak this way.My mom and my son placed the identical order to share. Their steak was chewy and had too much gristle, but mine was just about perfect. However, both steaks were expertly broiled to the requested temperature and slathered with garlic butter.Silver dollar home-fried potatoes ($5.95) were delightful, but far more than we could finish, given the bounty of food on the table.There were multiple food runners, but as far as we could tell, just one waitress for the full room. However, she was witty, cheerful, and remarkably efficient. When we told her that one of our steaks was a dud, she promptly comped us an order of Rugelach (dessert pastries), which were wonderful.Prices at Sammy's are reasonable by New York standards, but extras can run up the bill in a hurry. There's a $3.95 per person cover charge, and if two people want to share an entree, it'll set you back another $8.95.Vodka, the house drink, is served out of a bottle of Ketel One frozen in ice. (I didn't think quickly enough to snap a photo when our waitress served us.) One shot will set you back $9.95. They'll also sell you the whole bottle for $99.95. Wines are limited to Roumanian labels. My mom smelled a rat, and asked for a taste of the pinot noir, which she found hideous, but the pinot grigio was acceptable. Don't ask for cappuccino or espresso. When I asked the waitress about coffees, she said, \"Coffee? Schmoffee? We have coffee.\"Mimi Sheraton of the Times loved Sammy's. In her final review, published in May 1982, she would report that \"the Cadillacs and Rolls-Royces are still double parked along the otherwise dark and deserted street,\" with \"the line of waiting customers spilling onto Chrystie Street.\" Finding the food \"fresh, savory and greaseless,\" with staff \"cool, efficient and graciously goodhumored,\" she awarded three stars. That assessment remains pretty much true today.No Times critic since Sheraton has re-reviewed Sammy's, so it remains technically a three-star restaurant. How do you rate a restaurant for which there is no comparison? A star system, if it is helpful at all, is meaningful only when comparing similar establishments. For one-of-a-kind restaurants like Sammy's, the rating is beside the point. Either you want the unique experience that Sammy's has to offer, or you don't.Sammy's Roumanian (157 Chrystie Street near Delancey Street, Lower East Side)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: unratableOverall: *½

My favorite night at Sammy's was when the (sole) waiter and the singer got into an argument, in front of the whole room, in the middle of our dinner, and the waiter stormed out. I wish it had been the singer.

My son and I walked into Trattoria Dopo Teatro in December 2005. It was mostly an act of desperation: we were hungry, and in the Theater District it's hard to find anything much better than Olive Garden. I was surprised to find very respectable standard Italian fare and designer pizzas prepared in a wood-burning oven, all prepared conscientiously in spite of the crushing load of tourists on their way to a show.The other night, we actually made a 6:15 p.m. reservation, though I don't know why we bothered. We found a long line snaking out the door. After about 15 minutes, we finally got to the hostess station, and told her we had a reservation. \"So does everyone else,\" she said. It seemed almost random-like winning the lottery-when another hostess picked us out of the scrum of hapless souls waiting around the bar, and took us to a table.Last time, we were seated at a two-top near the front window, so I hadn't appreciated the size of the place. There's a rabbit's warren of rooms on two levels, with names like \"The Secret Garden,\" \"The Theater Room,\" \"The American Room,\" \"The Grappa Room,\" and \"The Wine Cellar.\" They must be able to accommodate hundreds of people. Despite that, the kitchen manages to do a solid job while turning out the orders quickly.Mezze Luni ai PorciniI truly enjoyed half-moon ravioli stuffed with ground veal in a porcini mushroom sauce ($19.50) Mezzi Rigatoni alla Siciliana (left); Calamari Sabbiati (right)My son didn't much care for the half rigatoni in a light tomato sauce topped with eggplant, mozzarella and basil ($16.00). But the kitchen did well by baby calamari ($10.50), which were delicately sauteed and topped with breadcrumbs, in a generous portion for an appetizer.The orders came out fast, but you had better know what you want, because you have only slim odds of flagging down a server later on. Near the end of the pre-theater rush, we saw the beginning of a transformation. Plain wooden table tops with paper placemats gave way to white tablecloths for those who would dine after 8:00 p.m., when things slow down considerably.I can't claim that there is anything unique about Trattoria Dopo Teatro, but for a meal before a show, it's a solid option in a neighborhood where so many of the restaurants aren't even worth writing about. And after curtain time, it might actually be a place worth hanging around.Trattoria Dopo Teatro (125 W. 44th Street between Broadway & 6th Avenue, Theater District)Food: *Service: HarriedAmbiance: *½Overall: *

BLT Fish revisited

***CONTENT
The raw bar downstairs at BLT FishMy last visit to BLT Fish left me so utterly disgusted that I vowed to take a long break before I would visit another BLT restaurant. The fish was excellent - how could it not be? - but the service was risible.In the meantime, Laurent Tourondel continued to expand his BLT empire, with the widely panned BLT Burger here in New York, the forthcoming BLT Market in the former Atelier space, and clones of BLT Steak in several cities. BLT Fish lost its Michelin star this year, confirming the generally held view that Tourondel was too over-extended to mind the store.Despite all of that, I decided to revisit BLT Fish the other night with my mom, who is visiting from Detroit. This was, by far, the most pleasant of all my visits to the various BLT establishments. The food was superb, and we were blessed with a four-top table set apart from the noisiest part of the restaurant. Service was solid, though this must be taken in the context of the comparatively low grade of service in Tourondel's restaurants. The bread amuses at BLT FishWe began with a couple of bread courses. First came crackers with a delicious tuna spread. As usual, the number of crackers was about half as many as needed-a fairly consistent screw-up at the BLT establishments. On the other hand, they are so justifiably proud of their luscious warm bread rolls that they even provide the recipe (see the little \"BLT\" brochure in the photo).Grilled Sardines / Caponata / Aged Xeres Vinegar / BasilThe waitstaff at the BLT restaurants are black-belt masters of plumping up the bill. Our server advised that the whole fish we had ordered would take about 25 minutes, so she strongly urged us to order an appetizer to tide us over. Grilled sardines ($12) came perched on crisp toasted bread, but for a dish so likely to be shared, why were there just three of them?Sea Salt Crusted New Zealand Pink SnapperThe menu offers a number of whole fish, most of them suitable for sharing. They are priced by the pound, which means you really don't know how much you've signed up for until the end. We chose the Pink Snapper grilled in sea salt. After dinner, we were put out of our suspense: it weighed 2.188 pounds, which at $35 per pound came to $76.58. Aren't you glad you asked?The fish was presented tableside, then whisked away to be filleted. I would have preferred to watch them do it, though given the tight spacing of the tables, perhaps this would have been impractical. Any of my numerous complaints about the restaurant were completely erased once we started eating: it was simply the most sweet, succulent, tender fish imaginable. Two wonderful sauces came with it, which I'm afraid I can't recall, but they were pitch-perfect accompaniments.A two-pound fish is a lot for two people to eat, but when it's this good you find a way to finish it. Had we bulked up on appetizers and side dishes, as our server advised, the snapper might have sufficed for three. When we thought we were done, the server returned to serve the tender, delicate \"cheeks\" from the fish head. It was an impressive encore.At BLT restaurants, vegetables and starches are always à la carte. Our sever advised ordering two or three of these, which at $8-9 apiece can quickly add up. I was prepared for this bad advice, based on past visits. Although the side dishes are uniformly terrific, you almost never finish them. One is normally enough. We had the Sauteed Garlic Spinach ($9), which was just right.After dinner, the server brought a small plate of petits-fours. But why only three of them, for a table of two people? A large clump of green cotton candy was too cloyingly sweet to be tolerated for more than a couple of bites.Many other aspects of the service remain peculiar. The menu is a cheap, loose sheet of paper, which I'm sure doesn't last much more than a day. So why must there be a separate sheet of paper listing the raw bar selections and daily specials? And why is only one copy of that sheet distributed, when there are two diners? We observed this at other tables, so I know it wasn't just a mistake.About the wine list there can be no complaint. Here, as at the other BLT restaurants, they take the wine program seriously. We were perfectly happy with a $45 bottle of Beaujolais, which was served (as it should be) slightly below room temperature.With a critic installed at the Times who positively abhores traditional formality, I suppose Laurent Tourondel has perfectly captured the mood of the age. Even Frank Bruni couldn't quite forgive the conceit of sacrificing a restroom for an open kitchen, one of the more boneheaded restaurant design decisions of recent years. But Bruni was smitten with the food, awarding three stars. For food alone, that is the correct verdict. You have to be willing to put up with some annoying conceits, but on this occasion it was well worth it.BLT Fish (21 W. 17th Street between 5th & 6th Avenues, Flatiron District)Food: ***Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **½

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Porter House New York.I first tried Porter House New York last October during its opening week. A 20% introductory discount was in place, perhaps because the management knew to expect some rough going. And that's exactly what we found. By late November, Frank Bruni was no more impressed. He awarded the same one star that I had given it, finding Porter House a \"generically sophisticated upgrade of the kind of chain establishment found in lesser malls...an M.B.A. program for beef eaters who did undergraduate work at Outback.\"My mom's visit this week provided the excuse to see if things have improved at Porter House. And indeed they have. Service was the best I have encountered at any New York steakhouse. At least five people must have said \"Good evening\" to us before we had even sat down. The number of servers, runners, sommeliers and managers paying attention to our table-every table-was nearly enough to put Porter House in Per Se's league.On the way out, I had a brief chat with the manager. He actually knew my name, even though we hadn't spoken at all during the meal. Now, that's service.There are rotating specials for each night of the week. We both had the Thursday special, Cowboy Steak ($38), a large rib steak on the bone that is typical of the ribeye most NYC steakhouses serve. The reason for offering this only on Thursdays utterly eludes me, when so many of Porter House's competitors serve it every night. (The every-day menu has a chili-rubbed ribeye at the same price, which, unless they have changed it, is served off the bone.)Anyhow, it was expertly prepared and very close to top-quality; perhaps a notch below the better specimens I've had around town, although not by much. We sampled three sauces along with it, of which the best was an excellent Classic Bearnaise.The wine list is very expensive, with no choices below $50, and very few below $75. We found a fine Cabernet Franc at around the $60 mark. We had tap water with that, which I mention only because it specifically contravened the wishes of the chef! Every restaurant tries to sell you bottled water, but this was the first time that a server has ever said, \"The chef recommends bottled water this evening.\"Luckily for Porter House and chef Michael Lomonaco, Frank Bruni's unfavorable Times review was irrelevant: business remains brisk. This isn't exactly a surprise, as it's tough to kill a steakhouse. But unlike the mass of undifferentiated steakhouses in New York, Porter House is special. With superb service, postcard views of Central Park, an extremely comfortable atmosphere, and very solid work from the kitchen, Porter House can now be strongly recommended.Porter House New York (Time-Warner Center, 10 Columbus Circle, 4th floor)Food: *½Service: ***Ambiance: **½Overall: **

Valentine’s Day at Country

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a more recent Valentine's Day visit to Country.It was only a couple of weeks after New Year's Eve, and we were faced with a new dining dilemma: where to book for Valentine's Day? It's one of those days when restaurants tend to serve sub-par menus at exorbitant prices. I have generally not had good luck on such occasions, although last New Year's Eve we hit the jackpot at WD-50.I do understand the restaurants' position. Valentine's Day is their single busiest day of the year. It's a day that attracts guests for whom a three-star meal is a once-a-year occasion. The restaurants respond by offering a simplified and unchallenging menu that will offend no one, and that can be turned out efficiently for as many covers as possible.One eGullet poster went into the bar at Picholine, and was told the only option was the \"price-inflated, dumbed down Valentine's menu.\" As he put it, \"there's no way in the world I'm going to pay a premium for a more boring version of your normal menu.\" And then he walked out, and headed over to Cafe Gray. Another eGulleteer walked into Eleven Madison Park, where they wouldn't serve him at the bar at all. The tables set for Valentine's Day - all two-tops. We decided to give Country a try, remembering our four-star meal last year. It would have been madness to expect Country to reach those heights again. But considering the occasion, Executive Chef Doug Psaltis's menu was impressive indeed, and everything that came out of the kitchen was uniformly excellent. Service was a bit sloppy, but the only real annoyance was the rather tardy appearance of the wine list.For Valentine's Day, Country was serving six-course tasting menus for $135-their usual price. However, the restaurant took my credit card at the time of the reservation and charged $270 a month in advance. I see the need to protect against no-shows, but I thought that this went beyond what is reasonable. After we were seated, the server presented us with printed menus that appeared identical on the outside, but were in fact quite different. I am not sure if he was supposed to tell us this, or if we were meant to be surprised. (We had checked the website in advance, but I'm sure many diners did not.)In any case, I thought it was a neat idea, as we both had different meals and got to sample each other's plates. And it showed that Country was not satisfied merely to do the obvious. Psaltis could easily have served the same menu to everyone, and no one would have complained. He went the extra mile.We begain with gougères spiked with truffles, which could easily be the world's most addictive snack food. Warm Parker House rolls were as good as I remembered them, but the butter was cold. The amuse bouche was a delicious cream of mushroom (above, left) so thick that it could have been a pudding. Heirloom potato veloute (above, right) sounded all the right notes. I tasted a bit of my girlfriend's foie gras torchon, which was one of the softest and richest preparations of that dish that I've ever encountered. I was similarly enchanted with the black truffle risotto (above, left) and the grilled sea scallop (right). The next two courses weren't as exciting. Bison bordelaise (left) may have sounded daring, but it was boring. I didn't taste much truffle in brie de meaux (right), which was a forgettable sliver of soft cheese, with a tiny slice of bread and a bit of apple jam. My girlfriend hit the dessert jackpot. I had never heard of \"Pavlova,\" which was a half-moon shaped mound of baked frosting, with a running river of red berries inside. It was as enchanting and seductive as it sounds. My dark chocolate dessert (above, left) couldn't stand up to this. Memo to Country: If you can't think of two great desserts, then just serve us both the same thing. After dessert came a bowl of sugar-coated baked macaroons (above, right).There were several service lapses, most of which I would ignore at a lesser restaurant. Inexplicably, we weren't offered a wine list. By the time I realized it, the food had already started coming. When I brought this to a server's attention, he presented a small pre-printed card with just three whites, three reds, and three champagnes. I flagged him down again. He explained that these were the sommelier's recommended wines to accompany the evening's tasting menu. The lowest-priced red wine was $97 per bottle. I asked to see the full wine list. There was another delay before this was presented, and yet another delay before he showed up again to take our order. By the time we finally had the bottle we wanted, we were already past two courses.On this day, Country had no interest in serving leisurely, multi-hour meals. The courses came lickety-split, and I think we were out of there in two hours flat. I have no serious complaints about what we were served, but it was probably only 80% of what the restaurant was capable of. Even at that level, I rate the hit-to-miss ratio higher than we experienced a year ago, in a very respectable Valentine's Day meal at three-star Oceana.The setting was lovely as ever. The remodeled ball room, with its gorgeous Tiffany skylight, is one of New York's great romantic dining spots. Some may argue that my original four-star rating was overly exuberant, but I don't think any major restaurant does its best work on a major holiday, so for now I will leave Country in the top echelon.Country (90 Madison Avenue at 29th Street, Flatiron District)Food: ****Service: ***Ambiance: ***½Overall: ****

Critiquing the Critic: Pera and Dennis Foy

***CONTENT
Today, New York Journal adds a new weekly feature. In \"Critiquing the Critic,\" we'll deconstruct Frank Bruni's latest performance in the Times dining section.Sadly, Jules Langbein's hilarious Bruni Digest has gone dark- she has posted only one of her patented Bruni-skewerings in the last three months. I can't possibly replicate what Jules did, and I won't even try. I'm afraid I'm going to sound much more sanctimoniously serious than the situation calls for.To business: This week, Frank Bruni files a double-review of Pera and Dennis Foy, granting one star to both.The frequency of double-reviews has gone up, and that's a good thing. There are far too many restaurants that never get a Times review, and far too many others that go years before a re-review. If Bruni is right about Pera and Dennis Foy-and I'm not saying he is-neither one is important enough to deserve a column to itself.Bruni reminds us, \"Dennis Foy occupies the elegant, creamy space that belonged to the excessively self-conscious restaurant Lo Scalco.\" That restaurant, I might add, won a Michelin star, but Bruni never got around to reviewing it. Whatever you thought of Lo Scalco, restaurants at that level shouldn't go un-reviewed.Today's headline, \"Knowing Their Place and Aiming to Fill It,\" has an \"Aw, shucks!\" attitude. It is never a compliment to tell someone they \"know their place.\" It's a bit like the massa telling the slave to be happy about picking the cotton. I don't know about Pera, but I'm sure Dennis Foy thought he was opening a two-star restaurant. I'm not saying it is two stars, but it's patronizing to give him one, and then congratulate him for \"knowing his place.\"Bruni says that Foy is \"an 'if you happen to be' as opposed to a 'you have to try' restaurant.\" The trouble is that almost no one \"happens to be\" on Church Street between Walker and Lispenard Streets. It's not a \"happen to be\" block.I suspect Pera will be just fine with Bruni's one-star review. As he notes, \"Its jazzy look and feel are unmitigated delights, and jazzy isn't so easy to come by on its patch of Manhattan, in the shadow of Grand Central Terminal.\"Overall, we are left with a sense that Frank was slumming it this week. Both restaurants slightly bored him.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Etats-Unis.Etats-Unis is an informal 30-seat restaurant on the Upper East Side-and the unexpected recipient of a Michelin star. It is one of the most accessible and least pretentious restaurants to have been accorded that honor.The restaurant opened in 1991. After a less-than-ecstatic Diner's Journal write-up from Bryan Miller in 1992, it received two stars in the Times from Ruth Reichl in 1993. Remarkably for a restaurant of its age, not much seems to have changed.Despite the French name, the cooking at Etats-Unis isn't moored to any geographic region. It is hearty comfort food that could vaguely be described as New American. The menu changes daily, based on available seasonal ingredients, with only five appetizers and an equal number of entrees on offer. Portions are quite large, and generally rich in high-calorie ingredients.The wine list is reasonably priced, and I was gratified to see a large selection of half-bottles, an option far more restaurants should offer. I started with grilled scallops ($16) on a bed of squash. The scallops were seasoned with a dash of pepper, and like much of the menu, grilled on a charcoal oven. There were three of them, which was more than generous at the price; many a scallop appetizer would come with just one or two. The squash was at room temperature, which to my preference wasn't warm enough. I couldn't tell if this was a miscue, or deliberate.My friend's mozzarella salad ($16) had an almost ethereal creamy softness. Braised shortribs ($28) came in an enormous portion, especially considering the heap of spinach and a steamed artichoke on the side. I couldn't find any fault with this dish, but after the large appetizer I was already filling up, and had to leave half of it behind.My friend's rack of lamb ($36) was also excellent, and (as you would expect) a large portion, with a mound of crisp potatoes au gratin. There are four desserts available, but two of them are baked from scratch, and have to be selected at the time you order the rest of your meal. Not realizing what we were in for, we both took the plunge. Even at a restaurant with more restrained portion sizes, either of these desserts could easily be shared. Other tables seemed to know this, and in hindsight I think the server should have said something.Date pudding ($10) came bathed in carmelized rum sauce and whipped cream. It would win the award for richest dessert in town, if it wasn't for the chocolate souffle ($12), which is an even more sinful choice. They were excellent, but we were by now completely stuffed, and finished less than half of both.There is not much space to maneuver when the restaurant is full, but despite that limitation, service was without fault. The kitchen is tiny. For its size, the quality of what comes out is remarkable.Etats-Unis (242 East 81st Street between 2nd & 3rd Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: **

Dinner at Varietal

***CONTENT
Note: A few weeks after our visit, Frank Bruni reviewed Varietal for the Times, awarding (without much enthusiasm) one star. Within days, executive chef Ed Witt was fired, and pastry chef Jordan Kahn announced that he was leaving to start another project in California. Wayne Nish (March) replaced both Witt and Kahn, but the restaurant was not able to survive, and has since closed. We first visited Varietal for dessert about a month ago, having heard about pastry chef Jordan Kahn's inventive creations. Kahn, who previously worked at The French Laundry and Per Se, is a major talent. We were smitten, and promised ourselves we'd return for a full meal. Varietal is a restaurant that you desperately want to root for. It has no irritating vanities, such as an overwhelming décor, a globe-trotting absentee chef, or snooty staff who act like they're doing you a favor. To the contrary, Varietal is an earnestly serious restaurant, with a service team who genuinely want you to be pleased. At least five different people, from the owner on down, asked us if we had enjoyed ourselves. Alas, Ed Witt's savory courses don't live up to Kahn's desserts. Indeed, the letdown is so great, that we struggle to imagine how it could have happened. Did we order the wrong things? Did we catch Witt's kitchen on an off night? How can a restaurant so serious about its desserts fumble the rest of the cooking so badly? The amuse bouche was a small spoonful of Cured Tasmanian Trout with fennel and olives. The olives were too dominant, completely obliterating the trout. At another table, my friend saw four diners grimace in unison as they tasted it. Everything on the menu comes with a long list of ingredients, often with funky names, and usually at least one too many. We were both intrigued by Prawns with Chamomile Consommé, Baby Carrots, and Forbidden Rice. The dish consists of a few small bits of pre-sliced shrimp, flecks of rice, and a bland salty broth that could have come out of a soup can, added tableside. The dish is entirely uninteresting. We had no idea what was \"forbidden\" about the rice. At $13, it was one of the lower-priced appetizers. Entrees are expensive, with most over $30. My friend had the Roasted Pork & Cider-Tobacco Braised Pork Belly ($31), which read much better than it tasted. The roasted pork was like a dull sausage, while the pork belly was surrounded by an unpleasant layer of fat that hadn't been fully rendered. Duclair Duck ($34) was a bit more successful, with a deliciously crunchy exterior contrasting the tender meat. But Marcona almonds and baby turnips seemed utterly superfluous, and a small cylinder of \"Medlar braised leg\" (whatever that means) was far too dry. For that matter, what is \"Duclair\" duck? That brought us to dessert, which seems to be the only attraction for which the restaurant can be seriously recommended. Whatever you order, it takes a while to arrive—the reason is abundantly obvious when you see the photos. They are works of art, and it seems almost a crime to bite into them. But they are just as much fun to eat, even if one cannot begin to figure out how they were made. My friend had the Wolfberry (lime sabayon, tonka bean, broken macaroons, ketjap manis; $14) , which we had so much enjoyed when we had the dessert tasting a month ago. I wanted to try something different, so I had Absinthe (liquid sable, black sesame, ricotta, sour apple sorbet; $12), another happy choice on a menu where one really cannot go wrong. Service was generally excellent, with only a few minor lapses that are hardly worth mentioning. The staff dress in dark suits and ties, and comport themselves with all due seriousness. With only a little bit more polish, I could easily imagine awarding three stars for service, if only the food lived up to it. The room might be accused of sterility, with the all-white walls adorned only with large photos of grapes. But the chandelier made of inverted wine glasses is a work of sheer genius. At the bar, there is a companion sculpture made of wine glasses tilted horozontally (not really clear in the photo below, despite my best efforts). You would expect a restaurant named Varietal to have a serious wine program. Indeed it does, although it may be far too over-priced for its own good. When we sat down, we were presented with a champagne menu, with no choices below $17. This seemed to us grossly excessive, when you consider that we had an excellent glass of sparkling wine last week at The Modern for just $15. The main wine list has some reasonably priced choices, along with some insanely excessive ones. Varietal appears to be struggling. The dining room was only about half full, surely not a good sign on a Friday night. The front bar area seemed to be doing a brisk business, but it is not large enough to support the full restaurant. Most of the patrons were a lot younger than we are, and they probably won't be choosing from the higher end of the wine list. In a dining room dominated by twenty-somethings, who will order the $500 bottle of dessert wine? Four new reviews of Varietal are on the way. The coming week will see reviews from the New York Observer, New York Sun, and Adam Platt in New York. The owner told us that Frank Bruni has already visited three times, so his review is surely no more than a few weeks away. Varietal probably needs a couple of good reviews to pull in the crowds. If Varietal survives, I suspect my friend and I will be back again for dessert. We would not be drawn back for a full meal unless future reviews suggest a considerable improvement over what we experienced. Jordan Kahn's superlative desserts deserve to play on a stage with a much better supporting cast.

A commenter complained that I was unfairly comparing the artisanal champagne at Varietal to the Virginia sparkling wine we had enjoyed at The Modern. Truth to tell, neither was (strictly speaking) a champagne. For a restaurant in Varietal's class, I did not think it appropriate for the lowest-priced option in that category to be $17 a glass.The same commenter also complained that I didn't know aboout “Duclair duck.” Anyone can google it. I was poking fun at the modern artifice of including the biography of your food on the menu. I suspect that I am not alone in not recognizing the name of every farm that sells to NYC restaurants.The commenter said that I am an idiot. I may well be. However, I didn't particularly see the need to provide the forum for him to say so, so the comment is now history. I don't delete comments merely because they disagree with what I have written. But if you want to call me an idiot, you'll have to say it somewhere else.

My daughter and I visited Varietal last saturday for dessert and wine after having a delightful sushi dinner at Yama. We were quite impressed by the friendly yet professional staff and we were not aware of Jordan Kahn's reputation until after we were seated. I echo Marc's comments regarding the desserts. We both had the tasting menu and shared eight desserts and five dessert wines. Kahn is brilliant and his creations please both the palate and the eye immeasurebly. We intended to return for dinner upon our next visit to nyc but will await a few thumbs up in that department.

Frank Bruni and the Fine Dining Deathwatch

Frank Bruni, the New York Times restaurant critic, has launched an all-out assault on fine dining. Bruni's influence is difficult to measure. But there is no doubt that the city's most influential critic has his knives sharpened against restaurants that offer classic, traditional luxury. Anyone planning such a restaurant must assume that the likelihood of recognition from the Times is close to nil.By \"fine dining,\" I mean the traditional trappings of excellent restaurants: white tablecloths, a first-rate wine program, fine china and stemware, elegant service, and of course a serious chef with a top-notch kitchen brigade. In so defining it, I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with restaurants that serve great food without some or all of these trappings. Indeed, like most people, the vast majority of my meals are not consumed at luxury restaurants.But there is a place in our city for traditional fine dining - the kinds of restaurants normally associated with three or four New York Times stars. During Frank Bruni's tenure, proper recognition for these types of restaurants has all but disappeared.In roughly 32 months on the job, Frank Bruni has issued 17 three-star reviews. Taken on its own, this is a reasonable pace. When you look at the characteristics of those restaurants, the results are sobering.One restaurant, Blue Hill at Stone Barns, isn't even in New York City. As far as I know, it's the only NYT starred restaurant that is not in the five boroughs. It is an anomaly.Another seven restaurants were previously reviewed by other critics, including:Two restaurants demoted from four stars (Alain Ducasse, Bouley)Three restaurants held at three stars (Babbo, Felidia, Picholine)Two restaurants promoted from two stars (Blue Hill, Eleven Madison Park)Nobu 57 is a strange case, as it was technically a new restaurant, but it is a virtual clone of the original Nobu, which was already a three-star restaurant. Bruni could hardly have rated Nobu 57 anything other than three stars, unless he was going to re-rate the flagship restaurant, to which it is largely identical.Hence, of the sixteen NYC restaurants that have received three-star reviews from Bruni, eight of them were either pure re-reviews, or in the case of Nobu 57, the clone of one. That leaves just eight truly new NYC restaurants that have received three stars from Frank Bruni.Of the remaining eight restaurants, five of them are notable for their comparative informality: A Voce, Bar Room at the Modern, BLT Fish, Perry St., and L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.That leaves just three traditional \"fine dining\" restaurants that have earned three stars on Frank Bruni's watch: Country, Cru, and Del Posto. Two out of the three are Italian or Italian-influenced (Cru and Del Posto). This leaves Country as the only new fine dining non-Italian restaurant that has won three stars from Bruni over a 32-month period.Against this is a much longer list of fine dining restaurants that clearly were designed for and expected three stars, but received less: Alto, Cafe Gray, Gilt, Le Cirque, The Modern, and most recently, Gordon Ramsay. The message is clear: If you are opening a non-Italian fine dining restaurant in New York, the odds of a three-star review from Frank Bruni are slim. If the restaurant is French or French-influenced, the odds go down to near zero.The odds against earning four stars are even worse. Frank Bruni has awarded four stars to no restaurants that opened during his tenure. He did review one four-star restaurant that was not a re-review: Per Se, which opened before Bruni started, but which no other Times critic had yet reviewed. With Per Se's clone, The French Laundry, regularly appearing on lists of the world's greatest restaurants, the decision was practically made for him. To have awarded anything less than four stars to Per Se would have taken Bruni's credibility to the breaking point.Even at Per Se, Bruni's award of four stars seemed almost regretful. What finally persuaded him? Of all things, the vegetable tasting-surely Per Se's least often ordered menu option. He also complained of ostentation, and a menu \"too intent on culinary adventure or too highfalutin in its presentation and descriptions of dishes.\" Where, if not here, would culinary adventure be expected? Where, if not here, would \"highfalutin\" presntation be acceptable, if not indeed demanded?Bruni's reviews of fine dining restaurants are full of comments suggesting he is hostile to the genre. The food at Cafe Gray is \"fussy\"; at The Modern, \"over-thought and overwrought\"; at Alto, \"something too restrained\"; at Gilt, the chef \"sometimes doesn't know when to pull back, pipe down and let superior food speak for itself\"; at Gordon Ramsay, \"low-key loveliness...in place of big excitement.\"His brutal demotions of Alain Ducasse and Bouley are especially telling. Ducasse was done in by an out-of-order toilet and a slightly snooty sommelier. The Bouley review dragged in a bunch of unrelated gossip about David Bouley's other activities, and wondered whether his heart was still in it-that, notwithstanding a comment about \"serious talent in the kitchen.\"The after-effects of Bruni's smackdowns have ranged from devastating to irrelevant. At Ducasse and Gilt, chefs were fired, and Ducasse closed altogether. The Modern and Bouley still seem to be doing just fine. But to the extent Frank Bruni's reviews have any influence, anyone who dares open a serious non-Italian fine dining restaurant is taking an almost unacceptable risk. The city's principal restaurant critic will probably not acknowledge excellence even if he trips over it.

you make it sound like it's a bad thing. you've made a pretty convincing argument in terms of what bruni has been doing, but so what? you gotta convince us it's bad. frankly i think he should spend more time in queens and brooklyn, and shun more linen-lined tables.

Good argument, but I agree with the Pauper. Who cares? I'd rather 3 Stars actually mean something. And since when does white table cloths automatically equal \"fine dining\". I find that to be a very old-school mentality. I certainly wouldn't prefer a white tablecloth over the beautiful green leather tables at A Voce.

Bruni has reviewed more Brooklyn and Queens restaurants than his predecessors. It's still not a lot of them, but his bias is comparable to most of the other major critics. The reality is that the Times' demographic is heavily Manhattan centric, and Bruni's choice of restaurants reflects this.I am not suggesting that the traditional trappings of luxury automatically equal fine dining. I am merely pointing out that Bruni is unusually hostile to this class of restaurants.
Martin
2007-02-13 00:00:00
I have to agree with the first two commenters. If I told you that the newspaper's new music critic was praising almost exclusively new bands like TV on the Radio and the Hold Steady at the expense of traditional acts like Norah Jones or Bob Dylan -- that would demonstrate bias and even might be vaguely objectionable. But really, in the end, don't we want music critics to embrace the new and even be a little hostile to the old? I mean, this is a good thing, right? Maybe taken too far, but generally a good thing?
Cole Matthews

I think Marc's point is that for someone with so much power over people's livelihood (my friend is a waiter at Varietal, which Bruni just gave one star, and people are being fired as we speak), he uses it a bit cavalierly. He is the stereotypical impossible-to-please critic, one who seems to drag his feet and complain when he's got one of the most sought-after jobs in the world. I especially enjoyed the comments about Per Se. Only Bruni could find something wrong with a four star place.

For some restaurants, a favorable New York Times review is make-or-break. Alain Ducasse fired chef de cuisine Christian Delouvrier after Frank Bruni demoted his restaurant from four stars to three, and not long thereafter he closed the restaurant altogether. The owners of Gilt fired Paul Liebrandt after getting two stars from Mr. Bruni, at a restaurant clearly designed for a minimum of three.Then there is The Modern-another restaurant with three or four-star aspirations that received a mere two. Owner-manager Danny Meyer was none too pleased, but he didn't panic. Executive chef Gabriel Kreuther is still in place, offering his elegant interpretation of classic Alsatian cuisine. The meal price has gone up since the Bruni review came out. Judging by OpenTable availability and our own experience on Saturday night, the restaurant seems to be full most of the time. Deserved recognition came with a Michelin star, and Frank Bruni's faint praise didn't much matter.Bruni thought that The Modern \"will only become better,\" but he has continued to take swipes at it, the most recent being an unprecedented three-star review for the Bar Room, The Modern's casual cousin. I don't believe there's any other establishment where the Times has separately rated the casual front-room of a more formal restaurant. And if it had, there is certainly no precedent for giving a \"bar room\" a higher rating than the main restaurant itself.The Modern is located in The Museum of Modern Art, although it has a separate entrance and is open for much longer hours than the museum itself. The main dining room is furnished in austere whites and blacks, with a spectacular view of the Abby Aldrich Rockefeller Sculpture Garden. Fine bone china and sterling silver table settings are paired with elegant and nearly flawless service. The room is lively, but with tables generously spaced, the noise level is not oppressive. However, there is not the hushed solemnity of some haute dining palaces.The menu offers a three-course prix fixe at $85, a seven-course chef's tasting menu at $125, or a seven-course winter tasting menu at $155. With amuse-bouches and mid-course treats, both seven-course menus are more like eleven courses. The more expensive tasting menu seems to derive its cost mainly from an over-dose of truffles. The chef's tasting menu, besides being $30 cheaper, actually had more dishes that appealed to us, so we chose that.Our meal, one of the best we have had in New York, unfolded over more than 3½ hours. Pacing, so often a problem with tasting menus, was impeccable. Even at restaurants that should know better, like Jean Georges and Gordon Ramsay, I've had to ask servers to slow down. Not here. When we arrived, we ordered a glass of champagne to start. The staff gave us time to enjoy it, rather than rushing us into ordering. And after we told our server that we had chosen the tasting menu, he asked if we wanted to defer placing the order until after we'd selected wine. I don't remember that happening at any other restaurant, and we gladly took him up on the offer.Paired wines would have been $95 apiece. I'm sure I'll do a full wine pairing again, but I always feel like I need to be wheeled out on stretcher afterwards, so I asked the sommelier to recommend a single bottle at $100 or less that would go well with the whole meal. He offered two recommendations, at $100 and $105, which seemed a wee bit like gouging. (I like to see sommeliers come within my price limit, rather than trying to exceed it.) I chose the $100 bottle and was quite happy.Bread service consisted of baguettes and olive bread, both served warm, with a cube of soft butter on an small two-tiered pedestal. The first amuse bouch was a trio of small bites: a foie gras truffle, a goat cheese linzer tart, and a cucumber ball, accompanied by a glass of roasted fava beans that could easily become addictive. The second amuse (above, left) was a luscious salmon tartare sandwiched between potato blinis. This brought us to our first savory course, a foie gras terrine (above, right) that was sinfully sweet, thanks to an accompaniment of juniper marinated raisins. The apple compote and duck prosciutto (left side of the photo) were just fine, although arguably surplus for a dish where the terrine took a well deserved bow at center stage. Next came a perfectly balanced tartare of yellowfin tuna and diver scallops (above, left) on a bed of cucumber, and speckled with Yellowstone River caviar-a breed of which, according to the menu, The Modern purchases the entire annual crop. Maine Lobster (above, right) came with winter vegetables and a spiced broth that was added tableside. This heavenly preparation was more exciting than Per Se's rendition of a similar dish. At this point I got caught up in the meal, and for the next two courses, forgot to snap the photos until after we'd started eating them. Chorizo-crusted Chatham Cod in a white coco bean puree (above, left) was another triumph. Long Island Duck Breast coated with a black trumpet marmelade and banyul jus added tableside (above, right) was the evening's lone disappointment. It seemed too pedestrian after the increasing raptures of the fish courses, and it required too much effort to cut through the duck with the dull knife provided. A pastry called a \"Fleischneke,\" made from duck confit (top right of photo), sounded promising but was also rather uninteresting. The cheese cart offered plenty of provocative selections, all expertly explained by the server. I was happy with all of them, but would particularly single out the orange one (third from left), which is actually a bleu cheese with notes of cheddar; and largest of the group (fifth from left), made from three different kinds of milk. Pre-dessert was a concotion of fresh pineapple, citrus foam and pomegranate, with fresh cilantro that perhaps was a touch too dominant. Dessert was a trio of chocolates-all more than competently prepared, but not as memorable as what had gone before. The traditional sweets came with a surprise-a miniature raspberry sundae in a cone. (Could it be an hommage to Thomas Keller's salmon cone?) The tray of petits-fours came on the same style of bi-level pedestal used earlier for the butter, although much larger: it weighed about eight pounds. There was also a box of chocolates (not shown). We concluded with Ethiopian coffee, which was hand pressed and came in its own silver serving pot.Our meal had a level of sustained excellence, with polished and professional service, that we judged superior to the tasting menu at Jean Georges that we had just over two months ago. If a couple of courses were less that fully inspiring (the duck and the dessert), this was only because everything else established such lofty expectations. During our long meal, we admired the plates coming out to other tables. One cannot judge food by looks alone, but everything we saw was beautifully composed and elegantly presented, with many dishes being finished at tableside.When we were finished, the staff graciously honored our request for a tour of the kitchen-a gleaming beehive of copper and stainless steel. As we left, we were given a lemon coffee cake; we made fast work of it the next morning.I've continued to read mixed reports about The Modern, which could suggest that it is uneven, or that Chef Kreuther's brand of fine dining is not to all tastes. I don't think there is any colorable argument, however, that it is not at least a three-star restaurant. Fortunately, The Modern has been wildly successful without Frank Bruni's endorsement. But his continuing animus toward this restaurant must nevertheless be reckoned a professional disgrace.The Modern (9 West 53rd Street between 5th & 6th Avenues, West Midtown)Food: ****Service: ****Ambiance: ***Overall: ****

The Modern has been one of the greatest dining experiences we've had in New York. We celebrated our first anniversary a couple months ago, and there was not any dissapointing point at all. Food was excellent (We went for the seven-course tasting menu), service could not be any more perfect, and all within a beautiful and minimalist setting.I don't get the mixed reviews. You described an experience as perfect as the one we had that night.

Pair of 8's

Note: Pair of 8's closed in June 2007.Remember Uovo? It was a sleek restaurant in the East Village (Avenue B & 11th Street) that got plenty of buzz when it opened in June 2005. But what it didn't get was a liquor license or a review from Frank Bruni. Fifteen months later, the place closed. Chef Matthew Hamilton has now resurfaced at the other end of town, at Pair of 8's, a restaurant that takes its name from the nearest cross street: 88th Street on the Upper West Side, a neighborhood not known for fine dining.That background has nothing to do with my reasons for visiting Pair of 8's last night. It caught my eye after a reasonably enthusiastic one-star review from Frank Bruni about a year ago. It was one of the few serious restaurants close enough to Lincoln Center that I hadn't tried yet. I don't know what happened in the meantime, but the original chef is gone. Matthew Hamilton is now in charge of the kitchen. As of last night he'd been there less than a week.We weren't that hungry, so we ordered entrees only. Our server recommended Coffee Barbecue Braised Brisket ($24), which was as good as it sounds. But the accompanying homemade sauerkraut and chick pea pancake were both extremely dull.That was nothing compared to the Pair of 8's Burgers ($16), which my friend considered an over-priced outright disaster. Two three-ounce mini-burgers (one beef, one lamb) were more like meatballs, overcooked, and overwhelmed by two little buns. French fries were soggy.Spiced apple bread pudding for dessert ($9) came piping hot, and was delicious. My friend played it safe with vanilla ice cream ($7).For what is basically a modestly priced neighborhood restaurant, Pair of 8's has far too few wines below $45. However, there's a good selection by the glass, and each pour comes in a quartino (really a glass and a half). We weren't that hungry, so we settled on a nice cabernet at $14 by the glass. A program of humorous themed wine pairings (e.g., \"Frankenwine\"), mentioned in the Bruni review, seems to be gone now.Our server was a bit confused about the menu, telling us there were no specials, even though we very clearly heard servers recite them at other tables. He was a bit irritating in other ways too-for instance, asking us if we'd like our check, instead of waiting for us to tell him when we were ready to leave. (Though doing a good business, the restaurant was not yet full when we left at 7:30 p.m.)The room is attractive and comfortable. What it needs is more competent execution from the kitchen. As this was Matthew Hamilton's first week, it is clearly too soon to judge his work. On the other hand, there is no real excuse when a restaurant is charging full price. I'm willing to give Pair of 8's another chance-but I'll probably have to find another friend to try it with.Pair of 8's (568 Amsterdam Avenue between 87th and 88th Streets, Upper West Side)Food: FairService: AcceptableAmbiance: GoodOverall: Uneven

i think uovo opened in june of 2005 and that they didn't blame bruni for not giving a review. and is his name michael hamilton or matthew hamilton. who did the fact checking on this article? maybe we'll read this paper again next week.

Thanks for pointing out the errors, which I have now fixed.Note that I am not saying they blamed Bruni, for the lack of a review. I am merely pointing out that he didn't review it.

I went to Uovo shortly before it closed, and they had very similar dishes in my recolection... such as the coffee barbecue braised brisket and the lamb hamburger. I remember thinking the food was just okay... similar to what you thought in your review. That could in large part be the ultimate reason uovo closed.... hopefully they'll get their act in gear with this iteration, otherwise it may suffer the same consequences.
Stacey L
2007-02-06 00:00:00
I don't think they closed for that reason. The food was wonderful and honest. Just look at all of the reviews of Uovo. All of them were favorable and they even won a time out critics pick award for bar snacks. These were the pros reviewing the place and they know food. Give Pair of 8's a chance. Why send out bad vibes to the palce and to the chef....
Marc Shepherd
2007-02-07 00:00:00
My feeling is that a restaurant that's open to the public, and charging full price, is a reasonable review subject. If plays, concerts, and operas get reviewed on their opening nights, then I don't know why chefs should be an exception.Having said that, I don't go looking for chefs to review in their first week on a new job. It was just a coincidence that I dined at Pair of 8's when I did. Indeed, it was only because of a casual comment by the bartender that I even knew that a new chef had just arrived. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been aware of it.The review noted that it was Chef Hamilton's first week, and I even said that I'd be willing to give it another chance one of these days. But for now, my experience was what it was, and I had to say so.Given the prevalence of food blogging and message boards, over time there are sure to be plenty of other reviews of Pair of 8's. If my experience doesn't reflect what Chef Hamilton's kitchen will eventually be capable of, I'm sure that will become clear through other reviews.

I visited Pair of 8's yesterday and had a very nice experience. It was my first visit in a few months as I tried it in the beginning and wanted to revisit it after the new chef. The wine list has changed from my last visit it now has many wines in the 30's to 50's with a good variety of types of wines. I think you were very wrong on the burger my dining companion was in his early tweenties and enjoyed having the burger as an option as I dined on the oil poached Spanish mackeral. As I was not there in his first week I will say that the kitchen is now functioning very well

I dine at Pair Of 8's failr often being that I am a local Upper Westsider, and I love what the new Chef has done so far. It seems as though a lot of changes have been made upon his arrival (not sure if he is the reason or not for all of them). For example they have a cocktail hour, a bar menu, music (which they were desperately in need of before), a new wine list and it even seems a better staff. I think I know the waiter who served you he served me there once and I never wanted to be served by him again. Twitchy and irritable- but I have not seen him my last few visits so I wonder if he finally got the boot! Anyway, my recomendation is you should definately stick to your word and give it another chance!
Rick
2007-05-24 00:00:00
He is totally the reason. I asked one of the waiters. He instructs the waiters daily on the food, as all chefs should do. That's the chef's stereo too. He made the owner play music. wierd to not have had music for so long.....

i have been reading your opinons of restaurants and came across this one that states you have the right to review. what qualifications do you have to review resturants? if you do not have the proper qualifications to reivew such as gael green and bruni and so forth, can you please just call it what it is. your opinion. the public has the right to read and agree and or disagree with your opinon. why do bloggers feel that they have the right or the qualifications to review a restaurant? give us some answers please.
Marc Shepherd
2007-05-28 00:00:00
I have never suggested that bloggers have any special rights or qualifications. I am simply a “civilian” who dines out a lot, and writes about my experiences. If you disagree with me, feel free to leave a comment here (as long as it is civil), or start a blog and post your own reviews.The fact is, every restaurant is getting “reviewed” constantly. Guests enjoy themselves, or they don’t. Whichever is the case, they tell their friends. I suppose I could preface every sentence with “In my opinion,” but that would be rather tedious, and I think most intelligent people already know that my views are opinions.It’s rather comical that you cite Frank Bruni as someone with “proper qualifications.” Frank Bruni’s previous assignment was as Rome bureau chief for the Times. His food-writing credentials are identical to mine: he has none.

I mentioned to a friend that I'd be dining at Butter on Saturday night. She replied, \"Butter used to be a huge celeb hotspot about 2 years ago.\" We saw no celebrities, but the place was packed. On entering, I was greeted by the same attitude Eric Asimov noted in his one-star review for the Times shortly after Butter opened in 2002:From the outside, it's difficult to fathom why Butter, which opened not long ago a few doors down from the Public Theater, requires a pair of grim hosts posted like sentries in a glass-walled vestibule, their arms mentally crossed. As with London beefeaters, I felt compelled on a recent visit to try to make them laugh, but I decided that they must have serious work to do, like fending off people who want to be seated before their full party has arrived. Butter's survival shows that a one-star review need not be fatal. Butter is still humming along, despite food that we found quite uneven.The amuse bouche was a spoonful of undistinguished orzo with truffle oil. The bread service came with a small triangle of butter that looked like it was spiced with chives. I was intrigued, but it turned out to be nothing special. You'd think a restaurant called Butter could find a way to hit a home run with-the butter. For the appetizer, we both started with the foie gras terrine, which was above average.For the main course, my friend ordered the ribeye steak, a slab of meat the size of Pittsburgh. Alexandra Guarnaschelli, the executive chef, previously cooked at Nick and Stef's Steakhouse, and at least she can get a steak to the right temperature. But the accompanying bed of mushy kale was practically inedible. It tasted like it was made hours earlier and left sitting under a heat lamp. My pork chop brought even less joy. It was tough and over-cooked, and came with a vegetable medley that had suffered the same sad fate as the kale.Far too much of the wine list was priced over $50 a bottle. We took our revenge by ordering from near the bottom of the list, a $40 Blaufränkisch (the only Austrian wine on the list). We should do that more often. It was delightful; indeed, better than anything the kitchen sent out.As we were leaving, we peered into the kitchen, and found it a cluttered mess. \"Messy kitchen = mediocre food,\" we concluded. I don't recall the prices of everything we ordered, and the menu on the web is outdated. Appetizers were in the $10-21 range, and entrees $19-35.The physical space at Butter is visually arresting. The high vaulted ceiling dissipates some of the sound, but it still gets rather noisy when the restaurant fills up. On the lower level, there's an informal cocktail lounge with a DJ. Halfway through our meal, my friend said, \"A hundred people must have gone downstairs since we've been sitting here.\" But the dining room was full too, which means people must find more merit to the place than we did.Butter (415 Lafayette Street between Astor Place and E. 4th Street, NoHo)Food: FairService: AcceptableAmbiance: Attractive, but noisyOverall: Don't bother

My friend spent a year in Sweden during high school, and she's gets nostalgic for Swedish food. The options in Manhattan are limited. We've been to the fancy and expensive Aquavit once, and to the more informal Aquavit Cafe twice. I hadn't realized there was anything else like it, until the other day I stumbled upon Smörgås Chef in the West Village.It turns out there are three Smörgås Chefs, including one on Stone Street in the Financial District, just a ten minute walk from home. We paid a visit on Friday night. Though not full, there was a decent crowd-mostly neighborhood residents, we would guess. It's a small, charming space. Our server informed us that the chef-owner, Morten Sohlberg, designed the tables as well as the bottle lamps hanging in the window. (See photo.)The West Village location is larger, and has more of Mr. Sohlberg's handiwork, but the quiet informality of the Stone Street space appealed to us. The street itself is a time warp; somehow, developers missed it when all the skyscrapers were being built in the late 20th century. For years, Stone Street was an eyesore and was used only as a parking lot, before preservationists had it declared a landmark in 1996. Closed off to traffic, it is now a home to restaurants and clubs. Most of the construction dates to 1836, and no building on the street is older than 1929. We started with two quintessential Swedish dishes. I had the Gravlaks (smoked salmon) with mustard sauce ($10), which was just about perfect. My friend said she was pleased with the Herring Sampler ($8). Alas, we didn't have equally good luck with the main courses. My Rack of Lamb ($28) was dry and over-cooked. My friend was happier with the Swedish Meatballs ($18) - not as good as Aquavit's, but perfectly respectable.Though not as polished or elegant as the Aquavit Cafe, Smörgås Chef is priced a dollar or two lower per item. It's in the neighborhood, and it's nice to know we can drop by anytime. Perhaps that over-cooked lamb was an anomaly. I'm sure we'll be back.Smörgås Chef (53 Stone Street between Hanover Square and Coenties Alley, Financial District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Note: Click here for an updated look at the star system.After my post on Momofuku Ssäm Bar, a commenter wondered how my enthusiasm for the restaurant could be reconciled with my 1½-star rating on a four-star scale. \"Overall, this review makes little to no sense,\" she wrote.There's a separate page where I explain my Rating System. I'm using the same four-star scale the New York Times employs. Many other media outlets follow the identical system, or something close to it. While the system is far from perfect, it does allow comparisons (for those who care) between my ratings and other people's.If all you know is that the top rating is four stars, you might think that 1½ stars is pretty bad. It's an understandable reaction, but nevertheless incorrect. One star means \"good,\" and two stars means \"very good.\" There is nothing inconsistent about writing an enthusiastic review and awarding 1½ stars. After all, I'm saying the restaurant is \"better than just 'good'.\"If you read more of this blog (index here), you'll find other enthusiastic 1½-star reviews. This is consistent with the mainstream press. The New York Times doesn't use half-stars, but Frank Bruni, the current critic, has written numerous two-star rave reviews. I am quite sure that if the mainstream critics review Momofuku Ssäm Bar, it will earn either one star or two, with two being more likely.The New York Times rating system has its critics. When the same system has to accommodate restaurants as different as Momofuku Ssäm Bar and Per Se, perhaps the rating by itself doesn't mean very much. You could argue that if Momofuku is the best damned ssäm bar in town, it ought to get four stars. But that's not the system we have, and you just have to get used to it. I could set up my own system, but I'm sure I'd make different mistakes, and then my ratings would have no connection to anyone else's.Star ratings are not great carriers of information. But if you are accustomed to the system, the ratings at the bottom of my reviews do faciliate comparisons with what other media outlets have done.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Momofuku Ssäm Bar.Is it possible to be hotter than Momofuku Ssäm Bar? Well, I suppose you could be The Waverley Inn. Aside from that, Momofuku Ssäm Bar is about as hot as it gets, with practically monthly mentions in New York magazine, the Times, and elsewhere.The restaurant, an offshoot of the successful Momofuku Noodle Bar, also in the East Village, is named for ssäm-basically a Korean burrito. The chef, David Chang, can be commended for his guts in choosing a name that sounds like moth-er fuck-you, although it means \"Lucky Peach.\" He can also be commended for having one hell of a publicist.The concept has changed almost monthly since Momofuku Ssäm Bar opened last summer. At first, it was just a lunch burrito bar. When Dana Bowen reviewed it in the Times, late-night dinner service had only just started, and then, only after 10:30 p.m. The starting time for dinner kept moving earlier, and now it is served at the times normal people eat. Like 7:30, which is when my friend and I showed up yesterday, when there was about a 5-10 minute wait for seats at the bar.The menu is in a bunch of categories; you are encourated to order tapas-style, and share. The server recommended that we choose six items, and as usually the case with such recommendations, it was probably one too many. Seasonal Pickles ($9) had a lively taste, with the ones pictured on the left packing quite a bit of heat.Wellfleet Oysters ($15 for half-a-dozen) were cool and fresh. Three contrasting hams are offered on the menu. We had the Edwards' Wigwam Smoked Ham ($10) from Surrey, Virginia. This was fresh and light to the taste, but we needed more than the two slices of bread that came with it. The restaurant claims that they serve \"no vegetarian-friendly items.\" This isn't strictly true, as Brussels Sprouts ($11) and a number of other dishes (like the pickles) demonstrate. Of course, perhaps there's more to this dish than meats the eye. It was so crisp and smokey that it could almost have been bacon. [See update below.] Finally we got to one of the dishes Momofuku Ssäm Bar is named for: Hanger Steak Ssäm ($19). To eat, you place a piece of steak on a leaf of lettuce, add rice and sauce, and wrap the whole thing up like a soft taco. It's a little unwieldy, but a pleasure. I was full by this point, and barely tasted Seafood Stew ($29). My friend loved it though, calling it a spicy bouillabaisse. A pair of small-tined forks would have been helpful, for prying the meat out of the mussels.There is much more to explore at Momofuku Ssäm Bar. If you can muster a crowd, consider ordering the whole pork butt ($180), which is slow-braised all day. We saw one at an adjoining table, and our mouths were watering. The party of seven couldn't finish it.Although it is crowded and loud, service is friendly and fun. The servers are well informed about the menu, and patient about explaining it. The kitchen doesn't really know how to pace the food. Like most tapas-style restaurants, plates come out when the kitchen is ready, not when you want them. Our first four courses appeared rather quickly, but there was a noticeably long wait for the fifth and sixth. In the meantime, we enjoyed a bottle of sparkling shiraz ($35), an oddity I don't remember seeing anywhere else.Momofuku Ssäm Bar (207 2nd Avenue at 13th Street, East Village)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½Update #1: My statement about the restaurant's purported absence of vegetarian choices sparked a few comments. Yes, I am aware that a vegetable dish may have come into contact with an animal-based product during its preparation. Similar items appear on menus all over town. Unless the restaurant has told you so (and most don't), one can never assume a complete absence of animal derivatives. I therefore thought that the unusual comment on Momofuku's menu was worthy of a mention.\"Vegetarian\" is an umbrella term that covers many different approaches to eating. (See Wikipedia.) Many people who call themselves vegetarians would eat a number of items on Momofuku's menu. The strictest vegetarians might not, but they would probably find themselves frustrated at many restaurants in New York. I have no reason to think that Momofuku is in a category by itself.One commenter seemed to think that this was \"Bad, incomplete reporting\" on my part. I am not writing Consumer Reports, just a journal of my impressions of restaurants I've visited. I don't claim to be exhaustive, as I think would be obvious to just about anyone. And I cannot imagine that any strict vegetarian would be depending on me (a confirmed carnivore) as her source for restaurant recommendations.Update #2: After posting this entry, one commenter wondered how my 1½-star rating could be reconciled with my apparent enthusiasm for the restaurant. I've responded to that in a separate post. After thinking about it, I did update the food rating from 1½ stars to two, but the overall rating remains at 1½ stars.

Are you really that naive to think that the restaurant doesn't know what's vegetarian or not? It's not like they're winning customers by claiming to serve all animal product -- those vegetables were probably cooked in animal fat.I hope you don't do this for a living.

2007-01-24 00:00:00
considering the pickles were merely vegetables that were pickled and not cooked, I am pretty sure that was totally vegetarian. In the NY Mag article they specifically say that the owner has an aversion to vegetarians and their restrictions. For that reason he says that to further annoy them, I believe. There were indeed several items on the menu that were vegetarian. It is true that the brussel spouts could have been sauteed in an animal fat.Now, snarky girl, leave your inane comments to yourself.

Just a note. Many restaurant preparations have hidden animal products including chilled, uncooked salads and pickled items. Fish sauce, worcestershire sauce, oyster sauce and the like season Asian and western dishes and fly below the radar of people looking for pieces of flesh. Next time you have a vegetarian Vietnamese dish and you pour on the nuoc cham, you're splashing fermented anchovy juice on your greens. It's delicious.Just a note.Oh, and people shouldn't be unecessarily snarky.

I don't think I was being snarky -- I think I was point out that the \"writer\" of this review doesn't know as much about what goes on behind the scenes as the kitchen staff/owner. If the owner is intentionally saying this to annoy people, that would have been important to report. The only things cited in this review as being vegetarian were pickles and brussel sprouts, which were probably cooked in animal fat of some sort. There was no mention until now of other \"totally vegetarian\" things on the menu.Bad, incomplete reporting.Overall, this review makes little to no sense [the star ratings don't match the written comments].

Cafe Cluny, the new French-American bistro, is so West Village: the quaint corner lot at an intersection no one can find without looking at a map; the low tin ceilings; the tables packed tighter than sardines; the short and uncomplicated menu.And the attitude. The afternoon of my reservation, Cafe Cluny called to confirm I was still coming. No problem, that. But then they added that my reservation would be forfeited if we were more than fifteen minutes late, and that no one would be seated until the entire party was present. Any more regulations, and they will have to publish a rule book.It turned out they were mighty friendly when I got there, and despite what I was told over the phone, they did seat me before my friend arrived. Luckily I am not overweight, as anyone larger would have struggled to squeeze into the tiny space without knocking things off of the adjacent table. Duck breast confitWe both tried the soup du jour ($9) - I believe a butternut squash - that was creamy and delicious. Duck breast confit ($27) was competently prepared, but it came atop a measly puddle of pureed potatoes and what was advertised as brussels sprouts, but didn't seem to be. The standard table knife (which had to do double duty as a butter knife) wasn't adequate for cutting into the duck.Our server tried hard, but she was one of those unhelpful waitresses who thinks every selection you ask her about is \"terrific,\" no matter what it is. Two entrees, two soups, one side dish, two coffees, and three drinks between us added up to $136.56 before tax and tip. While nothing we had was objectionable, I think one can find far more pleasant ways to spend that kind of money in this town.Cafe Cluny (284 West 12th Street at West 4th Street, West Village)Food: AverageService: AverageAmbiance: CrowdedOverall: Average

Note: Jason Neroni and the owner of Porchetta had a nasty split in April 2007, and the restaurant closed, re-opening as Carniceria, a Latin American steakhouse helmed by Alex Garcia of Calle Ocho and Gaucho Steak Co. fame. That restaurant didn't last long, closing in September 2007.It seems like forever ago (more like seven years) that Wylie Dufresne pioneered the Lower East Side restaurant revolution at 71 Clinton Fresh Food. Dufresne left 71 Clinton to open the ground-breaking WD-50. 71 Clinton drifted for a while, until Jason Neroni took over in March 2004. Many were smitten, including Frank Bruni, who awarded two stars. I was was not.A year later, Florence Fabricant reported in the Times that Neroni was leaving to become the personal chef for \"some kind of billionaire,\" and 71 Clinton was closing. The gig with the billionaire didn't last long, and by November Neroni was back in town, cooking at Porchetta in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. The critics have mostly been pleased, but Frank Bruni, who loves to hand out stars to casual restaurants in the outer boroughs, could muster only one.I am sure the owners of Porchetta fancied themselves a two-star restaurant, on the theory that if Dressler and The Little Owl could get two, then so could they. Alas, this time Frank Bruni is entirely correct. Porchetta is a decent casual restaurant, and no doubt a step up for its neighborhood, but we tasted nothing that justifies the schlep from Manhattan. The review seemed to be good for business, though. The restaurant was full on Friday night, and several walk-ins were turned away during our short visit. The menu offers the traditional Italian appetizers, pastas, and main courses. The pasta portions, however, are not large. We started with the potato gnocchi ($13). Even allowing for the lack of depth in the photo (above), you can see it is not a large portion. The light texture of the gnocchi was heavenly, and I loved the quilt of duck proschiutto and crushed black truffles. Frank Bruni raved about the short ribs ($20), but we were less impressed. We weren't fond of the puddle of pureed mustard greens surrounding the brick of short ribs, which were adequate but not ethereal. \"Not as good as Cafe Gray,\" as my friend put it.It so happens my friend and I were immediately drawn to the identical choices-the gnocchi and the short ribs. Our server seemed to think this was a bad idea. When we placed our order, she tried mightily to persuade us to order different items, and share. We found her assertiveness a bit presumptuous, and stuck to our guns. (Yes, Virginia, we did discuss our order before telling you.)At many casual restaurants, the wine list makes the difference between a moderately priced meal and an expensive one. We were please to find good red wines under $40, and indeed, none over $69. We were quite happy with a bottle priced at $38.The dining room at Porchetta looks like two or three failed decorating projects gone badly awry. In one corner is a black-and-white striped design suitable for a redneck rec room, with a wooden moose head and two more sets of fake antlers with light bulbs on the end. The rest of the room has two different wallpaper designs, as if the owner started a renovation and ran out of money.You'll have a decent meal at Porchetta, but it's not the revelation Jason Neroni's fans would claim. It's solid Italian food, in a city that has plenty of it.Porchetta (241 Smith Street at Douglass Street, Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: FairOverall: *

Dylan Prime is an haute steakhouse in Northwest TriBeCa. To an extent, it's built on the standard model, with steaks à la carte and side dishes that plump up the bill. It departs from that model by offering the alternative of fully composed plates that are a bit more creative. The setting is also much more elegant and refined than the standard-issue NYC steakhouse.I've dined at Dylan Prime a few times, always ordering standard steakhouse dishes. I always found them competently done, if not spectacular. To me, the restaurant's primary virtue was its proximity to the office (just two blocks). It's also a reasonable choice if you want to bring guests to an elegant steakhouse that doesn't play to stereotypes.Last night, I wanted to try one of the chef's compositions, the Carpetbagger Steak ($41). The chef must consider this his signature item, as the website offers a video of how it is prepared-an honor bestowed on no other dish. An 11 oz. Filet Mignon is sliced open and stuffed with Blue Point Oysters, and it's served on a bed of spinach and baked potatoes.The video shows the oysters being added before the filet is cooked. From the taste, I would have guessed they were added afterwards, as they weren't as warm as the inside of the steak. My reaction was that neither ingredient benefited from the presence of the other. The menu promised a Guiness and Brown Sugar Sauce, and this too is shown on the video. My dish was served dry, however. Obviously someone in the kitchen screwed up, and I only noticed the omission when I got home and rechecked the website.Side dishes are $8. Winter squash risotto with parmesan and honey was an amazing deal, considering that an order of french fries would have been the same price. That risotto was also the best thing I tasted. Like most steakhouse side dishes, it's not a realistic portion for a solo diner on top of an entree, unless you have an extraordinary appetite. I left half of it behind-not for lack of enthusiasm-and hadn't even ordered an appetizer.The dessert menu offers a number of cocktails called \"Pie-tinis\" and \"Cake-tinis,\" named for well known flavors of pies and cakes. Examples include Apple Pie à la Mode, Keylime Pie, German Chocolate Cake, or Strawberry Cheescake. I tried the Amaretto Cheesecake martini ($12). Sure enough, it tasted exactly like a liquefied spiked cheesecake, with a gingerbread crust on the edge of the glass, and crushed almonds floating on top.I had wondered whether Wolfgang's TriBeCa, which opened last spring just a few blocks south, would leech business away from Dylan Prime. But the restaurant was nearly full on a Wednesday night. Wolfgang's, of course, is nearly always full too, demonstrating that the steakhouse format remains almost indestructible, despite the high check size.As a pure steakhouse, Dylan Prime is not as good as Wolfgang's, but the space is far more attractive and serene. Notwithstanding the snafu with the Carpetbagger Steak, in general I have found that Dylan's does everything competently. Service is a tad slow, but friendly.Dylan Prime (62 Laight Street at Greenwich Street, TriBeCa)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: **½Overall: *½

Note: Parea closed in mid-2007. We had a later visit that wasn't as impressive as this one. Parea is probably the most seductive of the new wave of haute Greek restaurants. The walls are sculptured in the shape of an undulating wave. In the ceiling, there's a leafy gauze backlit with a warm orange glow. The center of the dining room is dominated by a long communal table, with tables for two or four tracing the room's periphery. The menu advises that the appetizers are recommended for sharing. We ordered the spicy sausage ($12) and the tiropita ($15), the latter being doughy dumplings filled with light cheese and minced meat. They arrived together and were gone rather quickly. We both ordered the strip steak ($28), violating our usual practice of ordering steak only in steakhouses. We were rewarded for our bravery, as it was quite good, with a nicely marbled texture and exterior char. The steak was not as thick as most steakhouses serve, but this is not a critique-steakhouse portions are often obscene. It came with \"greek fries,\" which had a consistency somewhere between baked and deep-fried potatoes, and which neither of us could finish. There was a yogurt-based sauce (lower left-hand corner of the photo), which I used as a dipping sauce for the steak.Portion sizes were large-not only at our table, but at others we spied on. Though the appetizers were modest, we were plenty full after our strip steaks.Frank Bruni complained about excessive noise in a two-star review shortly after Parea opened, but it was not busy when we visited for dinner on a Monday holiday. Service could have been better. No spreading knives were supplied for the bread service, and a busboy looked at me like I was crazy when I asked for another knife to eat the appetizers with. Our server never even asked us for a beverage order. By the time I noticed this, we were already in the middle of appetizers, so we skipped wine for the evening.Despite some service lapses, we enjoyed the comfortable space and inventive menu, and would be happy to return.Update: On a subsequent visit, Parea was considerably less impressive. Service was inattentive, and several dishes came out of the kitchen cold. The restaurant has since closed.Parea (36 E. 20th Street between Broadway and Park Avenue South, Flatiron District)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: **

Front Street is quickly becoming the center of Lower Manhattan's nightlife revival. It's the spine of several blocks between the South Street Seaport and the Brooklyn Bridge that fortuitously managed to avoid the modern redevelopment that obliterated most of the original low-rise buildings downtown. There are a few other isolated pockets like it, but on Front Street, with its cobblestones and distressed brick facades, you actually feel like you've left the canyons of Wall Street far behind.SUteiSHI (spelled thus), which opened in early December, is a new example of what Front Street could become. It's an edgy Japanese restaurant and sushi bar, with family-friendly service and a surprisingly fun menu. The left side of the menu features classic rolls, sushi, and sashimi; the right side features the chef's original creations. Prices are modest, although an omakase can take you all the way up to $120, if you want to go that far.Spicylicious shrimp ($14) was incredible. The golden sauce touched the perfect spicy and sweet notes, and the shrimp were both hot and crunchy. A smoked salmon and avocado roll, with a sprinkling of fish roe ($10) was competently done, but the flavor was rather dull. For dessert, the mochi ($6) were excellent: ice cream scoops (mango, chocolate with red beet, coffee) in a doughy flour crust, resembling dumplings. I had a small caraffe of warm sake to drink, which was just $5. The decor is industrial chic. There are garage doors on one wall, which I'm sure will be wide open in the summer, with perhaps an outdoor cafe. From its perch at the corner of Front Street and Peck Slip, there are gorgeous views of the Brooklyn Bridge.The clientele was a mixture of young professionals and families. I saw two parties there with children (don't fret; they were well behaved), including the unusual sight (in Manhattan) of a child at the sushi bar. Service was excellent; at one point, the matre d' even came over to my table and offered me a selection of magazines to read.There is much more on the menu at SUteiSHI that looks like it's worth exploring. As it is just a five-minute walk from my apartment, I suspect I'll soon be a regular.SUteiSHI (24 Peck Slip at Front Street, South Street Seaport)Food: *½Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

Note: La Vineria has moved to 737 Ninth Avenue at 50th Street, the former home of La Locanda dei Vini, another Italian restaurant by the same owners. The new chef is Massimiliano “Max” Bartoli, formerly of the Miss Williamsburg Diner. La Vineria is an unassuming trattoria that one could easily overlook, on a stretch of West 55th Street dominated by much larger places—indeed, despite knowing the address, I walked right by it the first time. Once inside, you quickly forget you're in Midtown. The space is cozy, with the décor dominated by an exposed kitchen and a high shelf lined with old wine bottles that encircles the room. The menu features pizzas ($14–17), antipasti ($9.50–14), pastas ($15–25) and main courses ($15–34). Many of the pastas have a heavy meat or fish component, accounting for some of the higher-priced dishes. These included the Pappardelle with duck ragout and seasoned mushrooms ($18), which I thought would have benefited from a heftier helping of duck than was offered. My friend was delighted with the mixed seafood stew ($24.50). The wine program at La Vineria is something to celebrate. On a list with a couple of hundred selections, there are 23 reds under $45, including ten choices $30 or under. We were delighted with a 2003 Valpolicella at $30, which had a bouquet so fragrant that I couldn't help holding the glass up to my nose every time I took a sip. Our party of 25 guests took up about two-thirds of the restaurant. Naturally, in such a small space the kitchen and service staff struggle at times to keep up, as they are not normally geared up to serve so many meals at once. Under the circumstance, they did an admirable job. For a moderately-priced dining option, in a neighborhood where most good restaurants cost a lot more, La Vineria is worth a look.

***CONTENT
Le Boeuf à la Mode is one of the last remaining classic French bistros, in a city that was once full of \"Le\" and \"La\" restaurants. It's run by the same French family that founded it in 1962, and one suspects the menu hasn't changed much in all that time. Thanks to a renovation in the 1990s, it doesn't have the same time-warp feeling as Le Veau d'Or, and it is also a bit larger.However, one is still acutely aware of a bygone era. My friend and I are in our 40s, and we were surely the youngest people there. The restaurant, which seats 90, was less than half full. In the most recent New York Times review-perhaps the only one-John Canaday awarded two stars in 1975.We ordered the four course prix fixe at $38.50. A duck mousse terrine was uncomplicated, but offered all the simple pleasure such a dish should. I am fairly certain the soup was the same cream of leek that John Canaday raved about, though to my taste it was merely average. Chicken breast stuffed with spinach and goat cheese (a recited special) was excellent. I seldom order chicken in a restaurant, but the promise of goat cheese was enough to tempt me, and I wasn't disappointed. For dessert, a blueberry tart was rather forgettable.Le Boeuf à la Mode's perch on 81st Street is too far out-of-the-way for me to consider becoming a regular. Besides, I liked Le Veau d'Or's ancient charm slightly better, and it is closer. But if you are hungry for the old-fashioned French classics, Le Boeuf is certainly worth a look.Le Boeuf à la Mode (539 East 81st Street between First and York Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: *½Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

A comfortable restaurant with satisfactory food and good service. The only downside is the selection of very tired, uninspiring dessert choices. I wish they had at least ONE good looking cake.

Varietal has been open less than a month. Food blogger Augieland is already smitten, as are many of the eGullet community. The concept draws on several ideas at once, and it remains to be seen if they will gel. It is a wine bar, with some 70 selections by the glass. There are savory courses too, which have drawn mixed reviews so far.But what has everyone raving are the inventive desserts of Jordan Kahn, who has stints at The French Laundry, Per Se, and Alinea on his resume. We dropped by at around 10:00 p.m. on a Saturday night after our dinner at Applewood, and were seated after about a ten-minute wait. The dining room was nearly full at that hour, although it had cleared out considerably by the time we left.You'll either love or hate the decor. The chandelier (pictured above), made from inverted wine glasses, is a work of genius. But the austerity of the stark white walls is relieved only by several undistinguished blow-up photos of grapes. The all-white theme is even more apparent in the front bar area, where there is another very clever sculpture made with wine glass stems.We asked to share the four-course dessert tasting ($35). The server blundered, and we actually got two full orders of the dessert tasting. I did not realize this when the first course arrived-assuming that the kitchen had been considerate enough to divide the portions. But it was clear, both to us and our server, by the time the second course arrived, that we'd received twice the amount we wanted. To the restaurant's credit, they continued with double orders of the third and fourth courses, but did not charge us for them.The four-course dessert tasting is far more than most people will want. For the typical appetite, one portion to share is ample for a couple who have already had a full dinner. Indeed, any one of the courses would be nearly enough to be a dessert on its own. The desserts are of course enjoyable in their own right, but the artfulness of the platings almost makes you regret digging in. You just want to gaze at them, as you would paintings in a museum.Most of the desserts have about half-a-dozen ingredients. I certainly can't remember them all, though fortunately I think I've found descriptions on various Internet sites.1) Sweet potato ice cream, yogurt, yuzu, picholine olive. The actual color was closer to orange than the photo shows. The olive was dried and shredded-you can see the crumbs at the back of the photo. An excellent starter.2) Wolfberry puree, rigid lime sabayon, broken macaroons, tonka bean cream, soybean, ketjap manis. This was the most gorgeous of the four desserts, and probably the most successful.3) This is the only dessert for which I cannot find a description, but we enjoyed it nearly as much as the wolfberry, above.4) Chocolate Gel, Pear Sorbet, Mushroom Caramel, Brown Butter.We thought this one was a little too similar to the third dish. We particularly admired the cylinder of pear in the middle of the dish, which was the consistency of an egg yolk and \"ran\" with pear juice when punctured. But after that, we left the rest of the dish unfinished.Although our server was no doubt chastised for sending a double order into the kitchen, she proved to be quite knowledgeable about the food, describing the complex dishes without a hitch. She recommended a lovely dessert wine to go with our tasting, which at $17 was neither the most nor the least expensive they had. The courses came out fairly slowly-no surprise there, given the complexity of the platings-but we were in no hurry.A judgment on the savory menu must await a future visit, but for its desserts alone Varietal is a welcome addition to the restaurant landscape.Varietal (138 West 25th Street between 6th & 7th Avenues, Chelsea)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Hardly a month goes by that I'm not writing about yet another restaurant that specializes in seasonal ingredients, locally sourced from artisanal farms-what New York's Adam Platt calls an \"haute barnyard.\" As Platt puts it, these restaurants are \"country-themed, supplier-obsessed, [and] increasingly expensive.\"Few restaurants wear their organic souls on their sleeves as proudly as Applewood, which has been wowing diners in Park Slope since September 2004: \"We use only hormone- and antibiotic-free meats and poultry. Our fishes are always wild and never farmed... Our produce is procured from biodynamic, organic and/or local farms.\"Applewood is on the ground floor of a Victorian townhouse, on one of the side streets just steps away from Seventh Avenue, one of the main drags in Park Slope. It seats about 45, in a cosy room that looks like it could be transplanted from the countryside, although the noise level quickly reminds you you're the city. All the tables were occupied, although I had no trouble getting a 7:15 p.m. Saturday evening reservation just a few days in advance.You quickly find out what Frank Bruni meant, when he wrote, \"Sometimes the food at this restaurant reads better than it eats.\" Out of four plates ordered between us, only my friend's appetizer, Crispy Vermont Pork Belly ($11) really lived up to its promise. It was accompanied by caramelized apples and roasted hazelnuts, and a pepper jelly pureee provided an unexpected spicy kick.I started with the Warm Vermont Ham Confit ($10, pictured below), served with pickled red onions and a parsley-jalapeno sauce. In this case, the expected flavor punch from the jalapeno sauce never materialized. Fresh (not smoked) ham can be a dull meat, and the accompaniments didn't rescue it here.For the main course, both of us had the Grilled Vermont Veal ($24, pictured below)-\"free range,\" we're assured, which means the beasts have a bit of leisure before they're slaughtered. It was served with caramelized brussels sprouts and turnips. An applewood smoked bacon sauce promised excitement, but it was pedestrian. The veal had a welcome crisp outer crust, and I enjoyed my portion, but my friend said hers wasn't tender enough.Even the wine list played along with the barnyard theme, with organically-grown wines specially pointed out. I found the list a tad over-priced, but we found a satisfactory (non-organic) shiraz at $45 to our liking. Two wonderful homemade breads came with a choice of three luscious spreads, but alas no butter knife.Applewood tries earnestly to please, and I'm sure it's possible to have a wonderful meal here. But we found ours merely adequate. With so many similar restaurants to choose from, we won't be in a rush to go back.Applewood (501 11th Street between 7th & 8th Avenues, Park Slope, Brooklyn)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

***CONTENT
This time last year, it looked like super-chef Kurt Gutenbrunner was veering dangerously close to over-exposure. Within three months, his two-restaurant empire (Wallse, Cafe Sabarsky) doubled, opening THOR on the Lower East Side in September 2005 and Blaue Gans in TriBeCa in December. Perhaps Gutenbrunner realized that he'd stretched himself too far. He pulled out of THOR-the restaurant least like the others-leaving himself with three unique but strongly related restaurants. At all of them, the focus is on Austrian food, a niche that Gutenbrunner has nearly to himself. Blaue Gans (pronounced BLAU-uh gahnz), which means \"Blue Goose,\" is the most casual of Gutenbrunner's trio of restaurants. It occupies a space that was once the restaurant Le Zinc, and Gutenbrunner made only minimal changes on taking it over. The walls are covered with vintage posters, most of which are unrelated to the Austrian theme. There are no table cloths, butter knives, or even bread plates to go with the excellent bread service. Servers, many of whom seem to be Austrian imports, tend to get stretched when the restaurant fills up-as it does, at least on a Friday night. The surroundings at Blaue Gans may scream \"casual,\" but Gutenbrunner still takes his Austrian cuisine seriously. The chef himself was in the house on Friday night, which suggests he didn't open Blaue Gans merely to make a quick buck. I suspect the restaurant may be his laboratory, with the more successful dishes graduating to his West Village flagship, Wallse. (A short list of handwritten specials accompanied the main menu.) As far as I can tell, the Wiener Schnitzel you get at Blaue Gans is the same Wiener Schnitzel you get at Wallse, except it costs $8 less. Appetizers at Blaue Gans are $8-12, but there's a separate menu category for sausages, which are $7-8. My friend and I tried the pork and beef sausage and the smoked pork sausage (both $8), served with sauerkraut and horseradish mustard. We thought the smoked pork sausage was a tad more interesting, but I would happily try either one again. For the main course, my friend ordered the pork belly ($21), which must have been one of the largest helpings I have ever seen. I ordered the pork schnitzel ($22), which was wonderful-as Frank Bruni described it, \"The meat had been dusted with flour and cooked with veal stock, cream, button mushrooms and bacon.\" Like everything else at Blaue Gans, the wine list has many reasonably-priced entries. We settled on a bottle of gewürztraminer at $36 that was more than satisfactory for our hearty, casual meal. The bill came to $103 with tax, before tip. One positive development is that, as of January, Blaue Gans now takes reservations, a convenience much more helpful to those of us who want to make definite plans. And I am reasonably certain my future plans will include Blaue Gans again. As my friend put it, \"I could eat like this every day.\" Well, maybe not: the food here isn't exactly lo-cal. But when you're in the mood for a calorie splurge, it doesn't get much more decadent than this.

WD-50

I haven't had the best luck with restaurant visits on holidays, such as New Year's Eve. Restaurants tend to simplify and reduce the scope of their menus, while charging more-in some cases a ton more-than they normally would. Our dinner last year at Picholine was a particularly egregious example of this: $800 for two, for a menu that wasn't worth half that.Perhaps the common-sense solution this year would have been to stay home, and save the blow-out meal for another evening. But I reasoned there must be a New Year's Eve dinner in New York that isn't a rip-off, and I was determined to find it. At WD-50, we hit pay dirt. It was my first holiday meal at a fine dining restaurant that was worth every penny. I reasoned that the eccentric avant-garde chef Wylie Dufresne wouldn't suddenly start serving airline food just because he has a captive holiday audience. Dufresne did not disappoint.At WD-50, the nine-course tasting menu normally sells for $105 [since increased to $125]. I don't mind a reasonable premium, and the cost on New Year's Eve was $145. That included a champagne toast, and a free disposable camera and party favors on every table, so the price was fairly close to what you'd pay anyway. The optional wine pairings were $85, again a reasonable cost for 9 half-glasses apiece.This was the menu, with wine pairings shown in italics:Crispy carmelized cauliflower, bone marrow, wild American caviarCava, Avinyo Brut, NV (Penedes, Spain)Oyster, salsify, fried lentils, kimchee pureeCava, Avinyo Brut, NV (Penedes, Spain)Foie gras in the roundViognier \"Sanford and Benedict\" Cold Heaven 2005 (Santa Barbara, CA)Smoked eel, blood orange \"zest,\" black radish, chicken skinPouilly-Fuisse \"La Croix\" VV Robert-Denogent 2004 (Burgundy, France)Melted cheddar, black truffle, crispy potato, powdered toastPink Wine Pax 2005 (Sonoma, CA)Mediterranean bass, edamame-rye bread, chive mashedValpolicella Classico Superiore TB Bussola 2003 (Veneto, Italy)Lamb loin, cucumber, pickled tongue, spicy pear, sorrelShiraz \"Lloyd Reserve\" Coriale Vinyards 2001 (McLaren Vale, South Australia)Banana puree, hazelnut, coffee, parsnipCommanderia St. John NV (Lemesos, Cyprus)\"Creamsicle,\" rooibos, squash, orange blossomCommanderia St. John NV (Lemesos, Cyprus)Mango jelly-mastic; Milk chocolate-mentholChampagne toastGuy Charlemagne Rose Brut NV (Champagne, France)Many of the dishes are really indescribable. Dufresne and pastry chef Alex Stupak create combinations of ingredients that you'd never imagine together. How, for instance, does one think of smoked eel, blood orange, black radish, and chicken skin? Just to ask the question is to realize how bizarre it is. And how successful. My friend, who said she normally hates eel, loved this dish.\"Foie gras in the round\" was another really odd concoction. Somehow, Dufresne managed to produce little pellets of foie gras, each about half the size of a small pea. Incredulous, we asked the server how it was done. He replied that it's a trade secret, but it involves liquefying foie gras and combining it with another liquid, an explanation that only adds to the mystery.Each dish is rather small, and sometimes an ingredient is just a dash of crumbs, such as the powdered toast that came with the melted cheddar, or the light dusting of ground coffee that came with the banana puree. Dufresne's gimmickry does not stand in the way of good solid cooking. The Mediterranean bass was impeccably prepared, as was the lamb loin.With so many wacky experiments on the menu, not all could be hits. The gooey oyster (our second course) was dull and not very appetizing. But that was really the only course that I could have done without.The restaurant was full, and service was a bit variable. Several times we were served food before the associated wine pairing arrived. When I asked our server to slow down the parade of courses, he replied, \"Sorry, I don't control the kitchen.\" Our reservation was at 9:00, and we didn't leave till past midnight, so I wouldn't say we were pushed out the door. Still, it wasn't an acceptable answer at a restaurant of WD-50's calibre.WD-50 is one of the more casual fine-dining restaurants in town, although on the Lower East Side it's hard to imagine anything more formal. There were guests in sport coats and fancy dresses, and there were guests in t-shirts and jeans. Most were on the young side, although one table was taken by two older ladies.In 2003, William Grimes of the Times awarded two stars to WD-50, noting Dufresne's undeniable talent, but also that \"diners are more likely to respond with respect than love.\" Three years into the experiment, Dufresne is as sure of his palate as an adoring public is sure of him. This was my second visit to WD-50, so I'm fairly confident that this New Year's Eve performance was no fluke. WD-50 isn't for everyone, but for those open-minded souls willing to to think broadly, it's as good a restaurant as there is.[Update: In March 2007, Frank Bruni of The Times upgraded WD-50 to three stars.]WD-50 (50 Clinton Street between Stanton and Rivington Streets, Lower East Side)Food: ***½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: ***

WD-50? The \"emporer's new clothes\" of restaurants! I'm a size 2 and no glutton, but when a restaurant serves up anorectic-sized portions at prices like Dufresne's,its offensive. I ordered a portion of lasagne as a main course. It came to the table in a morsel that was so small that I told the waiter that it was unaccecptable and he'd have to take it back, since it reflected a profound disrespect on the part of the chef for his clientele. The waiter came back with another portion about one centimeter bigger and it was on the house. This was vegetarian lasagne so I was stunned at the greed factor. After reading the menu for the New Year's Eve dinner at this restaurant, I can see that nothing has changed since my visit about two years ago. Guess he's found a bunch of \"stockbrokers in love\" who don't mind paying big bucks, while Wily(sic) is the one having all the yuks.

I have heard other comments about miniscule portions on the à la carte menu at WD-50. My report, however, was about a tasting menu. When you're having nine courses, you expect them to be small. The portion sizes were comparable to other long tasting menus I've had, and we left the restaurant plenty full. I think I've ordered enough tasting menus to be able to make fair comparisons, and I can say WD-50 gave us our money's worth.

Even if the food occaisionally shows some cooking ability, it still doesnt change tha fact that WD-50 is about weird, not well executed. I don't care what items are paired, or how odd it is- asl long as it makes good sense to do so. Wily Dufrense is no talent... He is pairing the unthinkable for the sake of being different, at all costs. It is a pathetic plea for individuality, and if the diner realizes a dish is no good, then the response is demeaning: \"your food knowledge is too limited for you to appreciate this. Our chef is ahead of your palate\" e.g. \"You don't enjoy the food because you are a tasteless moron.\" Let's face it, the only thing tasteless is the food at WD-50... and the only moron is Dufrense, or anyone who works for him. Does this mean that if I open a restaurant tomorrow, and I make a dish of Jelly bean crusted pig testicles with wet coffee grinds, eggshells and hot sauerkraut juice, that I will be hailed as a \"revolutionary chef\"? Probably, and thats a shame. Wily is a no-talent hack... Period. Thats why no chef will actually eat there twice. Keep up the good work Wily! Can't wait to see the testicle dish back on the menu!

Cafe Mozart is a respectable casual dining option before a concert at Lincoln Center, in a neighborhood where many of the restaurants are over-priced. I was there last night with two friends.I loved a Duo of Goat Cheese Tarts ($9). One of the tarts was made with herb-roasted Roma tomatoes and Niçoise olives; the other with mushrooms and onion marmelade. Plenty of restaurants would charge over $10 for that appetizer. An accompaniment of salad greens was entirely superfluous.Pignoli and dijon crusted salmon ($22) was a far less happy affair. The fish was too dry, and it was not rescued by an overpowering tomato sauce or dull risotto. One of my companions ordered, I believe, a chicken caesar salad in which the chicken was barely more than a rumor, but my other friend was pleased with her choices.My friend tried to make a reservation, but she called repeatedly for several days, and the restaurant never answered. The host was surprised to learn this was the case. Luckily they weren't busy last night, but I hear the place fills up on weekends. Service at Cafe Mozart isn't fancy, with the crew who deliver the plates not knowing who ordered what. We had two different versions of the menu between us, each with different spelling errors. However, wines by the glass are under $10, and that at least is something. Both the website and business cards promise \"World's Finest Desserts.\" We were too full to test that claim, but we noted that there are more desserts than appetizers and entrees put together, so it's clear where the restaurant's priorities lie. The decor is unpretentious, but adequate for a casual restaurant.Cafe Mozart (154 West 70th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue, Upper West Side)Food: SatisfactoryService: Acceptable, but sometimes carelessAmbiance: CasualOverall: Satisfactory

I tried P. J Clarke's on the Hudson with my 11-year-old son about a week ago. It is basically a slightly more upscale version of Houlihan's. Spectacular views of New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty are about all that distinguishes it from a mass of similar restaurants around town.Frank Bruni wasted a reviewing slot here, awarding zero stars:It's better than snobs would like to think and worse than contrarians would hasten to claim, which may be another way of saying that it's usually serviceable and sometimes respectable.At least he provided a history of the world-famous urinals.For the record, a Farmer's Omelet ($10.80) for me and a Buffalo Chicken sandwich ($12.20) for my son were unobjectionable. Service was pretty much invisible until it was time for the check, and suddenly our server became unnaturally chummy.The original P. J. Clarke's has been on the Upper East Side for something like 12o years. Perhaps it has some residual charm that this mass-produced version lacks.P. J.

The loudmouth chef already operates what is arguably the best restaurant in London (the three-star Gordon Ramsay at Royal Hospital Road), along with a bunch of others, including The Savoy Grill, which I visited last summer.The pathway to hell is littered with chefs that opened New York restaurants with four-star aspirations, only to fall short. We'll have to wait till late 2007 for the Michelin Guide, but Frank Bruni in the Times and Adam Platt in New York both delivered withering two-star smackdowns to Gordon Ramsay.Meanwhile, plenty of people are making reservations to find out for themselves. It isn't quite the hot ticket that Per Se was (and still is), but prime times nevertheless fill up quickly. I booked my date at Ramsay exactly two full months in advance, and a 6:15 p.m. reservation was the best I could get.Ramsay offers two seven-course tasting menus at $110 or a three-course prix fixe at $80. While no one would call it inexpensive, it a bargain compared to other top-echelon New York restaurants. Had the major reviews been favorable, I suspect these prices would have gone up promptly. Now, perhaps they'll be stable for a while.I was keen to order the tasting menu, which Ramsay calls the \"Menu Prestige.\" My friend chose the vegetarian tasting menu, and we tried a few bites of each other's plates, so I got a pretty good idea of what Ramsay's cuisine is about. There aren't any \"Wow!\" dishes, but there are no duds either. It is very classical and correct cooking, all executed to a high standard.The bread service came in two flights. First, there were slices of crisp bread with two spreads: cream cheese and foie gras. I could do with plenty more of that foie gras spread. There was also a choice of sourdough or multi-grain bread with unsalted butter.This was the tasting menu:Amuse bouche: White bean and mushroom soup with black truffle. Served in an capuccino cup with the soup whipped in a foam, in fact resembling capuccino.Pressed foie gras and game with port sauce and pickled mushrooms. A rather unmemorable terrine.Lobster ravioli with celery root cream and shellfish vinaigrette. An excellent dish, and I would have liked more of it.Striped bass fillet with pak choi and caviar veloute. Probably the highlight of the meal.Roast cannon of lamb with candied onions, confit tomatoes and marjoram jus. A peculiarly named dish, and for no good reason. There were several slices of rack of lamb, off the bone, and 8-hour braised lamb shoulder. My friend, who usually does not touch lamb, enthused about the braised shoulder, saying it was \"the kind of lamb I could eat.\"Cheese cart. Not as impressive as at several other high-end restaurants (e.g. Chanterelle, Picholine), but certainly very respectable, and I thoroughly enjoyed all that I had.Apriocot souffle with Amaretto ice cream. A can't-miss dessert.The vegetable tasting menu had the following:Amuse bouche: Vegetable soupMarinated beetroot with ricotta and pine nut dressingSweet onion gratin with Parmigiano ReggianoCep risotto with shaved trufflesChef's Preparation, seasonal vegetablesChocolate mousse [substitution]Apricot souffle with Amaretto ice creamMy friend's two favorites were the amuse bouche (which, like mine, came in a small coffee cup) and the chef's preparation of seasonal vegetables. You wouldn't think a plate of sauteed vegetables could stand up as an entree, but Ramsay made it work, and my friend couldn't stop singing its praises. The kitchen was also happy to accommodate my friend's request for a substitution, as neither of the standard choices for the sixth course (grilled pineapple or the cheese cart) appealed to her.I requested a wine pairing, and the sommelier did an excellent job for $60 each. We hadn't discussed price, and I actually expected him to come in considerably higher than he did.Service was friendly and generally excellent, with only minor flaws that at a less-expensive restaurant one wouldn't even bother to notice. Our meal took a bit more than two hours, which seemed just a tad rushed. It's difficult to pace a tasting menu, and this one needed a bit more leisure. At one point I asked a server to slow down, but it didn't seem to make much difference.The room is comfortable and elegant, with tables widely spaced, and heavily padded armchairs to sit in. Our table would have been large enough for a party of four at many restaurants. After dinner, we were offered a tour of the kitchen. It is a huge space, as the same kitchen is responsible for the main dining room, the adjoining London Bar (a casual \"tapas\" restaurant), and I believe the hotel's room service operation as well. Everything is immaculate, and you can easily see why they are proud to show it off. We walked by the chef's table that blogger Augieland raved about. I'm sure the guests there are fed like kings, but with servers and touring diners constantly walking by, it's no place for privacy.Ramsay did not earn the coveted four-star ranking from Frank Bruni. The Times critic has been on the job for 2½ years, and has yet to award four stars to a restaurant that opened on his watch. (For the record, Bruni was the first to rate Per Se and Masa, but they were already open before he landed the job. His other four-star write-ups have been re-reviews.) Surely he is itching to pull the trigger. But Bruni has made it clear that he has little interest in traditional formality. Bruni also has the modern critical bias (shared with many others) against restaurants that do classic things well without generating a lot of excitement.I have only one meal to go on, but if I were reviewing for the Times, I would have awarded three stars. In its elegance and polish, Gordon Ramsay is in some respects better than many of the three-star restaurants I've visited, but it doesn't have the \"Wow!\" factor that the best restaurants deliver.Gordon Ramsay at The London (151 W. 54th Street between 6th & 7th Avenues, West Midtown)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***½Overall: ***

The possible reason for the lowered rating by Messrs. Platt and Bruni may have to do with their dislike for Mr. Ramsay's style. The New Yorker Magazine actually had a small blip where they discredited him for his choice of going against the culinary norm of dress (short sleevs vs long sleeves)...of all things! As someone who does not believe in someone else's heresay, I will make my way to the restaurant and decide for myself. Anyway, one must read the Gordon Ramsay biography, for he most certainly has come a very loooonnnng way, and I have nothing but the utmost respect for the man, his success, his dress, and most of all his food!You have a very nice site and I thank you for sharing! My site is still under construction, but please do feel free to browse. Cheers,Antiquairia

One additional small note on the subject of restaurant ratings...The recent New Yorker Magazine \"New York vs. London\" issue (which you must take a gander at) indicated in their NYC vs London foodies survey that London restaurants have access to fresher ingredients/produce etc. compared to NYC restaurants. How can they not be especially with Paris as a neighbour? PS-The butter served in Paris has a three day expiry date! A delicious delight. Surely, it cannot get fresher than that (smile)! The other small, but happy pleasure is to actually be able to spread the this creamy version across one's baquette w/o it (and the bread) crumbling up into bits and pieces as it does here in the New York City establishments.Kindest regards,Antiquairia

I agree with the comment about \"not trusting someone else's heresay.\" But with literally thousands of restaurants to choose from, you cannot entirely avoid being influenced by what others have said, because there isn't enough time or money to try everything for yourself.Thanks for the kind words about the site.

Note: Click here for a more recent review.In late 2001, restauranteurs Jimmy Bradley and Danny Abrams made a gutsy move: they opened The Harrison just a month after 9/11. Obviously the concept had long predated the attacks, but many with queasier stomachs would have postponed the opening or backed out entirely.In those days, with many of the streets still cut off from traffic, you could barely get to The Harrison. But Bradley and Abrams were confident that the restaurant's fortunes would rise as the neighborhood bounced back. Two months later, they were proud parents of a two-star restaurant (per William Grimes in the Times).The Harrison is a close cousin of the flagship Bradley/Abrams property, The Red Cat in Chelsea. But I was not very much enchanted with The Red Cat; it seemed to me a decent neighborhood restaurant, nothing more. The Harrison has a dash of elegance that I found lacking in The Red Cat, and the cooking seems to me more accomplished.I dined at The Harrison last night with a colleague. Coincidentally, we both landed on the identical menu choices. We started with Pork Belly ($12), a decadently rich preparation that must be one of the highest-calorie appetizers in New York. Breast of duck ($28) was perfectly prepared, served on a bed of quark spaetzle, and accompanied by a kicker of seared foie gras curiously not mentioned on the menu. At the end, we shared a cheese plate, which was also excellent.I recognize the reasons why immigrants often land in the restaurant industry, but it can be frustrating at a restaurant of The Harrison's calibre when the server can't quite communicate. Before we ordered, he blurted out, \"We have grilled salmon\" (he pronounced it sal-mon). He was obviously telling us a daily special, but couldn't explain anything about its preparation. We had already settled on the duck anyway (specials should be explained before you start contemplating the menu, not after), but he wasn't making much of a case for that poor salmon, except that it was \"grilled.\"When our plate of seven cheeses arrived, the explanation was incomprehensible. We decided not to trouble him further. Aside from that, service was just fine. Our server clearly understood our orders, even if his explanations were lacking.I like the room at The Harrison. It's not the restaurant's fault that there are large glass doors lining two of the dining room's four walls, and there are also tables along those walls. Glass is a poor insulator, and on a cold winter night those tables will get chilly. We were at such a table, but luckily it hasn't been a very cold December. As temperatures start to fall, those tables may start to feel like Siberia. In the summer, they're probably delightful.I don't know if everything at The Harrison is as good as the pork belly, the duck, and the cheese plate, but it has been a long time since a restaurant in this price range hit a home run on all three courses. To drink, we had a sublime Saint-Emilion, Grand Cru, 2001 Chateau Haut-Segottes, at $68.The Harrison is certainly worth another visit.The Harrison (355 Greenwich Street at Harrison Street, TriBeCa)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Note: Town closed over the Easter weekend in April 2009. Geoffrey Zakarian operates two upscale restaurants in Manhattan. Country has garnered tons of press this year, including a three-star review from Frank Bruni, a star from Michelin, and if I may humbly say so, four stars on this website. Its older sibling, Town, doesn't get the buzz any more, as if the hip crowd has moved on-perhaps to Country. Town's website announces a $71 prix fixe at dinner, but on Sunday night the menu was available à la carte. This is a hard review to write, because the savory courses my friend ordered were a lot better than mine. Lobster bisque, a steal at $13, had great chunks of succulent lobster floating in a broth that was just about perfect. Filet mignon ($39) was almost tender enough to cut without a knife and had a beautiful exterior char. It was one of the few times I've been impressed with steak in a non-steakhouse restaurant. But my choices, Tuna Tartare ($21) and Bass Papillote ($36), correct and proper, did nothing to set themselves apart, which at those prices I believe they should do. There was nothing wrong with them-they just did not wow. When I think back on the meal, it will be tastes of my friend's lobster bisque and filet that I remember. About the dessert there was no doubt: we ordered the chocolate souffle for two ($20), a large gooey serving of what must be the dessert served in heaven, with an accompanying hunk of spearmint spumoni. The next day, my friend e-mailed me, \"Bring me a souffle. I need another one.\" (I replied that they don't travel well.) Inexpensive wines aren't abundant at a restaurant like Town. My friend was content to nurse a glass of rose champagne ($24), while I had two contrasting wines by the glass ($13-14). The imposing multi-level space is beautiful to look at. Service is elegant and polished. Town (15 W. 56th Street between 5th and 6th Avenues, West Midtown) Food: **½Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: **½

I don't know if the à la carte menu is a permanent change, or a Sunday-only thing. On the Town website, the only option is a $71 prix fixe. If the menu is ALC, then I assume you could visit just for dessert.By the way, if the switch to à la carte IS permanent, it almost certainly means the restaurant is having trouble.

I'm tired of prefixe menus. Why does a switch to a la carte signal trouble?
Marc Shepherd
2006-12-31 00:00:00
You may be tired of them, but prix-fixe-only menus are synonymous with high-end fine dining in this city. Nearly all of the most luxurious places in town are prix-fixe only (some offer a tasting menu as an even more expensive choice). This includes all five of the restaurants that currently carry four stars from the Times.If Town has now switched to an à la carte option, it almost certainly signals that they are having trouble filling the room, and are trying to attract customers by making the price point more accessible. That's why I suggested that the restaurant may be in trouble.

Note: Devi closed in August 2007 after various differences of opinion between the chefs and the owners. In September, The New York Times reported that the chefs had bought the space, and it re-opened in October 2007.Indian cuisine, like Mexican, Italian and Chinese, can be found in New York just about everywhere you look. Nine out of ten restaurants offer the standard dishes that you could name in your sleep. Truly memorable Indian restaurants are rare.Devi, which opened in 2004, is that rare exception. It earned two stars from Frank Bruni, which is almost the high-water mark for an Indian restaurant, as only Tabla carries three. This year, the Michelin Guide agreed, awarding a star - one of the few granted to a restaurant not serving European (or Euro-inspired) cuisine.I dined at Devi not long after it opened, and it was on my short list for a return visit. On Saturday, my friend and I had the six-course tasting menu, which at $60 is a bargain. We made different choices for most courses where a selection was offered, so I got to taste most of the menu.Calcutta Jhaal Muri (rice puffs, red onions, chickpeas, green chilies, mustard oil, lemon juice)orSalmon Crab Cake (tomato chutney mayonaise)I had the salmon crab cake, which was just fine, but I would have liked a little more spice in the tomato chutney mayonaise.Tandoori Quail (spicy fig chutney)orGrilled Scallops (roasted red pepper chutney, Manchurian cauliflower, spicy bitter-orange marmelade)I think the quail was the better deal here, as it was the whole bird, and the piece I tasted was wonderful. The \"scallops\" were in fact a single scallop, and tasted just a tad under-cooked.At around this time, the server dropped off a plate of the spinach & goat cheese bread, which was probably the best bread I've ever had in an Indian restaurant. We were glad to have eight slices of it to share; we noticed that a nearby table of four received the identical portion.Mirchi Wali Machi (roasted pepper chutney, spiced radish rice, fish of the day)orVeal Liver & Brain Bruschetta (veal with quail egg and green chilies, liver with cinnamon, tomatoes and onions)I'm pretty adventurous, but neither of us had the guts to try the liver & brain dish, so that left us both with the fish, which I believe was a black bass, enjoyably spiced.Tandoori Prawns (eggplant pickle, crispy okra)Once again, the restaurant had a little trouble distinguishing singular and plural. This was a prawn, not prawns. Eggplant is one of the few foods I never enjoy, but my friend thought this dish was just fine.Tandoor-Grilled Lamb Chops (sweet & sour pear chutney, spiced potatoes)You can probably guess what's coming: one chop from a rack of lamb, not chops. I thought this was competently done, but I would have liked a more crisp exterior to the chop.Emperor's Morsel (Shahi Tukra) (crispy saffron bread pudding, cardamom cream, candied almonds)orPistachio Kulfi (Indian ice cream, candied pistachio, citrus soup)I get almost weak-kneed at the thought of bread pudding, and Devi's presentation didn't disappoint.The alcohol, just like the tasting menu, is very reasonably priced. Specialty cocktails I tried ($12) included the Cilantro Tonic (Hendrick's gin, cilantro, tonic, lime) and Hard Limeade (Kaffir lime vodka, guanabana nectar, lime juice). Paired wines with the tasting menu would have been $40 apiece, but we decided to spend that amount on a bottle to share between us.The bi-level space is striking. Like most of Devi, it isn't cut from the same generic cloth as most Indian restaurants. We were seated upstairs, where it almost feels like you're at a small private dinner party. Service was solid and assured throughout.Devi (8 East 18th Street between Fifth Avenue & Broadway, Gramercy)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: ***Overall: **

Five Points is one of those restaurants that New York Magazine calls an \"haute barnyard,\" specializing in seasonal ingredients sourced from local providers. Cookshop in Chelsea, owned by the same team, is a close soulmate, serving many of the same menu items. Five Points is a bit more romantic, with its candle-lit room, leafy decor, and a table layout that emphasizes seating for couples. I started with a grilled mushroom salad that seemed to be almost an afterthought to the kitchen. The mushrooms were just dumped on the plate with mixed greens. They tasted fine, but the plating was uninspired. My friend's house-made country pate was a large portion, but I found it similarly uninspired.For the main course, we both had the double-cut pork chop with a roasted apple sauce and pepper cress, which I rated an improvement on the appetizers: a comfort food competently prepared.Five Points may not be a leader in its category, but the food is respectable and the space is easy on the eyes. Prices are quite reasonable, with appetizers from$8.50-13, and main courses from $17-28.Five Points (31 Great Jones Street between Lafayette & Bowery, NoHo)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Note: My enthusiasm for Dominic was evidently not widely shared. It closed in mid-2007. Truth to tell, I was always surprised it lasted as long as it did, as it was never crowded, and it was always offering happy-hour and holiday specials. As of September 2007, the space was still vacant.Last week, I had to arrange dinner for 31 people in TriBeCa. I wanted something memorable, but not ridiculously expensive. Dominic was the low bidder, at $55 per head, beating out places like Devin Tavern and City Hall by a considerable margin. The price included a half-hour open bar with hors d'oeuvres.I knew from past experience that the restaurant would do a solid job with the food, and the crowd would enjoy Dominic's sleek interior and Latin ambiance.The set menu offered a choice of three appetizers, three mains and three desserts, as follows:Seared Beef Carpaccio (truffle cheese, sweet and sour onions, Manodori balsamico)Classic Caesar Salad (prepared tableside)Risotto Farm Style (sauteed shrimp, basil and truffle oil)Spinach, Ricotta and Corn Ravioli (balsamic brown butter)Grilled Salmon (olive tapenade, slow roasted fennel, red wine)Grilled Hangar Steak (grilled trevisano and asparagus sald, wild mushrooms, bone marrow gremolata)Molten Chocolate Cake (raspberry chocolate sauce)Apple Crepes Tart (vanilla tuile and caramel sauce)Our Famous Sognos \"Beautiful little dreams\" (cinammon sugar puffs, raspberry & chocolate dipping sauces)At this type of meal, one just says a prayer that courses will be served together, without significant delays, and without tasting like it was catered for a VFW convention. Dominic did a whole lot better than that, and indeed everyone was pleased. I would add that they extended the open bar to a full hour at no extra charge, and had custom-printed menus for the occasion. The maitre d' also selected a very respectable Syrah at $32 a bottle, which is a good $8-10 less than what one might have paid for the same bottle elsewhere in town.With tax and tip, the bill came out to around $91 a person. Every other place I checked was at least $20 a head more. The three dishes I had (the risotto, the salmon, and the cinammon sugar puffs) were all competently prepared. Actually, I'm going to remember those cinammon puffs for a long time.Dominic (349 Greenwich Street between Harrison & Jay Streets, TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

What's the best restaurant in Manhattan that has never had a rated review from the Times? My vote goes to Thalassa, which carries three stars on this website. I've eaten there four times-enough to be sure that the strong impression it left with me wasn't just a flash in the pan. The line between two and three stars may be fairly debated, but with the less-impressive Periyali carrying two stars from the Times (and that a recent assessment, per Bruni), my three for Thalassa doesn't seem unreasonable.I had another excellent dinner at Thalassa this week. Maine Diver Scallops came wrapped in kataifi with sheep's, milk butter and a balsamic reduction. A black cod dish marked the first time I've had that fish without miso paste, and I'm happy to say that cod doesn't need any accompaniments when it's as delicately prepared as it was here.With most fish entrees over $30, and many over $40, the bill can mount in a hurry, but this is one of the better seafood restaurants in the city. It is also an attractive and refined space, and service is excellent. I dined with four colleagues who, like many people, ahd never heard of Thalassa. Now, they're all fans.Thalassa (179 Franklin Street between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, TriBeCa)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Note: Urena closed in 2007, re-opening (with the same chef, and in the same space) as Pamplona, offering more casual and traditional Spanish fare.The restaurants on Alex Urena's resume read like a Who's Who of the dining industry, from the River Cafe in Brooklyn, to Bouley, Blue Hill, and Ferran Adrià's El Bulli in Spain. Earlier this year, he finally opened his own place, the aptly named Urena, which we visited on Saturday evening.The appetizers seemed to show the influence of Urena's El Bulli apprenticeship. Texturas De Foie Gras ($17) had three treatments of foie gras, described on the menu as \"foie gras buffuelo with spice scented red plum puree, foiegras terrine with cocoa rib garache and chocolate tuile, foie gras yogurt with yellow current.\" A bit less wacky, but still unusual, was my friend's foie gras terrine ($17), in which foie gras was interleaved with braised beef cheeks.The entrees, on the other hand, seemed to be out of the Blue Hill playbook. Cochinillo Confitado ($25), or suckling pig confit, came with a granny smith apple puree, shitake mushrooms, and wilted green leaf lettuce. My friend's slow-cooked chicken ($25) was another example of unfussed ingredients skillfully prepared. The amuse bouche was also in this category, a delicious warm parsnip soup. The petits-fours showed Urena's wilder side again, with delicately sculpted chocolate lollipops.After it opened, the critics lambasted Urena's decor, truly a charmless performance. If the designer was paid, the restaurant deserves a refund. They have made the corrections they could. Harsh white lighting mentioned in early reviews seems to be dimmer now, and I didn't hear any of the \"cheesy recorded music\" Frank Bruni complained about. But the place still screams for a makeover, as do the staff, who don't seem to be held to any kind of dress code. A flat screen TV in the bar area looks new; the only thing it plays is a video of a roaring fireplace.On the plus side, service was fairly good for a restaurant in Urena's class. Most tables were occupied, but the staff didn't lose track of us, which isn't a given at mid-priced restaurants these days. The noise level was modest, and tables were more generously spaced than at many comparable establishments.We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at Urena. We weren't in the mood for a long tasting menu, but a $125 chef's degustation caught our eye, and we made a mental note to come back and try it. Aside from the tasting menu, prices are quite modest for a restaurant of this caliber, with no entrees priced higher than $29. The wine list, too, is unusually generous, with several fine choices under $40.Urena (37 East 28th Street between Park & Madison Avenues, Gramercy)Food: ***Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: **

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Mas (farmhouse). I've had Mas on my mind since it opened in 2004. Although Frank Bruni in the Times was lukewarm, awarding just one star, Adam Platt raved in New York. I was more inclined to trust Platt. But I tend to make most of my bookings just a few days in advance, and it seemed Mas was always full. Anyhow, I finally got my act together, and scored a 6:45 p.m. table on Friday night. The restaurant's name means \"farmhouse\" in Provençal. Indeed, the decor announces its rusticity beginning with the enormous wooden door. However, it is also one of the more elegant restaurants in Greenwich Village, with its white tablecloths, bone china, and polished service. The farmhouse reference also suggests Galen Zamarra's zeal for seasonal ingredients. The menu changes daily, with only about six or seven appetizers, and a similar number of entrees. Each one comes with a long list of accompaniments, such as \"Roasted beets baked with Westfield Farm goat cheese, baby greens, almonds & cucumbers\"; or, \"Roasted wild sea trout, thumbelina carrot stew, beans & white asparagus.\" Alas, there is no online version of what we had. The amuse bouche was a small square of butternut squash quiche-naturally, with three or four other ingredients that the server dutifully recited. My friend and I both started with the Trout Piscator ($16). She said, \"There's no way you'll be able to describe everything that's in here.\" Even Frank Bruni was stumped, simply referring to \"the delicious trout appetizer.\" The chicken entree ($34) was more straightforward: it came with wild mushrooms and mashed potatoes. The skin was crisp, the flesh tender. My friend ordered turkey ($36), which we both found slightly dry and a bit less flavorful. It did strike me that even the better of the two dishes, the chicken, was a tad over-priced at $34. Only a restaurant like Mas would offer a butternut squash cake ($10) for dessert and get away with it, but the accompanying raspberry sorbet was an odd bedfellow. The wine list is excellent, but expensive. I noted only one red under $50. We were delighted with a Herman Story Grenache, but at $70 it was more than we usually pay for wine. Service was polished and attentive. Mas is one of those restaurants that does not leave the open wine bottle on your table. I usually prefer to control the bottle myself, but I didn't mind at Mas, as they were always diligent about refilling our glasses. The one glitch was the bread service, which came with butter that was still frozen. Mas always makes the list of the city's most romantic restaurants. The room is charming, the service excellent, and the food first-class.

Note: 7Square closed abruptly in February 2007 after it ran out of money. It just goes to show that having hotel guests and theater patrons as a captive audience is no guarantee of success. Hardly a month goes by without a new steakhouse opening in Manhattan. The new restaurant 7Square seems to be yet another of these, with its billing as \"A Modern Chophouse.\" But of eleven entrees, the only one straight out of the steakhouse playbook is a ribeye. Other menu items that cater to carnivores aren't steak per se, and would be at home just about anywhere: rack of lamb, pork chop, and short ribs, for instance. The chef, Shane McBride, trained at four-star Lespinasse, and much of the menu at 7Square suggests that he isn't content to replicate the steakhouse format by rote. A Dirty Rice Risotto ($12) is laced with duck confit, smoked duck ham, and andouille sausage. In pleasure given per dollar spent, it beats most risottos in town. Other appetizers caught my eye (though I didn't try them). \"HAM2\" ($14), a \"unique tasting of artisanal hams,\" sure looked interesting. I've also heard good things about the steak tartare ($12). At these prices, it couldn't hurt to experiment. Main courses are $15-34, with most in the twenties. In the latest style, the menu tells you the biography of the animal you are eating. The pork chop comes from Niman Ranch, the veal chop from Upstate New York, the chicken breast from an Amish farm, the lamb rack from Colorado, and the ribeye from Wolfe's Neck Farm. I tried the ribeye ($32) after Adam Platt raved about it. Served off the bone, it's a slightly smaller cut than most steakhouses serve, which means you can actually finish it. The marbling and exterior char were first-rate-indeed, better than I was served at Porter House. Sometimes the best bread service comes in the most unexpected places. 7Square serves warm rosemary cornbread that's out-of-this-world. It would be worth stopping in for an appetizer, just to have more of that cornbread. Located in the Time Hotel, 7Square's decor is attractive and comfortable, but appropriately informal for the neighborhood. The service is a bit careless at times, but not annoyingly so. The food is actually good enough that you don't need the excuse of seeing a show to dine there. This is one of the few restaurants in the Theater District that you can take seriously. 7 Square (224 W 49th Street between Eighth Avenue and Broadway, Theater District) Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Note: Andrew Carmellini, the chef when this review was written, has left A Voce. His replacement is Missy Robbins, who comes to New York from the Chicago restaurant Spiaggia. A branch of A Voce will be opening at the Time-Warner Center, replacing Cafe Gray. Click here for more on the A Voce debacle. A Voce is the first solo restaurant by Andrew Carmellini, who had been the popular chef de cuisine at Cafe Boulud. It was one of the biggest hits of 2006, scoring three stars from Frank Bruni and another from Michelin. The restaurant is full almost every night of the week. I had wanted to visit a lot sooner, but it never seemed to be available when I was. When I saw that a 6:15 p.m. slot was available on Sunday evening, I grabbed it. My friend and I started with the duck meatballs ($15), which every reviewer has raved about. They are indeed a tasty delight, but I must say that neither of us could taste any trace of the foie gras that the servers insist is in there. A pork chop with onion glazing ($30), one of the daily specials, was done to perfection. My friend ordered the braised short ribs, at $39 the most expensive entree (unless you're having the truffle tasting). The preparation was certainly first-rate, although it seemed to me a bit over-priced, in that the best short ribs in town, at Cafe Gray, are \"only\" $38. The price of the short ribs, however, had nothing on the wine list, which featured many bottles over $1,000, and tons more well over $100. For a casual restaurant where the waiters wear dockers, it seemed to us incongruous. I did finally settle on a pinot noir a shade under $50. I was quite irritated to find that the restaurant kept the open bottle on a serving station, out of my reach. I generally prefer to control a bottle that I've paid for, especially when the serving staff are going to disappear for long stretches-as they do when A Voce gets busy. For dessert, I ordered a maple-walnut cheesecake ($10), which seemed more like a parfait. As I see it, the word \"cheesecake\" conveys definite meaning, and restaurants shouldn't be putting it on their menu unless they intend to serve something at least approximating a cheesecake. Bread service came in the form of addictive warm home-made bread and olive oil, although there wasn't enough of the latter. Although the menu is expensive, the atmosphere at A Voce is informal. The space is attractively decorated, and the swivel chairs are quite comfortable. But the tables are fairly close together, the noise level builds rapidly, and the serving staff gets a little stretched as the restaurant fills up. Andrew Carmellini's upscale Italian cuisine is wonderful, but he hasn't really provided the elegant stage on which it deserves to shine.

Your comment about the expense of the wines is jarring. When A Voce opened, what was notable about the wine list was how many choices it offered in the $40 range -- something I thought was particularly admirable for a place of this ambition. I'm sorry to see they haven't kept that up.

Note: Fresh closed in September 2008. The idea behind Fresh is simple enough. Eric Tevrow, the owner, also owns Early Morning Seafood, which supplies the fish to \"every four star and several three and two star restaurants in the city.\" So in 2002 he opened his own place in TriBeCa, scoring two stars from Eric Asimov in the Times. Shore, a casual New England-style fish shack, followed in 2004, and Coast a year or so after that. I paid enjoyable visits to Fresh and Shore a couple of years ago, and to Coast a while later. Shore and Coast were saddled with abysmal locations, and both failed. Fresh still seems to be holding its own. It was perhaps a shade over half full on a recent Thursday evening, with what appeared to be a mix of business diners, families, and romantic couples. A Ceviche of Artic Char ($12) was uncomplicated, with the lively—well, freshness of the fish—allowed to speak for itself. The excellent Pumpkin Seed Crusted Flounder ($27) took the opposite approach. It came plated in a tower (à la Gotham Bar and Grill) on a bed of chanterelles and butternut squash, and all of the ingredients worked well together. My mom was pleased with Spicy Seafood Stew ($31)—not all that spicy, she said. My girlfriend had the English Batter-fried Haddock ($21), an upscale fish-and-chips that was somewhat misplaced at this type of restaurant; she said it was soggy, and wondered how such a simple dish could be the one they screwed up. The décor at Fresh somewhat over-plays the seafood theme, with its wicker chairs and blue-tinged walls, suggesting a Caribbean resort with faded charms. But there is nothing at all faded about the excellent seafood, which is why I'll be going back to Fresh. Service is efficient, and tables are generously spaced, making for a sedate atmosphere that is increasingly rare in Manhattan. Be sure to order one of the specialty martinis, which come in funky glasses with curved stems that are unlike anything I've seen.

Le Veau d'Or

***CONTENT
Le Veau d'Or (\"The Golden Calf\") has been serving traditional French cuisine since 1937. They say it has hardly changed since then. The owner, Robert Treboux, who lives upstairs, looks like he's about 85. The only waiter appears to be about 75. The lavatories probably haven't been renovated since the Eisenhower administration.Craig Claiborne awarded four stars in the 1960s. The last rated review I can find comes from Mimi Sheraton in 1977. She awarded one star, but it almost sounds like she's describing a different place:One recommended formula for success in the restaurant business is to have a jam-packed, noisy, elbow-to-elbow setting with plenty of bumping and pushing among waiters and clientele and an overall atmosphere suggestive of a subway rush. The idea, supposedly, is that everyone wants to be where everyone else wants to be and that such a place is necessarily part of the \"in\" scene. It is a theory that certainly gains credence at Le Veau d'Or, the 31-year-old, very authentic French bistro...Recent visits indicated, unfortnately, that although the three-deep scene at the bar is still intact, and waiters continue practically to trample patrons standing at the door so they can serve the awkwardly placed front tables, the food is not nearly what it used to be, with only a few exceptions. The myth, apparently, is outliving the reality.Sheraton considered the prices \"moderately high,\" the wines \"overpriced,\" and the atmosphere \"jammed, noisy, attractive.\" As far as I can find, the last Times critic to mention it was William Grimes, in an article called \"The Restaurants That Time Forgot.\"Not long ago, a stylish South American woman walked into Le Veau d'Or, a small French bistro near Bloomingdale's. She had not set foot in the place for 40 years, but looking around, all seemed in order. The decor remained intact, with the painting of a calf sleeping in bed, the covers pulled up under its chin. The menu, a rote recitation of bistro classics, certainly hadn't changed. But something was not quite right. \"Have you changed some of the waiters?\" she asked suspiciously. Robert Treboux, the owner, tried to break the news gently. \"I told her, 'Some have died, some have gotten rich,'\" he said. \"It was a very funny question.\"I've been thinking of a visit to Le Veau d'Or for about a year now. My mom is in town, and she loves nothing more than classic French cooking. A review in this week's Sun reminded me. It was time to give it a try.You might think that no one under sixty visits Le Veau d'Or, but you'd be wrong. We actually saw young people there. Their presence gives hope that Le Veau d'Or could be with us for a long while-assuming Monsieur Treboux and his heirs hold on.The menu at Le Veau d'Or is as classic as it gets, but you don't need to be on Social Security to appreciate it. Whatever your age, you'll love the prices. M. Treboux owns the place free-and-clear, and he has no need to jack up the bill. You get three courses for around $30, all impeccably prepared. One of the best wines we've had in a while was just $42 for the bottle.We started with the escargots ($8 suppl.), and if anyone is preparing it better, we'd like to know who it is. It was decadent as all get-out. What's not to like about garlic and melted butter? We happily mopped up every drop with the French bread. Duck with cherry sauce ($29) came with wild rice and a helping of potatoes au gratin that could easily become addictive. The duck was perhaps a bit dry, but I didn't leave a morsel behind, and it was an ample portion (half the bird).Rum parfait was nothing complicated: chocolate ice cream with rum poured on top. But the waiter left the rum bottle, and I added plenty more. Coffee came, and we added rum to that too. They didn't seem to mind.Many other dishes appeared to be worth a look on future visits. Even after a full dinner, my mouth was watering at a half-rack of lamb, delivered to an adjacent party and carved tableside. Cassoulet also looked impressive. Many dishes are finished at the table, with sauces coming in gravy boats or large copper pots.The serving staff (the lone waiter and a busboy) are occasionally confused. We got a good look at that cassoulet because it was delivered to our table by mistake. The waiter smiled wryly when we pointed out the error. Earlier, when my mom asked if the duck was good, he had a deadpan reply: \"If it wasn't good, we wouldn't serve it.\"A few patrons at Le Veau d'Or wanted to practice their French. One man asked the watier, \"Êtes-vous français?\" \"Non, je suis Americain,\" replied the obviously French waiter.The food came out a little slowly, but we were having a good time and were in no hurry. With less than half of the restaurant's seventeen tables taken, they were in no rush to get rid of us. If we wanted, I think we could still be there.My mom and I wished that my late father could have seen this place. There are few places like it any more-even in France. There's a slightly frayed elegance to the bistro decor, as old French songs play in the background. Yet, it is entirely sincere. What's not to love?Le Veau d'Or (129 E. 60th Street between Park & Lexington Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: **

Thanks for capturing the essence of Le Veau d'or. How I long for a place of this vintage here in Victoria, BC. I can think of no restaurant which has survived since my arrival in 1970. Lucky you. What I wouldn't do for one dinner where \"character\" is as indispensable as the food...and at $30. Wow! Give me the good ol' days. And as far as the age of the staff...the older the better I say. Thanks for a good read.

My first visit to Hearth was a couple of years ago. My enthusiasm fell short of the rapture on the food boards, and the restaurant wasn't high on my list for a return visit. The rapturous comments never died down, so last night I thought it was about time I gave Hearth another look. Boy, am I glad I did.My mom and I decided to order different things and swap plates, so each of us had a taste of two appetizers and two entrees. To start, I ordered the Snapper Crudo ($12). Five small pieces of snapper were topped with lemon, red pepper and rosemary. Amanda Hesser, in her 2004 review for the Times, complained there was \"lots of flavor, none from the snapper.\" Perhaps they've improved the dish, or Hesser doesn't understand crudo. I thought it offered a well judged mix of contrasting flavors.Having said that, if you'd like something more tangy, go for the Grilled Sardines ($13). My mom found the sardines slightly fishy, but I really enjoyed their crunchy warm exterior mixed with the accompanying salad of crosnes, black radish, raisins, and pine nuts.The most expensive entree is the Braised and Roasted Domestic Lamb ($33), with lamb sausage, squash, and chanterelle mushrooms. It also might be one of the best lamb dishes in the city. Three tender medallions of lamb loin come with a strip of braised lamb shank so tender that the bone is nearly liquefied. The sausage is terrific. We also tried the pork belly, a special not on the printed menu ($28). This came with two ample squares of crisp pork belly.My mom and I debated whether the lamb or the pork belly was better. We each slightly preferred the one we had started with-the lamb in my case, the pork in hers, but we agreed that both dishes were excellent. We hadn't planned it this way, but it turns out we ordered the same dishes at Blue Hill three weeks ago: pork and lamb. Hearth did a better job at both, and Hearth also had the better appetizers.Hearth also has a much better wine program than Blue Hill. It might be one of the better wine programs in the city, short of the four-star and a handful of the top three-star restaurants. Co-owner Paul Grieco, a former beverage director at Gramercy Tavern, has a lot to say about his wines, and he's not shy about it. Many of the wine list's 33 pages come with their own mini-lecture. One page has five paragraphs about a single $85 bottle. Other pages compare various wines to Tom Cruise, Brittney Spears, Ann Coulter, Wayne Gretzky, and even former U. S. Senator Jesse Helms. I am not sure who really has the time to read all of this during dinner, but when all the talking is over with, Grieco has a great wine list-a tad pricy for this type of restaurant, but lots of fun. We settled on a cabernet franc at $47 (Les Picasses, Olga Raffault, 2002), and I was sorry the bottle wasn't bottomless.Service was a little slow. I didn't put them on a clock, but it seemed we were left with menus in our hands for quite a while before anyone came over to speak to us. (The menu is a single loose sheet of placemat-sized paper; surely they could do better than that.) Only then were we told about the off-menu pork belly special, after we'd already been pondering our choices for quite a while. The server then disappeared for another long interval so that we could ponder the pork belly option. Luckily, we had that long wine list to read. At some point, the server dropped off the amuse bouche, a shooter of delicious hot parsnip soup. But it was another long interval, and we still hadn't ordered. Anyhow, once orders were taken, the rest of the service proceeded at a decent pace.The ambiance at Hearth is casual, with wooden tables, exposed brick, and a ceiling painted a peculiar shade of burnt red. There is no actual hearth visible, but the name is appropriate for its suggestion of home comfort, which Hearth provides. It's the perfect setting for Marco Canora's excellent cuisine, which I look forward to sampling again soon.Hearth (403 E. 12th Street at First Avenue, East Village)Food: ***Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Jean Georges. The dining room at Jean GeorgesOver at eGullet, there's a long-standing discussion thread that asks: \"Has Jean-Georges Vongerichten Jumped the Shark? Or does he still have the magic touch?\" In other words, can a chef manage an empire of sixteen restaurants, and still turn out four-star food at his flagship, the eponymous Jean Georges? To be sure, many of those restaurants don't generate the excitement they once did. JoJo has left me underwhelmed on each of two visits; I found Perry St uneven (though many swear by it); most people won't touch Spice Market with a ten-foot pole; Frank Bruni demoted both Vong and Mercer Kitchen earlier this year; and V Steakhouse at the Time-Warner Center folded quickly. I was a fan of 66 before it closed, but few diners took it seriously. No other elite chef has attempted to juggle so many responsibilities at once. But against all odds, most people agree that Jean Georges is still the extraordinary restaurant it was in 1997, when Ruth Reichl awarded four stars, a verdict that Frank Bruni re-confirmed earlier this year. The Michelin Guide has been the butt of every imaginable criticism, but no one disputes that the Michelin inspectors know French cooking, and the Guide has awarded its top honor of three stars to Jean Georges in each of the last two years. That's the backdrop to my own first visit to Jean Georges last weekend for a 46th birthday celebration. The restaurant offers a choice of four courses prix fixe at $95, a seven-course tasting of Vongerichten favorites at $125, or a seven-course seasonal tasting menu, also $125. We chose the autumn tasting menu, which was fairly close to what is now displayed on MenuPages (sure to change in the near future): Hamachi Sashimi Fresh Herbs, Champagne Grapes and ButtermilkFoie Gras Brule Spiced Jam and Toasted BriocheWild Mushroom Tea Parmesan, Chili and ThymeRed Snapper Lily Bulb-radish Salad, White Sesame and LavenderButter-Poached Maine Lobster Fuji Apple, Endive and Crystallized WasabiRoasted Venison Quince Madeira Condiment, Broccoli Rabe and Cabrales FoamDessert Tasting (The night we were there, the first course on the menu was scallops, but we requested the Hamachi Sashimi as a substitution.) The were two highlights. Foie Gras Brule was one of the best foie gras preparations we could recall, with a light crisp crust covering a perfectly prepared lobe of foie gras, and the spiced jam adding a contrasting flavor kick. Likewise, the snapper was probably the best seafood dish we've had all year, again because of the contrast of ingredients-the fish and the radish salad. On the other hand, the Hamachi Sashimi, the Lobster, and the Venison, are all dishes I will quickly forget. My friend and I had different reactions to the Wild Mushroom Tea (actually a soup). This dish is served tableside from a silver bowl, with the warm soup poured over parmesan shavings. My friend seems to have gotten far more of the chili peppers than I did, so whereas my portion lacked the contrast that is essential to these dishes, her portion was far more successful. I haven't found the desserts anywhere on the web, and after seven courses I'm afraid my memory has failed me. I do know that we were offered a trio of options, each of which was a quartet of small desserts on a square plate. I have completely forgotten what they were, but all four were excellent-and it is rare that I feel that way about desserts. This was followed up by petits-fours and servings of home-made flavored marshmallows, cut tableside from large multi-colored strips. There was also, of course, birthday cake. The amuses bouches were also strong. As often occurs in restaurants like this, the server's explanations went by all too quickly, but there was a trio of them-a small square of goat cheese, a small sliver of sashimi-quality fish, and one other item. The bread service was distinctly inferior for a restaurant in Jean Georges' class, with a choice of simple French-style baguette rolls or sourdough bread (neither warm) and garden-variety butter. Per Se, Alain Ducasse, and Bouley all have far more impressive bread service than this. We noted that all of the serving staff are quite young. (Our primary server reminded us of Pat Sajak in his twenties.) Perhaps this explains a number of service glitches. At one point, the server started to pour my wine glass before catching himself at the last moment, as he had not yet poured for my girlfriend. At another point, plates were deposited, taken away, then brought back again. Servers were at times unsure about when to pour and clear wine glasses, and at one point in the meal we felt that the pace was slightly rushed. We ordered a wine pairing and received six excellent choices, with contrasting varieties and regions, although at no point did we speak to a sommelier-again, I consider this a minor lapse for a restaurant in this class. It is not the wine staff's fault that five of the six wines were white, as they were all sensible choices for the menu. But perhaps the overall effect would have been better had the fifth course (the lobster) been an item that paired with red. There are a couple of wonderful tables at Jean Georges that occupy small alcoves, and we were lucky enough to have one of these. With a wall on three sides of us, it almost felt like our own private world. However, it meant that all we saw out the window was the Time-Warner Center across the street, instead of the more compelling park views that many of the other tables have. We noted that there is nothing particularly lovely about the room itself, although it is of course tastefully decorated, and the service accoutrements are all lavish. When we left, we were sent on our way with just a tiny paper bag, containing a tiny box, containing two tiny pieces of chocolate. On our tasting menu, the foie gras, the red snapper, and the desserts showed how Vongerichten's cuisine can still be extraordinary, even if (as Frank Bruni claimed in his review) not much has changed in ten years. I do realize that it's nearly impossible for every course out of seven to be a mind-bending experience. Certainly everything we tasted was at a high level of competence. But I wanted just one or two more of those courses to be sublime. Jean Georges (1 Central Park West at 60th Street, Upper West Side) Food: ***½Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***½

I have to disagree with the overall verdict.I have eaten at all 7 restaurants Mr V. has in NYC. JoJo was like a little Jean Georges, MK and Vong were outstanding in food and service. (No JG but still good) 66 was hit and miss. Perry St is very conservative but again, very good food and service. Spice Market...love it. What has gotten into people here in NYC? Mr. V gets a little funky and all the local critics flip out. I just love that boring Porterhouse NYC that took over the V Steakhouse. Go Time Warner ;)Please... Mr V understands New York City and the people have spoken...Spice Market,Jojo, Vong, Perry St, Jean Georges, Mercer Kitchen and 66 are all doing well because we love the food, decor and service.Yes, Mr V can do it all and do it well.Stevie.

The communal table at Asia de CubaA friend of mine adores Asia de Cuba, Jeffrey Chodorow's fusion restaurant where pan-Asian meets pan-Latin. When she asked where I'd like to be taken for my birthday, I thought it was the perfect choice - a restaurant she loves, and one I'd never been to. Since it opened in 1997, Asia de Cuba has been the ultimate \"scene\" restaurant. Unlike many such places, the buzz hasn't died out. Almost a decade later, the young and the gorgeous haven't stopped flocking there. Philippe Starck's luminous double-decker interior still turns heads. Downstairs, a communal table the length of a football field dominates the dining room. Upstairs, the comfortable bar area and additional dining tables overlook the room below.Reviewing for the Times in 1997, Ruth Reichl wasn't impressed. She began, \"You won't eat well at Asia de Cuba.\" There wasn't much that she liked, but she proceeded to award a star anyway-surely the best evidence of the star-inflation for which she was known:I'm not impressed with the ropa vieja of duck, either. One of those thoroughly cross-cultural inventions, this is a variation on the classic Latin beef stew (called ropa vieja because the meat shreds like old clothes) served like Chinese minced squab in lettuce leaves. The idea is to spread the lettuce with hoisin sauce, add a few pea shoots, some thinly sliced snow peas and calabaza squash, spoon some stew on top, wrap it all up and eat it with your fingers. Nice idea, but it doesn't taste very good.I'm glad I didn't read Reichl's review before we went, as we ordered that very dish ($19.50), and it was a hit. They've changed the vegetable accompaniments since Reichl had it, but the idea is still the same. The server brought the duck to our table still on the bone, then shredded it and left us to wrap it into delicious pancakes with the accompanying lettuce.Miso cured black cod ($33) comes with a black bean and edamame salad. It's competently done, but these days every Asian-themed restaurant has a version of that dish, and the one here didn't erase memories of the better renditions of it. My friend recommended a couple of side dishes: Plantain fried rice with avocado salad ($9.50) and Lobster boniato mash ($13.50), which both lived up to her enthusiastic endorsements.Ruth Reichl and I do agree that the coconut cake is excellent. The restaurant served it with a candle and \"Happy Birthday Marc\" written in chcolate syrup on the plate. Like everything else, it was a huge piece, which even two people sharing could not finish.The restaurant has some wonderful specialty cocktails. I loved the Coconut Cloud Martini ($12), made with coconut rum and Stoli vanilla, topped with coconut shavings. We also had the Mojito ($12), for which my friend says Asia de Cuba is deservedly famous.Like many restaurants in the genre, Asia de Cuba serves the food family style. One appetizer, one entree, and a couple of side dishes are more than enough for two people (indeed, my friend took home leftovers). The ample portions somewhat make up for the stratospheric prices: appetizers are $19-26, entrees $23-59 (most over $30), side dishes $9-$13.50. I would prefer smaller portions and prices, which would allow a party of two to sample more of the menu without spending a fortune.If Asia de Cuba's food is no longer unique, it is certainly plenty of fun. Ruth Reichl's 1997 review didn't offer much promise, but in fact kitchen is doing a very respectable job. And if you can't make it to New York, there are Asia de Cuba outposts in London, Los Angeles, and San Francisco.Asia de Cuba (237 Madison Avenue between 37th & 38th Streets, Murray Hill)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

I visited Wallse about a week ago for a special occasion. I've reviewed this restaurant twice before (here and here). My enthusiasm for it remains undimmed, so I'll just get to the food recap. The four of us chose the five-course tasting menu ($70). There were two choices for each course: First course: foie gras terrine with plum compote; or cauliflower salad. My girlfriend and I both had the terrine. It's hard to screw up foie gras-and the restaurant didn't-but the silver dollar-sized portion was gone all too quickly. Second course: spicy lobster soup with lobster ravioli; or sea scallop. The scallop, accompanied with glazed onions, was as tender and flavorful as one could want. The lobster soup, of which I tasted a bit, was an unusually spicy preparation, but I thought it worked well. Third course: Wiener schnitzel with potato-cucumber salad and lingonberries; or fried sweetbread. I was the only one at my table with the guts to try the sweetbread. It was much larger than I remembered it in the past, and lightly breaded, to allow this juicy delicacy to speak for itself. I didn't try any of the Wiener schnitzel, but everyone else at the table was pleased. Fourth course: Kavalierspitz (beef shoulder) with creamed spinach, potato rösti and apple horseradish; or grilled venison loin with red cabbage, wild mushrooms and elderberry sauce. Once again, feeling adventurous, I took the road less traveled by-the kavalierspitz. While there was nothing wrong with this dish, frankly it was rather bland. After tasting a bit of the venison, I realized quite plainly that I'd made the inferior choice. Dessert: Viennese iced coffee with vanilla ice cream and espresso sabayon; or grilled pineapple. Three of us chose the iced coffee. I thought it was just fine-the taste of iced coffee and espresso foam is pretty predictable-but my two companions considered it a dud. The grilled pineapple was also fairly uncomplicated, but I tasted several bites and found it a sweet treat. Neither dessert option was as impressive as the rest of the meal, but the first four courses were up to Wallse's usual standard. I didn't care much for the Kavalierspitz, but when you are being adventurous, you must be willing to accept some risk. Service was up to the usual standard, and we were quite happy with an Austrian white wine at around $50 a bottle.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Savoy. These days, there is nothing newsworthy about a restaurant menu that's built around seasonal ingredients sourced from local farmers-what New York's Adam Platt calls an \"haute barnyard.\" But when Savoy opened in 1990, chef/owner Peter Hoffman didn't have a lot of company. Savoy has remained a New York favorite, offering a refined and romantic dining experience. When you arrive at Savoy, you find yourself initially on the bustling ground floor, which serves small plates and sandwiches, and doesn't accept reservations. If you're there to visit the fine-dining restaurant, the hostess leads you upstairs, where the setting is far more serene, with a wood-burning fireplace, warm lighting, and candles on every table. My friend and I were attracted to the identical menu choices. To start, we had the Grilled Sausage with mustard greens and lentil salad ($10). I thought it was terrific, although my friend was concerned to see pink on the inside of the sausage. (As Frank Bruni has noted, many restaurants are now serving pork rare, but not all diners have gotten used to it.) Salt Crust Baked Duck ($28) has been one of Savoy's signature dishes for many years. The server explained that the salt is used during cooking to keep the moisture in, but it is scraped off before serving, so the duck doesn't taste all that salty. It is an excellent preparation. I especially appreciated that the duck breast was sliced thick, and there was a visible layer of fat on the edges. The accompanying plum dumplings were an unexpected treat, but black kale was rubbery. The wine list is not long, and features mostly smaller vinyards. We landed on a very fine grenache for $42. Service was very good, aside from one pet peeve that seems to crop up more often these days: no butter knife. Many chefs with this kind of success would be looking to branch out-launching a second restaurant, then a third. Peter Hoffman just keeps his eye on the ball at Savoy, which continues its charming ways in a renovated 1830s Federal style townhouse in SoHo. For my money, Savoy a more relaxed and romantic atmosphere than Blue Hill, while offering a very similar style of dining that is arguably just as good, or better. By all means give it a try.

Note: Blair Perrone now seems to be closed. At first, it seemed to be temporary, but with Drew Nieporent recently eyeing the space, it would appear that the steakhouse is done.Nowadays, it seems every waiter with a Peter Luger stint on his resume wants to open a Luger clone in Manhattan. With Mark Joseph, Ben & Jack's, Flames, and two outposts of Wolfgang's, you are never very far from a faux Luger experience. The newest of the Luger offspring is Blair Perrone, which opened in late 2005. It's the brainchild of Charlie Blair, who worked at Peter Luger in Great Neck, and Joe Perrone, who was a manager at Mark Joseph.By steakhouse standards, Blair Perrone offers a comparatively refined atmosphere for your meal. The gargantuan restaurant occupies almost an entire city block between 47th and 48th Streets, with panoramic picture windows looking out on a fairly uninteresting stretch of Second Avenue. If only such a view were on the waterfront. The interior is dominated by the predictable dark wood paneling, but the tables are generously spaced, the seating comfortable, and the double-height ceilings give the usual steakhouse cocophany room to dissipate.The menu is entirely unoriginal. Thick Canadian bacon ($3.25) was served in the usual Luger style. The NY Strip ($39) came pre-sliced on a sizzling plate, but the exterior char wasn't as crunchy as the better examples in town, and the marbling was uneven, with several slices at the end not really worth eating. Creamed spinach ($9.50) was pedestrian.Service was friendly and very good to start with. Joe Perrone himself came over to my table twice to say hello. But as the restaurant filled up, my waiter gradually lost touch with me as, other parties started to compete for his attention. The bread service (a basket of home made onion rolls) was excellent. I didn't order dessert, but the choices were the usual steakhouse fare. Indeed, you could easily overlook them, as the after-dinner menu is dominated by an impressive selection of cognacs, brandies, single-malt and blended whiskies.I was encouraged to see a wine list with plenty of choices between $35 and $50. In common with most steakhouses, wines by the glass are not listed on the menu. If you ask, the server simply says, \"Merlot, cabernet, pinot noir, zinfandel, or shiraz.\" At these prices, can't they be bothered to put it in writing, so that you at least know what you're ordering? Anyhow, I didn't feel overcharged for a $9 glass of pinot noir, but I still don't know what it was.If the wine list is gentle on the pocketbook, the other prices are not. At the superior Wolfgang's, the NY Strip is $36.50, the bacon is $2.75, and the spinach is $8.95. For some items, the differences are even larger. For instance, Blair Perrone serves a 40-ounce ribeye at $48, while the ribeye at Wolfgang's is $36.50. I am not sure if Wolfgang's serves a 40-ounce cut, but I've had it several times, and it is more than most people can consume, assuming you've ordered appetizers, side dishes, and wine.The attractive space is Blair Perrone's selling point. But it is surprising that owners who took such care in remodeling the space didn't have a single original thought in the design of the menu. They have done a competent job at reproducing the standard New York steakhouse, a durable format that seems to do well almost anywhere. But unless you have other reasons for a visit to East Midtown, you might as well visit another steakhouse closer to home.Blair Perrone Steakhouse (885 Second Avenue between 47th and 48th Streets, Turtle Bay)Food: SatisfactoryService: *Ambiance: **Overall: *

Note: Earth closed in early 2009. Earth NYC, a pan-Asian restaurant in far west Chelsea, hasn't gotten much press. It opened eighteen months ago as a nightclub, and added a dinner menu about five months ago. Book at any time you want, and you get a 1,000-point bonus on OpenTable. At 8:00 p.m. last night, only a handful of tables were taken. The menu covers a lot of ground-or tries to. Each item is labeled for its place of origin: Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, Malaysia, Singapore, India. There are plenty of choices: seven soups & salads ($7-10), a dozen small plates ($9-21), seventeen large plates ($14-27), and seven kinds of bread, rice, and noodles ($4-16). For a place designed primarily as a club, our expectations were low. The strong appetizers were therefore a pleasant surprise. I started with the very respectable Vegetable Dumplings ($9), which came with a side salad of shredded lettuce and carrots. My friend was equally impressed with Lamb Samosa ($9), three savory pastries stuffed with minced lamb. She was also quite pleased with the Chicken Chilli Basil ($14), but my Chicken Curry Ayam ($16) was mediocre. The chicken, which came in a soup bowl, was tough, over-cooked, and drowned in a dull curry broth. The space is reasonably comfortable, with plenty of room between tables. The funky Asian soundtrack in the background is not oppressively loud. The decor? You will either love it or hate it, depending on your tolerance for lipstick red. I was reasonably impressed, but it won't be to all tastes. A spectacular 30-foot wall of candles has potential, although they were not lit last night. Service was at least competent, although our water glasses usually went a while without being refilled. A bread service would be helpful, given that both appetizers and entrees were a tad slow to come out. I have a tough time getting a read on this place, given that one of the entrees and both appetizers were good, but the other entree was not pleasant at all. As prices are modest, we certainly didn't feel cheated. But with so many other intriguing restaurants to try, I probably won't be rushing back to find out whether my dull curry was an anomaly.

Which New York restaurant has the best sushi omakase? Leaving aside Masa and its stratospheric $375 prix fixe, the debate usually comes down to Sushi Yasuda and Kurumazushi. Over at eGullet, a discussion thread comparing the two is now in its fifth year.Last night, I decided to give Sushi Yasuda a try. The experts all suggest reserving a place at Yasuda-san's station, but he was off-duty, so I was seated at the bar before Hiro-san. There is no \"fixed\" omakase at Sushi Yasuda. Rather, there is an ongoing dialogue with your sushi chef, who prepares pieces one by one according to your taste. I eat basically everything, so I asked him to surprise me. I'm sure (or I like to think) that he reacted to my expressions of delight as the meal progressed, and we talked about the fish as each piece was presented. This is the experience you simply don't get if you sit at the tables.With only a few exceptions, everything I had was a simple piece of raw fish atop a molded wedge of rice. Hiro-san applied just the right amount of house-made soy sauce and wasabe (checking that the degree of heat was agreeable to me). It's hard to think of a dining experience for which the connection with the chef is more personal. He molds a wad of rice into the right shape with his hands, applies the fish, adds seasoning, and puts it in front of you. With your hands or a pair of chopsticks, it goes into your mouth in one bite.Hiro-san was midly offended that I wanted to use chopsticks most of the time. For one particular piece, he directed, \"This time, you must use your hand.\" However, at the end of the meal he opined that I must be used to eating quite a bit of sushi, so I guess I didn't come off as a complete novice.There is no fixed end to the meal; it ends when you finally declare you've had enough. I had 25 pieces, which I suppose is a lot (Hiro-san said it was). I won't enumerate all the different kinds of fish I had. The list includes tuna, yellow tail, salmon, trout, mackerel, crab, oysters, roe, and eel, among others. The quality of the fish and the delightful parade of flavors were superb. Most of the items were raw, of course, but for one fish he carefully removed the skin and fried it on an open fire. Three little pieces of fried fish skin were the last thing I had.I was prepared for a staggering bill, but the whole thing added up to just $105.75-not inexpensive, but I was prepared for something like $140, and I tipped rather more generouslly than I normally would. A small pitcher of cold sake was just $10. The efficient staff kept my water glass full throughout the meal.The sublime space is decorated simply, in blonde woods, and comfortably lit. There are only about a dozen seats at the bar, which must be reserved in advance. The tables are quite widely spaced, and the noise level is insignificant.I look forward to giving Kurumazushi a try one of these days, and perhaps I'll even work up the fiscal courage to visit Masa. But for now, I can say that Sushi Yasuda fully lives up to the billing.Sushi Yasuda (204 E. 43rd Street between Second & Third Avenues, Turtle Bay)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Drew Nieporent isn't accustomed to doing things quietly. With Nobu, TriBeCa Grill, and Montrachet (among others) in his restaurant empire, he knows how to make a splash. So it is surprising that when the Times published its fall restaurant preview, there was no mention of a new Vietnamese restaurant from Nieporent's Myriad Restaurant Group. Was Nieporent trying to downplay expectations? If so, he needn't have worried. Mai House, which opened just nine days ago, is a hit. Nieporent likes to keep a close eye on his restaurants. All but one of his seven New York properties are in TriBeCa, within a five-minute radius of one another; indeed, three of them, including Mai House, are on the same block as his corporate office on Franklin Street. The night before Mai House opened, I walked in to take a look. There was Drew, lecturing the serving staff: \"You're here to serve the customer, not the kitchen.\" It may not be the most startling insight, but I've been to a few restaurants where the staff needed that lecture. Last night, Drew was in and out of the restaurant several times, chatting up the staff and making subtle adjustments. I began with a couple of the specialty cocktails, which were only $10 apiece, in a town where they could easily be $15. Either of the Tiger Tail (Absolut Peppar, Triple Sec, Passion Fruit Puree, Thai Chile) or the Flyboy (Ginza no suzume souj, Marasca, Rhum Orange, Lime Juice) could easily become addictive. For the appetizer, I ordered the Wild Boar Sausage ($11) with green papaya salad. The sausage is served warm, and is just mildly spicy. The kitchen slices it into small pieces, so that you can pick it up with your chopsticks. It comes mixed with the salad, which is crisp and refreshing. Braised Berkshire Pork Belly ($23), on a bed of red cabbage and drizzled with coconut juice, should be everyone's guilty pleasure. It looks gorgeous and tastes even better. After getting on the scale this morning, I concluded I should have resisisted Sticky Rice with Chinese Sausage ($4), but I'm glad I didn't. Vietnamese Coffee ($4) was a dud. A mix of espresso-like coffee and condensed milk, it tasted sour and dull. The chef, Michael Bao Huynh, made his name at Bao 111 in the East Village. He must be especially fond of the wild boar sausage, as he came over to my table after dinner to inquire whether I had liked it. I replied that I did, adding that the braised pork belly was terrific too. He replied in self-deprecating fashion, \"That must be because you like pork.\" The menu is still undergoing some refinement, as one would expect for a new restaurant. A pre-opening menu (PDF) had the wild boar sausage as an entree, but now it is available only as an appetizer. While it immediately leaped out at me as the first thing to try (and I was not disappointed), evidently not enough diners were willing to take that leap of faith for a main course. I'm glad Huynh hasn't given up on it. The space is gorgeous (see the Eater preview), although fairly informal. There are no tablecloths, though I was happy to see lacquer chopsticks, as opposed to the disposable wooden ones they're using at Nobu these days. The server was attentive, and almost a bit over-eager. He apparently hadn't been briefed on the evolving menu, as when I asked for a recommendation, he suggested an item that is no longer on offer. Mai House hasn't caught on yet. It was only just barely warming up during the 6:00 p.m. hour last night (hardly a barometer on a Friday night, I must admit). If I am right about the cuisine, it won't be a secret for long. If all Vietnamese cooking is this good, I'm ready to hitch the next flight to Hanoi.

I've always been in the \"what's the big deal?\" camp about Hearth. So I was interested to see your change of opinion. To what do you attribute the success of this meal, as opposed to your last one? Do you think the cooking has changed here? (Seems unlikely.) (For informational purposes, it's been about a year since I last ate here.) Do you think you just ordered better? If so, would you be able to recommend an ordering strategy?

To tell you the truth, I don't recall why I found Hearth a bit dull the first time. I didn't write a review, and I don't remember what I had. So I can't give much ordering strategy, beyond the specific dishes that I mentioned in the post.

My friend and I have often walked by Periyali on W. 20th Street, always on the way to somewhere else. Periyali has been a bastion of upscale Greek cuisine since 1987, long before it was fashionable. It's one of those restaurants that flies under the radar - a place that can usually wait for another day. Last night, we decided to give it a try.Coincidentally, we both landed on identical choices: the fried calamari to start ($11) and the braised lamb shank ($26). The breaded calamari was competently prepared, but I found the garlic dipping sauce and accompanying green salad totally forgettable. The lamb shank was a hefty portion and beautifully done. You hardly needed a knive (always the test with braised meats). The accompanying orzo in a light tomato sauce was a welcome bonus. Homemade bread with olive oil would be welcome on my table any day.The wine list is a mix of Greek and world wines (mostly France and America). I didn't trust my ability to pick a Greek wine, so I chose a Francis Coppola Syrah at $40. I don't usually buy wines named for celebrities, but this one was a winner. In this kind of restaurant, I'm always happy to find a good choice available that doesn't ask for a major investment.The space at Periyali instantly transports you to the Greek islands, with its billowing white fabrics on the ceiling and colorful banquettes. I would highly recommend it for a romantic getaway. The storefront is narrow, but goes very deep. It was not full (we were seated immediately without a reservation), but clearly doing a strong business on a Thursday night. There's an outdoor garden (which I didn't check out), but on this unusually balmy November evening the French doors at the front were open, and a large party was dining outside.Service was just fine. I can't remember the last time a manager made so many trips to the table to check if we were happy. He must have checked up on us at least three or four times.Eighteen months ago, Frank Bruni wrote, \"Nothing at Periyali proves hugely intriguing. Nothing wows,\" but awarded two stars, adding that \"the little touches add up slowly and nicely.\" He suggested it was a forerunner to Molyvos and Thalassa. Maybe, but those other restaurants have surpassed it. Still, Periyali does a competent job, and it's worth a look if you're already in the neighborhood.Periyali (35 W. 20th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Flatiron District)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: *½

I didn't blog about the midterm elections during the campaign, as I don't think my 2004 prognostications were particularly accurate. But now that it is just about over, I can't resist making a few comments. I have voted for Republicans on numerous occasions, but this year (as in 2004) I was strongly in favor of a change.The Results. Democrats have taken control of the House, wresting at least 29 seats from the Republicans while losing none of their own. (A few seats are still too close to call.) In the Senate, Democrats won six seats formerly held by Republicans, while losing none of their own. That's enough to ensure a 51-49 Democratic majority in the Senate next year. Democrats also now control a majority of the state governorships for the first time in 12 years, and won control of several state legislatures.Observations.The Democrats didn't win this election; the Republicans lost it. Democrats didn't win because they offered a specific agenda that voters wanted; Republicans lost because their agenda clearly wasn't working.Pending the results in a few of the undecided races, not a single Democrat incumbent lost in a Senate, House, or Gubernatorial race. That is probably unprecedented, and it is certainly very rare.The old saying is that \"All politics are local.\" Yesterday, that wasn't the case. The results reflected a dissatisfaction on national issues, particularly the war in Iraq.The northeast is now solid blue, and the deep south is almost entirely solid red. But in the midwest and far west, formerly red/blue states are now varying shades of pink and purple. These states are in play for either party. I don't see the Democrats becoming competitive in the deep South (other than perhaps Florida) anytime soon.Democratic Chairman Howard Dean's fifty-state strategy worked. Democrats were competitive in states like Wyoming where, a year ago, no one would have given them a snowball's chance.Polling, and particularly exit polling, worked. There were no embarrassing glitches or races called the wrong way, as happened in 2000 and 2004. The late pre-election polls and early exit polls were remarkably close to the final results. Apparently, the pollsters have learned their lesson.Independence has its virtues. The non-partisan analysts (Charlie Cook, Stuart Rothenberg, Larry Sabato) got their projections just about right. Conservative bloggers - even those who professed to be following a rigorous methodology - underestimated the size of the Democratic wave. (A few Democratic bloggers missed on the high side, but their errors were less pronounced, perhaps because you'd have to be utterly irrational to imagine a much better outcome for the Democrats.)Most of the incoming freshman class of Democrats are centrists. A generation ago, many of them would have been Republicans-back in the days when the phrase \"moderate Republican\" wasn't an oxymoron. Democratic leaders appear to understand that the Humphrey-McGovern-Mondale era is over, and to retain their majority, they must govern towards the center.George W. Bush isn't going to change his stripes overnight. But he will come under pressure to compromise. Republican colleagues know that they have to turn things around, to avoid another beating in 2008. As governor of Texas, Bush was known for working effectively with a Democrat-controlled legislature. But he wasn't a lame duck then. Even with a favoring wind, it has always been difficult for a president to control the agenda in the final two years of an administration. Look for Bush to focus on foreign policy and Iraq (with much more visible Democratic oversight), while the domestic agenda is set by a new generation of leaders in both parties.Having said that, I don't expect the Republicans to make any kind of meaningful shift to the center. Despite yesterday's loss, they've won 7 of the last 10 presidential elections, and the Republican party is dominated now by \"movement\" conservatives, who view their ideology as a jihad. These aren't the kinds of folk who compromise their principles, merely because it's electorally convenient to do so. Many of them will argue that they lost, not because they were too conservative, but because they weren't conservative enough.On ballot initiatives, both sides can claim victories. Democrats can be pleased that proposals to limit abortions went down to defeat in three states, stem cell research was approved in Missouri, and three states passed minimum wage increases. But Republicans can be pleased that gay marriage bans passed in seven out of eight states, and Michigan voters passed a ban on affirmative action.Democrats do not have a clear standard-bearer in 2008. Their two most prominently-mentioned presidential candidates, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, are almost certainly too liberal to be elected.I don't expect the Republicans to abandon their ultra-conservative, \"mobilize-the base\" strategy in 2008. Although it failed this time, it has worked often enough that I think they'll give it at least one more try.Blip or Tsunami? What does this election tell us about the national electorate? Republicans want to believe that this outcome is merely a blip, and in two years they'll start another winning streak. Democrats want to believe that a tsunami has finally brought the conservative movement to an end.The truth is probably somewhere in between. Like many politicians before him, George W. Bush over-played his mandate. He was a minority president in 2000, and probably would have been defeated in 2004 had the Democrats not fielded such a feeble candidate. By running a government that catered almost exclusively to the far right, the Republicans practically begged independents to vote for Democrats. Because moderates have been practically banished from the Republican Party, I wonder if those left actually have a clue about how to appeal to independents, or whether they're just hoping Democrats will implode again?But the new Democratic coalition is still both weak and unproven. Many of the independents who handed them this victory have voted Republican before, and will do so again, if the Democrats fumble away this opportunity. We are just eighteen years removed from the 1988 presidential election, when the elder Bush captured 40 out of 50 states. A Republican could quite easily do that again, but it is impossible to imagine a Democrat doing so. To win in 2008, Democrats will once again have to thread a needle through the electoral college.As I noted above, Democrats didn't really offer a clear alternative this year-they just stood back and allowed the Republicans to self-destruct. As the majority party in Congress, they will no longer be mere observers, and they will be expected to lead.

Monday night was the final stop of my culinary mini-tour with my Mom, who was visiting from Detroit. I chose Blue Hill, an iconic New York restaurant that you simply wouldn't find anywhere else. As we were chatting, it occurred to me that Fleur de Sel, which we visited on Sunday night, is clearly the better restaurant, but you could find it anywhere; Blue Hill could only be in New York. New York's Adam Platt coined the phrase \"haute barnyard,\" referring to restaurants that self-consciously define themselves with a reliance on locally-sourced seasonal ingredients. Blue Hill fulfills that ideal better than any. The cooking is impeccable and technically precise, although to some tastes it may seem a bit bland. I started with the Stone Barns Greens Ravioli ($12), made with ricotta, zucchini puree, pancetta, and lettuce. There wasn't much zing in this dish; its only point was to show that you can turn fresh farm vegetables into an acceptable ravioli. Stone Barns Berkshire Pork ($30) was served on a bed of spaetzle and spinach. The pork loin medallions were cooked to gorgeous tenderness. A square of crisp pork belly offered the right contrast, but it was only the size of a large postage stamp. My mom loved the lamb ($32), which like the pork was served in bite-sized medallions. On a previous visit, I complained of a lack of red wine choices around $40. This time I had no trouble finding a satisfying California red at around that price. Service was up to the usual standard, and I especially liked the warm and hopelessly addictive warm bread sticks.

Note: Fleur de Sel closed on February 21, 2009. Chef Cyril Renaud plans to focus on his new casual restaurant, Bar Breton. I had dinner at Fleur de Sel on Christmas Eve a few years ago. It didn't wow me. Like other expensive restaurant dinners I've had at holiday times, it seemed mass-produced and over-priced. But with Fleur de Sel winning a Michelin star for the second year in a row, I thought it was time to give it another chance and was very glad I did. Dinner at Fleur de Sel is $79 for a three-course prix fixe, which we had. Also available are a six-course tasting menu (with two choices for most courses) at $87, and the chef's tasting menu (number of courses not specified) at $112. The evening's only dud was my appetizer choice: Maine Lobster salad, with truffle mayonaise and Asian pair ($5 suppl.). I found the cold lobster thin and flavorless. My mom and my girlfriend both had the goat cheese and artichoke ravioli topped with caviar. Both of them gave me a taste, and it was outstanding. The kitchen sent out a a trio of crabmeat pancakes as a bonus mid-course, which were also excellent. We went our own ways for the main course. I had the crispy poussin, with organic arugula, wild mushrooms, and foie gras emulsion. This was the best poultry dish I've had since the bluefoot chicken at Alain Ducasse. The crispness of the skin and the tenderness of the flesh inside were a perfect contrast. My mom ordered the Atlantic Halibut, and my girlfriend the Duo of Lamb ($6 suppl.), and both pronounced themselves delighted. A roasted fig dessert (which two of us had) was wonderful, as was a chocolate tart. A complimentary order of the raspberry feullettee with white chocolate and caramel ganache was also sent out for us to share. The wine list is rather expensive. Many pages have no choices under $125; bottles under $75 are scarce. I was happy with a Chateauneuf du Pape at $80, but I don't think it would hurt to offer a few choices at lower prices. In an unusual arrangement, open bottles for the whole restaurant are kept on a table in the center of the room. We found this annoying, as we are quite capable of refilling our own glasses, and would prefer to do so at our own convenience, rather than a server's. The space at Fleur de Sel has a quiet, comfortable elegance. The decor is understated, but arguably a bit bland. The restaurant was less than half full on a Sunday night. Indeed, there was only one other occupied table when we arrived at about 6:20, although it had started to fill up nicely by the time we left.

Hey, I've enjoyed reading your sites and agree with you on alot of the restaurants you've covered, top to bottom. Next time you go there, you MUST try the granny smith \"brittany\" crepe. They always have it on the menu and it is ridiculously good.

Note: This is a review of Landmarc TriBeCa. Click here for a review of Landmarc at the Time-Warner Center.Landmarc in TriBeCa was an instant hit when it opened almost three years ago. A second branch of the restaurant is expected to open in the Time-Warner Center early next year. I dined at Landmarc a few times within the restaurant's first year or so (report here), but then it fell off of my radar screen. A dinner last Friday night reminded me that I ought to return to Landmarc a lot more often.My mother and I had no trouble getting seated at around 6:30 p.m. I ordered the warm goat cheese profiteroles with herb and roasted red pepper salad ($11). Anything with goat cheese is well-nigh impossible to ruin. The doughy profiterole pillows yielded quickly to the fork, surrendering the juicy goat cheese prize inside.My mom ordered the pan seared monkfish with tomatoes, red onions & black olives, and spaghetti squash ($22). This was a very large portion, perfectly prepared. I tried the pumpkin & gorgonzola risotto with sage and toasted walnuts ($22; also available as an appetizer for $15), which was competently prepared, but slightly too dry.Landmarc has a strong bread service for a restaurant in its class, but like many casual places I've visited lately, there is no butter knife. In other respects the service is solid. When you are seated, the menu is already at the table, folded in sixths like a homework assignment. This is an affectation that should be dropped.The wine program remains first-rate, with many excellent bottles in the $30-50 range. We had an excellent 2002 Crozes-Hermitage at $36, for which many restaurants would have charged over $50.Landmarc (179 West Broadway between Leonard & Worth Streets, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Note: Devin Tavern closed in January 2009. Click here for a more recent review. I had a first look at Devin Tavern late last week. The website describes it as a \"rustic American tavern.\" I didn't detect much rusticity in the decor, which reminded me of a country club, but it certainly applied to the cuisine. The menu steers toward hearty comfort food, such as a fresh ricotta tortelloni appetizer ($14), which comes with braised beef cheeks and chanterelles in a red wine reduction. The combination worked, but it felt more like an entree. One of the side dishes was a wild mushroom flan ($8), which had the appearance of a dessert, but was too substantial to be a mere side dish. Perhaps a shift to the appetizer section would help. A citrus cheese cake ($11) came poised atop a sponge cake that didn't yield easily enough to the fork. That tortelloni isn't an anomaly. The current menu includes severak other \"heavy\" appetizers, like Chicken & Biscuits ($12), Braised Lamb Shank & Barley Stew ($12), Shrimp & Grits ($16), and a Lobster & Corn Souffle ($14). I wonder how many diners want to move on from such fare to entrees like Braised Short Ribs ($26), Grilled Whole Fish ($36), or a Bison Rib-Eye ($34)? To be sure, you can also get a salad at Devin Tavern, but the meaning of \"rustic\" is abundantly clear. The space is large, and on a Wednesday evening it didn't seem close to full. Service was professional and sharp. Devin Tavern (363 Greenwich Street between Franklin and Harrison Sts, TriBeCa) Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: *

Gordon Ramsay at the London doesn't open for another 17 days, so the only thing we can talk about is the reservations line. Over at eGullet, every comment by Ramsay's reservationists is being thoroughly dissected. For instance, one caller was told, \"No trainers are allowed in the dining room.\" (Trainers are the British word for athletic shoes.)This morning, I called for a December 30th reservation. The person who answered spoke American English, and explained the dress code as \"jacket & tie for the gentlemen, smart dresses for the ladies.\" But there was one quirk. When I requested a table for two, she asked, \"Will that be Mr. and Mrs?\"I have no secrets about whom I'm dining with. Nevertheless, there are probably some diners for whom that's an awkward question. In New York, married couples are outnumbered by gay couples, dating heterosexual couples, unmarried partners living together, married people cheating on their spouses, business associates, and friends who are simply having a social night out. Does the restaurant really need to know the relationship of its customers?Ramsay's New York restaurant will be the latest serious contender for four New York Times stars and three Michelin stars (see press release). Opening night is November 16th. Introductory pricing will be $45 prix fixe for three courses at lunch, $85 prix fixe for three courses at dinner, or $117 for the tasting menu. I do not expect those prices to last.Ramsay already holds three Michelin stars for Restaurant Gordon Ramsay in London, and he also operates several one-star restaurants. I dined at Ramsay's one-star Savoy Grill over the summer (report here). Another of Ramsay's one-star restaurants, Maze, is the inspiration for a companion restaurant called The London Bar, which will serve small plates and bar food-also at The London Hotel.Gordon Ramsay at The London (151 W. 54th St. between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, West Midtown)

The Bistro Laurent Tourondel empire keeps growing, and this week Tourondel added another offspring to the brood: BLT Burger. If first impressions are any guide, the new outpost will be just as successful as the first three (BLT Steak, BLT Fish, BLT Prime). An eGullet post mentioned that the place was packed on a weeknight just a day or two after it opened, but I had no trouble getting a table at 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon.The restaurant doesn't much resemble the other BLT's, except for the chocolate brown upholstery on the banquettes. The prices certainly set it apart. Unlike the other BLT restaurants, BLT Burger could actually be called a bargain.In addition to the \"Classic Burger\" ($7), there's the \"BLT\" Burger (two patties, $11), a Kobe Burger ($16), Lamb Burger ($10), Turkey Burger ($7) or Veggie Burger ($7). All burgers come with tomato, onion, lettuce, pickles, ketchup, mustard and mayo. Cheese is an extra $0.50, other toppings (such as bacon, avocado, portobello mushroom, chilli) are $1.50. A \"combo\" of the classic burger with fries and a milkshake will set you back all of $13.There's a variety of sandwiches ($10-15), salads and appetizers ($9-14), sides ($2-5), and desserts ($3-6). The whole back page of the menu shows an impressive array of drinks, including nine kinds of milk shakes ($5), five kinds of floats ($5), four kinds of alcoholic milk shakes ($9), house cocktails ($11), twenty-seven kinds of beer ($3-10), and six wines by the glass ($6-9). Sodas are $2 or $2.50. Tap water (free) comes in a beautiful tall glass caraffe.I had the classic burger with cheddar cheese ($7.50). The burger was enjoyable, but nothing special. I would have preferred a thicker patty. The \"BLT\" Burger, with two patties, is always an option, but I thought that would be too much of a good thing. Onion rings ($4) were delicious. I especially admired the lightness of the batter. A strawberry-banana milkshake ($5) was plenty of fun. Service was friendly and efficient.You have to wonder if Laurent Tourondel can keep up the quality as his empire grows. Ominously, BLT Fish was stripped of its Michelin star, and I must admit my last visit to that restaurant wasn't stellar. At least two more BLTs are on the way: BLT Market in the former Atelier space, and BLT D.C. But for now, Tourondel is happy to go downmarket, and at these prices BLT Burger is sure to be a hit.BLT Burger (470 Sixth Avenue between 11th & 12th Streets, Greenwich Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

This place is overrated. My wife & I firmly believe Stand is far superior with similar prices but with distinctively better burgers/shakes/fries of higher quality. (24 E 12th at University).We went to BLT Burger 3:30pm Sun and sat at the bar. Given the great weather, the restaurant was understandably slow. Service was weak. The bartender kept coaxing us to augment the bill with toppings on our burgers, fries, more booze. The $10 'classic' burger was decent but served solo (no fries?? come on !!). It came on a Wonder Bread bun than probably came in the standard 8-pack. Included was a tiny portion of cole slaw, a paltry piece of iceberg lettuce, and 1 small slice of tomato. We shared a coffee shake. It tasted good but was as thin as water and was disappointing. Traditionally, with shakes you are supposed to be asked whether you prefer thick or thin. They also start removing plates before we were BOTH finished eatng....always a sign of a lack of interest of the ownership and poor training of employees. BLT Burger is a joke. Trendy and lame.

The Lonesome Dove Western Bistro carries a 27 out of 30 Zagat food rating in Dallas. If it were in New York, that would put Lonesome Dove on a par with such standouts as Alain Ducasse, Chanterelle, Gotham Bar & Grill, Masa, and Veritas.Celebrity chef Tim Love has opened a New York branch of the Lonesome Dove. His version of western cooking is fun, but the restaurant is befuddled with service problems and has already received one pan at the hands of the Post's Steve Cuozzo. Based on our experience last night, I suspect more are coming. [Update: The critics did indeed give the Lonesome Dove a thrashing, with both Adam Platt (NY Mag) and Frank Bruni (NY Times) awarding zero stars.]The signature dish is called the Tomahawk Chop, a portion for two that includes a 24-30 oz ribeye with an 18-inch \"tomahawk\" bone (Love designed the cut himself), a lobster tail, seared scallops, yukon gold mashed potatoes, and baby asparagus. The menu doesn't show a price, a conceit whose absurdity Frank Bruni has already pointed out. Are they hoping people will order it without realizing they're on the hook for $125? [Update: Per Bruni, the restaurant denied they were trying to trick anyone. The price ($120) is now printed on the menu.]Anyhow, we already knew the price and were happy to give the Tomahawk Chop a try. There is nothing subtle about Love's cooking. The scallops, asparagus and steak were slathered in butter. Did such a heavily marbled cut as ribeye need any more fat? I wasn't sure what Love did to make the mashed potatoes and the lobster so spicy, but they both packed plenty of heat. Even a margarita came laced with jalapeno peppers. The whole meal was solidly prepared, if not transcendent.The staff at Lonesome Dove are enthusiastic about the food, and they don't hesitate to tell you so. Their enthusiasm doesn't translate into good service. It took ages to order a drink at the bar. Getting a bar tab also took forever (they would not transfer it to the table), and finally I just plopped down cash. Once seated, we asked for tap water, but none arrived. Our server asked us about water again later on, having completely forgotten that we'd already asked for it. We ordered wine; a few minutes later, she was back to clarify what bottle we wanted. A wonderful warm homemade bread was served with butter, but no butter knife.We had probably the worst seat in the house, looking directly into the open kitchen. We don't blame the restaurant for this-after all, someone has to sit there. But if the kitchen is open, it ought to be neat. What we saw was a cluttered mess. A server dropped a pair of tongs; she picked them up, shrugged her shoulders, and took them out to the dining room to serve food with. Another server appeared to sneeze into a customer's water glass. The washroom clearly hadn't been cleaned in hours, as used towels had overflowed the wastebasket and were covering the floor.All of the chefs wear cowboy hats, including Love, who was in the house. Our server boasted that if we ordered the Tomahawk Chop, Love himself would personally carve it for us tableside. Someone carved it for us, but not Love. (We did see him carve a steak at one table, and share a glass of tequila with friends at another.) I couldn't care less who carves my steak, but servers shouldn't be selling an audience with the Great Man unless he is able to follow through. The server at our table didn't even leave that gorgeous 18-inch bone behind for us to admire; at another table, they did.Chef Love takes credit for the decor, but it's nothing to be proud of. There's a cowskin carpet outside, a stuffed buffalo head on the back wall, some cheesy watercolor paintings, and a lot of exposed brick. The ugly space is at war with the false elegance of the white tablecloths. The wine list is a serious one, but it's presented as loose sheets fastened to a clipboard. In everything it does, Lonesome Dove fails as a fancy restaurant, but it also fails as a rustic cowboy restaurant.There is much that is clever in Tim Love's cuisine. I'd love to come back and try the prairie butter (buffalo bone marrow), the kangaroo nachos, the quail quesedillas, the deer chops, the wild boar foreshank, or the stuffed tenderloin. But what Love clearly needs is a service manager-someone who will whip the lackadaisical staff into shape. As we were leaving, we asked for business cards. The hostess produced a card for the Dallas restaurant's beverage director, wrote a New York number in pencil (having first looked it up on a computer screen), then handed it to us. Doesn't that sloppiness just sum up what's wrong with the Lonesome Dove?Lonesome Dove Western Bistro (29 W. 21st St. between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Flatiron District)Food: *Service: needs a ton of workAmbiance: unimpressiveOverall: * (just barely)Update: The restaurant closed in early March 2007. Tim Love contacted me by email shortly before the restaurant folded. He said, \"In your review of my restaurant you do not make one comment on the flavor, texture or presentation of the food. While you did comment on the water color paintings (which are actually oil), the buffalo head (which is actually a Hereford steer) and a clipboard for a wine list (which is actually a cowhide mounted with saddle spurs made by one of the most famous saddle makers in the world, Leddy's).\"Love conceded that service was sub-par in the restaurant's early days, though he insisted the problems had since been fixed. He felt that I, like other reviewers, were criticizing West-of-Mississippi cuisine without having any basis for evaluating it. He thought it was like dining at Lupa, and comparing it to a sushi bar.Love's message gave no hint that the restaurant was about to close, but as the announcement came just a few days later, clearly he must have known. He probably thought that the New York critics were out to get him. Truthfully, I wanted to like the Lonesome Dove. I just wasn't wowed, particularly given the sloppy service and stratospheric prices.

My friend and I had dinner at Kittichai on Friday night. The Thai-inspired cuisine is artfully presented by executive chef, Ian Chalermkitticha, for whom the restaurant is named. The decor is spectacular, but it doesn't upstage the food, which is uniformly successful.The menu is divided into several categories: appetizers ($7-19), soups ($8-10), vegetarian ($6-14), curries ($19-24), fish & shellfish ($24-28), poultry & meat ($22-25), and sides ($3-7). Every dish we saw, on our table and others, came on a differently-shaped plate or bowl. At Kittichai, presentation is part of the game. Most dishes are suitable for sharing.I started with the Meing Tuna Tartare ($10), which comes with eight small round pastry shells that would normally be used for petits-fours-the menu calls them \"limestone tartlets\"-each holding a small peanut. An ample portion of tuna comes spiced with ginger and lime. One at a time, you spoon a mouthful of tuna into one of the tartlets; eat and repeat. It was one of the most clever appetizers I've had in a long time.My friend started with the Crispy Rock Shrimp ($13), which came in a grilled eggplant and palm sugar-tamarind sauce. She pronounced them terrific; I tasted one, and fully concurred.For the main course, I had the Baked Chilean Sea Bass ($28). The menu describes the marinade as \"yellow salted beans with morning glory,\" which isn't very helpful. Frank Bruni's description, \"divinely moist Chilean sea bass under a caramelized sheen of palm sugar and red curry paste,\" is more apt. My friend had the Dry Spice Rub Duck Breast ($25). Once it arrived, a server brushed on a decadent pinapple broth tableside. It was perfectly tender and came with a side of crispy leg confit.The wine list didn't have much to do with Thailand. It was over-priced in relation to the entree and appetizer prices, with not many reds below $50.Kittichai (60 Thompson Street between Spring and Broome Streets, SoHo)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

***CONTENT
The Chelsea restaurant Trestle on Tenth opened this summer with a \"press juggernaut\" behind it, but early reviews were mixed. I was intrigued enough to give it a try, but after a dismal performance, I won't be back.Lesson #1: Sometimes, you should just trust Frank Bruni. He described an oxtail and pig's foot terrine as \"gelatinous and unfocused.\" I thought it tasted like a slice of supermarket head cheese. It comes with what purports to be housemade mustard, but might as well be Grey Poupon.Lesson #2: Sometimes, you just can't trust Frank Bruni. He loved the saddle of lamb, and I must admit it looks terrific, with a generous lobe of fat surrounding the meat. But my friend's lamb was cold, and mine was barely lukewarm. We sent them back. They returned at the correct temperature, but the dull gravy was about what you'd expect at a diner-except that a diner would include mashed potatoes and would only charge you $8.95 for it. The greens it came with were inedible. I found my plate had too much salt, while my friend found too little of it.Another Bruni recommendation was the side dish of gratineed pizokel, with onions and gruyere. It also came lukewarm, and tasted like cafeteria food. We sent it back too for reheating.Not everything misfired. My friend liked the salad of butter lettuce, bacon, and buttermilk dressing. The bread service was also good, with a vat of soft butter, though alas no butter knives to spread it with. The wine list has been much praised, and we were pleased with a cabernet franc at around $40.After all that went wrong, a restaurant serious about service would offer to comp a dessert or an after-dinner drink. Perhaps a manager would come over to apologize? Truthfully, we were eager to get out of there, but it would have been a show of good faith. However, nothing further was said. We paid up and headed out to Room 4 Dessert, and a far more pleaseant experience.Trestle on Tenth (242 Tenth Avenue at 24th Street, Chelsea)Food: dismalService: mediocreAmbiance: sue the decoratorOverall: dismal

The situation at this place has been a folly from the get go.Its opening was delayed about a year due to DOB violations and when the finally open the go with this ridiculous concept/SMALL menu that they can't pull off.The food is horrible.The place is only open from 5:30- 11pm Tues.-Sun I believe.What is the Chef/owner doing with all this free time??This place should be at a 2** restaurant.It is a shame because what a GREAT location and the place has a back garden.I woould love to have this spot.Maybe I will one day because I am sure it will close soon.

OK, it's a year since the last post [almost], and how is Trestle doing?Sad to say, it's even worse, in terms of service. Tonight [10/18/07], they seemed to have a total kitchen meltdown.Almost an hour to get our first course, and almost another hour to get our second course -- we watched two other tables just get up and leave.Granted,it's Thursday night, always busy -- but after a year, can't they get their act together?The food was actually OK -- carrot soup and quail were both nicely done, and main courses [liver, scallops, and some ersatz coq au vin], were all good.But the service was beyond abysmal.In their defense, they agreed first to comp the appetizers, then the mains as well, as everything went south.What a shame: great location, but it surely won't last, when they can't even coordinate reservations and tables, and servicing the same in a normal fashion. When you have to go through four rounds of bread before you even get appetizers, that's BAD.Maybe the next establishment that opens at this corner, after Trestle fails, will have their act together better....

***CONTENT
Note: Room 4 Dessert closed in June 2007, after a spat between Will Goldfarb and his investors. Goldfarb originally stated that he would re-open elsewhere, but for now he seems to be content with consulting engagements without having a place of his own.Will Goldfarb has made a name as the mad scientist of desserts, cooking up kooky but delightful sugar rushes at such restaurants as Papillon and Cru. Neither the Times nor the Post liked his creations at Cru, but he took some time off, had a baby, and resurfaced with his own dessert bar in SoHo, Room 4 Dessert. And this time, the Times was smitten.The wonderful thing about it is that Goldfarb doesn't have to subsume his vision to somebody else's concept. The drawback is that diners have to get there from someplace else. So far, it seems to be working. My friend and I dropped by after dinner Friday night at nearby Peasant, only to be told there was a 40-minute wait at 10:00 p.m. The next night, after a dismal meal at the much-farther-away Trestle on Tenth, we gave it one more try, and luckily there were a couple of seats free.The restaurant occupies a long, narrow storefront. Signage is subtle, and you could easily miss it. Inside, it's probably 100 feet deep, but so narrow that an NBA player could stretch his arms and touch both side walls. All seating is at the bar. On the menu, which changes regularly, every category begins with \"Room 4,\" as in \"Room 4 Dessert Glass,\" \"Room 4 Alcohol,\" \"Room 4 Sweet Wine,\" and so forth. Desserts at R4D have funky names like \"indecent proposal\" and \"laissez pear.\" Individual desserts are $10 each, while tasting plates of four selections are $14 each. My friend tried \"choc 'n' awe,\" a four-dessert tasting of white chocolate cake, cacau mousse, sucree safranee with chocolate cream, and chocolate ice cream. I had bites of each; the mousse and the cake were particularly decadent.I had \"virtual mauritius,\" which came with a brown sugar creamy, little pieces of green mango, a iogurt biscuit, and whipped frozen carrot puree. (I am using Goldfarb's spellings in each case.) The connection to Mauritius was lost on me, but the \"iogurt biscuit\" was the best of the bunch, closely followed by the creamy brown sugar. The pieces of green mango were cut too small and were rather annoying.There's a variety of wine and hard liquor pairings recommended for every dessert. I had a drink called mar.ti.ni ($15), which is what it sounds like, and my friend had champagne ($14). Other drinks have names like \"who says cali can't age\" and \"hey man, nice priorat.\"Goldfarb prepares most of the desserts himself. When he came over to serve us, I introduced myself by my eGullet handle, and we had a nice chat about the restaurant. When I told him we were turned away the night before, he replied wryly, \"You should have complained to the owner.\" We talked about his baby girl too, and he brought over a stack of photos. Later, he comped us a \"tootsie roll\" (warm chcolate praline mousse, truffled streusel 'sex panther', raisins, and tequilla fluid), which was terrific. You couldn't make this stuff up.Room 4 Dessert is an expensive indulgence. With two tasting plates at $14 each, and drinks at $14-15, the bill was $57 before tax and tip. For the record, individual desserts have gone up by $1, and tasting plates $2, since the Times review came out in February. The liquor is particularly expensive. We found it a luxury well worth it-but a luxury nonetheless.Room 4 Dessert (17 Cleveland Place between Spring and Kenmare Streets, SoHo)Dessert: **Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **

The Italian restaurant Peasant is charming and delightful. Open kitchens are no longer a novelty, but no open kitchen contributes more to a restaurant's atmosphere as the one at Peasant. The raw, rustic aroma of its wood-burning stoves make you forget you're in New York City.The menu is entirely in Italian, and even seasoned diners will need a translation. (Anyone know the Italian word for cuttlefish?) The knowledgeable server (from New Zealand!) happily explained the menu all night long, but it's a lot to keep straight in your head. We wondered why they don't just print the translations on the menu itself, which would save both diners and servers a lot of trouble. The menu is printed on distressed paper, meant to look like it's an ancient relic.To start, I did indeed have the cuttlefish, which came in a super-heated cast-iron skillet. Bathed in vegetables and spices, it was delightful. For the main course, I tried an off-menu special, the suckling pig liver, which was tender and expertly prepared. My friend had the osso buco, of which I had a taste. It was about as flavorful as any osso buco I've tried.The bread service came with an overflowing bowl of soft ricotta (but we had to use our appetizer knives to spread it with). It took plenty of self-control to limit ourselves to one slice each.Dinner for two, with a moderately-priced bottle of wine, came to $133 with tax, before tip.Peasant (194 Elizabeth Street between Spring and Prince Streets, NoLIta)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: **

The restaurant Arqua has been dishing out solid rustic Italian fare in east TriBeCa for almost twenty years. Bryan Miller's two-star review, dating from 1990, comes right out of a time warp:Arqua is out of the way for most fans of Italian food, unless you have business at City Hall or are prosecuting drug dealers in Federal court. Speaking of courts, that artichoke lasagna alone is reason to volunteer for jury duty.Nowadays, TriBeCa restaurants no longer depend on prosecutors and city contractors to stay in business. Indeed, traffic must be better than ever, because earlier this year Arqua opened a casual cousin across the street, Petrarca Cucina e Vino, an informal restaurant and wine bar.Miller found Arqua's wine list over-priced, but Petrarca has an ample number of reasonable selections by the quartino, many priced at $20 or under. You can nurse two glasses out of a quartino, so that's not bad by today's standards.After I ordered some wine, the bartender offered me a selection of bar snacks. I should have been suspicious, because it was clear the other patrons weren't touching them. Indeed, they were cold, dull, and about ready to become cat food - except that most cats would have the good sense to give them a pass.The decor is rustic chic, with broad windows, wine bottles on floor-to-ceiling shelves surrounding the room, and comfortable bar stools. There are tables for dinner, but I didn't examine a menu. I won't rate a restaurant solely on stale bar snacks, but would note that Frank Bruni wasn't smitten.Petrarca Cucina e Vino (34 White Street at Church Street, TriBeCa)

When you want a quick bite before a concert at Lincoln Center, Sushi-A-Go-Go is certainly worth a look. The brightest spot on an otherwise dreary-looking block, Sushi-A-Go-Go offers perfectly respectable sushi at a price that won't bust the budget.Their version of the omakase, a Sushi and Sashimi Tasting for Two ($38), came with at least a dozen different kinds of raw fish and fish rolls, with a minimum of four pieces each (sometimes six). All were competently prepared, and at $19 a person, probably one of the better sushi deals going for the money. Don't ask for any substitutions, though. A glass of Sake Sangria ($7.50) and a Go-Go Cocktail ($8) were also bargains in a town where any cocktail under $10 seems like a misprint.Sushi-A-Go-Go is designed to turn tables in a hurry. It seemed like we waited a long time for our sushi platter, and our server was sometimes hard to flag down when we needed her, but in the end we were out of there in about 40 minutes. As one of the few Lincoln Center restaurants you can always get into without a reservation - and also one of the better bargains of the neighborhood - Sushi-A-Go-Go is usually full, as it was last night. The bright orange interior is the perfect antidote to a gloomy autumn evening.Outdoor dining is available in the summer, but while Sushi-A-Go-Go had already closed its outdoor tables for the season, we were surprised to find them open at other restaurants on the block. It shows what you sometimes have to endure for a pre-theatre meal across the street from Lincoln Center.Sushi-A-Go-Go (1900 Broadway between 63rd & 64th Streets, Upper West Side)Food: *Service: OkayAmbiance: *Overall: *

This week, as Frank Bruni recuperates from his Roman Holiday, Julia Moskin filled in with a two-star review of the Morgan Dining Room.I suppose that if one is going to review a restaurant so far off the radar, the least one can do is award two stars - otherwise, why bother? But the Morgan Dining Room is open only for lunch six days a week, and for dinner just one day a week (Fridays, 5 to 9). And of the recommended dishes...Green salad, beet salad, ricotta and Swiss chard tart, mussels, striped bass on squash risotto, salmon with baby carrots and parsnips, lobster salad, fruit cobbler, cookie plate...most are salads or desserts. Of the mussels, striped bass and salmon, all we're told is that they're \"successful.\" All in all, if this is a two-star restaurant - and I'm not saying it couldn't be - Moskin's case is rather limp.Steve Cuozzo of the Post says he doesn't write reviews any more, but in a piece today called \"Messed Western,\" he seems to do exactly that, dropping the hammer on Ted Turner's Montana Grill and Tim Love's Lonesome Dove Western Bistro. The original Lonesome Dove carries the Zagat #1 food rating in Dallas, so Cuozzo's review, if true, would be a significant fall from grace. Undeterred by Cuozzo's review, I'm keeping my reservation at the Lonesome Dove a week from Saturday.

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to The Little Owl. The food press and the blogosphere have been raving about The Little Owl since it opened in the the West Village in late May. We gave it a try last night, and while we had a thoroughly enjoyable casual meal, we were a tad less enraptured than others who've written about it.I started with an Ahi Tuna appetizer ($10). A seared two-inch square of tuna was served atop a mixed green salad. One cannot complain about the price, but I found the tuna a bit too dry. The dish was missing something. My friend found French Onion Soup ($9) competently prepared.We both ordered The Pork Chop ($20) that everyone has cheered about. It must be an inch and a half thick before cooking and is served with permesan butter beans and wild dandelion. We were impressed with the powerful seasoning (\"cayenne, curry, coriander and cumin\" in Frank Bruni's description), the tenderness, and the impressive swagger of that massive pork chop-probably a custom cut for The Little Owl, as I don't recall seeing anything like it elsewhere.News of The Pork Chop (capitalized thus on the menu) has spread far and wide, and I saw plenty of them coming out of the kitchen during our visit. Gravy meatball sliders ($9) are a popular appetizer, but as I knew a heavy pork chop was coming, I didn't have the appetite to try them.There are many things to love about The Little Owl. The servers do a terrific job of navigating the small space. Most entrees are under $25, most appetizers under $14. The wine list has plenty of fine bottles under $50 (always my litmus test at this kind of restaurant), as well as a good selection of half-bottles. Despite the constant rush for tables, there were no sign of hints for us to leave, even though it was clear we were done ordering and just wanted to linger over the wine. The check was delivered only after we asked for it.But the space is awfully cramped. The restaurant allegedly accommodates 28 diners at tables and 5 at the bar, but we saw only 2 at the bar (sitting rather cosily), and couldn't conceive of where 3 more could go. Our table was more like a cocktail table, and we needed every square inch of it. The bread service was a dull French bread probably made the night before and a dish of olive oil. The decor is fairly plain. Though no reservations were available, a few tables are always available for walk-ins. The receptionist advised that we would probably be seated right away if we arrived at 6:00 p.m.-and we were. Had we arrived a short while later, we probably would not have been.Frank Bruni awarded two stars to The Little Owl. I suppose one cannot come down too hard on Bruni, as Adam Platt did the same in New York (albeit on a five-star scale). But it still seems to me, as I noted in my Dressler review, that ratings entirely lose their meaning if the same two stars are awarded to The Little Owl and Cafe Gray. Although I award one star to both Dressler and The Little Owl, we actually liked Dressler a little better.The Little Owl (90 Bedford Street at Grove Street, West Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *

I live quite close by Gigino at Wagner Park, and have always been aware of it. But I was never motivated to go there, perhaps because I assumed there would be nothing special about the food. A friend suggested lunch there today, and I was more than happy for an excuse to check it out.There are indeed plenty of Italian restaurants in the city that are at least as good as Gigino. But Gigino turns out quite respectable dishes, such as fried polenta on a bed of risotto and chopped sausage, or hearty seafood stew, or a dessert of bread pudding. All of these are available on the three-course prix fixe ($25.99 at lunch, $29.99 at dinner).The unobstructed view of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor is stunning. Although it is almost mid-October, the weather was nice enough to eat outside. The indoor tables face wide picture windows, so the scenery should be worth looking at even after the weather turns.We were happy with the efficient service.Gigino at Wagner Park (20 Battery Place at West Street, Financial District)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Don't underestimate this place. Their food is consistently quite good, and the service just fine. But on a warm evening or afternoon, when you can sit outside, there are few places that offer what Gigino's does - a spectactular harbor view in a wonderfully pleasant and unpretentious setting.

***CONTENT
The Meatpacking District is surprisingly light on the commodity it's named for: red meat. There's the Old Homestead, which has been in the nighborhood since the streets were lined with prostitutes, and Craftsteak, which technically is in Chelsea. Frank's, a mediocre Italian steakhouse nearboy, is also technically in Chelsea. That leaves the new STK (\"ess-tee-kay\") as the only Meatpacking District steakhouse that actually feels like the neighborhood.A look at the website will have you quickly doubting whether STK is at all serious about, you know, steak. The splash animation begins with the word \"SCENE\" in white letters on a fucsia background. The word \"STEAK\" fades in and out; then \"SEAFOOD\"; then \"SALAD.\" On the main page:The bustling bar scene is the centerpiece, the menu is inspired, the DJ creates the sexy vibe and the atmosphere is relaxed.Party rooms are called \"Lillie St. Cyr,\" \"Do May,\" \"Tempest Storm\" and \"Candy Barr.\" The design renderings (here, here, here) suggest a restaurant with everything but steak on its mind. All three feature lithe twenty-somethings in short skirts, in what appears to be a moody nightclub setting. From the pictures, it's not even clear that there's any actual dining tables. The opening invite does nothing to dispel this impression. It shows a leggy model in a red micro-dress, from behind, holding a cleaver and a steak on a meathook. The caption reads, \"Not your daddy's steakhouse.\"For all that, STK's menu (PDF) offers much to be thankful for. Steaks come in three categories: small ($18-26), medium ($29-59) and large ($49-74). It's a welcome change from the typical steakhouse, where your choices are limited to large and humungous. There's also an ample selection of non-steak entrees ($24-46). By far the most expensive of these is a funky-sounding dish called Surf, Turf & Earth, which includes tuna, black truffles, and foie gras. Salads ($10-18) and appetizers ($11-20) include most of the usual suspects, but foie gras french toast ($20) and shrimp rice krispy's ($14) sure seem worth a look.I ordered the bone-in rib steak ($36). It had a strong flavor and was cooked perfectly to the medium rare I'd requested. If it wasn't the best rib-eye I've had, it was certainly superior to the one I had at Porter House NY last week. You can choose from among six steak sauces, such as salsa verde and blue butter, but I chose the house STK Sauce, which added a commendable bit of spice to an already good steak. Although listed in the menu's \"medium\" section, at 24 oz. this rib-eye is an impressive hunk of meat. You had better be hungry if you order the Cowboy Rib-Steak (36 oz., $49). The hefty steak knife, by the way, is one of the more impressive specimens I've seen. \"Be careful,\" the server said as he dropped it off.Side dishes ($9) include many of the usual suspects, but Parmesan Truffle Fries were intriguing enough to be worth a look. They came stacked like lincoln logs, with each fry about half-an-inch square, and about four inches long. I thought perhaps they'd be better if they weren't quite as thick, but I suspect they'll be a hit with many diners.The wine and liquor list is very reasonably priced, with an ample number of bottles under $50. A glass of 10-year tawny port was only $10.I would normally end my review here, but I want to report on the drama that took place a couple of tables away. A married couple that looked about twenty years too old for the restaurant had both ordered the sirloin ($38). They asked to speak to a manager. \"This is the worst steak I've had in my life,\" the man said. His wife concurred. They practically shoved their plates in the manager's face, declined her offer to re-do the steaks or send out something else, and asked for the check.I assumed that was the end of it, but a few minutes later out came the chef, Todd Mark Miller. He introduced himself, explained that he was \"new to the project,\" and did all but get down on bended knee and beg the couple to allow him to re-do their steaks. Miller also offered to comp a foie gras appetizer, which the couple would not accept. But they did finally agree to accept new steaks, which Miller said he would cook himself.A short while later, out came Miller with a parade of busboys, with two freshly cooked sirloins (which he again reminded them he cooked himself) and extra side dishes. Miller insisted on waiting till the couple had tasted the steaks, to ensure they were done correctly. For the first time, the man smiled and nodded his head. His satisfaction must have been sincere, because he did finish the steak, and his wife left only a little behind.I don't know if I've ever seen a chef do more personally to try to please two difficult customers. It impressed me even more because-well, it seems indelicate to say so, but this couple seemed so out-of-place in the neighborhood. They could tell all their friends to avoid STK, and it wouldn't really make a difference, insofar as the management's intended demographic is concerned. But the restaurant was determined to make it right, when they could just as easily have given the couple their check, and forgotten about them.As the publicity photos suggest, STK does have an unusually large bar space, but there are also two dining rooms and an upper level with four private rooms and a private cocktail area. A rooftop cafe with a separate menu will open next summer. The rock music sound track is not unreasonably loud. The clientele is generally young. The two women at the table next to me, both about 30, each ordered a blue iceberg lettuce salad and steaks from the \"small\" portion of the menu. They're the kind of diners who will love STK, but probably wouldn't choose a conventional steakhouse.If my dining experience wasn't transcendent, it was perfectly solid. Much more of the menu looks to be worth exploring. The scenery is easy on the eyes, and the service is just fine.STK (26 Little W. 12th Street between Washington & Greenwich Streets, Meatpacking District)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: *

My friend and I were wowed by our dinner at Aquavit Cafe in April. The kitchen sent out a bunch of free food, and everything we had was first-rate, so we decided to try it again on Saturday night.We both decided on the prix fixe ($37), choosing the herring sampler and the Swedish meatballs. I chose the Arctic Circle for dessert. I described these dishes in two earlier reports (here and here), so I won't repeat myself. This time, there was no free food-not that I had any right to expect any. Service was somewhat less efficient than before.A $20 wine pairing is available with the prix fixe. The herring sampler came with beer and potato vodka, as in the main dining room. It's a Swedish tradition, and I can't complain. But the meatballs came with the most bitter Merlot I've ever been served. Didn't these guys see Sideways? This was an uninspired choice, to say the least. Happily, fizzy dessert wine with our third course washed away the Merlot's acidic taste.I continue to like Aquavit Cafe for an offbeat casual dinner. It's also an excellent date place, as you can actually hear yourself talk-an increasingly rare luxury in Manhattan restaurants.Aquavit Cafe (65 E 55th St between Park & Madison Aves, East Midtown)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Porter House New York

Note: Click here and here for more recent reviews of Porter House New York.The Restaurant Collection at the Time-Warner Center was meant to be the most luminous assemblage of chefs ever gathered under one roof. Each of its five restaurants was considered a New York Times three or four-star candidate. Some, like Masa and Per Se, lived up to their promise. Cafe Gray has had its problems initially, but now seems to be flourishing, with a Michelin star to its credit. Charlie Trotter's restaurant never opened, and a clone of TriBeCa standout Landmarc is to replace it.Then there was V Steakhouse. With cuisine by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, it should have been a sure thing. But it never recovered from a devastating one-star review by Frank Bruni and a menu featuring $70 steaks. It was the first Time-Warner restaurant to fail, and also Vongerichten's first failure. Replacing it is-guess what? Another steakhouse.Porter House New York is run by chef Michael Lomonaco, formerly of Windows on the World. Luckily he had a pair of eyeglasses to pick up on September 11, 2001, or he would have been at work, and would have perished along with 3,000 other people. He's a popular guy, and he has a lot of folks rooting for him.Porter House opened over the October 1st weekend. In a show of goodwill, the restaurant offered 20% off the bill for the first week of operation. It would be nice to see a few more restaurants do that while they work out the inevitable early kinks. Plenty of people had heard about it. I had trouble getting a prime time reservation, and the restaurant was packed when we arrived at 8:30 on Friday night.It used to be that Manhattan steakhouses were so predictable you could write the menu in your sleep. In recent years, a breed of haute steakhouses has emerged, led by such standouts as BLT Steak, BLT Prime, Quality Meats, Craftsteak, and alas, V Steakhouse. These restaurants have the usual steakhouse staples, but more creative menus and a less \"clubby\" atmosphere.Like these haute steakhouses, Porter House aims at a broader audience. On Friday night, one of the tables near ours was a family of seven celebrating a birthday. Another was a family of three, including a young child, out for a casual dinner. Neither group would have chosen Sparks or Peter Luger. Porter House has a cool elegance that makes it suitable for a fancy night out, but without V Steakhouse's gilded trappings that scared away families and casual diners. A buzzing bar area with two wide-screen TVs is another signal that Porter House doesn't want to be taken too seriously.The menu, however, is not all that creative. There are a few more seafood entrees than you see at some steakhouses, but for style points it has nothing on BLT Steak or Quality Meats. I ordered the smoked salmon to start, my friend the clams casino-both standard steakhouse dishes. The salmon came with a clever garnish of tomato, avocado and chickpeas.My friend is partial to the ribeye ($36), so we both had that. It was served off the bone, and although cooked to the correct temperature and nicely charred, the marbling was uneven. Overall, it was well off the pace of the city's better ribeye steaks. Side dishes were priced mostly at $9. I enjoyed creamed spinach with bacon, but my friend thought that french fries had been left under a heat lamp for too long.Service was not unfriendly, but has a long way to go. Food took a long time to come out. At the table of seven next to us, one diner got his steak long after everyone else. Two side dishes came out (with profuse apologies) after the meal was almost concluded. At our table, the lemon from my friend's appetizer course was left behind after the other plates had been cleared. The spinach came without a serving spoon. Mid-way through the meal, our waiter just disappeared for about half an hour.The wine list is mostly American. It is about as expensive as you'd expect for this kind of restaurant. We were able to find a red that pleased us for around $60, in a peculiar category called \"Interesting.\" I didn't know there was a grape by that name.I think Porter House will do well, as its informality serves a definite need. Judging by the crowds, it has already caught on. But judged in the cold light of day, Porter House is not the creative tour de force of a BLT Steak or BLT Prime, and as a classic steakhouse it's not preferable to either Wolfgang's or Strip House.Porter House New York (Time-Warner Center, 10 Columbus Circle, 4th floor)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: *

Note: Since this review, Compass has changed chefs yet again. John Fraser left in 2007 to open his own restaurant, Dovetail, and founding chef Neil Annis is once again in charge of the kitchen.A friend and I visited Compass last night (previous reviews here). I believe this was the first time I've been seated in a booth. The upholstery is ultra-plush, and I practically disappeared into it.The $35 prix fixe is one of the better deals in town. The amuse bouche was a small soup. A basket of several kinds of bread rolls arrived, and I could very well have spoiled dinner by eating too many of them. The appetizer was a Butternut Squash Veloute with brown butter. After it arrived, a server sprinkled a pixie dust of pumpernickel, apples and parsnips into the soup. Up next was the Pistachio-crusted duck, with roasted endive and carrot emulsion. Both first-rate. The dessert (yogurt panna cotta) was unmemorable. As always, there were petits-fours after dinner and a small coffee cake to take home.They recommend wines by the glass to go with each course-perfectly respectable choices, varying from $9-14 per glass. We'd already had a good deal to drink before dinner, so we just had one glass with the main course. The menu on the website is up-to-date. It's very much as I've described it in the past, although I see the porterhouse steak is no longer on offer.Compass (208 W 70th St., West of Amsterdam Avenue, Upper West Side)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

Peking Duck House

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a more recent review of Peking Duck House. Peking Duck House is a restaurant you visit for only one dish. Their own website puts it admirably: \"It's all about the duck!\" I visited the uptown location (236 E 53rd St. between Second & Third Avenues) a couple of months ago, only to find out that my guest didn't care for duck. He could have saved me a lot of trouble by mentioning that before we went inside-in which case I'd have chosen somewhere else. Mind you, it wasn't a bad meal as Chinese food goes. But I wanted the duck, and the restaurant doesn't serve it in portions for one. Last night I visited the Chinatown branch. My friend said she was longing for Peking Duck, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed again. You can order the whole duck for $43, but in my experience it's too much duck for two diners to polish off. But for $35 a head, you get soup, a plate of appetizers, half of a duck, a second entree, fried rice, and fresh fruit for dessert. If that sounds like a lot of food-well, it is. We were happy to have Shrimp Sizzling Rice Soup as an option. The shrimp gave the soup an unexpected crunchiness. Many Chinese restaurants offer just the usual Egg Drop or Hot & Sour soups, either of which is instantly forgotten. But we won't forget the sizzling shrimp. An appetizer plate came with a spring roll, a vegetable dumpling, barbecued beef on a skewer, and the highlight: Chopped Chicken and Pinenuts on a bed of fresh lettuce, which you roll up and eat like a taco. This was a new appetizer to me, and I might just go back and get a whole order of it. As our dinner included only half a Peking Duck, we were deprived of the usual spectacle of tableside carving. Instead, the kitchen brought out two of the housemade pancakes for each of us, already stuffed with duck, scallions, cucumbers, and special sauce. That succulent duck ran rings around the pale imitation of it that I had at Buddakan a few weeks ago. I'm not a big eater, and I could have gone home full at that point, but a second entree was coming. We chose the Peking Lobster with ginger and scallions. It was a whole lobster, still in the shell, but cracked and split open for easy access to the meat. I'm afraid we ate very little of it, but not due to any flaw of the dish. (My friend took most of it home.) A generous fresh fruit platter likewise went mostly untouched. This excellent repast was just $35 a head. Beers were a whopping $3.50 each. I saw wine at some tables, but I was not offered a wine list, even after I asked about it. While I would happily recommend the food, the service wins no awards. When I arrived, it was a full ten minutes before anyone took a drink order. And don't expect them to notice if your drink runs out-you have to flag them down. The restaurant is designed to turn tables in a hurry, so once you've placed your order, you can expect the courses to come trooping out of the kitchen with military precision. After a 2004 renovation, the decor is slightly better than Chintatown's Plain Jane standard, but still pretty dull, especially after you get past the first few tables up front. Tables are packed fairly tightly together, although a less-crowded downstairs dining room seems to offer more elbow room. I didn't write a review of my visit to the uptown location, but as I recall the service there was a bit more polished.

Barbuto is one of my old favorites (earlier report here). Although it is on the edge of the Meatpacking District, Barbuto is far more civilized than most of the area's other restaurants, so I was happy to go back. Temperatures on Saturday evening were just nippy enough that the big garage doors were down. The restaurant was busy, but not full.I started with roasted butternut squash ($12), followed by the excellent whole grilled black sea bass ($21), which had a nutty crunch. My friend had the salt cod cake ($10), which she loved-it was not too salty, despite the name-followed by the oven roasted chicken ($17). We added a side dish of sauteed greens and ricotta ($6). Although the food was solidly prepared, I noted that there is still no bread service, which seems to me a peculiar omission in a restaurant of such ambition.We were irritated to find that the wine list had few reds under $50, and indeed many well over $70. It seems to me that at a restaurant with entrees in the high teens and low twenties, good bottles under $50 shouldn't be so hard to come by. We settled on a $40 bottle that was adequate, but unimpressive.After dinner, we headed over to Brandy Library for a brandy tasting and some gougères. We should end more evenings that way.Barbuto (775 Washington Street at West 12th Street, West Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Frank Bruni raised eyebrows in June, when he awarded two stars to Dressler, a Williamsburg newcomer that-from the description-seemed to be simply a solid neighborhood restaurant. Whether it deserved those stars I'll get to in a moment. But Bruni put Dressler on my radar screen (and apparently lots of other people's), and last night I finally got to see for myself what the fuss was about.When you think of restaurants in Williamsburg, Peter Luger springs to mind. But just a block away is Dressler, and better yet, it doesn't take three months to get a prime-time reservation. Williamsburg is gentrifying by the minute, and Dressler's arrival could very well signal that the neighborhood is primed to become a dining destination (for something other than porterhouse steak, that is). It's just one subway stop into Brooklyn on the J train, and a four-block walk from the Marcy Avenue stop.Williamsburg still has a ways to go, however. Other than Dressler and Peter Luger, virtually every other storefront on this section of Broadway was locked tight on Friday evening. Many buildings are still covered in grafitti. Walk just another block west of Dressler, and suddenly the neighborhood starts looking a little scary. (I'm not saying it is scary-only that it looks that way.) We might have said the same about TriBeCa 25 years ago, or what is now Lincoln Center 50 years ago.Dressler is certainly packing them in, and not with a neighborhood crowd. The generally young clientele have heard the buzz, and are coming from all over town. The host told us as much, when he said, \"All our reservations are running late, because a subway train got stuck.\" Indeed, we were not seated until about 20 minutes after our reservation time. But we were immediately impressed by the friendliness of the staff. At many hot restaurants, the hosts act like they're doing you a favor to even notice your existence. At Dressler, they apologized profusely, several times, for the delay.The restaurant is in a deep, narrow storefront. It seats about 60. Black cast iron filligree on the chandeliers and wall decorations put an unusual slant on standard bistro decor. Those chandeliers were enough to captivate us all evening long. Brown paper takes the place of table cloths, in a space that is rather tightly packed. With plenty of exposed hard surfaces, the noise level is on the slightly uncomfortable side of loud.Smoked sturgeon ($10) comes in a vertically-stacked dish that also includes a potato galette, frisee, arugula, crème fraiche, and truffle vinaigrette. I can well understand why Frank Bruni refused to share it with anyone else. My friend was pleased with a black mission fig and baby arugula salad ($9)Seared Ahi Tuna ($24), a new dish on the menu (so the server informed me) also came in a vertical stack, with several kinds of vegetables. Duck ($26) came with both sliced breast and the braised thigh on a bed of risotto. Many restaurants charge as much, or more, for the breast alone. My friend gave it a strong thumbs-up.Frank Bruni complained that a Strawberry-Rhubarb Crisp ($8) with buttermilk ice cream was so goopy that it needed a straw. That problem (if it ever was one) has been corrected. It was warm and comforting, and we had no trouble eating it with our forks.The wine list is short, but there are plenty of reasonably-priced bottles under $50. The bread service is unimpressive, with consisting of hard rolls that were probably baked the night before. The service was extremely solid, especially considering that our server appeared to have quite a few tables to cover.Well, what about those two stars? Quite simply, Frank Bruni is crazy. On the New York Times rating system, one star means \"good,\" and that's precisely what Dressler is. We had a great time at a very reasonable price by New York standards, and would happily come back. But when Dressler is lumped into the same category as Alto, The Modern, Cafe Gray and Eleven Madison Park, it makes Bruni into a laughing stock.Dressler (149 Broadway between Driggs and Bedford Aves, Williamsburg)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: *

Just for the record, the part of Williamsburg that has already developed a dining scene (albeit not much of a \"destination\" one) is the North Side, around the Bedford Ave. L stop. There are loads and loads of restaurants and shops around there. That's the (very) gentrified part of Williamsburg (as opposed to the South Side where Luger's is). (Anyway, don't forget that Diner is also on the stretch of Broadway around Luger's and Dressler.)

Note: Chef Michael Psilakis closed Onera in late 2006, re-opening in a more casual version of itself called Kefi. He then opened Anthos in East Midtown, a formal Greek restaurant even more refined than Onera.In a neighborhood short on elegant dining options, Onera is an oasis of calm. My friend was immediately taken by the cool, relaxing environment. The original chef, Michael Psilakis, has since expanded his empire to Dona (which he shares with Donatella Arpaia), though he remains chef/owner at Onera.The menu has morphed since my first visit a year or two ago. There's no longer quite as much emphasis on organ meat-a choice that had put Onera on the map, but apparently hadn't wowed diners. The cuisine seems safer now, but it's still plenty good.The menu remains a tad over-complicated. There's a choice of \"meze\" to start ($11 for two, or $22 for five), appetizers ($9-12), salads ($8-9), pasta ($15-17), fish ($23-26), and meat courses ($18-24). Some of those categories could be merged. It would be nice if the pastas were available in smaller appetizer-sized portions.Anyhow, we each chose a pasta and an entree. I had the sheep milk dumplings ($16), which were plenty of spicy fun, although slightly cloying in an almost main course-sized portion. My friend chose the Greek risotto ($16), which came with shrimp, spinach, onion, tomato, and feta cheese. I had a taste of this, and it was absolutely spectacular. I was jealous! This must be the city's best risotto bargain.Ah well, the haze sets in, and I've forgotten the entrees, except that mine was fish and hers was chicken, both well executed and enjoyable. The wine list has an impressive selection of Greek wines at reasonable prices. The bread service is bountiful, and you could easily spoil the meal if you snack on too much of it.Onera (222 W. 79th St. between Amsterdam Avenue & Broadway, Upper West Side)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: **½Overall: **½

Sfoglia has gotten its share of good press lately. Andrea Strong said, \"I would consider a move Uptown for this restaurant.\" In New York, Adam Platt was smitten, awarding three stars on his five-star scale.I was nowhere near as impressed. I started with the cheese antipasto ($10), which comes with crackers and a house-made jam, while my friend started with the creamy polenta ($11). Both presentations were competent, though not revelatory. I moved on to the veal chop ($25), which was a nice hunk of tender flesh spiced with a hint of sambuca. My friend had the fish of the day, which I believe was halibut-a generously sized portion. She gave me a taste, and sure enough the kitchen had gotten it right.But for all that, the restaurant is not very comfortable. Strong said, \"the vibe is soft and sexy.\" Well, Strong thinks something is sexy every week. It's a faux rustic decor that is pleasant, but unremarkable. Our table for two didn't allow much elbow room. Wine was served in water tumblers. Although it was a white wine, there was no ice bucket.If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd pay a visit occasionally. Next time I go to the 92nd Street Y, I'll consider it. But it's not a dining destination.Sfoglia (1402 Lexington Avenue at 92nd Street, Upper East Side)Food: *½Service: okayAmbiance: *Overall: *Update: In March 2007, Frank Bruni awarded two stars to Sfoglia in the Times.

5 Years Later: Rebuilding? Not.

***CONTENT
When I started this blog, I created a category called \"Rebuilding\" for my comments about downtown and the World Trade Center site. But on the fifth anniversary of 9/11, precious little has been rebuilt. The sum total of the accomplishments at Ground Zero are the replacement for 7 World Trade Center (a gorgeous building, but largely unoccupied); the reconstructed #1 subway tunnel (important, but largely invisible); and the WTC PATH station (which is temporary).In a fascinating long article called \"The Hole in the City,\" published today in the Times, Deborah Sontag reviews all of the missteps that have gotten us to where we are today, with Ground Zero still what it was on September 12, 2001: a 16-acre hole in the ground. Several key errors have created this five-year stalemate. Most of them are directly attributable to Governor George Pataiki's incompetence. He either made the decisions himself, or selected the key people who did:Larry Silverstein. His lease with the Port Authority compelled the agency to replace the office space that was lost on 9/11. Early on, the government could have forced him out. That would have meant the loss of lease payments that total more than $100m per year. But rather than frankly admitting the trade-off, leaders kept dancing around it, hoping the issue would quietly go away. It hasn't.The Families. Early on, Pataki decided to kow-tow to the families who lost loved ones in the 9/11 attacks. Their near-veto power over the site has been a constant impediment to development. Incredibly, Pataki's impetuous announcement that the footprints would be considered sacred (one of the 9/11 families' highest priorities) was not cleared in advance with site planners.Daniel Libeskind. Pataki hand-picked Liebeskind's ugly site plan, overruling rebuilding officials' preference for a rival plan. Today, most of Liebeskind's plan has been compromised out of existence. But his continuous presence has been a constant irritant. Liebeskind had no experience with a project on this scale, and many of his ideas were wildly impractical. Years ago, Liebeskind should have been thanked for his contributions, and sent packing.The Freedom Tower. This massive skyscraper, a symbolic 1,776 feet tall, was supposed to be the site's iconic landmark. But Liebeskind put it in the wrong place, at the corner of the site that's farthest from mass transportation, and Pataki refused to move it. The governor presided over the laying of the cornerstone on July 4, 2004. Since then, the stone has been \"unlaid,\" and put into storage. A costly redesign was mandated after the police department insisted the building had to conform to the security requirements of an overseas U. S. embassy. (These are the same cowards who have refused to re-open Park Row in Lower Manhattan.) It is still not clear whether the Freedom Tower will get built, as Pataki has not delivered on his promise to secure government tenants for it.Culture. I thought it was a great idea to mix culture and commerce at Ground Zero. But of the four cultural tenants the rebuilding agency selected, not one was a marquis name. Pataki ejected two of the four, out of fear that they would showcase unpatriotic content. The remaining two don't seem to have a prayer of raising the $50m required to build a Frank Gehry-designed theater on the site's northern edge.Transportation. On the transit front, there has actually been some good news. Construction is well underway for the Fulton Street Transit Center and the new South Ferry Terminal. But to accommodate the former project, almost 150 small businesses lost their leases. A temporary PATH terminal, which cost some $300 million, opened just two years after 9/11. Its permanent replacement, at a price over $2 billion, is now under construction. Developers called it a \"downtown Grand Central.\" But maybe it's just wretched excess. Grand Central has 45 sets of train tracks, while the PATH station has just five. The new station will have space for an express train service to JFK airport-another Pataki priority-but there's no assurance it will ever get built.All over downtown, there are large banners proclaiming all the great things that will get built by 2009 or 2010. Anyone who has followed the lack of progress downtown knows the instinctive response: Don't hold your breath.

Eric Asimov awarded three stars to L'Impero in December 2002, while Frank Bruni gave Alto a two-star kiss-off in July 2005. For a restaurant helmed by so well regarded a chef, it was a significant slapdown. Bruni seemed almost vengeful in that review, calling Alto \"haute and bothered,\" but it never really made sense. A celebration for my friend's birthday provided the excuse to see for ourselves whether Bruni was right.Alto is named for the Alto Adige a region of northern Italy. It's a companion to L'Impero, which features the food of southern Italy. But Conant plays with flavors and ingredients, and aside from an emphasis on pasta dishes, one is not really conscious of a focus on Italy. We ordered the seven-course tasting menu ($115) with wine pairings ($75). The server said that the kitchen would substitute freely, but we took the menu as printed. After a delicious amuse-bouche of smoked trout, we had:Branzino Tartare (avocado, gremolata and preserved lemon vinaigrette)Poached Black Sea Bass (caponata panzanella and lemon thyme broth)Veal and Fontina Angolotti (organic baby carrots, baby mushrooms, and parmigiano emulsion)Risotto with Frogs Legs (summer squash and black truffles)Roast Suckling Pig (smoked corn, chanterelles and black pepper agrodolce)Braised Beef Short Ribs (vegetable and farro risotto)Warm Chocolate Ganache (milk chocolate gelato, roasted peanot froth)We found the pacing and variety of the dishes, the combination of ingredients, and the quality of the presentation, all impeccable. The first four dishes were unanimous hits. The branzino tartare was meltingly delicious. The crunchy caponata was a perfect contrast to the soft black sea bass. We noted that the risotto ran rings around the one we had at Del Posto (for which Mario Batali charges $50). I found my suckling pig a bit tough, but my friend said that her portion was wonderfully tender. Short ribs, I suppose, were a rote inclusion not quite as exciting as the other items. The staff were alerted in advance that it was my friend's birthday, and her dessert came with \"Happy Birthday\" written on the plate in chocolate calligraphy.Conant has made some changes since Frank Bruni's two-star review. Some dishes that skewed towards German-Austrian cuisine have been dropped. There is no longer a bottle of olive oil on every table. The menu, formerly prix fixe-only at dinner ($75 for four courses), is now available à la carte. It was a Saturday night, and the restaurant was not full - I suspect they are starting to get desperate. The decor, which Bruni hated, appears to be unchanged. For us, it was elegant, refined, serene-delightful.We found the service attentive and impressive. Many dishes were delivered with half-moon covers, and the food uncovered with that voila! moment that is so seldom seen these days in restaurants. I was mildly irritated when we ordered champagne, but the sommelier could not explain what it was. (\"It just came in and I'm not too familiar with it, but I'll be happy to help you with any of your other wine selections.\") At $15 per glass, she should know.There was an addictive selection of homemade breads, but oddly enough they came with no butter, and the bread server's accent was so thick that we couldn't quite understand all of the five choices. A couple of the other dishes were dropped off by barely-comprehensible servers. Am I asking too much when I suggest that at a restaurant of Alto's calibre, a reasonable command of English should be required of those entrusted with describing the food?These minor complaints aside, Alto did a lovely job on a special occasion. We would gladly go back.Update: The day before our visit, Eater put Alto on deathwatch, with an over/under of January, noting that \"Conant's investors can't be very happy with the thin dinner crowds. There's even a rumor circulating that the venue is up for sale, which, no, does not bode well at all.\" I hope it survives, but I must admit the same thought crossed my mind when I saw the number of empty tables on a Saturday night.Update 2: Since our visit, Scott Conant has departed, and Michael White is now the chef.

In 2002, Arin Crumley and Susan Buice met on an Internet dating service. Crumley hatched the idea that the two struggling artists would communicate solely through \"notes, pics, music and videos.\" When they had sex for the first time, they had never spoken to one another, though they had exchanged plenty of post-it notes. A year later, they quit their jobs, went deeply into debt, and made a feature film about their peculiar relationship. It's called Four Eyed Monsters - Crumley's term for romantic couples.The film was accepted by the Slamdance Film Festival and premiered there in January 2005. It has since been seen at 18 festivals. Unable to find a distributor, Crumley and Buice have distributed it themselves. People vote on their website, and if there are at least 150 votes in a city, they arrange for it to be shown there. There are showings in six cities during September. In New York, it will be seen every Thursday in September at the IFC Film Center, 323 Sixth Avenue at West Fourth Street. A friend and I saw it last week.Without Crumley's \"no speaking\" rule, there would be nothing worth watching about the relationship of two New York twenty-somethings. That, and the couple's very dark sense of humor, make Four Eyed Monsters compelling viewing. Crumley and Buice are so insecure that it would take years on an analyst's couch to work out their inner demons. But they are able to laugh about themselves and their artistic alienation, without which the film would be an overly precious exercise in navel-gazing.The film also has an under-current of what one audience-member called meta-narrative. It's a film about two people who decide to make a film about their relationship, and the film they make is the one you're watching. Crumley and Buice do a compelling job of dramatizing the early days of their relationship, cleverly mixing animation and live action. Some of the film is a re-creation of past events, and other parts are the actual videos and e-mails that they exchanged while they were dating. It's no small feat to re-tell your own story, and then act it out too, without boring the audience. Crumley and Buice have managed it.Early on - it might actually be the first date - their relationship hits a snag that would probably stop 99% of relationships dead in their tracks. That it doesn't is attributable to two factors. Buice has never created anything on her own that she is happy with. And Crumley wants to get laid regularly, something he has never done before meeting Buice. What begins as a romantic relationship turns into a cottage industry. A series of video podcasts available on their website is partly, made in the film's same edgy style, blurs the line between soap opera and marketing.My friend, who is romantic at heart, pointed out that we never see an actual romance. \"Do they even hold hands?\" she asked? No, they don't. It is entirely commercial. The relationship and the product have become one. We disagreed on which of the two leads is more appealing. My friend found Buice chilly and sterile, while I had the same reaction to Crumley. While both share the directing, producing, editing, acting and writing credit, it appeared to both of us that Crumley is the artistic mastermind. The no-talking rule, without which there would be no film, was his idea. When it wore out its welcome with her, he insisted on continuing it.Crumley and Buice attended the screening and took questions afterwards. There's a small coterie of groupies following their appearances. Someone in the audience wanted to ask whether the couple are still together (there were Internet rumors of a split), but he couldn't just come out and ask it. Buice finally rescued him, and said they still live in Williamsburg, and sleep together on a twin mattress. Another audience member congratulated them on giving a better answer than they did last time (whenver that was).Crumley said that we'd seen a new cut of the film, including an improved ending. Some people in the audience thought it still needed work, while others advised them to leave it alone. Buice suggested that perhaps the time was coming to \"stick a fork in it,\" but Crumley suggested that the tweaking might continue. Do they have another great project in them? Their website links to a short film that Buice did by herself. It's awful.Four Eyed Monsters, however, is a clever experimental film, and well worth checking out.

Hey,Thanks a bunch for talking about the film, even your blog post is not entirely made up of compliments, there in there, kind of burried, but ultimately, I think what your saying is that your kind of into it.You know what, thats okay. We know that our video podcasts are sort of a closet addiction, a little weird to admit to friends your into because of what that means about ones self. I know it's a freakishly weird project and has all kinds of qualities that really shouldn't have appeal, crap, a lot of times we don't like it, but utltimately I think the implications are bigger then \"Susan\" and \"Arin\", I don't really care about showcasing us as people, or showcasing our abilities, really we aim to touch on more universal ideas and concepts that are more current then anything mainstream is able to touch. A few corrections:We live in bushwick, not williambsburg. Also, I'm not the mastermind, it takes two to tango, the idea to not talk means nothing if you don't have someone that is down to do that with you, most girls would have said \"screw you jerk\", and in terms of working on the movie, it goes far beyond susan simply being willing to partcipate, we've both done each of the roles you mentioned above, writing, acting, editing, directing etc... each to equal degrees. In production there were alwasy more people then just susan and I, even if it was only one other person, so I could see making an argument that with out help, the two of us don't have t he ability to do something good, but the video podcast had partially been our way of proving to ourselves that we shouldn't worry about that. But we are a creative team and we do know for a fact that our sum is greater then our parts, and that is true for both me and for susan. Basically, I could give you some links to some hidious stuff I've done, and susan has done bad stuff in the past too, but the video you linked to is not one of those bad things, we still think it's good at what it was aiming to be and to talk about that as a demonstration of susan's abilities with out me is just idiotic because both of us were only really filmmakers about half way into making a feature film, we are the type that learned on the job, we aren't trained, we aren't those filmmakers that have made dozens of awesome short films before they embark on their feature, why, because we don't really give a crap about filmmaking, we like stories, and once we had our story, there was no reason to delay and develope the craft any further then we needed to in order to get the story across. Now, incedentelly, we do use craft to create aesthetic which we think is the second most important thing after the story, and once again, aesthetic is something susan and I equally contribute and is unique to our team effort and would be very different if we weren't working together.Comments:Don't know how it's labled as \"commercial\" to not have more hugs, kisses and holding hands. First of all that stuff is cheesy, so I'm glad we don't have it, second, that is exactly what hollywood would have caked through out this type of a story, why, well I guess because the lemmings want it. So our approach of, as you put it, \"sterile\" and \"cold\" encounters that ultimately add up to what is a, lets face it, a disfunctional relationship, is obviously not a big money maker, but what we hope is that it's truthful and for that reason people find it valid.But if you were suggesting our relationship is some how a facade to generate commercial gain, WOW! That is giving us some serious masterminding credit, we've always been honest about presenting the strengths and weaknesses our relationship has, it's not perfect, which is why we always hesitate to say, \"yes, we are madly in love and getting married next month\" when the audience asks us in Q&A's if we are still together. That said, mixed with all of the hardship, Susan and I have an amazing time together and want that to go on, and the only reason we are sleeping on a twin air matress is because our building was just treated for bed bugs and rather then sleep in a chemical doused bed, we decided to inflate our guest bed for ourselves. But, today we went to ridgewood and ordered a new bed coming tomorrow. Another note about the word \"commercial\" used in your blog post. Trust us, we are not making any money, nor do we intend to. Our only goal with FEM is to break even, get out of the credit card debt we are in from having made the film. That may be too \"lofty\" to think that the world works that way, but what if it did, I'd like to think all artists and creators would be rueting for that because that would be a great sign for everybodies endevours that they wish they could do full time. I only bring this up so that people don't resent the idea that, \"YES, we do want people to go out to theaters and pay to see our creation!!\" And we don't feel there should be any shame in that. And just because our film is personal in nature doesn't mean it isn't our lifes work from the past 3 and a half years of full time 16 hour days and I would hope that it could all pay off and pay for it's self. How exactly it will do that is yet to be seen, and it definetely won't happen from theatrical profits, but people showing up and seeing the film does help a little, and is therfore hugely appreciated.Here is the link to the short film described by you as awful, is that really the right word? Maybe others can post comments to be the judge:http://foureyedmonsters.com/shorts/fischerchicks.movThe \"can we do it again?\" question: Does it matter? Also who is to say we even plan to? Maybe our next project won't take shape in the form of a narrative film, maybe it will be something else. If you are looking to track a tradditional trojectory of a filmmaking career, your in the wrong place. We already don't fit the mold in that we've commited to creating a video podcast that now has 73 minutes of content that some say rival the quality of our actual film. So maybe we already have done it again in a different medium, and I wouldn't be suprised if we jumped into yet another medium before maybe if we feel like it, make another film. Anyway, bottom line, glad to be a part of your blog even if I don't know if I can stand behind everything I wrote above, or if I can even stand behind who I am as a person, especially the person you've described me as, but I think the reason people work on Art is that they want to \"create\" something they can stand behind, and susan and I both totally stand behind our film and our video podcast.Take it easy and good luck with your projects,Arin & Susanwww.foureyedmonsters.com

Thanks to Arin for his comment. When I go back and read my posts, I usually find things I'd like to revise. But as Arin has commented on the original version, I don't think that would be fair. I wrote what I wrote, so I have to stand by it.I basically agree with Arin that the \"lovey-dovey\" stuff (holding hands, smooching) would not quite fit in the aesthetic of this film. I did not mean to suggest that Arin and Susan themselves exist only as a commercial enterprise.Also, by using the word \"commercial,\" I certainly was not suggesting that it has become profitable.I think it's fair to say that I warmed up to Susan more so than Arin, but my friend warmed up to Arin more so than Susan. \"Chilly and sterile\" weren't the exact words we used when we de-briefed after the film, and probably they aren't the best words to have chosen in the blog post.I do agree that the video podcasts, in a way, rival the quality of the film itself. They continue the dark humor and the meta-narrative structure, and I found them addictive viewing.Again, thanks for commenting.

I visited Harry's Steak last week, having dined at the companion Harry's Cafe a couple of months ago. I went in with a steak on my mind, but the server talked me into other selections, and they were so good I just have to mention them.Canadian bacon is common at New York steakhouses, but Harry's version ($6.50), hickory smoked in-house, is served with the bone, and apple sauce on the side for dipping. I've never seen bacon served that way, but as good as it was, I was only too happy to gnaw the bone clean after polishing off the bacon.Most steakhouses have a crab cake appetizer, but here too Harry's made it special. Their version ($15.75) was served in a shallow pool of shrimp bisque-again, a unique touch that shows an extremely thoughtful hand at work in the kitchen.At another table, I heard a guy telling his companions that Harry's is now his favorite steakhouse. As he put it, \"You can go to Sparks, wait for an hour, and have a mediocre steak; or, you can come here, get seated immediately, and have an excellent one.\"Once again, the restaurant was not full. Both servers that came to my table were rather obviously \"up-selling\" me, but service was otherwise a happy experience. The steakhouse is in the former wine cellar, but it has been totally redone and is quite comfortable.Harry's Steak (97 Pearl Street at Hanover Square, Financial District)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Of the two restaurants that Stephen Starr transplanted from Philadelphia last year, Buddakan seems to have been the more successful. Morimoto, on the other hand, didn't quite live up to Starr's promise that it would be \"far more interesting than any restaurant New York has seen.\" It even achieved the rare distinction of a \"Don't bother\" rating from Andrea Strong, who hardly ever visits a restaurant she does not like.Back to Buddakan: A business associate invited me to dinner there the other night - I suggested it, he was paying, which is always a pleasurable combination. The menu on the website seems to be outdated, or maybe it's the Philadelphia menu, as the New York portion of the site is still \"Under Construction.\" After almost a year, when are they planning to finish it?I can tell you we absolutely loved Deviled Tuna Tartare ($10), Crab and Corn Fritters ($14), Crispy Taro Puff Lollipops with pork and ginger ($12), and shrimp dumplings, most of which came from the Dim Sum section of the menu. Peking duck ($44) is the most expensive entree, and at that price I missed the show of having the bird carved tableside, as the better Chinese restaurants do. The pancakes were smallish, and in the dark room they were almost indistinguishable from the paper doilies that were used to keep them from sticking together. The duck was fine, if a bit oily. A side order of Chinese Sausage Fried Rice topped with a fried egg ($12) didn't have much sausage in it.There are a lot of rooms at Buddakan. The one we were in didn't have the \"wow\" power of the rooms usually featured in photos, but it was comfortable and not overly crowded. In the style of modern \"small-plate\" restaurants, dishes are designed for sharing and brought out when ready. Our table couldn't quite accommodate all that food as the appetizers started to pile up.Service was a little bit confused. Two sets of wine glasses were deposited and removed, before a third set arrived to stay. My colleague chose the wine. They always show the bottle to you, but this is the first time I recall a dining partner saying, \"That's not what I asked for.\" And indeed it wasn't. We began the evening at the cocktail bar. There was no option to transfer the tab to our table, nor did the hostess offer to carry our drinks.Buddakan is a fun place, and there are enough hits on the menu that I'd gladly go back. But it is not the polished restaurant its owner would like to imagine.Buddakan (75 Ninth Avenue between 15th & 16th Streets, Chelsea)Food: *Service: okayAmbiance: *Overall: *

Note: Candela closed in March 2007. Evidently, mediocre food in an industrial loft-like setting was as unappealing to others as it was to us. The space re-opened in October 2007 as Irving Mill.The first clue that we were in for a mediocre meal at Candela was the blurb on the restaurant's OpenTable profile: \"New American Cuisine offered in an industrial loft like setting illuminated by candles.\" The second clue came when we arrived and saw the menu, which offers sushi rolls, pasta dishes, and everything in between. Any restaurant attempting to cover such a far-ranging territory is bound to have more misses than hits.The dark industrial candle-lit setting screams \"date place\" - and indeed, I would recommend it for that. It doesn't scream \"Sushi place,\" but a Sesame Crusted Shrimp roll ($7) turned out to be the meal's highlight. Crispy Atlantic Halibut with mushrooms, spring onions, and sweet pea puree ($24) was a competent but dull performance. My friend thought the same about Fresh Ricotta Rigatoni ($14).I was pleased to see an ample selection of wines in the $30-40 range. I've forgotten which one we settled on, but in relative terms it was a bargain. I wasn't gouged on a cocktail ($8), either.Candela (116 E. 16th Street between Park Avenue South & Irving Place, Union Square)Food: acceptableService: acceptableAmbiance: *Overall: acceptable for a low-key date place, but I won't rush back

A Tale of Two Steakhouses

For a more recent review of Craftsteak, click here. This week, I head meals at two steakhouses I've reviewed before: Wolfgang's TriBeCa and Craftsteak. Both appear to be midlly struggling restaurants, although for different reasons. Wolfgang's had lengthy opening delays. I've been in there twice now, and while the restaurant certainly doesn't seem to be failing in any sense, it certainly doesn't have the heavy crowds that the original Wolfgang's did. It appears you can walk in just about any time and get a table.Craftsteak ought to have been a sure bet, with a celebrity chef/owner (Tom Coliccio) who has been successful wherever he went and a brand name (Craft) that has always stood for quality. But the restaurant was pilloried in one review after another for the same highly peculiar reasons: Craftsteak didn't know how to cook a steak; the menu was over-wrought and wordy. How hard could it be? Manhattan is overflowing with competent steakhouses. Surely steak is the one thing a steakhouse should know how to prepare. But apparently Craftsteak did not. In two separate interviews, Coliccio admitted they had blown it, and he even arranged an amicable split with partner Danny Meyer at Gramercy Tavern so that he could focus on his Craft properties.At Wolfgang's this week, I ordered the New York Strip. At $36.50, it is one of the better steak prices in New York City. It came sizzling hot, perfectly charred on the outside, achingly tender on the inside. The steak was sliced in the traditional Peter Luger style. My server not only served the first several slices, but kept returning to my table to serve more. For quality and attention, it could not be beat. Wolfgang's is a traditional steakhouse, populated mostly by businessmen. It is not for everybody. But in its genre, Wolfgang's is doing a superb job.At Craftsteak too, it was no problem to just waltz in and ask for a table. Unlike Wolfgang's, Craftsteak has the trappings of a high-end restaurant. I actually saw two tables with only women seated. There was a tasty amuse-bouche of a cube of goat cheese on a thin wafer. At the end of my meal, a plate of petits-fours was dropped off. Wolfgang's has neither. Both restaurants have better-than-average bread service, but Craftsteak's piping-hot Parker-house rolls in a cast-iron serving dish are some of the best in the city. A side dish of Wagyu confit potatoes was excellent.Both the dinner and the dessert menu at Craftsteak are reprinted daily. (At Wolfgang's, it probably won't be reprinted until the prices go up.) The menu has changed considerably since the last time I saw it. It no longer prints the biography of every slaughtered cow it sells, although there is still a choice between grass-fed and corn-fed beef. The strip steak is now offered at three different ages (28, 42, and 56-day), rather than six. The Wagyu offerings have been simplified too. The old Craftsteak was offering far too many options.But ultimately, we must judge a place like Crafsteak for its steak. And again last night, Craftsteak stumbled. I decided to splurge for the New York Strip aged 56 days. This is apparently the house's signature item. At $52, it is the most expensive entree you can order, except for Wagyu beef and steaks for two (porterhouse or ribeye, $88). I also thought it would be a useful comparison to the strip at Wolfgang's, which is only $36.50.Early on, Craftsteak was criticized for not putting a char on the outside of its steaks. The menu still says roasted, so I explicitly asked for a medium-rare temperature with charring on the outside. \"Pittsburgh medium rare,\" my server responded. I have never heard the term \"Pittsburgh\" applied to steak, but he assured me that this meant it would be charred. If the steak was charred, you could have fooled me. There was no char on the exterior that I could detect.Inside, the steak was indeed medium rare, but it was tough and chewy. This is what 56-day aging gets you? Wolfgang's doesn't tell you how long their strip steak is aged, but for $15.50 less, the New York Strip at Wolfgang's runs circles around Craftsteak.I decided to give dessert a try. A pound cake topped with raspberries and ice cream was wonderful, as indeed was everything about Craftsteak that isn't a steak. If Tom Coliccio could only figure out how to prepare a steak, he might have a three-star restaurant. But what good is a steakhouse that can't do steak?Wolfgang's TriBeCa (409 Greenwich St. between Beach & Hubert Streets, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **Craftsteak (85 Tenth Avenue, between 15th and 16th Streets, Chelsea)Food: mediocre steak, everything else very good or excellentService: **½Ambiance: **½Overall: *

A friend of mine has been itching to try shabu shabu ever since she saw it in the film Lost in Translation. I've had it several times in my life, including twice in Japan. While I wouldn't want a steady diet of it, shabu shabu is always fun. There are only a handful of shabu shabu restaurants in New York, and as my friend lives on the Upper East Side, I decided to give Shabu Shabu 70 a try.In case you're not familiar with it, shabu shabu (Japanese for \"swish swish\") is food that you cook yourself at the table in lightly spiced boiling water. Some restaurants offer a variety of meat, seafood, and vegetable platters, but Shabu Shabu 70 offers just beef or chicken ($20.50 pp, minimum of two); we chose the beef. You start with a platter of very thinly-sliced beef and another of vegetables (noodles, onions, carrots, mushrooms, greens, and tofu). The meat is so thin that each slice cooks in a matter of 15 to 20 seconds. The vegetables take a little longer.When you decide that a piece is done, you fish it out of the boiling water with your chopsticks, dip it in one of the two sauces provided, and slurp it into your mouth (it tends to get a little messy). I don't usually like to work for food I'm paying someone else to prepare, but I make an exception for shabu shabu, which never fails as a social activity, and is also quite tasty. As my friend pointed out, the ingredients are all very lean, so it's a healthy meal too. By the time you're done, the water takes on the taste of all the food, so the grand finale is to drink it as a soup.In Japan, I've been to restaurants that do only shabu shabu, where the cooking apparatus is built right into the table. At Shabu Shabu 70, despite the name, they serve a wide variety of Japanese food, so the cooking apparatus is carried over to your table. We started with a couple of excellent sushi rolls ($4.50-7.50).Service was friendly and helpful. The server could tell that we don't do this every day, and came over several times to check up on us. I was also pleased that my bar tab was transferred over to the table, something far too many restaurants refused to do.The decor is fairly plain, but for $20.50 apiece we got an enormous amount of food. Indeed, one reviewer suggested that four people could share a portion for two. With appetizers and dessert, that just might be the case. The lack of a seafood shabu shabu option was a bit perplexing, but the one option offered was plenty enjoyable.Shabu Shabu 70 (314 E. 70th St. between First & Second Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: okay, but undistinguishedOverall: *

Frank Bruni has taken a lot of heat for his procession of two-star neighborhood restaurants, but I have to admit that his review of The Orchard caught my eye. After a succession of high-end meals, my friend and I were in the mood for something a bit more casual, so last weekend we decided to check out The Orchard.The Lower East Side has become a dining and bar-hopping destination. Five or ten years ago, the idea of any respectable nightlife in the neighborhood seemed absurd. Now, the local community board has decided that perhaps it was too much of a good thing, and new establishments have been struggling to get liquor licenses approved. With carousers hanging out on the local sidewalks, you can see why they are concerned.There was no reason for The Orchard, a refined restaurant by LES standards, to be caught up in this political battle, but it was. At the time of the Bruni review, it didn't yet have a liquor license. As of last weekend it still didn't, although Florence Fabricant has reported in the Times that The Orchard will start serving drinks in September, nine months after it opened.The night we visited, most diners seemed to be well aware that Orchard was BYOB, and the restaurant was doing a brisk business in spite of it. If anything, it was a bit of fun to pick up a bottle of chianti for $35 that the restaurant would have sold for twice that much. The restaurant, of course, is losing losing the income that comes from a liquor menu, but all that will change in September.The food is Italian-inspired, but as Bruni noted, it nods at other cuisines as well. The menu is in three parts. Flatbreads ($11-13) are like rectangular pizzas with crisp, paper-thin dough. The toppings, however, are distinctly un-pizza-like. A steak tartare flatbread is seasoned with creamy dijon potatoes, wild arugula, and shaved parmesan. Another was topped with humas and Middle Eastern spices. Each one comes pre-sliced into six rectangular pieces, and is perfect for sharing.Since we had two of the flatbreads, we skipped the appetizers ($11-18) and went straight to the main courses ($21-32). There's a variety of fish and meat dishes, but it so happened we both chose pasta: the smoked salmon ravioli ($24) for me, the cavatelli with crispy panceta, diced avocado, and fresh herbs in a tomato-cream sauce ($27) for my friend. Both were fresh, creative, and flavorful. A home-made bread service with creamy-soft butter was also memorable.The decor is delightful for the neighborhood, with blonde woods and subtle recessed lighting sconces. Rows of bottled water are displayed on the shelves, which presumably will be replaced with wine as soon as they are able.We were mightily pleased with The Orchard, and obviously so are a lot of other people. Our server unceremoniously dropped off the check before we asked for it (though we were about ready to leave anyway). Other service issues need to be resolved, too. As of now, the restaurant has coffee, but not espresso or capuccino, an extremely odd omission for an Italian restaurant of this calibre.On the whole, though, The Orchard is doing a superb job at its price point. I would happily go back.The Orchard (162 Orchard St. between Rivington & Stanton Streets, Lower East Side)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

Note: This is a review of Cafe Boulud under Chef Bertrand Chemel, who has since left the restaurant. His replacement is Gaven Kaysen.A friend has just celebrated her 45th birthday. For the occasion, I decided to take her to Cafe Boulud, the three-star sibling of Daniel Boulud's four-star flagship, Daniel. I've heard great things about Cafe Boulud over the years, but Andrew Carmellini, the chef de cuisine to whom it owes its reputation, jumped ship recently to open A Voce, leaving the kitchen in the hands of Bertrand Chemel.We weren't blown away. One can never go too far wrong with seared foie gras ($26), but there was nothing distinguished about the preparation. Peking Duck ($36) was likewise competent, and an ample portion, but wasn't special. My friend had a similar reaction to sweetbreads ($19) and hangar steak ($34). Her cheese course ($21) was one of the comparative bargains.One server offered a special dessert, but moments later another server told us it was unavailable. The strawberry grati ($13) was just fine, although quickly forgotten.On the plus side, I was impressed to see that the wine list had a full page of white wine selections under $60, and another full page with reds under $60. I've been to plenty of restaurants less ambitious than Cafe Boulud where the choices under $60 were few and far between.With so much more to choose from on the menu, I hesitate to say that Cafe Boulud is coasting, but both of us found the cooking uninspired, given the price point.Cafe Boulud (20 E. 76th St. between Fifth & Madison Avenues, Upper East Side)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: ***Overall: **

Crispo is an easily overlooked Italian trattoria on 14th Street, on the border between Chelsea and the West Village. The chef, Frank Crispo, worked at La Côte Basque, among other places. There is an attractive outdoor dining space, a handsome bar, and plenty of indoor seating. The restaurant has received its fair share of good press since it opened in 2002, although the Times has never formally reviewed it. For a restaurant of its kind, prices are quite reasonable. Appetizers, salads and antipasti are $6.50-15.00, pastas are $17.50-19.00, mains are $17.50-25.00. I ordered the pork shank \"fra diavolo,\" a most impressive production. It was an enormous hunk of flesh, braised to a point of tenderness where the knife was almost unnecessary. I was there with three friends, and frankly we were so engrossed in conversation that I forgot to ask how everyone liked their food. But if the rest of the menu is as good as the pork shank \"fra diavolo,\" Crispo is doing very well indeed.

A friend of mine gets a peculiar Benihana craving about once a year or so - \"peculiar,\" because she can't stand the \"Benihana smell,\" which so thoroughly impregnates her clothes that even laundering doesn't entirely remove it. But she enjoys the theater of hibachi cooks preparing dinner before your eyes, even though the act is entirely predictable.So at her suggestion we visited Benihana earlier this week. To an extent, the theatricality of it is still fun, even though we all know what's coming. Our chef did all of the usual tricks, like making a volcano out of a sliced onion, performing acrobatic catches with shrimp tails hurled in the air, and spinning his knives as if he were a samauri.The food wasn't particularly impressive. Perhaps the best item was fried rice prepared tableside. Grilled shrimp were also enjoyable, but steak was rather dry and flavorless. A salad tasted like it was mass-produced, and left sitting in the fridge for a while. A frazzled server took a while to deliver our drink orders, and throughout the meal we had the slight sensation of being rushed. At Benihana, all parties are seated at tables of eight. If a couple of people are left lingering, the whole table is unavailable, so they want you out of there on a pre-programmed schedule. It was not particularly busy on a Monday night, but the requirement of seating people in batches of eight must be a constant constraint for them.For the amount of food, prices are reasonable, with most entrees in the $20-30 range, which includes soup, salad and dessert. A gin and tonic, which came with a liberal amount of gin, was only $5.50. As my friend noted, Benihana is surely the place to come and get plastered, as most Manhattan restaurants nowadays charge over $10 for a mixed drink (and $15 is certainly not unheard of). If you double-up on the G&T's, perhaps you'll overlook the fact that the food is just mediocre. The faux-Japanese decor gets you in the mood. While you're waiting to be seated, see how many celebrities you can identify in the photos posted in the vestibule.Benihana (47 W 56th Street between Fifth and Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: Comme-ci, comme-çaService: Ah, so-soAmbiance: Almost like JapanOverall: Okay

***CONTENT
In last week's New York Post, Steve Cuozzo surveyed the scene on Tenth Avenue between 15th and 16th Streets, where three restaurants have opened to great fanfare in the last year - Del Posto, Morimoto, and Craftsteak - but all have had their troubles.Craftsteak has been pummeled by the critics, after the peculiar decision to roast steaks instead of grilling or broiling them, as most diners prefer. Cuozzo reported that Craftsteak is \"awaiting delivery of a broiler.\" How anyone could open a steakhouse without a broiler utterly eludes me, especially when the owner is a savvy restauranteur like Tom Colliccio. About Morimoto I don't have much to say, but it too has been mostly lambasted by the critics.Reviews of Del Posto have been mixed. Frank Bruni awarded three stars - not the four that Mario Batali and his partners were hoping for, but better than it could have been. New York, as I recall, awarded only two, and that was on a five-star scale. Del Posto isn't exactly hurting for business, but Cuozzo reported that a lower-priced Sunday menu has been quietly introduced. My friend and I had no trouble scoring a 6:15 p.m. table just a couple of days in advance.Prices at Del Posto are all over the map. Some of the more ridiculously expensive items are now gone. The whole veal shank for $240 is no longer on offer, but risottos are $50-60 for two, which is ridiculous. All of the other pastas and main courses are far more reasonable. A special Sunday-only four-course menu is $49, while the chef's tasting menu is $120 for ten courses.Although it was the lure of Sunday bargains that brought us there, we chose the tasting menu. We were most impressed to find that a wine pairing was available for just $30. Many restaurants in Del Posto's class would charge double that. To be sure, we got five small pours of relatively recent vintage, but the wines all worked well with the food, and at the price it was a bargain.After an amuse-bouche of fried zucchini, our menu was as follows:SALUMI MISTI with Erbazzone and FigsGrilled SUMMER VEGETABLES with Ricotta di BuffalaTocai Friulano, Bastianich 2004 FriuliThe house-cured salumi were one of the highlights of the meal, extremely fresh and tangy.INSALATA di MARE with ProsciuttoPERCH with Truffled Green Bean SaladFalanghina, Feudi di San Gregorio 2004 CampaniaI found the seafood salad dull and rubbery, but the Perch was perfectly prepared.GARGANELLI VERDI al Ragu BologneseRISOTTO with Funghi MistiMorellino di Scansano \"I Perazzi,\" La Mozza 2004 ToscanaThe pasta was just fine, although as my friend remarked, it was nothing she couldn't have prepared at home. While eating the mushroom risotto, I couldn't help but think, \"This is what they charge $50 for.\" It was a competent risotto, but fifty dollars? Give me a break.Grilled RIB-EYE \"Tagliata\"6-year PARMIGIANO-REGGIANOVespa Rosso, Bastianich 2002 FriuliI've had bad luck with beef on tasting menus, which often seems a pale imitation of what the better steakhouses serve. But Del Posto's rib-eye was first-class: wonderfully tender, and with a crisp char on the outside. The cheese course was again a bit of a dud. It's wonderful to know that the parmigiano has been aged six years, but I found it overly sharp to the taste, and the accompaniments weren't much help.MELON SORBETTOCROSTATA di CioccolatoMoscato d'Asti \"Sourgal,\" Elio Perrone 2005 PiemonteI enjoyed the melon sorbet. I must admit I've forgotten what the final course was like, but at this point I was so full that I felt they'd have to wheel me out of there. A generous plate of petits-fours went untouched.The room at Del Posto is gorgeous. The tables are amply spaced. Service was friendly, but there were some glitches. After I used my fork to eat the amuse bouche, a server replaced it at my side, instead of bringing a clean one. It's a minor point, but no four-star restaurant would do that. Later on, there was a speck of dust floating in my wine (they replaced it without complaint). Another table ordered the grilled whole fish. We watched the staff struggle to fillet it for what looked like 20 minutes. By now, Del Posto ought to have the staff who know how to fillet in their sleep.For a couple of courses, the server's description was mumbled to the point of being incomprehensible. Luckily we had a postcard-sized cheat sheet to look at (and which I brought home with me). Still, I had no idea that what looked like apricot slices that came with the parmigiano was in fact horseradish.We enjoyed our meal at Del Posto - make no mistake about that. But both service and consistency have a ways to go if the restaurant aspires to four stars.Del Posto (85 Tenth Avenue at 16th Street, Chelsea)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: ***½Overall: **½

Wolfgang's TriBeCa

I've been to Wolfgang's Steakhouse in Murray Hill several times. It's like Peter Luger in Manhattan, except that they take credit cards, the menu has more variety, and the serving staff are a whole lot friendlier. Steakhouses are my great weakness, so I was delighted when a branch of Wolfgang's was announced for a building literally across the street from my office. Construction was plagued with delays (I don't know why), and it finally opened only a few weeks ago.As an aside, Wolfgang's TriBeCa was supposedly the first construction permit granted in New York City that fell under a new law that any public accommodation must have twice as many women's bathroom stalls as there are men's stalls. It's a little ironic that Wolfgang's would be the first, given the male-dominated clientele of most steakhouses.The new space is considerably larger than the Murray Hill flagship. There are actually some soft surfaces in the room, so you don't feel like you're in an echo chamber, as you do uptown. The menu is identical in both restaurants. Prices are a bargain by steakhouse standards, with most steaks for one priced at $36.50, and the Canadian Bacon appetizer still priced at the ludicrously-low $2.75.My friend had never had the Luger-style Canadian Bacon, so I persuaded her to give it a try. When you see the price of $2.75, you figure it has to be a microscopic portion. But I've learned from experience that one slice is all anyone can eat. And on this occasion, the bacon slices were even larger than I remembered them. They may be 85% fat, but boy are they good.My friend does not care for porterhouse (Wolfgang's specialty), so we both ordered the ribeye. The marbling was a bit less even than some of the better ribeyes I've had lately, but the meat was wonderfully tender. The aging program at Wolfgang's is obviously working to perfection. A creamed spinach side dish was perfectly prepared, and I was happy to see a good bread service, with some delicious onion rolls.The wine list is a little on the expensive side, but we were able to find an fine cabernet at around $50. Service was friendly-even Wolfgang himself came over to check on our table. It was a Friday night, and the restaurant was doing a decent business, but was not full. Those who were there seemed to be mostly couples from the neighborhood. But there was a boistrous table for 12-14 men in ties, most likely investment bankers. On most weeknights, I suspect this will be Wolfgang's core clientele.Wolfgang's TriBeCa (409 Greenwich Street between Hubert & Beach Streets, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

***CONTENT
Note: Dona closed in early 2007, after Arpaia lost her lease. (Well, technically she was bought out, but the landlord created a situation where there was no real option to stay.) A more casual version of the concept, Mia Dona, opened six blocks north in February 2008.Dona is the latest restaurant creation of impresaria Donatella Arpaia, who also brought us David Burke & Donatella (DB&D) on the upper East Side and Ama in SoHo. All three opened in about a two-year span, so you can conclude that Arpaia doesn't linger over her creations (indeed, she has already exited her partnership in Ama).DB&D is one of the hottest restaurant openings of the last several years, and as far as I can tell, it's still a tough table to get. Dona is just getting started. Arpaia's partner is chef Michael Psilakis. The website is just a stub right now, showing a photo of Arpaia and Psilakis, with \"Modern European Cuisine\" in big letters.I took a friend to Dona a couple of weeks ago. The space is attractively decorated, and the sound is nowhere near as deafening as at DB&D. Actually, I'm happy to say that we could hear ourselves talk without much trouble at all. There was a pleasant buzz, but it wasn't packed. On the other hand, Dona isn't a breakaway hit, like DB&D. The day of my reservation, I had to change the time from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. \"We can do that,\" said the reservationist. In contrast, last time I went to DB&D, we were sternly told that we had to keep our original time, and if we were more than 20 minutes late, we'd lose our table.The menu has separate sections for cold appetizers ($12-16), hot appetizers ($13-15), pasta ($18-24), fish ($26-32) and meat ($24-45). For $75, you can choose two appetizers, a pasta, and a fish or meat course, and we went that route. It's been about 10 days now, but I believe I had the Tartare (two contrasting raw fish bites), Spiced Almond Crusted Prawns (two hefty ones), Gnuci (sheep's milk ricotta dumplings), and the pork chop.My recollection is that it was all solidly done, but I was not wowed. The enormous pork chop came slathered in a heavy tomato-based ragout. It struck me that this was: A) far too much food after three earlier courses; and B) far too heavy for a summer menu. It didn't go to waste, though, as my friend took home a doggie bag.Service was friendly, and we were quite pleased both with a sparkling rose that we ordered before dinner and a sauterne that we ordered afterwards.Dona (208 E. 52nd St. between Second & Third Avenues, Turtle Bay)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

***CONTENT
The new restaurant Knife + Fork (spelled thus) has attracted a lot of attention lately. Andrea Strong gave it a great review in late July, and it was the recipient of a somewhat longer-than-usual blog post by Frank Bruni a few days later.Knife + Fork turns out food of unusual ambition for its neighborhood. It's a small space in the East Village, owned and operated by chef Damien Brassel and his wife. The six-course tasting menu for just $45 puts the shame to other restaurants' offerings at double the price. Although Bruni complained about the over-use of truffle oil (something we did not notice) he added, \"I'm hard pressed to think of another restaurant in New York that packs as much ambition into a price that restrained.\" He clearly liked the place, as he mentioned having paid several visits. I suspect he's going to give Knife + Fork time to shake out the kinks before considering a formal review in the newspaper.We weren't in a tasting-menu mood, but our selections from the à la carte menu convinced us that Brassel is doing great things. The amuse was a shot of clear, hot tomato soup. Seared foie gras sent me into orbit, and it was about double the portion size that many restaurants serve. My friend had a warm goat cheese and polenta appetizer that she pronounced amazing. I found a Mahi Mahi entree a bit stringy, although I enjoyed the crisp skin. I'm not sure whether it was entirely the chef's fault. I would have preferred a regular knife to cut it with; fish knives are always a burden, except with the most pliant flesh. My friend found lamb loin almost revelatory. Platings were all attractive and creative.With starters all $15 or less, and mains $25 or less, Knife + Fork delivers an outstanding value. Because it is near a school, there is no hard liquor license, but they do serve wine. Actually, the establishment bills itself as a \"restaurant and wine bar.\" The list is very reasonably priced, with about a dozen choices by the glass.Brassel and his wife are practically a two-man band. Brassel does all the cooking. His wife and one waitress do all the serving. Another hand in the kitchen washes dishes and does light prep work. I didn't do an exact count, but it looks to me like the restaurant can seat about 30-35 people. When it starts to fill up-as it's doing more and more, as the word gets out-Brassel has trouble keeping up. We were there at a slow time, but we can well imagine what happens on Saturday nights. His wife mentioned that he's considering adding another hand in the kitchen, although one look at the space tells you that it will need to be someone who's used to working in close quarters.I'll look forward to giving Knife + Fork another try.Knife + Fork (108 E. 4th St. between First & Second Avenues, East Village)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

I've just returned from a week in London. On past trips, I've spent my London evenings at the theatre. This trip, I wanted to focus on restaurants. I arrived on a Wednesday, but had no specific reservations until Friday.On Thursday, I was a bit under-the-weather and didn't want to travel far. Mosaique was located about a ten-minute walk from my hotel. On a stiflingly hot evening, its open-air façade and faintly Mediterranean decor seemed appropriate.I loved deep-fried brie (£3.50), two pie-shaped slices with a charred-brown exterior from the deep fryer, and with a lingonberry sauce. Monkfish (£9.25) was tender and came with a vegetable medley. Add a half-bottle of Sauvignon Blanc (£9.50), and I was out of there for £22.25, making this probably the best dining bargain of the trip. There were two servers, who kept things running efficiently.The restaurant is not really near any important destinations, so which might explain why only a handful of tables were taken. It's a reasonably walk from King's Cross, Russell Square, Farringdon, and Holborn, without really being convenient to any of them.

A colleague recommended Le Pont de la Tour for its superb views of Tower Bridge (for which it's named) and the Tower of London, from a perch along the boardwalk on the south bank of the Thames. There are numerous outdoor tables. None of these were available, but I was given an excellent window table facing the Tower, and as the windows were wide open, it amounted to the same thing. The decor is refined and elegant. I was overheated from an unexpectedly long walk, and started with a Pimms cocktail (£5.95) to cool off.The menu is squarely in the French tradition. My colleague particularly recommended the chateaubriand, advice that several reviews on the web confirmed, but this signature dish is available only for two. I asked the server for an alternative recommendation. He must love the menu, for he went on to describe pretty much all of it, but his knowledge of the cuisine was impeccable-at least for the two dishes I tried. All of the options placed Le Pont de la Tour squarely in the French tradition.I started with the morteaux sausage (£9.50), which came sliced, and with a honey mustard sauce. Sea trout, at £18.00, was the least expensive of the main courses. I wasn't particularly looking to economize, but the server said the poached sea trout was ideal if one didn't want to eat anything \"heavy,\" which was indeed the case on a sweltering evening. I'm usually not keen on filet fish prepared that simply, but this dish showed there are an exceptions to every rule when the flesh is as tender and the preparation as perfect as this one was.The sommelier recommended a wonderful half-bottle of Chablis. I'm most definitely not a Chablis guy-it always seems to be the dullest of the white grapes, the way Merlot so often is among the reds. But this one, at £19.25, was wonderful, showing that even Chablis can rise above the commonplace.When I arrived shortly after 8:00 p.m., most of the inside tables weren't yet occupied, but by the time I'd finished my appetizer and main course-around 9:00 p.m.-the restaurant was nearly full. Service had been superb up to that point, but things slowed down considerably. It would take another 50 minutes for me to order and receive an order of French Coffee (£6.75), and to settle my bill. It was nice to know that they weren't hurrying to unseat me from my table with a prime view, but that coffee took an awfully long time to prepare.All-in, dinner came to £59.45 before tip.Le Pont de al Tour (Butlers Wharf, 36d Shad Thames, London SE1 2YE)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

***CONTENT
Despite my keen interest in Gilbert and Sullivan, I've never dined at the Savoy Hotel (though I had high tea there once, many years ago). I had wanted to dine at three-star Gordon Ramsay, but that restaurant is closed this summer for refurbishing. I chose the Savoy Grill instead, which turned out to be another restaurant in Ramsay's large empire, though I didn't realize this when I booked.The Savoy Grill is more formal than its name would suggest, with fussy French-style service and tuxedo-clad waiters reminding me a bit of Alain Ducasse in New York. It is a much larger restaurant than Ducasse, and only one star, rather than three, so they are not quite as attentive, but many of the ideas are similar. The previous evening, I had a lovely window seat facing the Tower of London. At the Savoy Grill, I was seated next to a large column with a view of the hotel driveway.After I sat down, a server wheeled over a cart with several champagnes, from which I was invited to choose. In this type of restaurant, I'm always wary of getting stuck with something that costs $20 a sip, so I asked him for a printed list. He was apparently confused about this, and asked if I'd like bottled water. I said that tap water would be fine. With barely concealed disgust, he slid my water glass to the edge of the table (apparently a signal to his colleagues that this chump doesn't want the bottled variety) and moved on.When a server arrived, I explained that I did want champagne. He apologized and sent the champagne guy back over. He remained quite irritated that I wanted to see a list of the choices, but he managed to point out where they were on the wine list, and I chose one. For all that trouble, it was worth it-a glass of sparkling rose that was surprisingly sweet and smooth.The regular menu is a £55 prix fixe, but on weekends there is a £30 alternative, which they call the \"grill menu,\" with six appetizers and six main courses to choose from. Several of these looked compelling, so I decided to save myself £25. Smoked salmon (£4 supplement) was unimpressive. It came without sauces or any other accompaniments, and the taste was no better than average. Particularly for a dish that carries a supplement, I expected a better performance.Wiltshire pork belly was a tour de force. (After I ordered it, the server mentioned that it was a particular favorite of his.) It was cut in a long strip, in the shape of two thick cigars placed end-to-end. It was tender, fatty, and flavorful. As the server had proved he and I had similar tastes, I accepted his recommendation of the white chocolate cake for dessert, and this was most enjoyable.There was, again, a reasonable selection of half-bottles available. Remembering my happy experience with Chablis at Le Pont de la Tour, I chose Chablis again (£25), but this was a more pedestrian bottle that reminded me why I don't usually order Chablis.After the champagne fiasco, the server went out of his way to ensure I was taken care of. If anything, the service was a bit too rushed, and I was out of there in about an hour. When I'm paying this kind of money, I'd prefer that the meal unwind a bit more slowly. However, to their credit the champagne was comped. (At least, I think it was-nothing was said, but it wasn't on the bill). In total, dinner came to £59 before tip.When I told the server that I'm from New York, he introduced me to the house manager, who will be transferring to New York later this year to manage Gordon Ramsay's first American restaurant, which will be gunning for three Michelin and four New York Times stars. We had a pleasant chat and exchanged business cards. Obviously my Savoy Grill experience is not indicative of Ramsay's three-star cuisine, but I'd advise him to focus hard on the kind of service glitches that the Times's current reviewer tends to penalize.One wonders how much time Ramsay will be able to spend in New York. The house manager said that Ramsay will be there for \"the first few months,\" and then occasionally thereafter. Ramsay has something like nine restaurants in London alone. Coincidentally, during my stay I saw him on a TV show called \"The f word,\" which features Ramsay swearing at everybody in sight. In the show's main vignette, four amateur cooks do a service in the kitchen with Ramsay, in which he hurls expletives at them on the slightest provcation. The guests don't seem to mind, as they all seem to know about Ramsey's famous temper. Being told to shut the fuck up is obviously part of the game.The Savoy Grill (Savoy Hotel, Strand, London, WC2R 0EU)Food: **½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: **

The Waterside Inn

There are three Michelin three-star restaurants in the United Kingdom. One would certainly have to question the inspectors' objectivity, when an entire country has fewer restaurants with the top rating than Michelin awarded in New York City alone.In an odd quirk of fate, two of the UK's three-star restaurants are within 100 yards of each other, in the unlikely town of Bray, about 45 minutes west of London by train. I tried to get into The Fat Duck, but I hadn't realized how hard it is to get in, and I didn't book early enough. The Waterside Inn, which has been around a lot longer, was able to accommodate me on a Sunday evening. The restaurant opened in 1972. It earned its first Michelin star in 1974, its second in 1977, and its third in 1985. The original chef, Michel Roux, is semi-retired. His son Alain now runs the kitchen.Michelin's definition of three stars is \"worth a special journey.\" The proprietors of The Waterside Inn took that to heart. Their hotel exists, it seems, solely for patrons who want to dine at the restaurant. As the house manager put it to me, \"we have 11 rooms and 11 tables for two.\" The dining room faces a quiet part of the Thames, well upstream of London. There are no buildings on the opposite bank to disturb the view. Ducks paddle by, and there is the occasional pleasure boat. Green moss floats on the water near the shore. This was a gorgeous evening-not too hot, as it had been for much of the week, and with a mild breeze. The dining room's picture windows were wide open, and every table had a slice of the gorgeous view. It was one of the most romantic dining spots I've seen.I began the evening, as many guests do, with a drink on the terrace. The staff brought out a plate of canapes (the beef tartare being my favorite), a glass of champagne, and a menu, and I lingered a while. My order was taken while I was still on the terrace. When I finally took my table, it was already laid with the flatware and glassware that went with what I'd ordered.You can order a la carte, with appetizers in the £20-38 range, main courses generally £35-53, and desserts about £20-25. When you bear in mind that the exchange rate is almost $2 to the pound, you get the idea that you're in for an expensive evening. I chose the \"menu exceptionelle,\" which offered three savory courses and dessert.I wasn't expecting an amuse bouche after snacking on the wonderful canapes on the terrace, so a vegetable terrine to start was a happy surprise. I have to wonder, though, at the wisdom of that particular choice when another terrine, foie gras and chicken, was one of the appetizer options. The latter was just fine, although not as creamy as some of the better foie gras terrines I've had elsewhere.The fish course was a scallop, perfectly sweet and just slightly seared on the outside. The other choice for the fish course was lobster, and a glance at other tables showed it was a more elaborate production. I wasn't unhappy with the scallop, but I had a bit of regret about not choosing the fancier lobster.The palate cleanser was a rose petal sorbet, which seemed to be a strawberry sorbet with a small rose petal elegantly garnishing the top of it. Then came the evening's only dud, a duck breast with classic orange sauce, potatoes and peas. The duck, although an ample portion, was slightly tough and over-cooked. I suspect the duck breast had been cooked too a bit too, and it dried out on the stove. I finished it, mind you (at those prices who wouldn't?), but it was not up to the level of everything else.An excellent cheese course, carved tableside, was partial redemption. And because I complained about the duck, the restaurant comped an extra dessert, a heavenly strawberry souffle.Service throughout the evening was impeccable, yet never haughty. The staff seemed to be mind readers; you would merely think about something, and in a matter of moments someone would appear. The one cheesy moment came early on, when a server appeared with an already-open bottle of Evian poised for pouring, and asked if I would like some water. Human nature is to say 'yes', at which point one will have purchased the bottle. I resisted that temptation and asked for tap water. The server replied, without any hint of irony, \"Perfect!!\" I dwell on the incident only because it was the cleverest ruse I've seen yet to steer diners towards bottled water.I drank a little more liquor than I usually do-a pre-dinner glass of champagne (£15.50), a half-bottle of white wine (£26.50), and a glass of dessert wine (£10.50). None of it came cheap, but it was all excellent. The wine was decanted for me in advance, as naturally it should be at a restaurant of this quality. I was once again pleased to see-as I had at all the other restaurants I tried-a reasonable selection of half-bottles.The Waterside Inn serves mostly classic dishes. There's no foam or culinary fusion here; no molecular gastronomy. But it nevertheless serves up a special kind of magic. The duck gaffe was significant, but I would like to assume it was atypical. I would still put The Waterside Inn on my list of places to return to.All told, the final bill came to £142 before gratuity.The Waterside Inn (Ferry Road, Bray, Berkshire, SL6 2AT)Food: ***½Service: ****Ambiance: ****Overall: ***½

Hakkasan resembles the \"big-box\" Asian restaurants that have taken over Manhattan (Buddakan, Megu, Matsuri, Ono). It's located in a quiet back street that is practically guaranteed not to attract walk-in foot traffic. A friendly goomba asks for your name at the door. If you're not already on his list, you're not getting in. Then, it's down three flights of stairs to a dimly-lit subterranean lair, with a modern Asian decor, although most of the staff seem to be Westerners. Just about every seat in the large space is taken.With all of those gimmicks, you'd expect the food to be almost secondary, but Hakkasan has a Michelin star, and they seem to have earned it. A dim sum platter (£10.00) came with eight pieces. I have to admit that I didn't recognize what was in them, but they were fluffy, tender, and delicious. Stir-fried Mongolian venison (£18.50) may have been a tad over-priced, but the spicy preparation was expertly judged, and lacked the generically over-salty taste to which stir-fry sometimes succumbs. Egg fried rice (£3.50) was also excellent A colleague recommended the signature cocktails, which came with names like The Hakka, Green Destiny, and the Lychee Martini (all £8.50). I was feeling pretty happy after three of those.The clamor for tables at Hakkasan is obviously intense. When I called for a 7:30 p.m. reservation on a Tuesday evening, the hostess replied, \"The table is booked for 7:30 to 9:30 p.m.\" I know that some people resent being told in advance when they have to leave, but I am more than capable of finishing my dinner in two hours, and at this type of restaurant I don't really mind the restriction.Big-box Asian restaurants are getting a bad name in New York. There are so many of them now, with the menu often designed practically by rote. At Hakkasan, they really seem to care about the food.The bill came to £57.50 before tip.Hakkasan (8 Hanway Place near Tottenham Court Road, London, W1P 9DH)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

On a recent celebratory occasion, my friend and I chose Chanterelle. Though I've dined there a couple of times in the past, I'd forgotten the magic of this restaurant's quiet, refined atmosphere. With its widely spaced tables, its luminous chiffon shades, and high chandeliers, Chanterelle offers an elegant escape. On a Sunday evening, it was never more than half full. It was delightful to note that we could speak barely above a whisper, and have no trouble hearing each other. Chanterelle offers a three-course prix fixe at $95 or a tasting menu (which we had) at $125. Both are written in an extravagant longhand on one of the famous artistic menus, which change about monthly. Although Chanterelle may seem old-fashioned, it is one of the few restaurants at its level that keeps its website up-to-date with the latest menu, which was as follows: Green Gazpacho with Chesapeake Bay Crabmeat & Black Caviar Foie Gras Saute with Pickled Farm Peaches & Baby Lettuce Sauteed Speckled Sea Trout with Sorrel, Tomato, Mussel Broth Niman Ranch Beef filet with Sweet Onions and Cracked black Peppers Cheese Course Vermont Goat Cheese and Purple basil Souffle with Tuscan Melon Sorbet Petits Fours, Coffee/Tea We started with a double amuse bouche, a warm gougère and an oyster on a spoon. The gazpacho was (to borrow the cliche) so thick you could almost eat it with a fork. The foie gras was heavenly, and I loved the crisp sea trout. The beef filet was the only dud; it tasted like pot roast, except that pot roast would probably be better. The cheese course made up for it. A server brought a cheese tray to the table and patiently explained more than a dozen choices, of which I had five-all superb. A cheese course never looks like much food, but by the time you're finished you feel stuffed. (On the prix fixe menu, the cheese course is a $25 add-on, which makes the tasting menu look like an even better deal.) The selection of petits-fours after dessert was awesome, but I counted something like 15 bite-sized pieces, which is way beyond what two humans can consume at the end of a long tasting menu. I've been to only two other restaurants in the city (Per Se and Alain Ducasse) that make a point of presenting two contrasting butters, with the server explaining the characteristics of each. I particularly liked the unsalted butter, which I believe came from Vermont (the other was from France). Bread rolls were served warm, but I would have liked a choice of breads, to go along with the choice of butters. Chanterelle's renowned wine list is a tome that looks like a telephone directory. I believe $55 was the least expensive bottle that I noted, and most were well over $80. I settled on a $95 bordeaux, which was near the bottom of the list, but was nevertheless superb. The staff decanted it without prompting, a service few restaurants offer any more. The restaurant takes a team approach to service. I had noticed this the last time I was here and wondered if it was an anomaly, but they did it again. Every server seems to perform every function, and no particular server seems to be assigned specifically to your table. On my last visit, this arrangement led to some minor glitches (e.g., being asked twice whether we wanted bottled or tap water), but this time it was seamless. Service, indeed, is first-class, but without the stuffiness of some high-end places. There is the occasional mistake (a roll dropped on the floor; a spoon forgotten), but it hardly detracts from a delightful evening. Unlike the tasting menu at Bouley, which I had just a couple of weeks ago, this performance was leisurely (taking nearly three hours), and never seemed hurried. The preparations are generally first-rate, but platings are classic, without the wild swishes of colored sauces and the widely varying plate shapes at Bouley. If the overall performance is a step shy of extraordinary, Chanterelle is nevertheless one of New York's restaurant treasures.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Harry's Steak.When I started working on Wall Street in 1989, Harry's at Hanover Square was the quintessential \"good ol' boys\" restaurant. Located at One Hanover Square in the landmarked India House, in the heart of the Financial District, it catered primarily to brokers and investment bankers. A big horseshoe-shaped bar dominated the space. It wasn't known for its food.Harry Poulakakos retired a few years ago. The space was carved up; two restaurants on Stone Street now occupy space that was formerly part of Harry's. The main restaurant was closed for approximately 2½ years. Harry's son gutted the place, and it has now re-opened as two separate but connected restaurants: Harry's Cafe and Harry's Steak. (Papa Harry is still associated with the place, as an advisor.)The two technically have separate entrances: Harry's Cafe at 1 Hanover Square, Harry's Steak at the adjacent 97 Pearl Street. They are listed separately on Zagat and Menupages. But they have a common website, and apparently a common kitchen. The steak restaurant, which is smaller, is located in the former wine cellar of Harry's at Hanover Square.The steakhouse menu has pretty much the standard items and price structure that you would expect in Manhattan. The cafe menu has some of the steakhouse appetizers, but only one actual entree in common (the Dry Aged New York Strip on the bone, $41). The cafe's entrees are more eclectic, with everything from lemon sole ($22) to \"the original crackling pork shank\" ($25), whatever that may be.I was actually looking for the steakhouse, but wandered into the cafe instead. The staff advised that the cafe doesn't normally offer the full steak menu, except on weekends, when the cafe is open but the steakhouse is not. But they let me order from the steak menu anyway. I chose the bone-in rib steak ($38.50). This was an enormous hunk of beef, possibly two inches thick before cooking. It was perfectly marbled and aged, and comparable to the two best ribeyes I've had in New York, at Strip House and Nebraska Beef.At the cafe (but not the steakhouse), steaks come with fries and creamed spinach without any extra charge. There was no way I could finish all that food, but I noted that the spinach was excellent. The helping of fries was enormous and could easily have served several people. The bread service was above average.Service was friendly and efficient. There was a bit of a delay in getting my steak out of the kitchen, and although I did not complain about it at all, they comped a glass of wine anyway. The decor is still in the burnished mahogany of the old Harry's, but the space seems a bit more open and inviting.The restaurant wasn't full, but they have only opened recently, and are still building word-of-mouth. The clientele seemed to be a mix, rather than the pure Wall Street types you used to see in Harry's at Hanover Square. The fact that the cafe is now open seven days a week speaks volumes to how the financial district has changed. Back in 1989, you could roll a bowling ball down Broad Street on a Saturday without striking anyone. It's now a family neighborhood, with residential conversions on just about every block.Harry's Cafe (1 Hanover Square) and Harry's Steak (97 Pearl Street), Financial DistrictFood: *½Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: *½It's hard to judge by just one visit, but based on what I saw yesterday, Harry's is doing an impressive job.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Bouley.I've been dining out periodically with some consultant friends from Boston. Last week was their final week in New York, at least for a while (their contract having ended), so we decided to go for a \"blow out\" meal somewhere special: Bouley.Bouley is one of New York's iconic high-end restaurants, helmed by celebrity chef David Bouley, who also runs Danube and Upstairs, both of which are just steps away. The restaurant is located in a stately TriBeCa building that announces its importance with understated elegance. Inside are two lovely rooms dubbed the \"red room\" and the \"white room.\" The entrance lobby is lined with fresh apples. The intense aroma transports you into Bouley's world.Unusually for a restaurant at its level, Bouley hasn't succumbed to the prix fixe trend. The menu is pricey, but still à la carte. Appetizers are $16-29. Entrees are $38-45. The tasting menu ($90) is also unusual, with several choices offered for most of the courses. It is also shorter than some tasting menus, offering an amuse bouche, three savory courses, a palate cleanser, and dessert. The menu mentions the availability of a seasonal chef's degustation menu, without stating the price.In light of the special occasion, we chose the regular tasting menu, on which I had the following:Chef's Canape (which I have forgotten)Phyllo Crusted Florida Shrimp, Cape Cod Baby Squid, Scuba Dived Sea Scallop, and Sweet Maryland Crabmeat in an Ocean Herbal BrothMediterranean Rouget with Mung Bean and Saffron Risotto, Rose Olive Puree, and Parmesan FoamMaine Day Boat Lobster with a Fricassee of Baby Bok Choy, Sugar Snap Peas, Celery Root Puree, and a Passion Fruit and Port-Wine Paprika SauceWild Hudson Valley Strawberry Soup with Homemade Fromage Blanc SorbetWashington State Rhubarb \"Shortcake\" with Crème de Cassis, Guava Sorbet, and Warm Wild Strawberry Jam(For the record, there were two options for the second course, three for the third, four for the fourth, and two for the dessert; the list above shows the selections I had, copied from a menu I brought home with me.)All the courses impressed me as complex, expertly composed, and exquisitely prepared. I particularly loved the seafood medley (the second course). The lobster was superior to a similar dish I had at Per Se in February. The presentations, too, were gorgeous and artistic, with each course on a different style and pattern of china, and usually accompanied by a decorative swish of some kind of sauce.As there were only three savory courses, each came in a portion large enough to appreciate and dwell upon. As special as the Per Se experience is, the nine bite-sized courses on its menus go by too quickly, even if the meal itself is a long evening. The portion sizes at Bouley seemed perfectly judged.Bouley is legendary for its bread service. On a cart wheeled to your table there's a choice of eight breads, all baked in-house. They are all, of course, fresh, but I found the butter a little too hard and uncompromising.The pacing of a tasting menu can be a challenge, and this one felt a bit rushed. From arrival to departure, the whole experience was just 90 minutes. Service was polite and efficient throughout, and no one ever acted like they were pushing us out the door, but in the end they did just that. An extra dessert course (not listed on the menu) arrived while we were still eating the first one.As we were leaving the hostess said, \"I have a gift for the ladies.\" Then, my two companions were each handed a wrapped Bouley coffee cake. I didn't say anything, but I thought it should have been obvious that I was not going home with either of them, and deserved a coffee cake of my own.Until a couple of years ago, Bouley carried four stars from the New York Times. The current critic, Frank Bruni, demoted it to three. I can see why. Bouley doesn't create the sustained magic of a Per Se or an Alain Ducasse. The food, I think, is up to that level, but the overall package falls a bit short.Bouley (120 West Broadway at Duane Street, TriBeCa)Food: ****Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***½

It must be a slow news day over at AM New York, a free daily that's handed out around the city's subway and commuter rail stations. Their cover story today is, \"Will Mike Run?\" The page three headline reads, \"Mike's mixed messages: Bloomie says he won't run for prez, but deputy won't let issue die.\"A sidebar headlined \"Bloomie the underdog\" quotes Steven Malanga, a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute, who says Bloomberg doesn't \"stand a chance\" of getting either party's nomination. I'll say! Although nominally a Republican, Bloomberg is considerably more liberal than most national members of his party. He's the kind of Republican that only New York City could love. With Republicans having won 5 of the last 7, and 7 of the last 10 presidential elections, they have no reason to offer up a moderate like Bloomberg to the national electorate.Democrats, on the other hand, would love to offer up a moderate like Bloomberg. Indeed, in the current political climate, only a moderate Democrat has any chance of being elected president. In the last forty years, the only Democrats to have won the presidency - Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton - were centrists. But Bloomberg isn't a Democrat. He used to be, but switched parties to run for Mayor of New York. Nobody's going to support a presidential candidate who switches parties back-and-forth, depending on what he's running for. A politician is allowed only one such switch in a lifetime (as Ronald Reagan famously did), and Bloomberg has had his.Rudy Giuliani, Bloomberg's predecessor, is making serious presidential noises. By Republican standards, Giuliani is slightly more conservative than Bloomberg, but no one that supports abortion rights (as Giuliani does) is conservative enough for the national party. He'd be a compelling candidate if he could manage to get the nomination, but he won't survive the primaries.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Wallse.On Friday night, my friend and I went to Wallse. Since my last visit, chef Kurt Gutenbrunner has opened two new restaurants - THOR and Blaue Gans - bringing his New York restaurant total to four. I had to wonder if the logistics of looking after four places would mean a reduction in quality at the flagship Wallse, which now has a Michelin star to its name.Well, there was no need to worry. Chef Gutenbrunner is still very much on top of his game. My friend and I both had the excellent foie gras terrine with gold leaf pears ($20). I had a salmon dish from the market menu ($32), while my friend had the classic Wiener Schnitzel ($30), both impeccably prepared. When you've been in a few noisy restaurants, you appreciate a place like Wallse where the surroundings are as rarefied as the food. We noted that service was always there when you needed it, but never intrusive.

***CONTENT
In 2003, Adam Perry Lang-who had previously cooked at such haute cuisine temples as Daniel, Le Cirque, and Chanterelle-decided to open a barbecue joint. He chose practically the most inhospitable and least accessible location in town: the corner of 46th Street and 11th Avenue, a solid fifteen minutes' walk from the nearest subway station, and in a rather dingy neighborhood. Nevertheless, 'cue hounds flocked to Daisy May in the belief that no one else in Manhattan had come close to getting it right.This spring, Daisy May added a small cafeteria-style dining room (it was previously just counter service, take-out or delivery), and they enhanced their menu, with rack-of-lamb for two ($95), half-a-pig or a whole pork butt for six ($200), or the whole pig for twelve ($400). All of these items have to be ordered a couple of days in advance, with a credit card to guarantee the reservation.In the Times, Peter Meehan warned that it's a ton of food, although he was in pig-heaven nonetheless. I didn't have half-a-dozen companions to bring with me, so my friend and I pre-ordered the lamb. It cooks over a low heat for about two hours, and it's fall-off-the-bone tender by the time it's served. The rack was higher in fat content than what most restaurants serve, which is what allows it to cook for so long without drying out. Two or three ribs is quite typical for a lamb entree, so with four between us the portion was ample. Yet, it was so good I was sad to see it gone. It came with homemade barbecue sauce (made partly with lamb gravy) that was out-of-this world.The dish comes with huge helpings of cole slaw, watermelon, \"Texas toast,\" and two additional side orders from a menu of about eight choices-I picked the Peaches Bourbon and Cream of Spinach. The sides came in large serving dishes and could easily have accommodated five or six people. We didn't touch the spinach, and we left behind great quantities of all the others. It is a sinful amount of food, and we felt rather guilty at leaving so much behind (when children are starving in Africa, yada, yada, yada).The Times warned that service is pretty \"bare-bones\", but the bones were barer than I'd imagined. The food is served with paper plates and plastic utensils. They not only lack a liquor license, but even so much as cups or a corkscrew. Unless you've pre-ordered one of these massive cuts of meat, service is strictly cafeteria-style, with canned soda all that's available to drink. Then there's the very long walk to 11th Avenue. This may well be the best barbecue in town, but I'm not sure how often I'll walk that far to get it. Still, on this occasion it was more than worth it.Daisy May's BBQ USA (623 11th Avenue at 46th Street, Hell's Kitchen)Food: **Service: FairAmbiance: FairOverall: *½

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Perry St.I enjoyed my last visit to Perry St. in February, notwithstanding that I felt like death warmed over that day (no fault of the restaurant's). I went again last night. It was a very light crowd, with much of the clientele probably being out of town for the July 4 holiday.We found the seating pattern mysterious. Twice, the host seated a couple at the table right next to us, despite acres of free two-tops elsewhere in the restaurant. (The first time, the couple objected, and were moved.)My friend and I ordered identically: the homemade fried mozzarella to start ($12), followed by the herb-crusted rack of lamb ($36). Both were excellent, and indeed I broke my usual rule, and had dessert. It was a coconut/caramel/banana mix with whipped cream on top, which is a can't miss combination in my book. Like last time, the bread rolls were so hard they could be used as doorstops.As before, the menu is brief, with about 8 appetizers and an equal number of entrees listed. The wine list, too, is brief for a restaurant serving this type of food. Although we both chose the expensive lamb entree, there are plenty of choices in the $20-30 range. For the quality, Perry St. is reasonably priced. Perry St. (176 Perry Street at West Street, West Village)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

I dined at db bistro moderne a couple of years ago, but my only memory is their $29 gimmick hamburger. A couple of Saturdays ago, I went back with my friend, determined to try anything but that hamburger. The restaurant caters heavily to a pre-theatre crowd - and I must say that it's a far higher-class dining experience than most Theater District restaurants can offer. The decor is stylish and comfortable: a \"modern bistro\" indeed. We arrived at 7:30 to a busy, bustling room. By 7:45, it was practically deserted. A few more diners came in later, but clearly their busiest hours were behind them. No one seems to have told the serving staff that a couple who arrive at 7:30 probably aren't going to the theater. The appetizers couldn't have taken more than five minutes, and the entrees came out pretty fast too. In all, we didn't spend more than about an hour at db, and that included the time we spent lingering over our bottle of wine at the end. Although the staff didn't suggest that they were eager for us to leave, it seems the kitchen is geared up for turning out food in a hurry, and they don't change their rhythm after the theater crowd has departed. The food, however, was wonderful. I had a great tuna tartare followed by duck confit. My friend had duck pâte followed by coq au vin. All four dishes were prepared in classic style and were flawless. If there was nothing particularly imaginative, there is much to be said for executing old favorites to near perfection. The wine list mentioned that the sommelier was highlighting syrah and granache this month, so we tried one of the recommendations in that category, and were pleased we did. The bread service was underwhelming, and not up to the level of the rest of the food.db bistro moderne (55 W. 44th St. between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **½

Quality Meats is a new entry in the sub-genre of luxury steakhouses, a niche occupied by itself, BLT Steak, BLT Prime, and Craftsteak. Characteristic of the category, the decor is significantly more upscale and chick-friendly than the typical steakhouse, the wine list more serious, the side dishes more carefully thought out, and the prices are several dollars more per entree than the already expensive standard set by NYC steakhouses.My friend and I gave Quality Meats a try last night. We found it a tad superior to Craftsteak, although with a few reservations. The restaurant offers a 64 oz. double bone-in rib steak for two, for $110. We're both fans of the ribeye, so we gave it a try. This was enormous, sliced tableside, with more of a \"prime rib\" taste than usual for a solo ribeye steak. We asked for a preparation between medium and medium rare, which the kitchen executed perfectly. We brought the ample leftovers home.The amuse bouche was a deviled egg, which struck us as unusual at this type of restaurant, but the kitchen did a fine job with it. They also sent out freshly baked dinner rolls, which were sinfully good. For appetizers, my friend had a salad, while I ordered the bone marrow ($9), which was excellent. While we awaited our steak, a server came over and prepared a terrific home-made steak sauce tableside. I don't normally use steak sauce, but for this I made an exception.For side dishes, we ordered the crispy potatoes ($7), which came in a hot pan, over which garlic butter was poured at the table. The effect was upscale potato chips. An order of grilled asparagus ($8) was wonderful. To go along with this, I found a very reasonable pinot noir. The total for two, before tip, was $215, which for a meal of this quality in New York was quite reasonable.If the story ended there, I'd give Quality Meats a solid three stars. But there were a number of glitches with the service. When we asked for the double ribeye, we initially did not want appetizers, as we knew we were in for something huge. Our server warned us that the ribeye would take 90 minutes to prepare, and asked if we wanted to reconsider the appetizers. We were baffled as to how a steak could take 90 minutes, but we took her word for it and ordered appetizers. In the meantime, our steak appeared 35-40 minutes later.We would also like to have been told that the steak came with about a pound of mushrooms and glazed onions, in which case we wouldn't have ordered two side dishes on top of that. Lastly, we were subjected to unctuous upselling at dessert time. We were full at that point, but the server tried to break our resistance: \"Are you sure you don't want any dessert? Perhaps an ice cream to share?\" On an already expensive bill, this bordered on offensive. We held our ground, but it was annoying nonetheless.For a restaurant of this size, the noise level was manageable. The AvroKO decor is spectacular, but the tables are small and close together. Indeed, there was not room on our table for everything we had ordered, and our server had to commandeer the next table over, which fortunately was not yet occupied. I don't know what they would have done had it been a full house.I'm sure I'll be back to Quality Meats - a steakhouse this good deserves to be on everyone's list. I sure hope they'll get their service team knocked into better shape.Quality Meats (57 W 58th Street, East of Sixth Avenue, West Midtown)Food: ***Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: **

A friend and I spent the long weekend in Montreal. That gave us two dinners to splurge on. We chose Au Pied de Cochon (reviewed in the last post) and Toque (pronounced \"to-KAY\"), which seems to be the dean of Montreal's fine dining restaurants. We hadn't reserved in advance, and our hotel concierge was skeptical of our chances on a Saturday night at short notice. However, he managed to secure a 9:30pm reservation, which was just fine for us.We chose chef Normand Laprise's seven-course degustation menu ($88). The printed menu doesn't tell you what you'll be getting - it's \"an elaborate mystery menu of seven inspired courses.\" To the best of my recollection, this is what we had:Amuse bouche of cold tomato soup with a cucumber foam, and a crisp mozzarella stick with a chive running up its spine.Scallop with strawberry foam. This was the one unsuccessful dish, as the strawberry foam totally overwhelmed the scallop. My friend, who doesn't eat scallops, was given a seafood ceviche instead, which she enjoyed.Tuna tartare on a tortilla, with an avocado puree. This combination of tastes was the second most successful course, after the bass (see below)Grilled striped bass, which my friend and I considered the most successful coursePork belly, served in a sealed glass jar. This presentation was amusing, but frankly the taste of the pork was completely forgettable.Duck breast in a mild pepper sauce, which we noted was an ample sized portion for a tasting menuGoat cheese sorbet, which was excellentDessert, which I have entirely forgottenI apologize for the Spartan descriptions, but that's about as much as I remember after a long and exhausting day. Service was terrific. The restaurant has a strange affectation of laying all the silverware at a 45-degree angle to the diner, and laying knives on their edge. It presents no inconvenience, and it is even a bit witty, but we wondered about the point of it. The restaurant is enormous and well appointed. Tables are both large and very generously spaced.This was a very strong degustation menu, and for the $88 price a very compelling dining choice for the visitor to Montreal.Toque (900, place Jean-Paul-Riopelle, Montreal, Quebec)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

***CONTENT
My friend and I spent last weekend in Montreal-the first visit for either of us. Au Pied de Cochon (\"The Pig's Foot\") was tops on our list of restaurants to try. We were totally delinquent in making reservations, so we were pleased that our hotel concierge was able to book us in at 9pm on the night of our arrival (Friday), and Toque (see the next post) at 9:30pm the following evening. In New York, we probably wouldn't have had such luck.Perhaps a better name for the restaurant would be Au Pied de Cochon et Canard, because the signature ingredient is foie gras. A whole section of the menu is dedicated to foie gras, and it figures in many other dishes as well. Several of the foie gras selections are clearly meant to be humorous riffs on popular comfort food normally served without it, such as foie gras poutine, foie gras grilled cheese, and foie gras hamburger. (A recent article in Gourmet said that Au Pied de Cochon goes through 300 pounds of foie gras per week.)Poutine is a popular fast food dish (even McDonald's has a version of it), consisting of french fries, cheese curd, and gravy. Foie gras poutine, naturally, is the same thing, but with a huge hunk of seared foie gras as the centrepiece, and a hint of foie gras in the gravy. We thought it was terrific.Many of the dishes have cryptic names, of which the most humorous is \"duck in a can.\" There is no explanation on the menu, but our server explained that it's duck breast and foie gras cooked inside a can. We didn't order this, but we saw a serving of it delivered to another table. Sure enough, the server brings a medium-sized soup can to the table, opens it with a conventional can opener, and then pours the meal onto the diner's plate. Who would think of such a thing?During the summer, the menu skews towards seafood. We saw massive raw bar platters being delivered to the tables, priced anywhere betwen $45 and $320. Pork, lamb, and venison also remain fixtures on the menu. Au pied de Cochon's steak frites is made with venison all year long.We ordered the pied de cochon foie gras, which again would be obscure if the server didn't explain that it's a whole shank of pig's foot with foie gras, mashed potatoes, and vegetables. It was indescribably good, and the kind of dish you're not going to find anywhere else.Portion sizes were enormous-not just the things we ordered, but also the servings we saw delivered to other tables. Our server kindly advised that one order of poutine foie gras and one order of pied de cochon foie gras would be ample for two people, as this wouldn't have been apparent from the menu. That pied de cochon was $48, but when served for two it is a bargain.The apple pie was the only thing we ordered that was listed as a portion for two on the menu. Naturally, it was big enough for three. It came freshly baked, and was about the best apple pie I've ever tasted in a restaurant.The chef, Martin Picard, has made a reputation with his button-down shirts (never tucked in), wild hair, and three-day-old beard. While we were there, he was all over the place - cooking some of the food, drinking beer and wine, and chatting up the customers. He said \"Bon soir\" to us as we left.The space is informal, with tables fairly close together. The restaurant is only about 20 feet wide (although it is fairly deep). To get to the men's room, you actually have to pass through the open kitchen. However, service was friendly and attentive. Our server recommended a superb wine at about $48 that went perfectly with our foie gras festival of a meal.Au Pied de Cochon (536, rue Duluth Est, Montreal, Quebec)Food: ***Service: **½Ambiance: *½Overall: ***

In my never-ending search for perfection in steaks, I gave Delmonico's a try last Thursday night. Delmonico's has been operating at its present location since 1838. It is presently configured as a steakhouse, which is a wise choice in the financial district, because it seems bankers can never get enough steaks. The menu is pretty much the standard fare, at the standard prices. I tried the ribeye ($38), which is my benchmark for excellence in steaks these days. It was one of the better ones I've tried, though not on a par with nearby Nebraska Beef or Strip House.The restaurant does get brownie points for ambiance, though. It is a comfortable and well-appointed space with white tablecloths and handsomely-dressed waiters, that makes you feel like you're having a special night out.My only complaint was with the wine service. When I asked for wines by the glass, the server said, \"We have a merlot, cabernet, pinot noir, shiraz,\" etc. This seems to be a peculiarity of steakhouses, where they don't have a written list of wines by the glass, and you are only told the grape-not the producer, the region, or the year. At steakhouse prices, why can't they tell you what they're serving?Anyhow, I was pleased with Delmonico's overall and would be happy to visit again.Delmonico's (56 Beaver St, at William & S.

My friend and I had a terrific meal at the Aquavit Cafe in April (report here), so we were tempted to try the main dining room. Our dinner there a couple of weeks ago was peculiarly underwhelming.We had the three-course prix fixe ($80). My friend started with the Herring Sampler, which came with a glass of beer and a shot of what must have been 100-proof potato vodka. I had a foie gras starter, but the accompanying strips of bacon stole the show.For the main course, my friend had the bacon wrapped New York strip, and again, she found that the bacon stole the show. Spice rubbed venison loin came in a peculiar apple-pine broth that turned the dish into a swimming pool. I found the dessert choices underwhelming, and settled on a selection of three scoops of ice cream.Aquavit is, of course, capable of great things, but on this occasion we weren't wowed. The design is supposed to suggest Scandinavian minimalism, but my friend, who has spent a lot of time in Sweden, found the space sterile.Aquavit (65 E. 55th St. between Park & Madison Avenues, East Midtown)Food: **Service: **½Ambiance: **½Overall: **

A friend of mine absolutely swears by Woo Lae Oak, a Korean barbecue restaurant in Soho. At her suggestion we gave it a try last week. The space is large, the vibe dark and sexy, the tables generously spaced. Though there were just two of us, we were seated at a four-top, with partitions separating our table from those on either side of ours. It almost felt like a semi-private room.She steered us clear of the appetizers, based on past experience. There are some 17 barbecue choices, priced $18-39, of which we selected two: black tiger prawns and sliced beef rib eye (both $24). Cook-it-yourself food is always plenty of fun. We were particularly impressed with the rib eye's intense flavor.She selected a rice dish, Dol Sot Bi Bim Bap (steamed rice with vegetables in a hot stone bowl) ($18), again based on past experience, which was a spicy delight. Dinner also comes with a salad and garnishes, and with the two barbecue dishes this probably would have been enough.But we also ordered the black cod and daikon radish in a spicy, sweet garlic soy sauce ($28), which was superb, ranking right up there with Nobu's famous preparation. I would run back to Woo Lae Oak for this dish alone.We didn't drink alcohol. Dinner for two was $102 including tax, before tip. I don't believe I've tried Korean barbecue anywhere else, so I can't make comparisons, but Woo Lae Oak was plenty of fun, and we were quite happy with our meal.Woo Lae Oak (148 Mercer Street between Prince & Houston Streets, SoHo)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

A colleague and I visited Pastis a couple of weeks ago. It wasn't my choice. I have nothing against the place, but I've seen the long lines plenty of times, and I doubted that it would be worth braving the crowds. However, he made a 7pm reservation, and at that hour the restaurant was only just beginning to fill up.My colleague mentioned that Pastis seems to be one of those iconic New York restaurants where you're supposed to see celebrities-or that's the theory, anyway. We didn't spy anyone famous. He mentioned that he's watched Sex and the City only four times, and twice the characters dined at Pastis.Well, what about the food? Frankly, we didn't get what all the fuss is about. I had a mediocre steak tartare and a decent grilled sea bass. A not unhappy experience, but certainly nothing to justify the restaurant's reputation. Tables are both small and uncomfortably close together, the noise level is loud, and menus double as placemats. At least the prices are reasonable.You won't eat badly at Pastis, but we could hardly see what all the fuss is about.Pastis (9 Ninth Avenue at Little West 12th St, Meatpacking District)Food: *Service: okayAmbiance: fairOverall: okay

At Duvet, there are plenty of signals that food is not the real attraction. This is one of those restaurants where most of the \"tables\" are beds. Their OpenTable profile warns in bold-face type that there is a two-hour time limit on all beds, as well as a two-appetizer or one-entree minimum per person. In other words, what they don't want is for the Chelsea/Flatiron party set to occupy the beds and drink the night away.Mind you, there is plenty of bar space for those who do want to drink, but the restaurant's centerpiece is 30 very large beds and the vast space that accommodates them. The space is decorated in soft whites and off-whites. Programmed lights project a rotation of constantly changing hues on the walls. Wide-screen TVs show soothing videos. You're encouraged to take off your shoes. Slippers are available at each bed. For our relatively early reservation, the space was still relatively empty, but I would imagine it gets packed later on.For those who wimp out at the idea of eating in bed, as we did, there are a small number of tables available. We noted that the vinyl banquettes are somewhat worse for the wear, including even a cigarette burn (surprising, since the NYC restaurant smoking ban long pre-dates Duvet's opening).Duvet's staff are obviously taken with the beds. Earlier in the day, when the reservation agent called to confirm, she asked if we wanted a bed or a table. \"A table,\" I replied. When I arrived, the host insisted that we try a bed. I knew my friend didn't want to eat in bed, but I said I'd give it a whirl. It felt funny, and while I probably wouldn't mind snacking in one of their beds, I don't think I'd enjoy it for a full-scale meal. Trays are available, but the balancing act could be awkward. When the server comes by to take your order, he actually gets onto the bed with you. There's plenty of room, of course, but it seems wacky.The cuisine is described as \"Modern American with global influences.\" One of those influences is Japanese. Flights of sushi, sashimi, and hand rolls are available at $55, $85, or $125. I started more modestly with the Spicy Yellowtail Roll ($14), which was competently executed. My friend had no joy with the Salmon Ceviche ($9), which she found mediocre and did not finish.For the main course, we both had the Peking Duck ($26), which comes with \"sweet and sour\" cherries. We didn't detect any Peking or sweet and sour in the dish, but it was a modestly enjoyable performance.Duvet is more about a sexy vibe than fine dining. You won't eat badly, but you won't eat memorably either.Duvet (45 W. 21st St. between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Chelsea)Food: okay, but nothing specialService: *Ambiance: *½Overall: okay

Note: Chef Adam Perry Lang has since left Robert's Steakhouse.Robert's Steakhouse has gotten some good press lately, including a prominent mention in the Times. One night in early June, I decided to find out for myself if the fuss is justified. The restaurant is located in the Penthouse Lounge, although it is a separate section of the club. Most men go there, I think, to drink at the bar, to look at the strip show, and perhaps to visit a private room with one of the models.Steakhouse pricing is fairly consistent in the city. The steaks at Robert's are over-priced beyond reason. There are three options for the solo diner: filet ($51), t-bone ($51) or bone-in strip ($53). All of them are at least $10-12 more than most NYC steakhouses would charge. The porterhouse and ribeye, both available only in portions for two, are similarly over-priced.The server recommended the strip. At this price, it had better be a strip steak to die for. It wasn't. Yes, it was a huge slab of meat, probably two inches thick before cooking. And yes, it was expertly broiled. But it was slightly tough and over-salted. Later on, one of the Penthouse models told me that she thinks Del Frisco's is better - a remarkable admission.Needless to say, Del Frisco's is more sensibly priced. It's also in a far more hospitable part of town - 49th & 6th, rather than Robert's perch in the hinterlands at 45th & 11th. Indeed, I could easily name a dozen steakhouses serving better steaks at better prices in better neighborhoods than Robert's.The over-priced fare was not limited to the steaks. On the wine list, there were no bottles below $75. When I asked for wine by the glass, I was offered \"cabernet or merlot\"; no indication of vintage or winery. A glass of the unremarkable and unnamed cabernet was an outrageous $17.Service was merely average. There was an excellent selection of warm bread rolls, but they were brought to the table long after I sat down. My check was brought to the table before I had finished ordering. I could go on, but you get the idea.Robert's Steakhouse (603 W 45th St at 11th Avenue, Hell's Kitchen)Food: *Service: fairAmbiance: fair, but not a place you could take a dateOverall: okay

Brandy Library is a delightful lounge for brandy, cognac, armagnac, calvados, whiskey, rum, and the like. The quiet, comfortable room is ringed with floor-to-ceiling shelves. Naturally, instead of books, those shelves are stocked with liquor.One night a few weeks ago, I took a seat at the bar and immediately stumped the panel. I asked for \"Macallan 1988 15 years 86 proof Sherry cask MacKillop's choice\" ($16). After searching the shelves for several minutes, with no fewer than three staff members consulting, they determined that my choice was no longer in stock.I asked for somthing similar, and funky. \"Funky we can do,\" the hostesss said. They recommended Glenrothes 1992 86 proof. Glenrothes is a smaller highland distillery, but they promised I would taste a sherry flavor, just like the Macallan. This was a whiskey so powerful that I started to get intoxicated merely by waving the glass under my nose. It was served in a wide-mouth Riedel glass that gives the drink plenty of room to breathe. It was extremely smoothe, with a long, comfortable, only midly burning after-taste.On another visit, I once again made a selection that was out of stock, but this time the spirits sommelier was in the house, and he quickly suggested an excellent alternative at a lower price than the one I'd picked. \"The list of whiskeys we're out of is longer than the list that most restaurants serve,\" he quipped. On a third visit, I put myself in his hands, and he again made an excellent suggestion. Chivas Regal was doing a promotion, and a couple of attractive models came over with free glasses of Chivas 18. I also tried a basket of the gougères on that occasion. They are hopelessly addictive.A few months later, I brought a friend, and we ordered a brandy tasting called Spirit of Gascony ($36). That buys you eight shot-glasses with splashes of different brandies. It's more than enough for two people to have a good taste of each. (Any more brandy than that, and you'd have to be wheeled out the door). The gougères ($8) made a terrific accompaniment.The room is clearly configured for drinking, but there is a respectable food menu that includes everything from those gougères to burgers.Brandy Library (25 N Moore at Varick St, TriBeCa)Food/Spirits: ***Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **½

In his review of Barbounia, Frank Bruni's most gushing praise was reserved for something critics usually don't talk about: the seats. Yes, Barbounia has the most comfortable seating of any restaurant in New York-or any I've tried, at any rate.On Memorial Day, the restaurant was only sparsely populated, and the staff invited us to choose our own table. Although we found Barbounia comfortable on both the eyes and the arses, the dining experience was mediocre.I started with Saganaki ($13) - baked cheese, truffled fig marmalade, fresh fruit, fresh baked cherry and walnut breads. I was thinking of a baked cheese dish that I'd ordered in Greektown in Detroit, but this was a pale shadow of it. After a couple of bites, the cheese quickly became sticky and dull to the taste. Halibut with fava beans ($26, I believe) was competently prepared. My friend seemed to have the better of it with three juicy pieces of rack of lamb.The wine list was featuring white wines of Santorini, a small Greek island of which I have distant but fond memories. Alas, both the first and the second Santorini wine I selected were out of stock. (\"We're re-configuring our wine list,\" the server said, a process that evidently involves restocking, but not reprinting.) Pressing my luck, I gave a third choice, which they were finally able to produce. It was astringent and overly acidic. I don't know if that's Santorini's fault, or if my first choice would have been better.The befuddled serving staff was persistently confused about silverware. They gave me the steak knife and my friend the fish knife for our entrees. After we were finished, they dropped off clean forks and steak knives for both of us, although we hadn't ordered any dessert. A few moments later, they were taken away.In a neighborhood that has plenty of excellent dining options, we won't be rushing back to Barbounia.Barbounia (250 Park Avenue South at 20th Street, Flatiron District)Food: okayService: okayAmbiance: *Overall: okay

Note 2: As of Friday, April 10, Lever House is \"closed for renovations.\" We put that in quotes because many such closures turn out to be extremely long-lasting, or indeed permanent. It certainly seems that if Lever House re-opens at all, it will be in a much altered form. Note: As of April 2008, Scott Bryan is executive chef at Lever House, replacing Dan Silverman. Oops! Scott Bryan was in, but now he is out. As of June 2, 2008, Bradford Thompson will be the new chef at Lever House. The alum of several Daniel Boulud restaurants, Thompson was most recently chef de cuisine at Mary Elaine's at the Phoenician in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he won the James Beard Best Chef (Southwest) award for 2006. I dined at Lever House in late May with two colleagues. The modernist space is striking, with the abundance of hexagonal shapes almost letting you forget that the walls are a plain-Jane light brown. Tables are comfortable and impeccably set, but they are exceedingly close together, with waiters performing Olympic-class gymnastic manoevers to get to your table. The noise level is uncomfortably loud. The cuisine is a mostly undistinguished New American. Roasted asparagus with duck egg and parmigiano reggiano ($17) sounded promising, but a puddle of fried egg somewhat overwhelmed the asparagus. I was pleased to find that Colorado rack of lamb ($38) came with two thick double-cut chops, which were lusciously tender. They came with a spicy lamb sausage that was the evening's highlight, along with a salad of parsley and mint that didn't wow me. Strawberry cheesecake for dessert ($12) brought the evening to a fitting close. I enjoyed a cocktail called the Bourbon Smash, although it was over-priced at $15. I was annoyed when the server removed it before I was finished. He asked if I'd like some wine with dinner. I hadn't had time yet to peruse the list, so I entreated him to return in a few minutes. We never saw him again till dessert, so I drank water. The bill for three was $200 including tax, before tip. That was for food only, as we drank no alcohol. (My cocktail was ordered at the bar.) At that price, you certainly expect the food to be good-which this was-but I prefer quieter surroundings and more attentive service. I won't be rushing back.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Craftsteak.So many new steakhouses, so little time. That's the feeling I have these days, with high-profile steakhouses opening almost weekly. Craftsteak is special, being a creation of the sainted Tom Colicchio (Gramercy Tavern, Craft, Craftbar, Craftsteak Las Vegas, etc.). The space is comfortable and gorgeous. My friend was distracted all evening by a spectacular mural of the Chelsea landscape that takes up the whole back wall. You never thought Chelsea looked so good! I was, on the other hand, distracted by the floor-to-ceiling wine cellar that separates the dining room from the bar, where there is ample seating for the casual visitor. The menu has undergone some refinement from earlier versions posted on the net. On a Saturday night in May, the Wagyu tasting menus, which had ranged anywhere from $115-165 per person, were no longer on offer. Gone too was the prime rib, which had carried a price tag of anywhere from $180-240. I suspect the whole lobe of foie gras ($160) may be an endangered spiecies. Our server said that it has been ordered only twice. A normal order of foie gras is $20. Our server was not informed as to how it was prepared. \"I don't know...it changes daily\" was all he could say, but he felt sure it came with toast points. Turns out it didn't. It was still a portion of seared foie gras ample enough to be shared (as we had expected), and sinfully good, but the server ought to know what's coming. A ribeye for two ($72) struck us as way under-sized. This does not seem to be a problem for the restaurant generally. A glance at other tables showed that most steaks were enormous. But this ribeye seemed only slightly larger than the typical steak for one. It yielded just nine small slices of beef. Luckily, we are not huge eaters, but I suspect others would have been disappointed. (On a subsequent visit, my friend ordered a ribeye for one that was not much smaller than the ribeye for two that we had shared.) One could find no fault with the beef itself, which was perfectly marbled and expertly cooked. We noted that it was grilled, rather than broiled, and did not have the exterior char that many steakhouses provide. It came with a bone on the side filled with gooey marrow. To top it off, we ordered the English Pea and Morel risotto ($22), which was superb. Aside from the foie gras confusion, service was just fine. The amuse bouche was tasty, although I've forgotten what was in it. The bread, which came hot out of the oven, in its own cast-iron pan, was irresistible.Craftsteak (85 10th Ave at 15th St, Far West Chelsea)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: **

Note: This is a review of Eleven Madison Park under Chef Kerry Heffernan. Click here for a review under Chef Daniel Humm.I took my mom and my girlfriend to Eleven Madison Park last night. They were doing a good business, but the restaurant wasn't full at any point during our 3½ hours there.For Mother's Day, they were offering the standard three-course prix fixe at $68 or a special five-course tasting menu at $85. We chose the latter. The courses, as best I remember them, were:Amuse bouche of gazpacho and cherry tomato sorbetSalad of Florence fennel, radishes, and essence of cara cara orangeFoie gras terrine with rhubarb and raisinsLobster with butter poached carrots, orange and GewürtztraminerPalate cleanser, which I have forgottenWagyu beef short rib braised with bone marrow crust and garden peasChoice of cheesecake with sheep's milk yogurt and roasted pineapple; or, selection of cheesesPetits-foursThis was the first time that I've dined out at a high-end restaurant on a holiday, and not been disappointed. The fact that the regular à la carte menu was available was a positive sign. When restaurants channel everyone to just one menu (as they often do on New Year's Eve, for example), it's a sure sign that you're going to get a mass-produced mess that's no better than a catered wedding.Here, every course was excellent. The rhubarb-raisin foie gras terrine stood out, especially for the unusual combination of ingredients. The beef short ribs were wonderfully tender. In a tasting menu one always regrets that there are only a few bites. I also especially liked the creativity of the cheesecake.Paired wines would have been $48 each, but that was more wine than we cared to consume on a Sunday evening, so we ordered a bottle of cabernet franc from Channing Daughters ($71), and weren't disappointed. The staff decanted the wine for us without our asking, which is something all too few restaurants will do these days.Service was close to flawless. (The restaurant won the 2004 James Beard award for best service in America.) We were especially impressed with the timing of the courses, which at some restaurants are rushed when your meal is a tasting of multiple small courses. We always had an ample amount of time to relax before the next course arrived.Dinner for three, including tasting menus, pre-dinner cocktails, wine, and cappucino afterwards, was $371 before tax and tip.Eleven Madison Park (11 Madison Avenue @24th St, Flatiron District)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

***CONTENT
Acapella is my second off-the-radar Italian place this week. The restaurant claims on its website to be \"home of the finest Northern Italian Cuisine on the planet.\" It also says that the first episode of The Sopranos was shot there. Acapella has a 24 food rating on Zagat, but it has never garnered so much as a mention in The New York Times.My dinner there last night demonstrated that you can eat very well at Acapella, but they are not without missteps. To start, we were given plates of cured ham, marinated egglpant, and freshly shaved mozarella to go with bread for the table. A captain then recited in a thick Italian accent a list of specials that was longer than the printed menu. It's a quaint custom, but ordinary mortals naturally have trouble keeping it all straight. At these prices, can't they print a new menu every day?I started with scallops, which came with a covering of hot diced tomatos. Unfortunately, the presence of scallops on the plate was only a rumor. All the flavor had been cooked out of them, so the dish was just tomatos accompanying something with no taste at all.Rack of lamb was an altogether happier experience. I was not expecting a full half-rack to be presented table-side. It was certainly a spectacular show. They carried the rack away to a prep station in full view, where it was put into a pan and spectacularly set on fire. Moments later, it was brought back to the table, freshly carved with a peppercorn sauce and mashed potatoes. The lamb was tender and rare, in a generous portion that I was only too happy to finish. One of my companions ordered a veal chop that was massive.After our entrees were finished, they brought out dessert glasses, and we had a serving of excellent homemade peach grappa. Throughout the meal, service was highly attentive, but also very rapid. Although we didn't get the sense they were trying to get rid of us, I can't remember a meal of this quality when the courses came out so quickly.Our wine was an excellent Barolo. As a vendor was paying, and everything we ordered was off of the recited specials, I didn't see what anything cost, but I am certain it didn't come cheap.Acapella (1 Hudson Street at Chambers Street, TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: **½Ambiance: **Overall: **

Caffe La Fenice flies beneath the restaurant radar. I've walked by it dozens of times over at least a five year period on the way to Lincoln Center, from which it is only a few blocks away. Given the paucity of dining options in that immediate vicinity, I was surprised to find it is not even in Zagat.Well, it was Saturday evening, and I had no reservations before a 7:15 performance of Lohengrin. The usual standouts were booked, and I thought of La Fenice (which means \"The Phoenix,\" and shares its name with an opera house in Venice). Sure enough, they had a table, so we gave it a try.I had a terrific grilled portabello mushroom, which was about double the usual portion, along with a perfectly respectable grilled red snapper. My friend started with a salad and then rack of lamb, which she thought was wonderful.La Fenice has a wonderful selection of flavored martinis - I tried peach. As we had five hours of Wagner ahead of us, we didn't sample the wine list.The decor is uncomplicated faux Italian. There is sidwalk dining available on a spring or summer evening, and we enjoyed the fresh air. One complaint with the service was that the entrees were delivered before we were finished with our appetizers. They took them back to the kitchen, but it was an amateurish mistake nonetheless.For uncomplicated solid Italian cuisine before the symphany or the opera, we'll certainly be back to La Fenice.Caffe La Fenice (2014 Broadway between 68th & 69th Sts, Upper West Side)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Ici is an unpretentious neighborhood restaurant in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn. Like many restaurants these days, Ici emphasizes its reliance on seasonal local ingredients. It's about a fifteen-minute walk from the Brooklyn Academy of Music (our reason for being there) and is a safe choice for a pre-show meal.A friend and I had dinner at Ici last Friday night. I should have taken better notes when my memory was fresh, but I vaguely recall starting with a goat cheese salad that was unspectacular, followed by sea bass that was simply grilled, and presented competently without any frills. Much of the clientele seemed to be from the neighborhood. The outdoor garden is lovely, and the restaurnt is child-friendly.Our meal was nothing special, but it was enjoyable and easy on the pocketbook. I will certainly consider going back the next time I am going to BAM. Otherwise, I wouldn't make a special trip.Ici (246 DeKalb Avenue between Vanderbilt & Clermont Aves, Fort Greene, Brooklyn)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Vino Vino is a small wine bar in TriBeCa, right next to the old El Teddy's lot. The space is divided by a glass partition, with the retail wine shop on the right and the wine bar on the left. There are comfortable benches with a view into the retail space, with small tables and upholstered stools. At the back of the deep, narrow space is a traditional bar with about 5-6 seats.A colleague and I visited Vino Vino last night. There were less than 10 people there, leaving the space eerily solemn, but perfect for a quiet conversation. There seemed to be only one server, and it took him quite a while to come to our table, even though he didn't seem to be busy. However, he was fully knowledgeable about the menu, and gave accurate descriptions of the two Pinot Noirs we wanted to try. We wound up having a glass of both - 2003 Christom Vinyards \"Mt. Jefferson Cuvee\" ($14) and 2002 Walter Hansel \"Estate Cuvee\" ($16).The menu offers about 30 wines by the glass, ranging from $6-20; most are $10-15. The food menu includes a limited selection of cured meats ($9-13 ea.; $14, plate of three), pates ($10, plate of three) and cheeses ($9, plate of three; $15, plate of six). We shared the plate of 6 cheeses, which were excellent - again, well explained by our server, once we could get his attention.The bill, including two glasses of wine apiece and the cheese plate, was $96 including tax and tip. Although service was spotty, we would definitely go back to Vino Vino, as prices are reasonable, and the space is both comfortable and serene.Vino Vino (211 West Broadway at Franklin St, TriBeCa)Food/Drink: **Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: **

Flor de Sol is a Spanish standout in TriBeCa. Zagat calls it \"sexy\" and \"romantic\"; I would agree.I had lunch there today with a group from work. My assistant, who is Hispanic, adores the place. She highly recommended the sangria, but that wasn't in the cards with an afternoon of work still to go. On her recommendation, I tried the filet of sole (just $11.95 at lunch), which was light, tender, and just slightly buttery. At dinner, they serve the sole in a banana sauce ($22), which I had several years ago, and was so memorable I can still taste it to this day.Several reviews have mentioned that Flor de Sol gets noisy and crowded at night, but it wasn't busy for lunch. Our food came out quickly-always critical for a working lunch.Flor de Sol (361 Greenwich St, between Franklin & Harrison Sts, TriBeCa)Food: *Ambiance: *Service: *½Overall: *

A friend and I had dinner at Molyvos the other night. We both ordered a Sea Bass special ($30), which was cooked to perfection - crisp on the outside, tender on the inside, and perched atop a bed of vegetables. I wasn't very hungry, so all I had with it was the house cabernet ($12), which was unremarkable.Molyvos has settled into a happy middle age. Ruth Reichl, reviewing for the Times, was utterly smitten in 1997, awarding three stars. Five years later, Eric Asimov was still enthusiastic, but took the restaurant down to two stars.I have a sense that Molyvos is executing a well-trodden path competently, but isn't doing anything that would make it a destination. Maybe it's because there are a lot more Greek restaurants today in Molyvos's class than there were in 1997.The ambiance is a comfortable faux Greek, and we were pleased to be seated at a large table that could easily have seated four. It was a happy contrast to restaurants that insist on putting you at a two-top, even when it's clear they're not busy.Molyvos (871 Seventh Ave between 55th & 56th Sts, West Midtown)Food: *½Ambiance: *½Service: **Overall: *½

***CONTENT
Note: SAPA closed during the summer of 2008. It will re-open as Nuela, a Latin fusion concept under Chef Douglas Rodriguez. The restaurant SAPA's blurb on the OpenTable website leads you to expect that shotgun wedding of culinary styles that is usually called \"fusion\": Sapa; it's namesake, an incredibly picturesque village that lies on the Hoang Lien Son mountain range near the Chinese border in NW Vietnam, was built by the French in 1922. Sapa marries the two cuisines under one roof, but not on the plate. The food embodies modern interpretations of Vietnamese dishes with an emphasis on share styled plates as to conform to the Vietnamese style dining and the French cuisine expresses versions of classic bistro and brasserie dishes. The menu has evidently undergone some refinement since Frank Bruni was there in January 2005. Its length so offended him that it became the theme of his review, \"So Many Dishes! A Little Help, Please.\" As presented last night, SAPA's menu did not appear overly long, and some of the specific dishes mentioned in the review are now gone. The alleged French bistro/brasserie influence is largely a phantom. Actually, I had forgotten Bruni's review entirely, but I was looking for a dining spot in Chelsea on a Sunday evening, and SAPA caught my eye. The gorgeous AvroKo-designed space is modern, sleek, and sexy. You know you're in for an Asian-themed eclectic menu when you find both chopsticks and Western utensils at the table. To start, I decided to try the Spicy Tuna Rolls ($10). There were two rolls, about three-inches long and as thick as a cigar, and they came with three dipping sauces. Perhaps \"tangy\" would have been a better name than \"spicy,\" but whatever the name they were very good. I was even more impressed with Cod Roasted in Parchment ($32). You expect fish cooked in parchment to retain its moisture (as this one did), but you don't expect the combination with porcini butter, roasted mushrooms, and pureed potato to deliver such an effective flavor punch. This was one of the more delightful fish preparations I've had in quite some time. My friend had a duck salad ($12) and stir-fry chicken ($25), and she appeared to be equally satisfied. Service was friendly and efficient. The restaurant appeared to be doing a decent business for a Sunday night, although they were well under half full.

Note: Frank's steakhouse closed in early 2008. An inconvenient location, mediocre food, and the arrival of far better steakhouses nearby, finally doomed the place.Frank's, an Italian steakhouse, has been in business in southwest Chelsea since 1912. It recently (per the website) moved to 16th Street between Ninth & Tenth Avenues, a bit closer to the Meatpacking District / Chelsea Market action.It's pretty tough to imagine a restaurant more empty than Frank's was last night. I believe there were three tables occupied, including ours. Perhaps there were a couple of guys hanging out at the bar, and watching the Yankees' game on two large flat-panel TV screens. It's a big space, and it's hard to see how they can survive, if this is at all typical.I ordered the \"Lamb Chop\" ($32), which actually was three smallish chops. They were cooked competently, medium rare as I ordered them, but came with no condiments, and for the price I thought it was a modest portion. My friend ordered the braised veal shank ($28), which was an enormous portion partially overcooked. The appealing bread service came with a bowl of antipasto and a tasty crumble of bleu cheese.I hate it when the waitstaff try to sell you side dishes, and neglect to mention that your entrees already come with vegetables. One never knows for sure at these quasi-steakhouse restaurants. My lamb came with hand-cut potatoes, broccoli, and carrots. My friend's veal came with a helping of rice that could have fed the whole Meatpacking District. Yet, our server mentioned nothing when we ordered a side of asparagus ($10) on top of all this.Service was a tad slow, especially for a place that was practically empty, and therefore had no excuse.Frank's (410 W. 16th St. between Ninth & Tenth Avenues, Southwest Chealsea)Food: OkayService: FairAmbiance: OkayOverall: Okay

Note: This is a review of Gilt under Chef Paul Liebrandt, who left the restaurant later in 2006. Click here for a review of Gilt under Chef Chris Lee. Those who were as impressed with Liebrandt's cooking as I was can rejoice: in late 2008, he'll be opening Corton in the former Montrachet space.My friend and I had dinner at Gilt last night. Located in what was once the Villiard Mansion (and is now the Palace Hotel), in the space that was formerly Le Cirque, it is an opulent restaurant that is clearly trying to shoot for the moon. It doesn't always get there. Chef Paul Liebrandt's cuisine is adventurous, colorful, thoughtful, and frequently excellent. But there are too many dishes that fail to live up to their promise.The menu at Gilt changes frequently, and is still clearly undergoing some refinement. Frank Bruni complained that practically half the dishes carried supplements on top of a $92 prix fixe. On last night's version, I noted a supplement only on the Dover Sole ($12).We chose the seven-course tasting menu, which is $160 on the website, but was $145 last night. There were, in fact, something closer to eleven courses, including two flights of amuses bouches, white asparagus, foie gras, skate, lobster, a palate cleanser, Berkshire pork belly, cheese course, another palate cleanser, and a degustation of chocolate. Every plating was a work of art.I'm not adept at remembering ingredients, and Liebrandt puts more into each dish than any chef in town. We found the foie gras, the pork belly, and the cheese course spectacular. Especially notable was a decadent truffle butter that was brought to the table with the foie gras. But both fish courses disappointed. The skate was only about the size of a silver dollar, and it failed to make any impression at all. And there were just two popcorn-sized lumps of lobster. The white asparagus wasn't as impressive as what Geoffrey Zakarian's performance of it at Country. The chocolate degustation was terrific if you're a choc-a-holic, but I think there should have been other options for dessert.Gilt is clearly trying to offer four-star service, and at times it succeeds. For instance, Gilt was just the third restaurant I've been to (along with Alain Ducasse and Per Se) that has your coat ready when you leave, without the attendant even asking your name. But there were peculiar glitches. The wrong wine glasses were delivered to the table: a captain whispered, \"No, the bordeaux glasses,\" and the right stemware was quickly substituted. When you leave your table, the staff brings a fresh napkin. Or they're supposed to. On one occasion, a new napkin wasn't there immediately; on another, I had to ask for it.Frank Bruni complained about the $1,000 glass of wine at Gilt. It's still on the menu (a Screaming Eagle cabernet that's ridiculously priced everywhere). When he first visited, wines by the glass didn't come cheaper than $18, but there are now choices as low as $12 (though you'll more likely pay at least $14). For wines by the bottle, there are plenty of choices under $100, and even a handful under $50. For a restaurant of this calibre, I can't complain about that. My friend and I chose a Martinelli Reserve Pinot Noir at $122, which was out-of-this-world. It was more than we usually spend, but it was a night to splurge. Gilt does gouge you in other ways. Cocktails are $15 apiece, which is on the high side, and we were charged $9 each for capuccinos.The room is small, elegant, and comfortable. The door to the kitchen is up a short flight of steps, and open to view, which detracts slightly from the magic of the occasion. The hard polished wood surfaces reflect sound, and when the restaurant fills up it gets a bit noisier than I'd like.The bill came to just a hair under $500, including tax. We went home happy, and much of the food was as terrific as it should be, but at that price there should be a sustained excellence that was lacking. I can see why Frank Bruni awarded just two stars, but that seems almost punitive for a restaurant that aims as high as Gilt, and often succeeds.Gilt (455 Madison Avenue at 50th Street, in the Palace Hotel, East Midtown)Food: ***Service: ***½Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Actually, my friend had taken me out to an expensive meal at Country the week before, so I thought it was appropriate to reciprocate.

I've eaten at Sapphire a number of times before shows at Lincoln Center. It offers mainly the standard Indian dishes, but in a more elegant setting than one usually encounters for this type of cuisine. The embroidered tapestries hanging from the ceiling are especially striking.My friend and I were there on Friday night. The Michelin Guide had suggested the Chutney Idli appetizer ($5), which is described as \"Steamed rice and lentil flour cakes topped with coconut chutney.\" This is a clever dish, but better for sharing than as an individual portion. You get five small cakes, but after about three of them the novelty wears off.The Salmon Tandoori ($19) was more successful. It's marinated in yogurt and spices before being skewered and grilled in the tandoor. The salmon has just a slight spicy kick to it, but it's not a hot dish by any means. I enjoyed it, but thought that it was a touch too dry. My friend enjoyed lamb vindaloo, but said it wasn't as hot as she's had elsewhere.Sapphire (1845 Broadway between 60th & 61st Streets, Upper West Side)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: *

MJ Grill is under new management. Although the signage and decor remain the same, it is now an Italian place. Within the next 2-3 months, it will be renamed Amici.One thing that hasn't changed is the lack of a dinner crowd. Just like every time I've been there, you find oceans of empty tables once you get past the bar. You've got to wonder if an unremarkable Italian place is going to have any more luck at attracting patrons.The menu doesn't break any new ground. I had a rather dull crab cake caesar salad, although my friend loved the veal parmagiana. There is still a cheeseburger on offer, but I have no idea if it's as good as MJ Grill's version. On the whole, it's a menu that could have dropped in right out of Little Italy-which I don't necessarily think is a bad thing, but it's not going to turn many heads.Service on a Tuesday night was extremely slow, despite the lack of patronage. We were offered complimentary after-dinner drinks, which unfortunately we had to decline.MJ Grill, soon to be Amici (110 John Street at Cliff Street, Financial District)Food: OkayService: FairAmbiance: OkayOverall: Okay

I've been meaning to visit Nebraska Steakhouse for a while now, as I live only ten minutes' walk away. The first trouble was that I couldn't find the place. Stone Street is in two segments, and I kept looking for it on the cobblestone segment between William St and Coenties Slip. Once you get to the other half of Stone St, Nebraska Beef is fairly conspicuous with its huge orange sign.The menu's signature item is simply called \"The Steak,\" a 32 oz bone-in ribeye dry-aged for 28 days that's about as thick as any ribeye I've seen in town. It's a wonderful piece of beef, and Nebraska cooks it expertly, with a deep char on the outside and a juicy medium rare interior. If the ribeye I enjoyed at Strip House was a 10, I give this one a 9. I was unable to finish it, but the steak made great leftovers the next night.I was impressed with the prices at Nebraska Steakhouse. That enormous ribeye is only $37.95 - obviously not a budget item, but there are plenty of steakhouses that would charge more. There's also a 7 oz filet on the menu for around $20, and if the quality is anywhere near the ribeye, it's a great deal for someone who doesn't want a huge steak.Even by steakhouse standards, the decor is of the Plain Jane variety, but service was friendly and efficient. They are open only on weeknights, as in that part of the Financial District there is hardly any foot traffic on weekends. On Wednesday evening, when I tried it, I think there were more people in the bar than were seated at the tables.There are four steakhouses in the area: MarkJoseph, Flames, Bobby Van's, and Nebraska. On this showing, Nebraska has the best ribeye of the bunch, while I prefer the strip at Flames. MarkJoseph has the superb Peter Luger-style Canadian Bacon and an excellent porterhouse. I'm not sure where Bobby Van's fits in, except that it's the most crowded of the bunch.I'm looking forward to another ten-minute trip to Nebraska.Nebraska Steakhouse (15 Stone Street between Broad and Whitehall Streets, Financial District)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

The Dining Room at Country

***CONTENT
Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Country.Like a number of upscale restaurants (Gramercy Tavern, Aquavit, Jean Georges, The Modern, BLT Fish), Geoffrey Zakarian's new restaurant Country has an upscale dining room attached to an informal sister establishment that offers a similar but less elaborate menu in humbler surroundings. My friend and I tried the Cafe at Country a few months ago, and we weren't impressed. It was loud, uncomfortable, and pretentious.But we knew that the main Dining Room was designed to offer a far more luxurious experience, so we were willing to entirely forget our unpleasant memory of the Cafe downstairs. I should add that, despite Frank Bruni's imprecise co-mingling of the two in his three-star review, the Dining Room and the Cafe should be thought of as entirely separate restaurants under one roof.Your choices in the Dining Room include an $85 four-course prix fixe, a five-course tasting menu at $110, and a seven-course tasting menu at $145. We were in a celebratory mood, and chose the seven-course tasting. Our server then asked us which dishes from the à la carte menu we wanted included - a flexibility I don't recall at any other restaurant that offered a tasting menu. We named four particular items that interested us. Our server advised that he would confer with the kitchen, and in fact all of our choices were included in the meal.I didn't take detailed notes, and the online menu is outdated, so I can describe our experience only in general terms. There was a trio of amuses to start, of which the most memorable was a gougère filled with spinach. Another amuse was a delectable miniature poultry leg (I'm not sure of which bird). Perhaps I am forgetting a third amuse course. Along the way, we received a melt-in-your-mouth parker house roll with soft butter.Our seven course meal consisted of the following:Foie gras terrineGrilled white asparagusShrimp ravioliCrisp Berkshire porkBison filetCheese course(Palate cleanser)Hot apple crisp(Petits fours)This was the best meal I have had in the last twelve months. While both Per Se and Alain Ducasse offered individual courses that were superior to anything at Country, each of them had at least one course that I rated-in relation to the price range-a disappointment. But there were no disappointments at Country, nor anything even remotely close to it. Just one outstanding preparation after another. We kept thinking, \"It can't last; there must be a dud.\" But there wasn't.Service was highly attentive and nearly impeccable. We were also impressed with the timing of the courses, which came neither too quickly nor too slowly. I would have liked a bit more time to relax after our cocktails, but as the overall meal was spaced over nearly three hours, I could hardly call it a rush job.The wine staff upsells a bit too aggressively. When we asked the sommelier for a bottle of red under $100, her recommendation (a wonderful burgundy) came in at $110. We could, of course, have refused, but I suspect she realized that we weren't going to quibble over $10. And when our foie gras arrived, we were asked if we'd like a glass of sauterne to go with it. (Even downstairs, the waitstaff on our previous visit had done the same.) With our still-unfinished cocktails and the just-opened burgundy already on the table, this would have been more alcohol than the table would bear, and we declined.The Dining Room was formerly the hotel ballroom. It retains the original beaux arts tile floor and a gorgeous tiffany skylight, and is open to the lobby below. The period details are wonderful, but as the hard tile floor reflects sound, the restaurant is just a touch noisier than I would like. Somewhat in compensation, the tables are generously spaced.It would take many more visits to determine whether Country is a four-star restaurant. But as I rate this one meal at least as highly as those I enjoyed at Alain Ducasse and Per Se, for now Country is four stars in my book.Country (90 Madison Ave at 29th St, in the Carleton Hotel, Flatiron District)Food: ****Service: ***½Ambiance: ***Overall: ****

Note: Click here for more visits to Keens Steakhouse. I returned to Keens last night with two companions who were eager to try an authentic New York steakhouse. I started with the House-Cured Salmon ($12.50), which was wonderful. Last time at Keens, I tried the mutton chop, which I loved. I'm sure I'll have it again someday, but in the interest of science, I wanted to sample something else. I would have chosen the porterhouse (available for 2 or 3 people), but my companions prefer filet to strip. So I ordered the T-bone ($42), while they ordered the Chateaubriand for two ($90). The T-bone was correctly prepared to the medium rare that I'd requested, although I like a crisp char on the exterior that is apparently not in Keens' repertoire. My companions declared the Chateaubriand \"best steak we've ever had.\" It was one of the largest hunks of beef I've ever seen on one plate. I tasted a bit of it, but their preference for well done steaks renders my opinion irrelevant, as I like to see blood on the plate. For dessert, we shared (but could not finish) an order of bread pudding, which was terrific, but more than we had room for.

There isn't a whole lot to say about Frederick's Madison, which a friend and I tried on Monday night. I agree with Frank Bruni's one-star verdict:Frederick's neither composes an interesting enough menu nor performs consistently enough to lure many diners with no other business in the East 60's.Yet Bruni was in a very different world when he wrote:Frederick's seems to exist in very large measure for people who want to feel, and want restaurants to make them feel, that they have reached the very apex of privilege. In that pampering clime they find an Upper East Side neighborhood bistro recast as an unabashedly expensive validation of their social and economic stations.Our take on the ambiance was so much different that I almost wonder if they've dumbed the place down since his review. We found Frederick's utterly forgettable - certainly no \"apex of privilege.\" And there was no $26 foie gras, nor any $42 veal chop on the menu (both of which Bruni mentioned).Frederick's is carb-happy. Two kinds of bread come to the table. A while later, there's a hot sliced bread with a garlic, olive oil and manchego cheese. About the best thing we sampled was a filet mignon tartar appetizer with dijon mustard ($14), which came with yet more bread (which I left alone). Sea scallops ($26) were about as boring as scallops could be. They came with an over-powering cauliflower puree and raisin sauce (I tasted no raisins). A Pot de Crème trio ($10) was a pleasant dessert.My companion had an Alaskin King Crab Legs cocktail ($15), Poached Snapper ($22) and Chocolate Tartufo ($10) that were just fine, but unremarkable.Frederick's Madison (768 Madison Avenue at 66th Street, Upper East Side)Food: SatisfactoryService: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: Satisfactory

Last weekend, I wanted to try a couple of the \"little sister\" restaurants of the city's fine dining rooms. After our food orgy at the Aquavit Cafe on Friday night, we proceeded to the Bar Room at The Modern on Saturday. The atmosphere here is far more raucous and lively than at the sedate Aquavit.It is located in the Museum of Modern Art, although there is a separate street entrance. The Bar Room has been a hit - Frank Bruni even suggests that it is more enjoyable than the fine dining room adjoining it - and there is the ever-so-slight hint that the staff know you're at they're mercy. However, I was pleased that they were willing to transfer our bar tab to our table, something that even much fancier restaurants will often refuse to do.The menu is in three columns, labeled One ($9-19), Two ($12-16), and Three ($15-19). Column One are the cold appetizers, Column Two are the hot appetizers, and Column Three are the entrees, which the menu says are half portions.We were still feeling over-fed from Aquavit the night before, so we ordered a bit less of chef Gabriel Kreuther's food than we might have had under other circumstances. My friend ordered the gnocchi and the Austrian pork sausage (both from Column Two). I ordered the Warm Veal & Goat Cheese Terrine (One) and Crispy Tuna (Three).I was struck by the complexity of both dishes I tried, and they were both terrific. I was also impressed with my friend's sausage. (I had only a bite of her gnocchi, not enough to form an impression.)Chef Kreuther's cuisine deserves a more serene environment than the frenetic Bar Room gives it, but service was generally acceptable, and the place is impressive when you consider it's the cafe attached to an art museum. If I lived in the neighborhood, I'd stop by often just for a plate or two. Just about everything on the menu looks appealing.Bar Room at The Modern (9 W. 53rd St. between Fifth & Sixth Aves, West Midtown)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Aquavit Cafe. It was less impressive the second time around. My friend and I dined at Aquavit Cafe last Friday night. As Frank Bruni noted in that day's paper, there are now several restaurants in New York that have an informal cafe attached to a fancy main dining room. I've tried several of these \"little sister\" restaurants, and the Aquavit Cafe is the most refined of them. Despite its comparative informality, tables are generously spaced, and there's plenty of fabric to deaden the sound. Service is top-notch.We started with cocktails (a bit pricey at $14 ea.), two kinds of Swedish bread with luscious goat cheese butter, and an amuse of toast with sour cream and a hot mushroom sauce.My friend ordered the Herring Sampler ($12), while I had the Salmon Sampler ($18), and we each sampled each other's plates. My friend observed that my appetizer had \"enough salmon to feed all of Chelsea.\" Okay, not quite, but it was a large portion. On days when I've had a full lunch, it could be dinner all by itself. But it is also perfectly prepared, and not at all \"fishy.\"Quite to our surprise, the kitchen sent out mid-course plates, compliments of the house. We aren't celebrities or regulars, and we weren't spending much on liquor, so this was most unexpected. My friend was served a lobster roll, while I got a plate of duck carpaccio.For the entrees, my friend had the Swedish meatballs ($18), one of chef Marcus Samuelson's specialties, made with beef, veal, and pork. It was an enormous portion, and even after I shared a bit of it, she was unable to finish. I ordered the hog smoked salmon, which was poached in wine, cauliflower, pearl onions and lentils. (I know, salmon twice - what was I thinking)? This was a bit bland, as I am wont to find with fish courses, but technically excellent. The kitchen recommends paired wines with each entree, and we adopted their excellent suggestions ($14 ea.).When my friend ordered, our waiter noted that her appetizer and entree choice were both on the prix fixe, so she might as well get that, and have dessert in the bargain. She had the Arctic Circle, a terrific goat cheese parfait with blueberry sorbet and passion fruit curd. Although I had not ordered dessert, the kitchen sent out a plate of chocolate cake for me anyway, compliments of the house.We left Aquavit happy as could be, stuffed to the gills, and eager to try the main dining room. The bill for all of that food was just $121 with tax. I left a 25% tip.Aquavit Cafe (65 E. 55th St. between Park & Madison Aves, East Midtown)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: ***

A friend and I went to Jarnac a couple of weeks ago, on a Saturday night. This is a casual French bistro in Greenwich Village, not far from the Meatpacking District.We both started with the Duck Rillettes ($10.25), which came in thin wrapped pastry dough and packed plenty of flavor punch. We then tried the Cassoulet-Braised Pork Cheeks ($24), with duck confit, pork sausage, great northern beans, tomato & garlic. It's a heavy meal, which neither of us was able to finish. The dish comes painfully hot, to a point that some of the flavor potential is cooked out of the ingredients. Your server provides an extra plate, along with the advice to spoon the cassoulet in stages onto the plate for cooling. It's a bit too much of a production, with the danger of a scorching burn if one miscalculates.Our table was comfortable, service was friendly, and we were pleased to find a reasonably priced wine list. In nice weather, be sure to get one of the window seats (which we had).Jarnac (328 W. 12th Street at Greenwich Street, West Village)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

i came across this review of the jarnac cassoulet by accident. As the chef/partner of jarnac since it opened, we never served the duck rillettes in \"thin wrapped pastry dough\". that's the first signal that you seem to be unware of what you were eating. second, the cassoulet is cooked for the time it takes for the dish to be hot! Sorry you didn't enjoy it but from the sound of your review you didn't know what you were ordering

Thanks for the comment, but I stand by the recollection. It could be that the server misinterpreted our request, and what was sent out was not what we ordered.As for the cassoulet, I can only compare it to the same dish served in other restaurants.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Craft.Craft is one of New York's iconic restaurants. The name \"Craft\" was suggested by chef Tom Colicchio's concept of preparing \"expert ingredients, expertly and simply.\" Colicchio adds that \"simple doesn't mean simplistic.\" It is, in other words, the \"craft\" of getting the simple things right. Trite, perhaps, but it has been a huge and much-imitated success. Craftbar in Manhattan and Craftsteak in Las Vegas are popular spin-offs, and a new branch of Craftsteak is opening on Tenth Avenue later this spring.As originally conceived, the name \"Craft\" also meant that the diner would design the meal, choosing from among a variety of ingredients, sauces, and cooking styles. It was probably the original restaurant where servers would begin with, \"Let me explain how our menu works.\" Colicchio soon found that diners weren't interested in quite so much freedom, and Craft's menu is no longer so complex. However, side dishes and accompaniments are still extra at Craft, as they've always been, and the bill can mount in a hurry.My friend and I had dinner at Craft a couple of weeks ago. We had a wonderful time, although we concluded that the restaurant is, perhaps, a touch overrated. We started with the foie gras terrine ($24) and the roasted quail ($14). Everything at Craft is served family style, and two appetizers are more than enough for two people. We were especially struck by the ample foie gras portion-two hefty discs that resembled slender hockey pucks. It was superb, to be sure, but required a little more of the wonderful toast that came with it. The quail, too, was excellent.We wondered whether a Côte de Boeuf, at $125, could possibly be worth it. Concluding that we weren't willing to spend that much to find out, we went with a more modest choice, the braised veal shank ($75), which is a portion for two. As one would expect for a braised meat, it fell off the bone at the touch of a fork, and was perfectly prepared. We ordered a side of the gnocchi ($10). Our waiter seemed aghast: \"Just one side?\" We stuck to our guns, and good thing too, because we were plenty full and were unable to finish the gnocchi, which was chewy and over-salted.The dessert menu is confusing. There are six sorbets and six ice creams listed. Below these, it reads: \"Ice Cream & Sorbet Sampler. 6./12.\" So, what do you get for $6, and what do you get for $12? When our server heard that we were both interested in the sampler, he advised, \"In that case, you can get one of each.\" We didn't ask him to specify what that meant. Promptly, $24 worth of ice cream and sorbet arrived, and there were full scoops of each flavor. One must assume that this was a greedy waiter who eagerly seized on an opportunity to pad the bill, as no one could sensibly believe that two people could polish off that much ice cream and sorbet. Indeed, a party of four most likely wouldn't have finished it.At Craft, wine selections under $50 are few and far between. We settled on a Cadence Coda 2003 at $60, which was terrific. Service was solid, aside from a couple of attempts at bill-padding. The ambiance is upscale, but casual. The tables are both large and well spaced. The final bill for two was $229 before tip.

Note: Almost two years after I wrote this review, Colors soldiers on, largely ignored in the restaurant press, and apparently no great success. A New York Times article last year suggested that it is struggling to survive. My award of a star was overly generous; the colleagues I dined with later said it was the worst restaurant recommendation I'd ever made.Colors is a restaurant you want to root for. It's a cooperative run by former employees of Windows on the World at the World Trade Center. According to the manifesto on the website: COLORS' mission is to build a worker-owned cooperative restaurant dedicated to food quality, service excellence and employee welfare.Chef Raymond Mohan and his kitchen team offer a global menu inspired by the diversity of the staff and their family recipes reinterpreted for New York diners. COLORS is committed to sustainable agriculture, purchasing locally grown foods and sourcing free trade vendors whenever possible. The winelist spotlights small wineries and producers from emerging regions, featuring great values from around the world.I dined at Colors on Wednesday evening with two colleagues. It is an attractive space, even if the international theme hits you over the head (you can't look anywhere without seeing a map). There are white tablecloths. The staff, in general, are highly professional and smartly dressed.The bread service was as good as, or better than, many three-star restaurants I've been to. The menu is a mongrel, with dishes composed from many cuisines and styles, and no recognizable theme uniting them. Among the entrees, for example, you'll find steak, goat curry, and a Japanese bento box. The offerings are said to be \"inspired by favorite family recipes\" (i.e., of the staff).To start, I ordered the Colors House Cured Duck Breast ($13). The menu says it's \"Citrus flavored, hardwood smoked, served on raisin bread with porcini jelly.\" The porcini jelly tasted more like a horseradish spread. The duck, an ample portion for an appetizer, came stacked on three small slices of bread. It was a little unwieldy to pick up and eat, but the rewards were ample.One of my colleagues had an oyster appetizer that looked wonderful, while the other had a tuna appetizer that he described as \"okay.\" He didn't finish it, so I would guess his response fell well short of rapture.None of the entrees really caught our fancy, so all three of us wimped out, and ordered the NY Strip (around $33). It came with chimichurri sauce, potato confit, watercress and blue cheese salad-or so the menu said; I couldn't really detect any blue cheese. The online menu shows a \"Grass-Fed Ribeye,\" and I don't know why it's been replaced. It's hard to go seriously wrong with a steak, but at such a restaurant the strip is predictably going to fall short of what the better steakhouses have to offer.The restaurant was nowhere near full. I suspect they are hanging on for dear life. There have been no professional reviews yet, aside from Frank Bruni's Diner's Journal preview right after the place opened. I suspect the critics are giving Colors a bit more time to get its act together-a kindness extended to a restaurant one desperately wants to succeed. Rather than deliver a potential death blow with lukewarm reviews, it seems the critics have steered clear, a courtesy they wouldn't extend to most other restaurants.Colors offers a pleasant experience in comfortable surroundings, but I won't rush back.Colors (417 Lafayette St. between Astor Place & E. 4th St., NoHo) Food: *Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: *

These days, Democrats are giddy about their chances to re-take one or both houses of Congress.Cool-headed analyst Charlie Cook has been saying: \"Not So Fast.\" At first blush, the \"macro\" conditions, as Cook describes them, seem to favor the Democrats. Cook is referring to the generic \"right track/wrong track\" and presidential job performance polls that we see almost every week. For instance, in the spring 1994, the year of the political tsunami that swept the Democrats out of power in Congress, 47% of Americans said the country was on the wrong track vs. 33% on the right track, a 14% gap. This year, according to one poll, the gap is 36% (26% \"right track\" vs. 62% \"wrong track\").But ironically, while people seem overwhelmingly to favor Democrats in a \"generic ballot,\" when voters get into the booth they tend to re-elect incumbents. One must also bear in mind that the quirks of our system give less populous states disproportionate representation in Congress, and Republicans are lucky enough to control many of those states.When you look at the \"micro\" conditions (as Cook puts it), Republicans look like they're still in pretty good shape. To seize control of the Senate, Democrats need a net gain of six seats. Cook identifies six races in which the Republicans are somewhat vulnerable, but Democrats would need to run the table while losing none of the seats they already control. While theoretically possible, it seems unlikely.Democrats' chances in the House are a bit better, since all 435 seats are up for re-election, but Cook concludes that only 36 are \"truly in play.\" The Democrats need a net gain of 15 seats, but as Cook observes:Meanwhile, despite their herculean efforts, Democratic recruiters have enticed few first-tier challengers into running this year. Instead, the party has an abundance of second- and third-tier candidates who could never prevail on their own and would need a hurricane-force wind at their backs to cross the finish line first.Without another scandal or a few more serious gaffes by President Bush, it looks like the Republicans will hold onto at least one house of Congress, and probably both, although the Democrats appear certain to narrow the GOP majority.Although no Democrat will publicly admit this, it is actually to the Democrats' benefit if they just narrowly fail to re-take Congress this year. Without a friendly ally in the White House, there isn't much that a Democratic majority in Congress could do. The most likely outcome is two years of gridlock, and in 2008 both parties would be able to blame the other for the lack of progress.In contrast, if the Republicans hold Congress through the remainder of the Bush presidency, in 2008 the Democrats will have a clear shot at retaking Washington, with Republicans being held clearly accountable for the current state of things.

Cafeteria is open 24 hours a day. It's perfectly suited to clubland exiles who need a place to get over their 4am hangovers. A branch in Miami Beach no doubt appeals to the same type of crowd. But for Sunday brunch, which my friend and I tried yesterday, you can do a lot better.Cafeteria isn't a cafeteria. It's a restaurant with sit-down service. Perhaps I should put 'service' in quotes, because there wasn't much of it. The milk to go with our too-strong coffee was served in a sugar bowl. You can imagine the mess when we poured it. Omelets took about 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen. (To that, add the 25 minutes we waited for a table.) Each omelet came with just a single slice of toast. We had to ask for butter.The omelets were fine: nice and fluffy, with goat cheese and mushrooms (we both ordered the same). But nothing to rush back for.Cafeteria (119 Seventh Avenue at 17th Street, Chelsea)Food: SatisfactoryService: PoorAmbiance: FairOverall: Fair

My friend and I had dinner at Telepan on Saturday evening. The restaurant is named for Bill Telepan, who was formerly the chef at Judson Grill, which has since closed. Telepan has received favorable buzz, including a two-star review from Bruni (and some thought it was a contender for three). Certainly the addition of another serious restaurant near Lincoln Center is a welcome development. But we were underwhelmed.The menu seems designed to bump up the final bill, with savory courses in three categories (appetizers, \"mid-courses\" and entrees), instead of the usual two. If you order à la carte, the appetizers are $9.50-$16.00, the mid-courses are $15.50-$26.00, and the entrees are $23.00-$36.00. Desserts are $9.00-12.00, cheese plates $12.50-14.00.We were naturally enticed to choose the four-course prix fixe at $55, which allowed us to choose one savory course from each heading, plus a dessert. Wine pairings would have been another $32 apiece, which seemed a little dear, so we went for a single bottle at $48. For the record, there's also a five-course prix fixe at $65, or $105 with wine pairings, which adds a cheese course to the mix.The website tells you very little, except that Bill Telepan is \"so excited about the opening of...my new restaurant.\" There's no menu posted, though fortunately it is on menupages, and I was able to refresh my memory as to the details. However, I cannot tell you the amuses bouches, except that there were three of them, described by an incomprehensible server with halting English. One of them was a gougère, the second a small piece of melba toast that you dipped in something or other, the third a small cup of soup with mystery ingredients.After that, I had with Marinated Quail with Apple-duck Sausage, while my friend had the Foie Gras Terrine. Both of these were pretty good, if not outstanding. Ordered on their own, these two dishes would have been $13.50 and $19.00 respectively.For the second course, I had something called \"Eggs in a Hole,\" which was a single fried egg (not eggs, as the caption implied) on top of a small piece of soggy toast, with an even smaller strip of smoked salmon and herb-caper sauce on the side. Telepan gets an A for Dufresne-like creativity, but what was the point? My friend's mid-course was even more peculiar: Roasted Cauliflower, with herb oil, crushed heirloom shell beans and winter greens. It was over-cooked. Ordered on their own, the cauliflower dish would have been $15.50, the egg/salmon mix $16.00.My entree was Seared Duck Breast and Foie Gras Custard, but for the life of me I could taste no foie gras on the plate, and the portion was awfully meager for a main course. My friend ordered the Roasted Sirloin, which came with oxtail glaze, gold nugget potatoes, roasted vegetables and horseradish. Those vegetables were, again, over-cooked. Ordered separately, our main courses would have been $29.50 and $36.00 respectively.For dessert, we both chose the Banana Cake Sundae, with bananas foster, banana ice cream and sugared walnuts ($9 on its own). It was both unexceptionable and unmemorable.We found the decor rather dull, and the artwork bordered on tasteless-the kind of ugly stuff you'd buy at a suburban shopping mall. However, tables were amply spaced, and service was in line with what you expect at an upscale restaurant. We sense the possibility that Telepan could be excellent someday. All of the dishes show a considerable amount of thought, but the execution leaves much to be desired. Many of the portions are both too small and too expensive.

I wish I had read this review before I wasted $200. It was very disappointing. We opted for the \"full\" portions because the difference based on what we wanted was only $5 when compared to the prix fixe.First-Class airline food was the overall impression.I can only hope that the chef was otherwise engaged preparing for his appearance on \"Regis & Kelly\" the following morning.

We ate here last month (I was listening to Regis this morning and he went to Telepan for lunch yesterday, so it reminded me of my dining experience) and we enjoyed it very much. I actually would book another trip to New York to eat here again. I love that they use fresh in-season produce to create the menu. While we were there, the peas were in season and everything from the amuse to the soup to the pea pancakes were fantastic. We also order the lobster bolognese which was incredible.

Couldn't agree more, there is no way to get out there for under $200 and the portions, wow, very small for an entree about sums it up. I actually really enjoyed the food but $200+ for a meal I pretty much could make myself was a bit rich.

Note: This is a review of 5 Ninth under chef Zak Pelaccio, who has since severed his ties with the restaurant. As of February 2009, Kevin Pomplun (a former Kurt Gutenbrunner deputy) is running the kitchen. My friend and I had dinner at 5 Ninth last Friday evening. The restaurant was running a bit late, and our 9:00pm reservation was honored at more like 9:20. Some of the silly service quirks remain from my last visit, such as serving bread without bread plates. This seems so elementary that it defies belief they haven't thought of it. On the other hand, the wine list is to the restaurant's credit. We had no trouble identifying a very pleasing red for around $27, where one would much more commonly pay something in the 40's at a restaurant in this price range. We both started with the Berkshire Pork Belly in a garlic chilli paste. It was four gorgeous hunks of pure fat, which is of course the tastiest part of the animal, so we found it wonderful. Anything after that was bound to seem bland. My friend had the hangar steak, and I had a baramundi (one of the day's market specials). The baramundi had a nice crisp exterior, but it was totally unmemorable after the pork belly. I didn't note the prices of individual items (and they aren't shown on the website), but the total for two, with tax and tip, was a very reasonable $127.36. 5 Ninth (5 Ninth Avenue between Gansevoort & Little West 12th Streets, Meatpacking District) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *

Strip House is the witty name of a steakhouse in the Village. It faintly suggests a house of ill repute, and it comes dressed for the part with its ruby-red decor. It also suggests a cut of meat, which is Strip House's real point.The owners, Glazier Group, run a chain of restaurants, including two other Strip Houses (New Jersey, Houston) and two other steakhouses in New York (Monkey Bar & Michael Jordan's). Monkey Bar is an enjoyable place, attractively priced for a steakhouse. I've never been to Michael Jordan's (inside Grand Central Terminal), but several reviews have suggested that it's surprisingly good for a restaurant named for a celebrity and located in a train station.Strip House is the group's flagship. I paid a visit last night on the advice of blogger Augieland, who pronounced their bone-in ribeye ($42) his \"favorite steak in Manhattan.\" I'd been there once before and ordered the NY Strip, which was okay without being memorable. But Augieland is right about the ribeye. It's a wonderful hunk of meat, with high fat content and a crisp char on the outside. I tried the identical cut of beef at Bobby Van's the other night, and while it wasn't bad, it lacked the perfection of Strip House's version.Best steak in New York? It's hard to say, when there are so many of them. But I don't recall offhand having tasted a ribeye better than this one. (Wolfgang's came close, but I think this one was superior.) It was preceded by an amuse bouche of warm potato soup with parsley oil in a shot glass. The restaurant was packed on a Thursday evening, but I had no trouble getting served at the bar, where service was friendly and efficient.While I was eating, a couple next to me saw what I had ordered, and raved about the Strip House ribeye. The gentleman told me that the March 2006 issue of GQ named Strip House one of the five best steakhouses in America. (I couldn't find an online version of the full article, so I can't say which four other steakhouses were so honored.) Visit the Glazier Group homepage, and you'll see they're crowing about it. The company has announced plans to open Strip Houses in several other cities. Lucky for them.Strip House (13 E. 12th St between 5th Ave & University Place, Greenwich Village)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: **

Ground Zero Plan Breaks Down

***CONTENT
It has been a while since I posted a commentary on the status of rebuilding at Ground Zero. This week's collapse of negotiations between developer Larry Silverstein, the Port Authority, and Governor Pataki's office, provides a timely backdrop for an update.Contrary to the most dire pronouncements, there is a lot going on around Ground Zero.The big transportation projects are on or close to schedule, including the new Path Terminal, the Fulton Street Transit Center, and the new South Ferry terminal.The new 7 World Trade Center is set to open in May. It is a far classier building than the structure it replaced.Construction of the Memorial, Reflecting Absence, has begun.Demolition of the Deutsche Bank building has begun.Across the street from the Ground Zero, the investment firm Goldman Sachs is building a new headquarters, making them the largest and most prominent firm since the attacks to make a significant commitment to Lower Manhattan.These projects have all had their problems, and most have taken a lot longer to materialize than the planners' rosy forecasts led us to expect. Still, they offer evidence of real progress.Against all of this are two huge failures. Almost 4½ years after 9/11, none of the five office buildings that are supposed to replace the original Twin Towers have started construction. And the cultural program for the site is all but dead.It seems like forever since architect Daniel Liebeskind was selected from a group of nine finalists to supervise the overall plan for the site. Current plans, even if they are all realized, bear very little resemblance to Liebeskind's original winning design. Indeed, the Freedom Tower, a symbolic 1,776 feet tall, is about the only recognizable idea of his that remains. Liebeskind is still the site's nominal \"master planner,\" whatever that means. Every once in a while, he comes out of the woodwork and makes a comment or two. What he is being paid to do is a mystery to me.We're in this mess because developer Larry Silverstein's lease, which he signed just six weeks before the 9/11 attacks, requires him to replace the 10,000,000 sq. ft. of office space that was destroyed. Moreover, Silverstein is paying rent to the Port Authority, to the tune of about $120 million a year, while receiving no income from the site. Naturally, and for entirely understandable reasons, Silverstein wants to get going, so that he can start attracting tenants.Unfortunately, there is no demand for so much office space at Ground Zero. Silverstein can't even fill 7 World Trade Center. And what's making it worse is that the first building in line, the Freedom Tower, is a white elephant. It's too far from mass transit, its floor plate is too small, its design (altered to accommodate security concerns) is ugly, and commercial tenants fear it will be a terrorist target.About the only people who are still enthusiastic about the Freedom Tower are public officials, such as Governor Pataki, who've invested political capital in the structure, and who view it as a symbol of resiliance and rebirth. Symbols are great, but a skyscraper that will cost $2 billion to build, and that no tenant wants to occupy, is a peculiar way to celebrate the return of commerce to Ground Zero. At the moment, only a handful of government offices have committed to occupy the Freedom Tower, and there certainly wouldn't be enough of them to come close to filling it.Everyone agrees that Larry Silverstein's insurance proceeds and government sponsored Liberty Bonds won't suffice to fund all five towers in the site plan. It might be enough to build two of out of the five. Silverstein says that rental income from the first couple of towers would provide the revenue stream to fund the rest. Others say that this is a pipe dream, especially when the Freedom Tower is so profoundly unmarketable. The planners' great fear is that Silverstein runs out of cash in the middle of construction, defaults on his lease, and leaves most of the site vacant for years to come.Governor Pataki had set Tuesday at midnight as the deadline for Silverstein and the Port Authority to resolve their differences over the site, with some $3.35 billion in Liberty Bonds hanging in the balance. Pataki and Mayor Bloomberg don't want Silverstein to get the bonds until they are convinced he can really build what he's promised. The two sides were close to an agreement whereby the Port Authority would build the Freedom Tower and one other tower on the Deutsche Bank site, and Silverstein would build the three most lucrative office towers along Church Street. The deal broke down over how to allocate the costs. The Port Authority said that the parties were about $1 billion apart, which needless to say is a significant figure.The site's cultural program is in even more of a shambles. Liebeskind's site plan called for two buildings that would be devoted to cultural institutions. After a lengthy selection process, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation selected four institutions: the Freedom Center, the Drawing Center, the Joyce Dance Center, and the Signature Theater. In an embarrassing reversal, the Freedom Center and the Drawing Center were booted out, because it was feared their programming would clash with the site's patriotic zeitgeist. The LMDC has committed $10 million to find the Drawing Center another home downtown. The Freedom Center, which never existed except on paper, closed up shop for good. The Joyce and Signature companies remain nominally committed to the site, but there doesn't seem to be a penny of funding for the Frank Gehry-designed theater they would occupy. If the theater manages to get built, one wonders if the programming would come under the same kind of narrow-minded pressure that eventually forced out the Drawing Center and Freedom Center.The solutions to these problems are far from clear. The Freedom Tower-so symbolic, but so impractical-seems to be a colossal mistake. Yet, erasing it from the site plan would be a huge political embarrassment, especially for Gov. Pataki, whose long-shot presidential ambitions could be damaged if there is no visible progress by the time he leaves office next January. All of the parties seem to be boxed in by legal and/or moral commitments they've made to a site plan that increasingly makes little to no economic sense. The right answer, which no one wants to hear, is to send the original architect, Daniel Liebeskind, on his way, and re-think the whole mess.

A friend and I had a pre-concert dinner at Ouest last Saturday night. I had been there twice before-another occasion before an event at Lincoln Center (loved it), and two New Year's Eves ago (underwhelmed).This visit was more like the first time I went. I started with the Salmon Gravlax with Chickpea Pancake Caviar & Mustard Oil ($14). This was an excellent hunk of smoked salmon with just a dash of caviar, but then, how many $14 dishes have any caviar at all? It was terrific. My friend had an off-menu potato gnocchi dish, which she liked.We both had the Braised Beef Short Ribs with Israeli Cous Cous, Spring Onion & Shiitake ($32). This was one of the larger short rib portions I've seen, and also one of the cleverest. After braising, the short ribs were apparently put on the grill for finishing, as they had obvious 'lines' where the meat had been charred. The dish offered the best of both worlds: braising first (for tenderness), grilling afterwards (for flavor). Forget about the short ribs at Cafe Gray. This dish is the ticket.Ouest doesn't try to be formal, but the service was solid, and the food a lot more enjoyable than many restaurants at its price point. I'll be back...just as long as it's not New Year's Eve.Ouest (2315 Broadway between 83 & 84th Streets, Upper West Side)Food: **½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

I've never ordered a tasting menu that didn't have at least one dud-even at Per Se. That changed on Saturday evening, when my friend and I ordered the five-course tasting at Tabla. This was a culinary exercise in near-perfection, from beginning to end.Tabla is a bit difficult to characterize. Downstairs, there is a \"bread bar\" that serves conventional Indian food. The main restaurant borrows ideas from many cuisines, with only the slightest hint of Indian spices. (The Michelin Guide was thoroughly stumped; they branded the cuisine \"Contemporary,\" the same pigeon-hole as Alain Ducasse.)Tabla offers three dinner options: a prix fixe at $64 (you choose one appetizer, one entree, and one dessert from a fairly long list of choices); a five-course winter tasting menu at $79 (optional wine pairing, $38); or, an eight-course market tasting menu at $92 (optional wine pairing, $48).We chose the five-course winter tasting menu with the wine pairings, which included the following:Sweet Maine Shrimp & Fluke CruLime, Cider & Toasted SpicesChampagne Brut Reserve, Biillecart Salmon (Mareuil-Sur-Ay, France) NVRice Flaked TurbotBaby Spinach, Applewood Smoked Bacon and Jaggery-Tamarind GlazeSemillon, The Willows Vinyard (Barossa Valey, Australia) 2002Slow Roasted Nova Scotia LobsterYellowfoot chanterelles, Water Chestnuts & WalnutsViura, Cune, Blanco Seco Monopole (Rioja, Spain) 2002Challan Duck Two WaysBraised Endive, Horseradish, Orange CurryChiraz, 3-Rings (Barossa Valley, Australia) 2004Apple Tarte TatinGreenmarket Quince Membrillo, Mutsu Apple FritterGewürtztraminer, Kent Rasmussen Late Harvest (Sonoma County, CA) 2003Petits Fours, Coffee and Tabla's Teas(The above is from Tabla's website, which appears to be up-to-date. I cannot swear that we had those exact wines, but I believe we did.)The first course (Sweet Maine Shrimp & Fluke Cru) was a daring winter choice, as it was served cold. However, it worked in the context of the overall meal. The Rice Flaked Turbot was one of the top fish courses I've had anywhere. The duck was tender and hearty. If I had to deduct a half-point, it would be for the lobster, which was ever so slightly tough.I was particularly impressed by the wine pairing. The wines were all a bit off the beaten path, but went perfectly with the food. And we had five glasses of well contrasted wines for $38. It has got to be one of the better deals around.The layout at Tabla is a bit unusual. The fine dining restaurant is upstairs, but it is partly open to the floor below, and some of the sound from the bar drifts into the dining space. There is an attempt at elegance, and the tables are generously spaced, but I found it a bit chilly-and not only metaphorically; I regretted not bringing a sweater.There is no flaw in the service, however, which is polished and efficient. Overall, this was one of the finest meals I have had in New York over the past year.Tabla (11 Madison Avenue at 25th Street, Flatiron District)Food: ***½Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: ***

Note: This is a review of 'Cesca under Tom Valenti, who shortly thereafter severed his ties to the restaurant to focus on his other Upper West Side property, Ouest. Frank Bruni paid a visit to 'Cesca in October 2007 under the new chef, Kevin Garcia, and liked what he saw.My friend and I had dinner at 'Cesca a couple of Fridays ago. I was sporting a 101-degree fever and wasn't in the mood for fine dining, but we had an opera to catch, so there we were.'Cesca was a hit pretty much immediately after it opened in late 2003. Along with its sister restaurant Ouest, 'Cesca marked the arrival of fine dining in a neighborhood that had had precious little to choose from. Poor William Grimes, in his two-star review for the Times, complained that he could only get 5:30pm reservations. That's still true, by the way. Our reservation was at 5:30 for an 8:00 opera-earlier than I would normally choose, but nothing later was available.The decor is warm, comfortable, and welcoming. There seem to be enough soft surfaces to catch the sound, and prevent 'Cesca from becoming an echo chamber-like so many other contemporary restaurants. In the middle of the night, I wouldn't mind tearing down some of the velvet curtains and transporting them to BLT Fish.I had the cauliflower soup (a daily special) and a wonderful duck ravioli. It's not the restaurant's fault that I didn't finish them, but I just wasn't up to it that day. My friend had a tomato and mozarella salad, followed by a huge veal chop (also a daily special), which she pronounced a huge improvement over one she had recently at Cookshop.We had only one complaint. My friend ordered a side dish of mashed potatoes, only to find that her entree already came with potatoes. She said, \"There are enough potatoes here to feed the whole Upper West Side.\" (That side dish was a huge helping, which even two people might have trouble finishing.) A server really should tell you that the entree you've ordered already comes with a generous helping of vegetables.I really was out-of-it for this meal, but we'll definitely return-if we can get a reservation, that is.

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Perry St.I visited Perry St. with two friends a couple of weeks ago.Perry St.'s very existence speaks volumes about the evolution of this part of town. Twenty years ago, the idea of a fine dining destination on West Street would have been madness. This part of town had evolved to serve the shipping industry, with factories and warehouses girdling Manhattan to serve piers on the Hudson River. The shipping trade eventually found more commodious digs, leaving the West Side Highway derelict-useless for any purpose except as a transportation artery. It's hard to think of another metropolis that had so thoroughly squandered its coastline.But West Street is gradually making a comeback, and the two luxurious Richard Meier-designed apartment buildings in the Far West Village are part of the area's long-overdue return to respectability. Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who owns Perry St., lives in the same building as the restaurant itself. One must doubt how often Vongerichten darkens its door now that a three-star review from the Times has been secured, but its proximity to the place where he sleeps probably offers an incentive for him to stop by a bit more often than he visits the other restaurants in his far-flung empire.Perry St. is cool, quiet, and elegant. There are some nods to informality (e.g., the paper placemats and the lack of tablecloths), but it is still one of the more refined dining experiences you can have in this part of town. The lounge and bar area are both large and extremely comfortable, and they serve the full menu. The dining room posts a panoramic view of the Hudson River and the New Jersey skyline. It is an especially attractive view at sundown.My review comes with a significant caveat. Earlier in the day of my visit, I came down with a high fever. I had already cancelled my dinner with these friends on an earlier occasion, so I was determined to keep the date. However, I was frankly miserable, for reasons having nothing to do with the food or the service.I tried the chicken soup ($10.50), which Ed Levine praised in a recent Times article: In the best chicken soups, the meat is added at the end of the cooking process. At Perry St., the sous-chef, Paul Eschbach, actually cooks the chicken sous vide (by vacuum-sealing it in a plastic pouch and cooking it in a water bath) separately with dill, butter, salt and pepper, and then puts it in the soup at the last second.The chicken broth was actually added tableside. The soup bowl contained an array of fresh vegetables (carrots, radishes, greens), and the server poured the broth on top of that. The soup was fresh and tangy.At Perry St., the menu is spare: just eight appetizers and eight entrees are offered. Our server advised that only two of the entrees have been on the menu since the place opened. One of those is the crunchy rabbit ($31), which Frank Bruni had liked, so I gave it a try. It looked like a wrap sandwich, but was warm with a crisp breading on the exterior with a splash of avocado puree on the side. Here too, a broth was added tableside. I finished only half of it, due to my fever. Two different staff members asked if there was any problem with it. There wasn't; I just wasn't up to finishing.My only significant complaint is the bread service. There is wonderful, fresh butter at the table, but the bread rolls tasted like they were baked eighteen hours ago. At its price point, Perry St. needs to do a better job with the bread.We didn't drink (except that I had a cocktail to start). The total was about $150 for three, before tip.Perry St (176 Perry Street at West Street, Far West Village)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: ***

Note: La Goulue will be closing on June 24, 2009, after losing its lease. When the 2006 New York Michelin Guide came out, many of the usual suspects received the coveted stars. But there were a handful that came as a surprise, and La Goulue was one of these. Once known primarily as a people-watching destination, La Goulue seemed about as likely to be honored with a Michelin star as Tavern on the Green or Cafe des Artistes. The restaurant opened on East 70th Street in 1972 and moved to its present Madison Avenue address in 1993. In 1994, Ruth Reichl gave La Goulue zero stars (\"Satisfactory\") in the New York Times: La Goulue is a club; there are no dues and no secret handshakes, but its members know who they are. Interlopers are quickly put in their place. Reservation for Jane Doe? \"I don't seem to have that,\" the hostess has told me on three of my four visits. .................. Salmon with green tea and truffles sounded like a nice idea.... But that dish was a joy compared with the risotto of blue prawns. The night I had it the prawns were so mealy I could not swallow them, and the risotto was just a bed of soggy rice. I wondered how I was going to explain the fact that I had eaten no more than a bite, but I need not have worried. Nobody asked any questions. This should not be a surprise. Few people go to La Goulue for the food. It is one of New York's best addresses for people-watching and for that alone may be worth the price of admission. There hasn't been a rated review in the Times since then, although by 1998 Reichl had evidently mellowed a bit-but only a bit: \"Le Tout Paris descends on La Goulue when visiting New York City. Chic, attractive and expensive, this is one of those upscale bistros that tastes much better if you speak French.\" La Goulue's chef in 1994 was one Jacky Pluton. Today, it is Antoine Camin. Service, too, has improved, perhaps because La Goulue is no longer in such high demand. I had no trouble scoring a 7:30pm reservation on OpenTable, which was cheerfully honored. Service was superb. My companion called our server \"the best waiter ever,\" a tribute to his attentiveness and cheerful disposition. La Goulue doesn't have its own website; its URL redirects to a site called \"iseatz.com.\" The text pays homage to the restaurant's days as a celebrity dining spot: \"Recent guests of La Goulue have been Stanley Tucci, Ashley Judd, Rod Stewart, Jude Law, Rene Russo, Bruce Springstein, Giorgio Armani and LeeLee Sobieski.\" Further down: \"The lunch crowd at La Goulue is a mixture of business men and women looking for a low-key, fun atmosphere to dine, and young, hip, upper-east side lunching ladies. La Goulue also entertains politicians, writers, actors and actresses, and European tourists staying at some of the many swanky boutique hotels nearby.\" And so forth. But if the Michelin inspectors know anything, they surely know French food, and here La Goulue excels. To start, I had a homemade chicken & pork sausage (Boudin Blanc, $12.50 on the bill), while my friend had the crab meat salad ($14.50), both excellent. We each had the John Dory entree ($30.50), a hearty cylinder of fish atop a crisp mushroom tart. For dessert, my friend had the chocolate tart ($9), which she found a bit too salty. My dessert was called \"Oeuf à la Neige\", which was translated as \"Floating Island\" ($9). I guessed that it would be a kind of egg cream custard, which was about right, and it was superbly executed. The restaurant boasts an excellent wine list, or so I'm told, but when I asked for wines by the glass, our server recited them, rather than providing a list. I settled for a glass of sancerre ($11.95), which proved to be an excellent recommendation. The decor at La Goulue gives every indication of being an authentic Parisian transplant. The website boasts: \"Burnished wood panels, century-old mirrors, yellow, nicotine-tinged, pressed-tin ceilings and brass luggage racks enhance the intimate bistro's ageless ambience. Many of the lighted wall sconces are extremely rare and are signed by the French glassmaker Majorelle.\" I found the chairs not particularly comfortable, however. All of the staff are French, although they have none of the stereotype French stuffiness. The menu items are all written in French, with English translations. It appears that the menu is updated often; the copies we were provided were dated late January. La Goulue isn't cheap, with many appetizers in the $20-30 range, and most entrees over $30. But for authentic French comfort cuisine, I haven't found better in New York. It's high time for La Goulue to put its menu on the website, instead of talking about all the beautiful people who dine there. It really is about the food.

***CONTENT
After admiring Per Se from a distance for the last two years, I finally had dinner there on Wednesday evening with two colleagues and a vendor, who was paying.I was first to arrive. Three hosts stood guard at the door to ask which party I was with. They were as friendly as could be, but their purpose was plain enough: curiosity-seekers who just want to come in and have a look aren't welcome. They took my coat without providing a claim check; when we were ready to leave, they had our coats in hand, without even having to ask who we were. Alain Ducasse and Gilt are the only other restaurants where I've experienced such efficiency.As I was early, I relaxed in the comfortable lounge and ordered a cocktail. My colleagues arrived a short while later, and we were ushered into the elegant main dining room. Some people find the Adam Tihany-designed space a little chilly, but its warm elegance grew on me. The view across Columbus Circle and Central Park's southwest corner is wonderful at night.Your choices at Per Se are simple: the seven-course tasting menu, the nine-course chef's tasting menu, or the vegetable tasting-all at $210 (service included). The seven-course tasting offers a couple of options, the nine-course tasting just one option (foie gras or salad), the vegetable tasting none at all. So, while these menus do change frequently, on any given evening the kitchen's life is a lot more predictable than at other luxury restaurants.I was not surprised that all of us selected the chef's tasting menu with the foie gras option ($30 supplement). The printed menu offered a foie gras terrine, but our server told us that we could substitute seared foie gras if we preferred, which two of us did. After our host selected bottled water and a red wine, we were done making decisions, and it was time for the parade of food.At Per Se, people walk in every day asking to see a copy of the menu. At some point, the management obviously got tired of this, so they erected a stand outside of the main entrance, where copies of the three menus are there for the taking. Nowadays, curiosity-seekers need not enter Per Se's hallowed doors just to get a copy of the menu. I had meant to take an extra copy as I left, as a memento of the evening. When I got home, I realized I'd taken a copy of the vegetable tasting menu instead. (That's how tired I was.) So unfortunately, I don't have a complete record of everything we had.As it has been from the day Per Se opened, the amuse bouche was the salmon cone, and the first course was \"oysters and pearls\" (pearl tapioca with oysters and caviar). It's no surprise that Per Se keeps serving these dishes, as they are superb. Meanwhile, we were offered a choice of house-made breads, along with two butters that come from a farm with just five cows that sells only to Per Se and the French Laundry.Although foie gras is a standard second course at Per Se, it has been offered in a variety of preparations. As I mentioned above, I chose the seared foie gras, which came in a large portion that melted in the mouth. Greater perfection could not be imagined.Third was a fish course that was very good, but I have forgotten what it was. Then came the lobster cuit sous vide that some people have found underwhelming. I had no such complaints with the preparation, but it was awkward to cut into pieces with the fish knives we were given. Serrated knives would have been the way to go.Next came duck breast, which I found mildly uninteresting for a restaurant of this calibre. Calotte de boeuf grillee (basically a slice of ribeye steak) was beautifully done.The cheese and dessert courses were excellent, although I have forgotten the details. We concluded with the house-made mignardises, of which I could have had many more. We were sent home with a cellophane bag of cookies. (The coffee cake that Compass leaves you with is better.)At Alain Ducasse, which I also visited recently, I had two courses that were absolutely transcendent, and which I will remember for a long time to come: the blue foot chicken and the \"baba\" rum dessert. Only one dish at Per Se reached this level - the \"oysters and pearls,\" which was gone in about sixty seconds (it was only a taste). If Per Se deserves four stars, it is for sustained excellence over the course of such a long menu, rather than for a particular extraordinary dish.The service was, of course, at the highest level-seamless, polished, and expert.Per Se (10 Columbus Circle, in the Time-Warner Center, 4th floor)Food: ****Service: **** Ambiance: ****Overall: ****

Oceana on Valentine's Day

Note: After this review was written, Executive Chef Cornelius Gallagher left Oceana. Ben Pollinger replaced him. The restaurant plans to move to the McGraw-Hill Building in Rockefeller Center after its current lease expires in July 2009. Gray Kunz is said to be eyeing the space, possibly for a re-launch of Cafe Gray, which will be closing in the Time-Warner Center in June 2008.I am mindful of restaurants' tendency to over-charge and under-perform on special occasions. (Picholine on New Year's Eve was my latest experience of that kind.) At the venerable seafood palace Oceana on Valentine's Day I am happy to say that we were not disappointed, although I suspect it is possible to have a better meal there than we had.For Valentine's Day, Oceana pared its cuisine down to a six-course tasting menu priced at $125:Smoked Cod ChowderVirginia Ham, New Potatoes, Pepperjack CheeseCrisp Iceberg LettuceMarinated Vegetables and Bacon-Buttermilk DressingDuck and Pistachio TerrineFrisee, Cornichon, Mustard and an Apple-Onion MarmaladeSteamed HalibutSpaghetti Squash, Edamame, Lotus Nuts, Kaffir Fish TeaLoup de Mer in an Almond Tea CrustBaby Bok Choy and a Jura Wine Emulsion orShort Rib of Beef Braised in Red WineWinter Vegetables, Fingerling Potatoes Garlic-Herb Beef JusValentine's Day Dessert SamplerSarsaparilla Ice Cream Soda, Banana Strudel,Warm Chocolate Tart, Blood Orange SorbetYou'll note that the only decision for the diner was Loup de Mer or Short Ribs for the fifth course. (Anyone who'd come to Oceana and order short ribs needs to have his head examined.) I do realize the need for restaurants to simplify on such a busy night, but I think a professional kitchen could offer more variety than that.The smoked cod chowder, the duck & pistachio terrine, and the loup de mer-a house specialty-were all superb. I especially would have liked more of the cod chowder and the loup de mer. That's always the drawback of a tasting menu: no matter how good a dish may be, it's gone in a few bites.My friend wasn't fond of the iceberg lettuce salad, although I thought it was just fine, if unmemorable. For me, the low point was the steamed halibut, which was dry and had left all of its taste in the poaching pan.The desserts were first-rate. I could have done without the sarsaparilla ice cream soda (basically melted ice cream that you sipped with a straw), but I can't complain about one dud when they give you a four-item sampler.Paired wines would have been another $100 a person. Here my rip-off alert went into high gear. For well under that figure, one can select a superb white from Oceana's long wine list, and come home with cash to spare. Oceana also has a fine selection of half-bottles, and you could even sample a few of those without spending as much as the house wine pairing. As it was a work night for both of us, we settled for cocktails followed by a half-bottle of chardonnay ($38), with which we were delighted.Including beverages, tax, and tip, the meal came to $398. Nobody would call that inexpensive, but for a three-star restaurant on Valentine's Day, it was one of the better special-occasion meals I've had.Oceana (55 E. 54th Street between Madison & Park Avenues, East Midtown)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Note: Cafe Gray closed on June 21, 2008. A branch of A Voce will replace it, though not with its original chef, Andrew Carmellini. Click here and here for my parting thoughts on Cafe Gray.Last night, I returned to Cafe Gray, my first visit since November 2004. My early impression remains my impression today: it is a wonderful restaurant, but not without its share of miscalculations.Chief among these must be the boneheaded interior design, surely the most obscene waste of a great view in dining history. Instead of giving customers a priceless view of Central Park, Cafe Gray puts an open kitchen in the way. Walls studded with hard surfaces ensure that the noise carries-and, oh boy, does it carry.At the table next to us, a man was delivering what sounded like a lecture in musicology to a hearing-impaired companion. The next table over had a Japanese family with two toddlers, one of them quite loud. Ninety minutes later, thanks to the din, I left Cafe Gray with a mild headache.I have the Cafe Gray website open in another window as I write this. I'm not fond of websites with a sound track, but this is one of the dumbest ones ever. People chat and laugh, glasses clink, wine is poured, music flits in and out in the deep background. About its only merit is that, if you quintuple the volume, you have precisely the aural experience of a meal at Cafe Gray.The food is an altogether happier story and deserves better surroundings. My friend was grateful to be steered towards the mushroom risotto ($22) and the braised shortribs ($36), both signature dishes that Gray Kunz made famous at Lespinasse. They are indeed special, but as I'd already had them the last time, I wanted to see what else the kitchen could do.I started with the Seared Foie Gras and Quail ($24). Foie is pretty much infallible, but the quail was a succulent surprise. For the entree, I chose the sauteed pork chop with housemade sauerkraut ($35). The chop was about half again as thick as one normally sees. To get the interior to the house-recommended temperature of medium, the exterior had to be slightly over-cooked. The sauerkraut was wonderful.We didn't have dessert, but I noted that the available choices were between $14-18, which is excessive for this type of restaurant. (My friend and I got into a long discussion about how high the rent must be.) Wine options under $50 were in short supply, but when we chose something at around $48, it was one of the better wines we've enjoyed at its price point.Many restaurants in town have a disappointing bread service, but Cafe Gray served a loaf of homemade sourdough bread that I'd love to eat every day. The amuse bouche was a small beet in a mildly spicy sauce that I've now forgotten.Overall, the kitchen at Cafe Gray does a first-class job, but the surroundings disappoint.Cafe Gray (10 Columbus Circle, 3rd floor of the Time-Warner Center, West Midtown) Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: *½Overall: **½

***CONTENT
Note: A Michelin star did Lo Scalco no good. It closed in mid-2006, giving way to Dennis Foy. A promised midtown re-opening of Lo Scalco has yet to materialize.In the 2005 Michelin Guide, Lo Scalco received an unexpected star. The restaurant had been open for less than a year, and the media had largely ignored it. To date, there is no New York Times review. New York Magazine reviewed it after the Michelin Guide came out, praising the pastas but finding fault in other dishes.The Chef/Owner is Mauro Mafrici, who once worked as executive chef at Felidia. The restaurant's name is taken from a renaissance Italian word (now obsolete) that is approximately equivalent to maitre d'. A photocopy of an old book that used the word is on display in the vestibule.The dining room is beautiful, serene, and refined. Service is leisurely, if a bit lazy. We puzzled for a while over the menu. We expected a server to wander over and utter the words any diner these days should dread: \"Let me explain how our menu works.\" Instead, they left us to ourselves, and we had to ask how it worked.In an earlier incarnation, apparently the menu was organized by ingredients. The version we saw last night was organized by regions of Italy, listing an antipasto, first course, and second course for each. This wasn't explained, although one might have guessed what was going on from the prices. This pattern is repeated for four or five regions. Then, there's a list of chef's specialties. If all of this is too confusing, you can order a tasting menu of 4, 5, or 6 courses, priced at $54, $66, or $78 respectively. With the tasting menus, you can choose your courses or ask the chef to choose for you. Got that?If you order à la carte, the various courses are between $12-29 each. There's a cheese tasting at $12, $16 or $20 for three, four, or five cheeses. Desserts are $12, or $9 for sorbet and gelati. It is not easy to find a wine under $50, although we lucked out with a selection barely under that, at $48.We chose the four-course tasting menu, selecting the courses ourselves. Coincidentally, my friend and I made identical choices. We began with the homemade sausage, which is served with canellini beans and broccoletti. This was wondeful, tender, and tasty. We then had a risotto that is not listed on the website, but I believe it came with a pumpkin sauce, which was also terrific.Alas, the meal tanked with our third choice, duck wrapped with suckling pig-one of the chef's specialties. The duck was tough and dry. My friend's portion had what seemed like gristle in one of the pieces; she found it inedible. Given the culinary fireworks of the first two courses, I would like to think this was an anomaly, but it was highly unfortunate, particularly as this was claimed to be a speciality de la casa.We diverged on the desserts. I had the apple and caramel cake with pistachio ice cream, she the chocolate hazel cake with coffee ice cream. These were both strong finishers, although my friend found her cake a bit too rich (probably not the restaurant's fault). At the end, we weren't at all rushed to leave the restaurant. Had we not asked for a check, I think we might still be there.In its style, ambiance, presentation, and culinary ambitions, Lo Scalco is a three-star restaurant. The staff needs to work on the consistency of the kitchen's output to actually reach that level.Lo Scalco (313 Church Street between Walker & Lispenard Streets, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: ***Overall: **

There are many restaurants in New York that I want to try, so a restaurant has to be pretty damned good for me to rush back. If it is merely good, I move on to the next destination. After my girlfriend and I had paid a first visit, Cookshop had made it into that rare pantheon of places we felt we had to rush back to.Alas, early promise wasn't fulfilled. On our second visit, my friend ordered a \"humanely-raised\" veal chop. We supposed that meant that the young animal received plenty of coddling in its short life, but in the end they still slaughtered it anyway. All of that made no difference. The chop was inexpertly cooked, lacking any char or texture on its outer surface.I ordered the suckling pig, another animal that had died young. Its final stop before my plate was a rotisserie, which is perhaps a gimmick to persuade the diner that he is getting something special, but in the end it was just bland. I had a far superior version of the same dish a few days later at the TriBeCa restaurant Dominic.So our enthusiasm for Cookshop has dimmed somewhat. We'll probably give it one more try one of these days, but this time we won't be rushing back.Cookshop (156 Tenth Avenue at 20th Street, West Chelsea)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

TriBeCa Grill used to be a tough reservation when it opened sixteen years ago. It was Robert DeNiro's restaurant. Celebrities dined there. My companions last night-none of whom had been before-asked me to alert them if I saw anyone famous. We didn't. But obviously they'd heard of the TriBeCa Grill's reputation. The restaurant was full, and it is still doing well.In more than half-a-dozen visits to TriBeCa Grill, most of them lunches, I've never had a bad meal, or even a bad course. Yet, there's a certain je ne sais quois that's missing. I would never suggest that anyone go out of their way to visit TriBeCa Grill. It has no unique selling proposition. It's a very good New American restaurant that is simply solid in its category. Most neighborhoods have one like it, so there's no reason to make the trip. But if you happen to be in TriBeCa, you won't go wrong at the Grill.We were seated last night in a small back dining room that I had never seen before. It has only 5 or 6 tables. The walls are studded with abstract oil paintings and charcoal drawings. There is no exposed brick to reflect the sound. It is a far more refined atmosphere than the raucous main dining room.To start, I ordered a Charcuterie Plate ($14), which comes with a veal & foie gras ballotine, serrano ham, and chicken liver mousse. It was all excellent. The very smooth chicken liver mousse stood out. It's essentially your grandmother's chopped liver, but with the texture of a puree. It comes with toast points for spreading.Then came the Grilled Long Island Duck Breast ($26) with spinach, a butternut squash & apple puree, and sundried cherry sauce. Actually, that sauce reminded me of a Chinese hoisin sauce. Anyhow, it was another excellent dish. The duck was tender, and it came in ample slices.A pumpkin cheesecake ($9) was a bit less successful; perhaps it had been in the fridge a bit too long. It's no small accomplishment to continue serving such uniformly good food. After 16 years, many restaurants would take their eye off the ball. TriBeCa Grill is still dependable.TriBeCa Grill (375 Greenwich Street at Franklin Street, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Craft is one of New York's iconic restaurants. It derives its name partly from the structure of the menu, which presents ingredients in various categories, allowing the diner to craft his own meal. This can be a rewarding but expensive undertaking, with vegetable side dishes running to $12-15 apiece. The restaurant is also known for a style of cooking that \"celebrate[s] 'single' ingredients, expertly and simply prepared.\" But Chef Tom Colicchio (Gramercy Tavern) is quick to note, \"Simple does not mean simplistic.\" A truckload of honors (three NYT stars and one Michelin star) suggests that critics generally have agreed.Like many successful restaurants these days, craft has become a mini-chain. Many people think that craftsteak is the best steakhouse in Las Vegas. We'll all see for ourselves soon enough, as a branch of craftsteak will be opening in far west Chelsea later this year. And then, there is craftbar, a less pricy alternative around the corner from the mother ship, which moved to new digs last year.For a downscale sibling, craftbar is surprisingly formal-looking. Of course, it is not a formal restaurant as we would traditionally have understood that term. But in an era that has largely jettisoned old notions of fine dining, craftbar seems like an oasis of calm. The booths are comfortable, the tables widely spaced, the decor gentle on the eyes. Nowadays, such a space could easily be the home to far more ambitious cooking than craftbar is, in fact, serving.My friend and I could not avoid the comparison to the Cafe at Country, the downscale sibling of a main dining room that hasn't opened yet. We dined there about ten days ago. It was a miserable experience, not for any fault of the food, but for an ambiance that seemed perversely designed to inflict maximum discomfort. At craftbar, there's proof that an informal sibling need not have tables the size of postage stamps and the noise level of a Wall Street trading floor.The menu comes on a single loose sheet of paper, and it changes daily. I started with the pan-roasted sweetbreads ($15), which came lightly breaded. This dish seemed to exemplify the \"craft\" approach-presenting the best ingredients, prepared simply. I found it tasty, but unadventurous.Several reports have praised the veal meatballs with ricotta ($19). Here too was a comfort food featuring impeccable ingredients prepared uncreatively. There were three hefty meatballs in a red sauce with an ample sprinkling of grated cheese. The veal was tender, and obviously a high quality. In less capable hands, it could easily have been overwhelmed by either the sauce or the cheese, but here the piece parts were skillfully balanced.My friend also made uncomplicated choices: a duck liver pâte followed by spaghetti. I tasted a bit of the pâte , and found it comparable to the better examples that I've tasted elsewhere.At $15, my sweetbread appetizer was craftbar's most expensive; other starters are in the $8-12 range. At $19, my meatball entree was craftbar's least expensive; other main courses were in the $25-30 range. If not exactly budget-priced, craftbar is certainly less expensive than its luxury sister restaurant, craft.I wasn't in the mood for a fancy meal last night, but I would certainly look forward to a return visit to try some of craftbar's more adventurous main courses.craftbar (900 Broadway between 19th & 20th Streets, Flatiron District)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Steven A Shaw's \"Turning the Tables\"

Turning the Tables: Restaurants from the Inside Outby Steven A. ShawNew York: HarperCollins, 2005xxiv+216 pagesSteven A. Shaw is the \"Fat Guy\" of eGullet, the superb Internet food site that he co-founded, and to which I am addicted. Any regular visitor to the site will have been impressed by Shaw's encyclopedic knowledge of the restaurant industry and especially the New York restaurant scene. Shaw gave up a career in the law to become a food writer. It is his passion, and it comes through in everything he writes.A bit belatedly, I finally got around to reading this book. It's about 200 pages, but goes by quickly. I bought it on a Thursday night and finished it the next day. Curiously, although it's hardcover, the book is shaped like a Zagat Guide, which is a strange design choice. I found it a little unwieldy to hold.The book's premise is to provide an insider view of the restaurant industry. Shaw talks about how they manage their reservation books, how kitchens work, how ingredients are sourced, how restaurants operate as businesses, and the \"Restaurant Information Age.\" Most of his points are made by example. The bulk of his research was conducted in high-end New York restaurants (Eleven Madison Park, Gramercy Tavern, Tavern on the Green, Cafe Gray), but he also visits a hot dog stand, pizzarias in New Haven, barbecue joints in the South, and a small restaurant in Florida where one guy does all the cooking.Shaw has done most of his writing in short formats, and it shows: the book reads like a series of newspaper feature articles. This structure makes the material easily digestible, but at times it lacks depth. For instance, in the chapter on \"The Business of the Restaurant Business,\" Shaw takes brief tours of projects that are already in progress, but they are only fly-bys. Take Cafe Gray, for instance. Shaw wants to tell us what it takes to open a new restaurant, but when he first drops by, the space is already under construction. A lot of the formative stages have already happened. And he never gets far enough to tell us how it all turned out after Cafe Gray opened: What worked? What didn't?Shaw spends several pages on one of his favorite hobby horses: critic anonymity. He believes that critics should drop the pretense of dining anonymously, since restaurant staffs usually recognize them anyway. He argues persuasively that restaurants can't really improve the quality of the food when a critic is in the house, so in that sense anonymity is meaningless. Instead, he suggests that critics should develop \"ties-close ties-to the community.\" Shaw believes that those close ties will allow the critic to obtain better information, and ultimately to \"promote the best within the industry while exposing the worst.\"Shaw's own book demonstrates why this will not work, for it is notable that Shaw never criticizes any of the restaurants or restauranteurs whom he had personally interviewed or worked with during his research. To the contrary, he gushes and fawns over them. It is a love-fest. Regular eGullet visitors will know that Shaw hasn't lost his critical faculties. But in the book, he holds his tongue. He is too indebted to his sources-without whom the book would have been impossible-to confide what he really thinks about what he may have seen or heard.By the way, Shaw doesn't hesitate to criticize those whom he did not work with. He gives an extremely balanced view of the Zagat Guides, both their strengths and methodological flaws. He rightly takes the New York Times to task for selecting amateurs as food critics (William Grimes and particularly Frank Bruni). He brashly says that \"Michelin will, and should, fail to gain traction in the United States.\" Early indications suggest that he is already being proved wrong on that prediction. But would he have been so harsh had Michelin invited Shaw to a few confidential inspectors' meetings? To the contrary, one must assume that Shaw would have bestowed heaps of praise upon Michelin, just as he did for everyone who helped him on the present volume.Mind you, I am not suggesting that Shaw has done anything wrong here. I would be very happy to receive just one-tenth of the comped meals and insider access that Shaw receives. But I do not suggest that I could write about those restaurants with the same objectivity as a critic who attempts-however imperfectly-to remain detached and anonymous.One can understand Shaw's lack of objectivity about the wonderful resource he co-founded: eGullet. Having already run us through the limitations of Zagat, Michelin, and newspaper reviews, he asks, \"Is there another way? I think there is. It's called the Internet.\" Jaws drop in amazement. There's this undiscovered secret called the Internet, and somehow we missed it!Anyhow, I'm as big a fan of the medium as anybody, but Shaw's discussion of the Internet doesn't have the same detachment-and perhaps it can't-as it does where he's not personally involved. He steers clear of mentioning Chowhound, the one other Internet site that could reasonably be considered a competitor to eGullet. Perhaps that's because, in any rational comparison, Chowhound would invariably come across as inferior, and Shaw could be forgiven for not wanting to gloat. However, I could see no reason for his failure to mention the invaluable menupages.com, or indeed, any other Internet site that caters to dining out.Along the way, Shaw doesn't spare us his opinions, and some are provocative. He appears to be right when he criticizes overly harsh U. S. agricultural regulations that prohibit the manufacture of chesse made from raw (un-pasteurized) milk, even though it is permitted in Europe. He concludes that the purported health risk is insignificant.He strongly believes it is worthwhile to focus your dining on a few good restaurants, so that you'll become a \"regular\" and get treated like a VIP. One of the book's early chapters explains precisely how to go about doing that. I don't doubt Shaw, since he's done it and I haven't. But for the moment I intend to disregard his advice. Trying new places-his advice in a different chapter-is just too much fun.Some of Shaw's general advice seems trivial. He points out that most restaurants have a menu posted outside, and it's a good idea to read the menu first before deciding whether to eat there. Yet, we shouldn't be afraid to try new things. I think my mother told me all that before I was 10. Shaw advises us to remember to say \"please\" and \"thank you.\" Those to whom this is a revelation are probably beyond his help.A final chapter on the future of dining takes a fun look at where the restaurant industry has been, and where Shaw thinks it is going. He interviews Jean-Jacques Rachou (La Côte Basque) and Georges Briguet (Le Perigord), two conseratives who turn out to be surprisingly open-minded. He also profiles avant-garde chefs like Ferran Adria of El Bulli and Grant Achatz of Alinea. He argues convincingly that we shouldn't be concerned about global chefs who aren't always present in the kitchens they supervise: all chefs are executives, and are to some extent dependent on work done in their absence. \"To my way of thinking...all chefs are absentee chefs,\" he says. \"The only variable I have been able to isolate is the extent of their absence.\" Less persuasive is his strange definition of authenticity as \"being faithful to oneself.\"Shaw has a tendency toward hyperbole that can be extremely irritating. Nobu Masuhisa's flavors are \"seemingly extraterrestrial.\" Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Gray Kunz \"run roughshod over culinary borders with the audacity of international arms dealers.\" A pizza oven is \"ancient...spewing forth sparks, flames, and smoke with reckless abandon.\" (Can an inanimate object be reckless?) The workers who tend it \"look as though they've been working the boiler room of the Titanic.\" A cheese-making machine \"looks like an evil harp.\" He later tastes the cheeses: \"all are at least superlative.\"The book is written in Shaw's easy conversational style. There are occasional lapses into irrelevance, such as complaints about having to wake up early to do research. My alarm goes off at 5:45am on weekdays-a time not unusual among New Yorkers-so Shaw's complaints about leaving the house at 6:30am don't draw much sympathy from me. The ongoing saga of his choices of shoes, none of which seem to make him comfortable, is a distraction we don't need.But while it may be a mixed bag, there is much here about the restaurant industry from the inside-out, which is precisely what Shaw set out to tell us. I can't imagine anyone more qualified to tell it. One gets the sense that Shaw has far more knowledge to share than made it into this book. I will be very happy to see a sequel.

Return to BLT Fish

Note: Click here for a more recent review of BLT Fish.I returned to BLT Fish last night with one of the two colleagues who joined me there last May.Andrea Strong reported yesterday that Laurent Tourondel's next venture is a branch of BLT Steak in Washington, D.C. Based on last night's performance, Mr. Tourondel needs to spend more time minding the store back home. Two years into the experiment, the BLT schtick is starting to wear awfully thin.I believe BLT restaurants aspire to serve three-star food, and there is at least a colorable argument that they do so. Why, then, are they so determined to dumb down the ambiance? Naturally, the noise level is almost deafening. The menu is printed on loose sheets of paper, plus a separate loose sheet itemizing the raw bar, plus a separate loose sheet with \"highlights\" of the wine list, plus the wine list itself in a leather-bound book.All of those loose sheets are obviously printed cheaply, and not meant to last. So you'd at least like to think that they are up-to-date, but alas, they are not. The waiter recites a long list of specials. It is black truffle season, and several of the specials include that ingredient, but it's more extra information than I can keep in my head, so I order off the printed menu. (I also presume, given the BLT franchise's propensity for upselling, that those truffle specials are more expensive than the rest of the menu, but our server doesn't mention prices.)To start, we ordered a pound of Alaskan king crab legs to share. For the entree, I ordered the Alaskan black cod with honey glazing, while my colleague ordered a Chatham cod special that the server had mentioned. We also ordered two side dishes (mashed potatoes and brussels sprouts).A long wait ensued. My colleague saw a tray of crab legs on the kitchen counter. He thought, \"Surely those must be ours.\" Ten or fifteen minutes went by, but those crab legs remained on the counter, unclaimed. Finally, we asked our server what was going on. A team of BLT staff now descended on us with the crab legs, our entrees, and the side dishes-all at once.But it gets worse than that. Instead of an order of the Alaskan black cod and the Chatham cod, the kitchen had prepared two orders of the Alaskan black cod. My colleague pointed out the slip. After a conference, the staff announced that they were all out of the Chatham cod-a daily special, I remind you-but would he like the halibut? Well, what could he say? I ate my Alaskan black cod, and he snacked on the crab legs, while they prepared the halibut. Later on, he ate the halibut while I watched.You'd think they couldn't mess up anything more, but they managed it. The server forgot to offer us a bread service. The crab legs came without the usual miniature forks for prizing the meat out of the shell. The side dishes arrived without serving spoons. The amuses-bouches came with disposable wooden forks-they can't run the dishwasher?Earlier on, they had taken my coat, and promised to return with a claim ticket. The claim ticket never arrived. When I left, we had to turn on the bright lights in the check room and rummage around for my coat. Luckily, the place wasn't packed. And luckily, I had a distinctive scarf that set my gray wool coat apart from the many others like it.To their credit, the staff was aware of the more egregious of their sins, and tried to make amends. We were served dessert wines for free, and my colleague's entree was taken off the bill. But of other sins the restaurant is apparently out-of-touch: the cheap outdated paper menus, missing/wrong utensils, and so forth.For all that, the food was great. I would happily eat the honey-glazed Alaskan black cod every day. The side dishes were wonderful, as they always are at BLT restaurants. Dessert (bread pudding) was excellent. The sommelier was knowledgeable, and recommended a terrific pinot noir.But service and ambiance count, and the lapses here were too many to forgive. Laurent Tourondel's cuisine deserves a far better setting.BLT Fish (21 W. 17th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Flatiron District) Food: ***Service: *Ambiance: FairOverall: **

Calle Ocho is named for a street in Miami's Little Havana. On this stretch of Columbus Avenue, its bright exterior immediately gets your attention. The interior decor is consistent with the snazzy Latin vibe.The ceviches are terrific. For $28, you get a sampler of four of them, which a friend and I shared:Conchitas - Bay Scallops, Salsa Verde, Avacado, Pico de GalloOstras - Four Oyster Shooters (Mojito, Caipirinha, Sangria, Margarita)Tropical - Rock Shrimp, Roasted Tomato, Mango-Passion, CitrusPescado - Red Snapper, Aji Amarillo, Crispy Sweet Potato(Separately, they'd be $10-12 apiece.)The restaurant offers a crispy cuban pork special on Sundays called Pernil ($21). My friend, who's had the dish at considerably less expensive Cuban restaurants, said that Calle Ocho's version was over-cooked, and dry. I've no comparison to go on, but I agreed that the meat wasn't tender enough.She had a happy experience with the Cuban skirt steak ($22), which had been slowly braised, and yielded easily to the tug of a fork.I won't rush back, but the ceviches and the skirt steak were well executed, so I assume the menu has a lot more to offer.Calle Ocho (446 Columbus Avenue between 81st and 82nd Streets, Upper West Side)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

***CONTENT
Note: Alain Ducasse at the Essex House closed in late 2006. Ducasse transferred the kitchen team to a new but less formal restaurant, Adour, at the St. Regis Hotel, which opened in early 2008.I had been looking for a special occasion to visit Alain Ducasse at the Essex House Hotel, a/k/a \"ADNY\". That occasion presented itself yesterday, and my friend and I had a grand time. The experience was, if not perfect, certainly extraordinary-the definition of four stars, if ever there was.I've seen many photographs of the room, but they fail to do it justice. It is creative, comfortable and luxurious, without being over-the-top. The exposed kitchen surprised me. Obviously there are plenty of open kitchens at fine restaurants in New York, but here it seemed slightly out-of-place.ADNY virtually defines extraordinary service. One could give a thousand examples, but what especially impressed me is that our coats were taken when we arrived without a check ticket, and were ready for us when we left. Somehow, the staff is able to keep track of every coat and has telepathic insight when you are ready to leave.Your options at ADNY are a three-course meal at $150, four courses at $175, the seven-course tasting menu at $225, or the six-course tuber melanosporum (black truffle) tasting at $290. We chose the four-course meal ($175 plus supplements), which offers an appetizer, a fish course, a meat course, and dessert.ADNY tries mightily to tempt you with the truffle menu. Before we ordered, a member of staff brought around a box of several enormous black truffles in a bed of rice. I was encouraged to pick one up and take a whiff, which I did. We had already decided on the four-course, but we were still going to see truffles later on.The water service might be seen as an attempt at upselling. Almost every starred restaurant tries to entice you to purchase bottled water, but at ADNY a water sommelier comes along with six waters for you to choose from. However, our request for tap water was heeded graciously.I was beginning to wonder if attempts to pad the bill were going to take over. I asked the wine sommelier either to recommend a single bottle in the $150-200 range, or wines by the glass paired with each course. He was happy to do either, and when he didn't state a price, I wondered what was coming. I was happy to find that the paired wines came in at only $140, below the bottom end of my stipulated range.Our service began with two wonderful gougères and an amuse of seared tuna with pureed celery root. There was a choice selection of warm bread, of which an olive roll was especially memorable, along with two fresh butters (one salted, one not).For the appetizer, I chose the butternut squash ravioli, celery \"moustarda di cremona\", and sage emulsion, a complex dish that is difficult to explain. More straightforward, but no less superb, was my friend's foie gras terrine, with mango chutney sandwiched by layers of foie.I had no firm idea about the fish course, but I chose the Chatham cod, which includes \"fennel-some braised, others raw-Taggiasca tapenade, and clear essence.\" I reasoned that as this dish is part of the tasting menu, the chef must be rather pleased with it. It was, of course, impeccably prepared, but utterly unadventurous, and in the end unacceptably dull. My friend made the happier choice: poached Maine lobster with truffles ($35 supp.), which she pronounced superb. She must be getting to know me pretty well, as she said, \"I took one look at that cod, and could tell you weren't going to love it.\"(Update: Over on eGullet.com, Steven A. Shaw (the \"Fat Guy\")-who is a professional food writer and has been to ADNY more than just about anybody else who writes about it-read my review and said, \"I agree that the fish dish oakapple described is unremarkable as were two other fish dishes I tried on our most recent visit, when we also had the four-course menu with all the same choices oakapple described. On the whole, the fish course was weak. Maybe as part of a longer tasting menu I'd have seen it in a different context: a beautiful little piece of fish with a technically correct sauce. But as an entree-type course the fish dishes fell flat.\")I'd heard rave reviews of the blue foot chicken ($35 supp.), which we both had. This dish is a truffle orgy, with truffles both under the skin and all over the plate. The raves are entirely justified; it was outstanding.Another dish everyone raves about is \"Monsieur Ducasse's favorite dessert,\" Baba Monte-Carlo style, with rum of your choice. A server comes around with a tray of five rums. You choose one, and it is poured into a small copper cup. You also receive a bit of the rum in a snifter. The Baba comes out in a sterling silver bowl that must have been custom-made for Ducasse, as I've never seen anything like it. Your server slices the cake in half, pours the rum over its innards, then ladles on heapings of cream. If there's a better dessert in New York, I can't imagine it.We were not finished yet, as the kitchen sent out a small serving of sorbet as a palate cleanser. Then, a cart comes out with more sweets, of which you may choose as many as you please. (I had the vanilla panna cotta and a marshmallow coated with almonds.) The selection of coffees ($8) was impressive, including even M. Ducasse's custom espresso, which I enjoyed.The meal was not perfect: the Chatham cod didn't live up to the surroundings, and none of the vegetable accompaniments wowed me. But at its best, ADNY operates at a level few restaurants can touch.Alain Ducasse at the Essex House (155 West 58th Street between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, West Midtown)Food: ***½Service: ****Ambiance: ****Overall: ****

Note: This is a review of the Café at Country under chef de cuisine Doug Psaltis. Click here for a more recent review under executive chef Blake Joyal. Chef Geoffrey Zakarian, formerly of Le Cirque, 21 Club, and Patroon (among others), owns and operates the well-regarded three-star restaurant Town, in the Chambers Hotel on West 56th Street. It was only appropriate that he would call his next restaurant Country, which is in the new Carleton Hotel at Madson Ave & 29th Street. Zakarian recruited Doug Psaltis (who worked most recently at Alain Ducasse's failed Mix in NY) as chef de cuisine. Like many a restaurant (Jean Georges, Gramercy Tavern, Aquavit, The Modern), Country has an informal café attached to a more upscale main dining room. The café has been open for about two months, but the more elegant room upstairs hasn't opened yet. We could see that the tables are all in place and tablecloths laid, so I'm not sure what Zakarian and Psaltis are waiting for. The café is surprisingly ill-conceived, and it strikes me as a waste of time. The décor is unattractive, the tables and seating are uncomfortable, and the noise level induces a splitting headache. We were seated at a small circular table that looked cheap, and seemed to belong in an ice cream parlor. It was just barely large enough to accommodate our food. The banquette was too low. The restaurant also has a number of two-top rectangular tables that appear to have come from a different designer. I don't know what the circular tables are doing there, as they clash with the rest of the décor. Dinner began with cylindrical bread rolls that were so hard they could have been used to pound nails. There was olive oil at the table. It came in what looked like a cologne bottle, but the label on the outside said, \"I Love Olive Oil.\" I poured a little of it onto my plate, and my jaw had a good workout chewing through the bread. I started with a beet salad, while my friend had the foie gras pâté. The pâté was probably the highlight of the meal. It was an excellent, but very large serving, and even after my friend and I shared it, we sent almost half of it back unfinished. Coincidentally, the New York Daily News reviewed the Café at Country in yesterday's issue, awarding 1½ stars, an assessment that may have been a tad generous. It was thanks to that review that I knew what to order for the main course. Critic Pascale Le Draoulec said: Among entrees, I loved most of all the spectacular lamb shank, braised endlessly in North African spices. The rosy flesh yielded at the slightest prompting from my fork. Topped with glistening pomegranate seeds, it comes with basmati rice laced with exotic preserved fruit. In fact, we both had the lamb shank. Le Draoulec's enthusiasm is about right, but we both felt that it was more akin to comfort food than fine dining. Anyone competent isn't going to mess up a lamb shank, and Psaltis is at least competent. Service was solid, but in some ways over-the-top in comparison to the humble surroundings. Our server kept referring to my friend as \"Madame,\" and his obsequiousness was almost irritating. There is a very large wine list, which almost certainly will be shared with the main restaurant when it opens. We had an enjoyable Loire Valley red for about $47. With most appetizers under $15 and most entrées under $25, the Café at Country clearly aims to attract diners who want a thoughtfully-composed menu that doesn't break the bank. But what you get is basically a baby step above comfort food, and it isn't good enough to justify putting up with the ugly, uncomfortable, and ear-splitting surroundings.

Last night, I visited the midtown branch of Churrascaria Plataforma. This outpost is larger, noisier, and a bit less hip than its TriBeCa cousin, which I have been to twice. It was the ideal outing for a group of 30 people belatedly celebrating the new year.I've not much to add to what I've said in the past, so I'll just link to the account of my first visit.Churrascaria Plataforma (316 W. 49th Street between Eighth & Ninth Avenues, Hell's Kitchen)

Note: Dominic closed in 2007. I did have one more visit, and it was again positive: see here.It took me nineteen months to get back to Dominic, which I finally did last night. (An account of my earlier visit is here.) My enthusiasm for the restaurant is undimmed-some minor glitches aside.It's not often that the Zagat review tells you precisely what dish to order, but it does for Dominic: \"all can agree the roast suckling pig, a holdover from its old Portuguese incarnation, is 'a must.'\" So, that's what I had last night.The menu describes the dish as a 10-Hour Pig Roast ($24). It's slow roasted with Tuscan seasonings, crispy skin, wildflower honey and sauteed greens. The dull sauteed greens added nothing, but the pig was terrific, including the crunchy skin and a brick of tender, flavorful meat.Coincidentally, I had Cookshop's version of this dish on Monday night, and found it bland. The folks at Cookshop need to high-tail it over to Dominic, to see how it's done.Dominic's current winter menu lists five pasta dishes, and it was most peculiar to be informed that three of them were unavailable last night. I wasn't looking to order pasta anyway, but it's strange for a purportedly Italian restaurant to be out of so many items.When I sat down, I was not presented with a wine list. When I asked for red wine by the glass, the server told me that my choices were chianti classico, pinot noir, or merlot, apparently on the view that it is unnecessary for me to be told which chianti, pinot, or merlot it is. I could have insisted, but I just ordered the chianti and ignored the lapse. It was nothing special, but at $7 I didn't feel cheated.The restaurant seemed to be a little over half full, which isn't bad on a Wednesday night, in a neighborhood where there are so many dining options. It might help if they knew their own web address. It says \"www.DominicRestaurant.com\" on their business card, but the correct address is \"www.dominicnyc.com\".Dominic (349 Greenwich Street between Harrison & Jay Streets, TriBeCa)Food: *Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: *Overall: *

\"Study Finds That Marriage Builds Wealth.\" So says an article I found today on Yahoo! News.Unfortunately, the corrollary is that divorce destroys wealth:Marrying for money, it turns out, works. A study by an Ohio State University researcher shows that a person who marries - and stays married - accumulates nearly twice as much personal wealth as a person who is single or divorced. And for those who divorce, it's a bit more expensive than giving up half of everything they own. They lose, on average, three-fourths of their personal net worth.\"Getting married for a few years and then getting divorced is clearly not the path to financial independence...\"Boy, oh boy, ain't it true!

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Industria Argentina.Industria Argentina has been open about two weeks, in a space that used to be a Chinese restaurant. It has been totally remodeled. According to Daily Candy, \"everything in the place-floors, tables, chairs, fabrics, bar-comes from Argentina.\" (Photo here.)When I visited last night, a small corn tortilla was served as an amuse bouche - a soft, warm, tasty miniature pillow of dough that was a perfect prelude to the meal. Crisp Pan Seared Sweetbreads ($12), or mollejahs, were served over a salad of warm potato, scallions and bacon bites. This was an ample portion, to which I would award the ultimate compliment: I just couldn't get enough of it.Several entrees are in a category labeled \"From the Brick Oven.\" I tried the 24-hour Braised Ossobuco ($25), which is served over roasted vegetables with pine nuts pesto, in its own juices. My knife was entirely superfluous-the delicate flesh readily collapsed at the touch of a fork.There menu also offers a variety of steaks from the grill (filet, ribeye, skirt steak, short ribs), and other dishes like pork milanese, pan seared chilean sea bass, pumpkin risotto, and so forth. It looks like there will be plenty to explore on future visits. For the adventurous, the available side dishes include a grilled blood sausage. You can look at the menu on menupages (to which my description of the food is partly indebted).I concluded with Spiced Bread Pudding ($7), which is served with vanilla ice cream and caramelized rum-infused raisins. Again, a wonderful dish. Everything I tasted was conscientiously prepared and most attractively plated. The final bill before the tip, including two gin & tonics, was $65.It's early days yet, but the restaurant hasn't caught on. According to Eater, even people who live on the block had no idea what was coming till the place opened. Evidently, this is the softest of \"soft openings.\" I was truly worried when I walked in at 6pm and was literally the only patron for about the first 20 minutes of my visit. But by the time I left, around 7:20pm on a Friday night, about half the tables were occupied.Service was friendly and usually efficient, but there are a few glitches. No one offered to take my coat (I hung it myself). There were no other customers were when I arrived, so the staff couldn't have been too busy. Warm bread rolls came with a wonderful lamb pâte, but no knife to spread it with. I asked for a cocktail menu,, and was advised, \"Our menu is to invent your own.\" Another patron asked for single-malt scotches, and was offered Johnnie Walker or Dewar's. He then got up to look at the bar himself, and advised that there were indeed a few true single-malts on offer.Still, with the restaurant barely a couple of weeks old, a fault or two is to be expected. The owner said hello to me warmly as I was leaving. According to Daily Candy, he also owns Novocento in SoHo and Azul Bistro on the Lower East Side. I wish him the best in this new venture. Industria Argentina is a fun place to eat.Industria Argentina (329 Greenwich St., between Reade and Jay Sts., TriBeCa)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: **

Viet Cafe is an attractive home to Vietnamese cuisine. Next door is the companion Gallery Viet Nam, which was featured on an episode of Donald Trump's show, The Apprentice.The attractive decor is composed entirely of furniture and lamps imported from Viet Nam. The tables are plain wood, many of them with benches for seating, although other tables have real chairs. For those against the wall, the banquette seats seem rather austere. The restaurant looks like it seats about 65, but it wasn't at all crowded, nor has it been anytime I've walked by since it opened about a year ago.Appetizers are a very reasonable $6-10, salads $6-8, noodle dishes $8-10, fried rice $5-7, and entrees $16-24. On my first visit, I wasn't quite hungry enough for the Roast Laquered Duck ($24) or the Grilled Pork Chops ($18), with shallots and Vietnamese herbed wine. Instead, I had a one of the specials, a flavorful shrimp curry stew ($20), which was made with coconut milk, eggplant, kaffir lime leaves, carrots, and potatoes, and came with white rice. The ingredients seemed fresh, and the dish took just long enough to persuade me that it hadn't been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I was pleased that a glass of respectable cabernet to go along with it was only $7.On a second visit later the same week, the restaurant was, again, rather empty, although it was early (around 5:40pm). I started with the Grilled Garlic-Marinated Pork Rolls ($6), which are made with mint, pickled carrots, cucumber, rice noodles. This was not quite what I expected. The pork, carrots, and rice noodles were wrapped in a mint leaf, which was wrapped in a cucumber slice, and held together with a toothpick. It is finger food - a salad you eat with your hands. I didn't find much pork, however.From the entrees, the Roast Lacquered Duck called out to me. At $24, it is the restaurant's most expensive main dish. The menu says that it's made with \"5-spice lacquer, nuoc mam glaze, and ginger sauce,\" but the only spice I tasted was the ginger sauce. The duck was an ample portion, but slightly dry and a tad overcooked.Dessert was a winner, a litchi meringue cookie with coconut sorbet ($5).Viet Cafe (345 Greenwich Street between Harrison & Jay Streets, TriBeCa)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Fatty Crab is chef Zak Pelaccio's casual Malaysian spinoff. His other restaurant, the more upscale and expensive 5 Ninth, is just steps away, in the center of the Meatpacking District.Indeed, Fatty Crab is about as casual as it gets. The restaurant is tiny, and reservations aren't accepted. The bar serves beer and wine only. However, it has the foodie buzz, and if you get there much later than 6:30pm, you can expect to wait. A Fatty Crab meal isn't an epic-length event, and the tables seem to turn rapidly.The restaurant follows the irritating contemporary trend of turning out plates as they're ready, regardless of whether you are ready for them. This can work well if you're intending to share (as my friend and I were), but I find it presumptuous when I am informed that this is what the kitchen means to do, like it or not. Isn't dining out meant to suit our convenience, rather than the restaurant's?The menu comes as several printed sheets held together with a clip board. It offers the following categories: snacks ($4-8), salads ($7-13), noodles/soups ($10-12), vegetables ($7), rice bowls ($1-3), and specialities ($6-28). All of those specialties are $17 or less, except for the restaurant's signature dish, the chilli crab, which is $28. It was unavailable last night (worldwide shortage of dungeoness crab, we're told).A salad of watermelon pickle and crispy pork ($7) was wonderful, offering a sharp contrast between the cool watermelon and the warm crunchy pork. I would have liked a bit more of the pork, but I shouldn't complain at that price. A sweet and sour fish broth with rice noodles ($10) was plenty of fun, but awfully difficult to eat.The dish of the evening was Short Rib Rendang ($17), which is braised with kaffir lime, coconut, and chili: tender, succulent, and flavorful. A dish called Chicken Claypot ($10) offered tender cubes of meat that had all of the flavor cooked out of them.I suspect that Fatty Crab's menu will reward further exploration. At its wallet-friendly price, the trip will probably be well worth it.Fatty Crab (643 Hudson Street, between Gansevoort and Horatio Streets, Meatpacking District)Food: *Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *

THOR

***CONTENT
Note: This is a review of THOR under Chef Kurt Gutenbrunner, who has since departed. As of 2008, THOR was on its fourth chef, with Jesi Solomon (a former sous chef at Stanton Social) having replaced Mark Spangenthal, who replaced Kevin Pomplun, who replaced Gutenbrunner. Update: As of May 2009, THOR (as we knew it) is closed, to be replaced by a new concept called Levant East. THOR is short for The Hotel on Rivington. It's also the name of the restaurant that occupies the ground floor of that hotel. I don't know what possessed somebody to put a 21-story hotel on the Lower East Side, although it is surprisingly easy to reach (just 2 blocks from the F train's Delancey St stop). The building sticks out like a sore thumb in this trendy, but still gritty neighborhood of low-rise tenements. Who could be staying there? You get no immediate idea of the hotel clientele when you visit, because the entire ground floor seems to be occupied by the vast lounge and restaurant. Indeed, you wouldn't even know that it is a hotel, except for the name. There is no check-in counter, bellhop, or concierge to give it away. The host that greets you seems oh-so-annoyed to have landed in the maelstrom of a successful restaurant. You get the sense that he'd be happiner in a far less hectic profession. Just beyond his station, a capacious lounge area awaits, filled with beautiful young bodies sipping their drinks. Loud music thumps in the background. \"This is very Lower East Side,\" my friend remarked. The seating area is just beyond the lounge, and it is not far enough. I have not seen a serious restaurant that goes to a more sustained effort to ensure that your ears will be battered and assaulted during your meal. THOR's 21-foot ceiling offers plenty of hard surfaces for the sound to bounce off of, and the sound happily obliges. Your eardrums may need a medical checkup after the meal is over. The large tables (apparently the same ones you find at BLT Steak) offer plenty of room for the food, but to communicate you'll have to shout. If you survive the aural onslaught, you'll be treated to some of the best and most creative food in New York. Of restaurants I'm familiar with, only nearby WD-50 offers a comparable exercise in culinary experimentation on this level. Practically every dish on THOR's menu offers surprising combinations from superstar chef Kurt Gutenbrunner. I had my doubts about THOR, because Gutenbruner is now on his fourth restaurant (with Wallse, Cafe Sabarsky, and Blaue Gans also in his stable). Perhaps, like many a celebrity chef, he's taken his eye off the ball. But Gutenbrunner is obviously as good a manager as he is a chef. THOR's kitchen staff turns out his creations expertly, and the service (despite the din) is nearly perfect. Gutenbrunner told Frank Bruni that \"he considered Thor the culinary equivalent of a chance to move from orchestral music to rock 'n' roll.\" You can see what he means. At his flagship Wallse, the Austrian cuisine is excellent, but largely traditional. At THOR, he lets his wildest urges run wild, with spectacular results. The menu is needlessly confusing. My friend, who hadn't researched the restaurant in advance (and one shouldn't have to), was initially baffled. In a preface, Gutenbrunner explains that there are plates of various sizes, allowing you to construct a tasting menu of your own design. But there is no indication of which plates are small, and which are large. Instead, the menu is in sections labeled \"Cold Plates to Start,\" \"Warm Plates in the Middle,\" \"From the Market on the Side,\" \"Hot Plates\" (a fish list and a meat list) and \"Sweet to Finish.\" Since when did the traditional captions - \"Appetizers,\" \"Entrees,\" \"Side Dishes,\" and \"Desserts\" - need to be replaced? Anyhow, after all that my friend and I each ordered a \"Warm Plate,\" a side dish, a meat course, and a dessert. And we were transported. To start, my friend ordered the \"Grilled shrimp skewers with green tomatoes, peppers and quark powder\" ($14), and I the \"Ravioli with farmers cheese, mint and hazelnut butter\" ($13). My dish came with three ravioli, and they were wonderful; the ingredients worked marvelously together. The side dishes are all $7. Many of them are traditional vegetable sides, but a terrific mushroom risotto is offered, which my friend and I both ordered. This is one of THOR's better bargains, given the intensive labor required to make a risotto. It could have been an appetizer in itself, but it came out with the main courses. I hardly ever order calves liver; indeed, I can remember ordering it only once before in my life. It wasn't a bad experience, but calves liver is simply one of those dishes that you don't want every day. \"Glazed calves liver with apples and scallions\" ($24) seemed too intriguing to pass up, and my willingness to take a chance paid off. If all calves liver dishes were this good, nobody would be ordering foie gras. My friend had \"Roasted rack of lamb with broccoli puree and 14K golden nugget potatoes\" ($28), which offered two hefty chops, which she said were spectacular. For dessert, I tried the pumpkin cheesecake with maple syrup ice cream ($9), which Frank Bruni had described as \"a happy nose dive into the heart of autumn.\" My friend ordered the petits-fours ($5), which come with what looks like a tube of toothpaste, but it actually contains hazelnut chocolate, which you squeeze into a small basin in the center of each cookie. WD-50's Wylie Dufresne and Sam Mason would be kicking themselves, and wondering, \"Why didn't we think of that?\" The wine list is organized by region, but there is also a section labeled \"Sommelier's Discoveries,\" featuring growers and/or regions that don't get a lot of publicity. The friendly sommelier came over unbidden and made a wonderful suggestion from that section. It was a 2003 Blaufrankisch by Feiler-Artinger, from Burgenland, a region of eastern Austria. Better yet, I had requested a wine between $35-45, and it was $39. Sommeliers who don't try to gouge every last dollar earn my everlasting respect. The restaurant uses stemless wine glasses from the Austrian firm Riedel. Somehow, you feel strange drinking wine from a stemless glass, although the Riedel catalog is in fact highly regarded, and pricey. The individual dishes on the menu are all reasonably priced, but if you heed Gutenbrunner's advice to construct a \"tasting menu,\" the bill can mount in a hurry. Our meal of an appetizer, side dish, main course, and dessert apiece, plus wine, was $192.56 (including tax and gratuity). Had we ordered cocktails, more tasting plates, or a different wine, it could easily have been a lot more. For cooking this good, we considered it money well spent. THOR is full of contradictions. Kurt Gutenbrunner's serious cuisine finds itself in a clubland setting designed for twenty-somethings who probably don't realize how special it is. Many of those who would appreciate it are no doubt put off by the location, the clientele, or the noise. (We are in our forties, and seemed to be among the oldest people there.) But if you can put up with the racket, you'll find that THOR is serving some of the finest food in the city.

What the Stars Mean

***CONTENT
I've employed a variation on the system found in The New York Times and many other newspapers:**** Extraordinary*** Excellent** Very Good* Good(zero) Satisfactory, Fair, or PoorLike some newspapers (but not the Times), I award half-stars to further discriminate between rating categories. Similar to Zagat (but not most newspapers), I consider the food, service, and ambiance separately, in addition to awarding an overall rating.I attach greater significance to the food rating than to service or ambiance. If service and/or ambiance are only a bit better/worse than the food rating, then the overall rating will simply be the same as the food rating. However, if I feel that service/ambiance make a significant difference, I adjust the overall rating accordingly.Here's a bit more on what the stars mean to me:One star: Good in its category; worth a look in its neighborhood, but not worth a special trip.Two stars: One of the city's better restaurants in its category. More than just \"good for the neighborhood.\" A \"minor destination,\" though possibly with some significant limitations. Worth going at least somewhat out of your way.Three stars: The city's best, or very close to the best, of its kind. A special experience. A destination in every respect, without any serious limitations. Nationally, or perhaps even internationally recognized (or deserves to be).Four stars: A transcendent experience, one of the world's best. Worth a trip to New York in its own right.For service and ambiance, I award stars based on my views of what is generally expected for a restaurant in its category. Service, I think, is self-explanatory. Ambiance refers to decor and related issues, such as the noise level, spacing of tables, and so forth.One and two stars are not bad ratings. They literally mean \"good\" and \"very good\" respectively.Like the Times, I take price into account, but I am not as price sensitive as Frank Bruni. If something is \"very good,\" it doesn't suddenly become \"bad\" because I think the restaurant is over-charging for it. I usually mention prices-at least for what I ordered-and you can decide for yourself if you think it's worth it. In borderline cases, I may award a slightly higher rating for a great bargain, or a slightly lower one for egregiously over-priced fare.Unlike the Times, I don't limit the star system to \"$25-and-over\" restaurants.The Times isn't entirely consistent about this anyway. And I will sometimes rate restaurants that the professional critics didn't bother to review. Note: For more on the stars, see this post.

Siam Inn is easily overlooked. The sign outside is small and humble; we nearly walked right by it. But for a happy, budget-friendly pre-theatre meal, Siam Inn is the ticket.Both Zagat (\"very plain decor\" leads some to opt for the \"excellent delivery\") and Michelin (\"plain dining room\") take swipes at at the ambiance, but this is misleading. Okay, it's not a decorator's wet dream, like Vong or Spice Market, but Siam Inn is both pleasant and easy on the eyes. The banquettes are comfortable, the tables generously spaced. There are white tablecloths, and service was better than some two-star restaurants I've visited latelyIn Michelin's defense, they are tough graders on ambiance, or what they call \"comfort.\" Siam Inn receives two couverts on their one-to-five scale. That might not seem very good, but quite a few fine dining restaurants in New York have two couverts, such as Artisanal, David Burke & Donatella, and TriBeCa Grill, so Siam Inn is in pretty good company. Notwithstanding that, Michelin praised both the cuisine and the service, and it was an entry in the guide that led me to Siam Inn in the first place.Anyhow, back to the restaurant: My friend and I shared an order of Thai Spring Rolls ($4.25), a generous and tasty portion that comes with three rolls, provocatively cut in half lengthwise, to show their innards.Menu choices show between zero and three stars to indicate the degree of spiciness. I ordered a three-star special, Duck Basil ($19.95), which comes with Holy Basil, White Mushroom, Garlic and Chili. I would describe this as pleasantly hot, but not the fire-engine red associated with Sripraphai or some Indian curry houses. The duck slices (boneless, with the skin still on) were tender and moist. My friend had another hot duck dish, which looked very similar to mine, but with different vegetables and spices.We both had a fun cocktail starter called a Blue Moon (sorry, I forget what was in it). The final bill, including tax but before tip, was about $62. Siam Inn (854 Eighth Avenue between 51st & 52nd Streets, West Midtown)Food: * Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: *

I had lunch at Nobu on Wednesday, probably my 4th or 5th time at the restaurant, always for lunch. (Accounts of two past visits can be found here and here.)As I have noted before, if you show up without a reservation at 11:45 or noon, you will invariably be seated. In the past, we've always been told that we'd have to be finished by 1:30, or so. No such guidance this week; even when we left, at 2pm, the restaurant was not full.I started with a salmon skin roll, which was very good, if not quite offering the taste explosion of the best sushi restaurants. My colleague and I shared four of the signature dishes: yellowtail tartar with caviar and wasabe sauce; spicy rock shrimp tempura; squid \"pasta\", and miso black cod. I think the squid pasta has lost a bit of its lustre; when you get over the novelty, it is really nothing special. But the others are all top-notch, and it is no surprise that they bring the miso black cod last. Although imitated a hundred times over, there is still no miso black cod like Nobu's.I finished with an apple crisp with cinnamon ice cream, and while you don't think of Nobu for its desserts, this was beautifully prepared and a sensory pleasure.Service was excellent.As an unrelated aside, did you ever wonder why you can't get through to Nobu on the reservation line? At lunch time, there are five phone operators sitting at a booth near the front door. They are the reservations department. While waiting for my coat, I overheard one of them telling the others about a recent social event she'd attended. The phone rang: \"Nobu, can you hold, please?\" After putting the caller on hold, she finished her story about the social event.Nobu (105 Hudson Street at Franklin Street, TriBeCa) Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: ***

Is there a sommelier in the house? An Olive Oil sommelier, that is?You'll find one at Fig & Olive. On entering, you notice a striking back-lit wall at the far end of the restaurant, with what look like wine bottles on display. But those bottles contain olive oil.After you arrive, your server drops off a plate of soft bread and a ceramic dish with three small compartments, each containing a splash of olive oil. He explains each olive oil sample with the kind of lexicon usually reserved for wine or liquor (\"buttery notes with an oaky taste and a smooth finish\" - that sort of thing). The bread, \"our freshly baked olive fougasse bread,\" is perfect for dipping. My friend and I couldn't exactly perceive the various tastes he had described, although we could tell the three olive oils were subtly different.Indeed, olive oil takes center stage at Fig and Olive. Almost every dish mentions which olive oil it is prepared with. For instance, I started with a Fig Jamon Goat Cheese Carpaccio, which comes with 18 month cured Spanish ham, warm goat cheese, sherry vinegar, and Aguibal Arbequina Olive Oil (from Spain, I gather). That's a lot of ingredients, but they go together perfectly. This was a terrific dish.My dining partner had a French-inspired starter, Saumon Marine Aux Trois Agrumes, which comes with marinated raw salmon, lemon-orange-grapefruit, chive, cilantro, and Moulin Baussy Olive Oil. This was a nearly entree-sized portion. (She had started with a salad, which was also an ample size, and she was quite pleased with it.)Both of these selections ($12 each) are in a section of the menu labeled Carpaccio and Tasting Plates, priced in the $10-14 range. Salads are $12-15, soups are $6.95, Tartines (served till 6pm) are $9.50-$13.50. Various tasting plates (vegetables, crostini, chesse, meats) are available; for instance, six cheeses for $14, or four vegetables for $16. Everything seems to come with olive oil and figs.Main courses (served after 6pm) are $15-24. I had the Salmon with Carmelized Fig and Orange ($19), which comes with Mahjoub Tunisian Olive Oil. This dish was not as successful as the starter. Initially, I was intrigued with the carmelized exterior of the salmon, but the dish had no staying power. About midway through the dish, I concluded that the fish itself was over-cooked, and dry.Service lapses abounded. When I selected a white wine at $36, the server informed me that it was not cold, and suggested another at $10 more. Now, I am always happy when a server directs me to a better wine choice, but when I have selected a $36 bottle (and this restaurant has plenty of choices at that price point), his recommendation should be in my range. I ignored his advice and chose something else, with which we were delighted.At another point, he brought out an olive oil, but then held it up to his nose and sniffed before describing it. My dining partner's entree was brought out while she was still eating her appetizer. After finishing my appetizer, I had left my knife and fork on the plate-clearly suggesting I wanted them replaced. Instead, when the plate was cleared, my dirty knife and fork were returned to me.The no-nonsense decor gives olive oil bottles center stage. Tables are metallic and rather closely-spaced, and the noise level is above average. Fig and Olive may be a one-trick restaurant, but its considerable charm in the olive oil department, at a moderate price point, makes this restaurant worth a try.Fig & Olive (808 Lexington Avenue at 62nd Street, Upper East Side)Food: *Service: FairAmbiance: *Overall: *

Perish the Thought: Kerry in '08??

***CONTENT
An article today on Yahoo! News says \"Kerry Positioned for '08 White House Bid.\" Egad! A second Kerry bid is just what Democrats don't need. Even his presence in the primaries will reinforce the party's image as soft, flip-flopping, liberal, tax-and-spenders. I don't think Hillary Clinton is electable either, but at least she's been tough on Iraq. Much as I oppose that war, no one that's perceived as soft on defense-as Kerry is-will be the next President.While Kerry has not formally declared his candidacy (it's far too early for that), the article says that he has maintained the core of his 2004 campaign staff, continues to build a network of supporters, and continues to travel nationwide raising money-all things he'd be unlikely to do if he were content merely to be the junior Senator from Massachusetts.The most memorable quote of the article goes to Ronald Kaufman, a former political director for the first President Bush: \"I go to bed every night praying Kerry is the nominee again.\" Yes, that's right, folks. Kerry is precisely the nominee the Republicans would love to run against.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Picholine.It seems that when I roll the dice with fine restaurants on New Year's Eve, I keep getting snake eyes. Restaurants tend to offer a limited menu-something they can serve to hundreds of people quickly and easily-at an inflated price. I was disspointed in Ouest last year (although I'd had a good meal there on another occasion), so I suggested to my friend that we take a step up the food chain, to Picholine, mainly because it's the best restaurant of that calibre near Lincoln Center, where we were starting our evening.Let me be clear: I did not have a bad meal at Picholine last night. But my friend and I paid almost $800 (incl. tax & mandatory 20% tip) for a dinner that, to put it charitably, just might have been worth about a third of that. A New Year's markup is fair, and to be expected, but a 200% mark-up? I am not so sure about that.Picholine was serving a six-course prix fixe at $195. We began with a quartet of amuses bouches, consisting of: (1) Cauliflower Panna Cotta with Caviar; (2) Peekytoe Crab Tartelette; (3) Goat's Cheese Gougère; (4) White Bean-Truffle Soup. These were all small, but together made a respectable first course.There was a choice of two appetizers. We had the Sauteed Foie Gras and Wild Game Pate with a Kumquat Chutney and Port Vinaigrette. (I haven't noted what the other appetizer choice was.) This was a superb, thick lobe of foie gras, and certainly the best dish of the evening.For the fish course, the choice was Maine Diver Sea Scallops or Wild Striped Bass with Truffle Toast, Salsify and Oyster Jus. We both had the striped bass, which was skillfully prepared without ever rising to excellence.For the meat course, the choice was rack of lamb or Scottish Pheasant with Crosnes, Dried Fruit, and Foie Gras Sabayon. On this dish, the accompaniments were better than the main event. One imagines Picholine's assembly line of scores, and perhaps hundreds, of pheasant breasts, and it isn't a pretty thought. Is high-quality pheasant available in such quantities? I found mine dry and tough.Picholine's cheese course is possibly the best in New York. We received a generous serving of six cheeses, none of them likely to be encountered anywhere else. We were feeling rather bloated by this time, but we did give a try to each of them:(1) Fleur de Maquis, a sheep's milk cheese from Corsica, encrusted in dry herbs.(2) Roncal, a sheeps milk cheese from Navarre, Spain. This was a hard cheese, and our least favorite of the bunch.(3) Le Moulis, a cheese from the Pyrenees, described as \"semi-firm, lingering, earthy, and fecund,\" whatever that means.(4) Winnimere, a wonderful raw cow's milk cheese from Greensboro, VT.(5) Sprintz, a cow's milk cheese from Switzerland that was described as \"hard, majestic and profound,\" whatever that means.(6) Stilton, a cow's milk cheese from England that had a \"mineral tang.\"All quotes are from the cheese menu, which (as always at Picholine) they give you to take home, with your choices circled and numbered.Finally, there was a dessert tasting, which consisted of four small mini-desserts on one plate. At this point my stomach was yelling \"No mas!\", but I gave most of them a try. I found them unremarkable, but perhaps I wasn't the best judge of things by that time. Mignardises, which I didn't touch, came with the bill.I've saved the most serious complaint for last. Picholine has a wonderful wine list, but we took our chances on the recommended wine pairing, at $115 per person, i.e., $230 for the two of us. At that price, we could have had two terrific half-bottles or a blow-the-doors-off full bottle, and had money left over. Instead, we put ourselves in Picholine's hands, and went home both poorer and disappointed.We were served just four glasses each, with no wine for the amuse or the cheese course. A little math tells you that they were charging $28.75 per glass, and for that price you expect the best, especially at a restaurant noted for its wine list. We were optimistic when we tasted the excellent sauterne that accompanied the foie gras, but what on earth were they thinking when we were served a red wine with the striped bass? I know it is not impossible to drink red wine with fish, but for a wine pairing it was bizarre. Moreover, the server advised that it's \"something new from Oregon.\" For that we were paying $28.75 a glass? My friend aptly characterized it as \"flat\" and \"lacking any body.\"For the pheasant, our server turned up with another red, which she assured us was \"something bolder.\" We couldn't taste any difference at all. Several hours later, as we were reliving the meal, my friend and I concluded that they give us the same wine for both courses. We are not wine experts, but we think we can tell when something allegedly \"bold\" is in fact no such thing.A mildly fizzy dessert wine came with the final course, and this was more suitable, but by now we were rather offended at what we'd been given for our $230. I've ordered wine pairings at a number of restaurants, and normally you get a range of provocative choices that present some strong contrasts, and really enhance the meal. Instead, we were simply ripped off. In addition, several of the wines were mis-timed (i.e., arriving well before the food they were supposed to go with).The space at Picholine is of course lovely. Naturally, the restaurant was packed. Our reservation was at 10:30 (after the New York Philharmonic Gala), and there were still people getting seated after us. Service showed the potential for being first-rate, but on such a night, naturally there were slips. On another day, I think Picholine would do a lot better.We paid $195 apiece for the food, $115 apiece for the wine pairing, 20% for service, and tax, for a final bill $795.93. At that price, the restaurant should be going the extra mile-nay, the extra light year-and they did not.Picholine (35 West 64th Street between Central Park West and Broadway, Upper West Side) Food: **Service: **Ambiance: ***Overall: **

Dim Sum Go Go

Mario Batali once said that there would be no losers when the Michelin New York guide came out-only winners. (His reasoning was that since this was the first guide, no one could \"lose\" by being de-listed or stripped of a star; there was only the upside of being listed, or getting starred.)Well, one of the winners-for me, at least-was Dim Sum Go Go, which I tried tonight, mainly because it was the closest Chinatown restaurant in the guide to where I live.Dim Sum Go Go (originally named that way, because it offered Dim Sum to go) has a funky, but obviously on-the-cheap, interior that's a step above the usual Chinatown decor that comes out of a Hollywood backlot. Most of the people eating there are caucasian, and I'm not sure if that's a bad sign. The restaurant was fairly crowded, but I was seated immediately.Your server presents two menus, one for dim sum, and one for everything else. The \"everything else\" menu looks like a typical Chinese menu, while the dim sum menu is a loose sheet of paper. You place your order by checking a box next to the items you want, and a pencil is provided for this purpose. Prices are indicated by Chinese symbols, and you have to find a code at the bottom of the page to interpret them. Individual dim sum orders (3 pieces) are mostly $2.50 or $2.90 at lunch, $3.45 or $3.95 at dinner. You can have a dim sum platter or vegetarian dim sum platter (10 pieces) for $9.95/$10.95. Dumpling soup with Shark Fin is $6.00/$6.95.I suspected that a dim sum platter wouldn't be enough on its own, so I ordered that plus Duck Dumplings and Pumkin [sic] Cakes. The drawback of the dim sum platter is that you have no idea what you're getting. I recognized shrimp, duck, and stuffed mushroom dumplings. The others were a wild fantasy of colors and shapes, and they were all at least interesting. Several were a bit slippery, and given my mediocre chopstick skills, did not easily make the trip from plate to mouth.I wouldn't recommend the pumkin cakes for a solo diner. You get three cakes about 4×2×½ inches. It's basically like eating the filling of a pumpkin pie, without the crust. About one of these is enough, before the cloying sweetness of the dish becomes overwhelming. The main menu describes it as a dessert (which I think is more appropriate), but the dim sum menu doesn't indicate this. I wasn't quite full yet, so I ordered a real dessert: Tapioca with Egg Yolk, and this was wonderful.Service was just adequate. You don't have a server assigned to your table; you just need to flag down one of the \"roving\" servers. Water was offered only on request, and servers had trouble keeping water glasses full, both at my table and at others. The server who took my initial order was so busy that he didn't even think to ask if I wanted a beverage.William Grimes awarded one star to Dim Sum Go Go in 2001, and in his view the main menu-which I did not try-is actually superior to the dim sum. I can't judge that, but I'll say that a meal of just dim sum is a bit cloying. Next time, I think I'll do dim sum as an appetizer, and then order another main course. At a total of $29.75 (incl. tax & tip) for nineteen pieces, Dim Sum Go Go was certainly kind to the wallet.Dim Sum Go Go (5 East Broadway at Chatham Square, Chinatown)Food: *Service: FairAmbiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *

Note: Danube closed on August 2, 2008. It is re-opened in October as Secession, a French brasserie with Italian and Austrian influences. The pseudo-Klimt décor remains in place, but with a more casual vibe. I visited Danube for the second time last night. (An account of my first visit is here.) It remains a wonderful restaurant for a special occasion. The Klimt-inspired décor is a gem, although it occurred to me that curtains in the main dining room would be an improvement. It almost spoils the atmosphere to look out the windows and see gloomy Hudson Street outside. Although Danube is a beautiful room—arguably one of the city's nicest (it shares the top Zagat rating of 28 for décor)—it is not a large space. As at many New York restaurants, you could easily reach out and touch your neighbors at adjoining tables. Luckily, the room is not loud. I don't know if it's because diners are speaking in hushed tones, or because the heavy carpeting and tapestries absorb the sound. There are three à la carte menus at Danube: Austrian, Modern Eclectic, and the Chef's Market Choice. Each has two or three appetizers and anywhere between two and five main courses. You are not required to order your entire meal from the same menu. Appetizers are $9-19, but most are under $15. Mains are $26-35. I should note that Danube has what they describe as a \"tasting menu\" at $85 ($155 with paired wines), but it is actually a four-course prix fixe (appetizer, fish, meat, dessert), with two or three options for each course. Anyhow, that's not what we had on this occasion. It is remarkable that you can have a very respectable meal at this fine restaurant for $35 total (before tax, tip, and beverages), if you order at the bottom end of the appetizers and entrées. Finding an inexpensive wine at Danube is more of a challenge, as nearly all of the selections on the long list are over $60. We found a very respectable burgundy right at $60. I thought the staff left me to struggle over the decision for rather a long time. At a restaurant of this calibre, a sommelier should come over without being asked. The wonderful amuse bouche was a small cube of smoked salmon, with creme fraiche, cucumber salad, and mustard seed. This was a variation on the same amuse that I was served the last time. The server who deposited it at our table had an extremely thick accent, and we had to ask for the description twice. The bread service was disappointing. Several choices of rolls were offered, but both that I tried were unimpressive. At Outback Steakhouse, you get a wonderful loaf of warm, freshly-baked pumpernickle bread. Why is it that so many high-end restaurants are content to serve perfunctory dinner rolls that were baked hours ago? The food was a happier experience. I ordered from the Modern Eclectic menu. The restaurant is rather long-winded in its descriptions. Per the website, the appetizer was described as \"Freshly Harpooned Sashimi Quality Bluefin and Hamachi Tuna, Key Lime Pickled Onion, Pumpkin Seed Oil and Sesame Mustard Dressing\" ($14). This was a wonderful dish, rich and flavorful. When the appetizer is this good, sometimes the entrée is an anti-climax, but not here. I ordered \"Chestnut Honey Glazed Long Island Duck Breast with Wild Mushrooms, Corn Purée and Seared Foie Gras\" ($31). The duck was luscious, tender, and enveloped in fat, while the foie gras was pure heaven. For the record, my friend ordered two of the Austrian specialties, an Austrian ravioli ($11) and the Wiener Schnitzel ($30). She was pleased with both. The tasting menu shows an \"Elderflower Gelée with Lemon Verbena Sorbet\" as a pre-dessert, and I believe this is what we were served. This was a palate-cleanser, which prepared us for the \"Original Viennese Apple Strudel, Crème Anglaise and Tahitian Vanilla Ice cream\" ($10). I thought this was just okay; nothing wrong with it, but rather forgettable. Service was generally smooth and polished. Early on, I felt that we were being slightly rushed through our meal. We started with cocktails. It seemed like only a few moments had gone by, and we were placing our order, receiving the amuse, and inspecting the wine—with our cocktail glasses still half full. Yet, it was over two hours before when we left, so things slowed down considerably later on. As we departed, the staff handed us a blue Bouley bag containing a wonderful lemon coffeecake, which we enjoyed for breakfast the next morning. While no one would call Danube inexpensive, overall it is very fairly priced for what you are getting. The New York Times ratings have been bastardized in recent years, and three stars isn't quite what it used to be. Danube has truly earned every one of its three stars. When Michelin's New York City guide came out in November, eight restaurants received one of the two highest ratings. Seven of those restaurants either have now, or have had very recently, four stars from the New York Times. Danube was the eighth. What this basically means is that Danube is, in at least one reasonable opinion, the best restaurant in the city that has never had four stars from the Times. There are a handful of other plausible candidates, but I've certainly no argument with Danube's extra Michelin star. It is one of the city's best fine dining experiences.

***CONTENT
Angelo & Maxie's Steakhouse offers a three-course lunch special for $20.99 till 3:00pm. For the appetizer, you get a tossed salad, caesar salad, or soup (today it was split pea). For the entree, you get an 11 oz sirloin, an 8 oz filet, chicken breast, or salmon. I did not note the dessert options.One of my super-scientific theories of fine dining is that you should never serve a salad with just one anchovy, as Angelo & Maxie's did this afternoon. It looks like a mistake. The rest of the salad was competent, if you can excuse stale croutons, but there was one lonely, soggy anchovy. Had it wandered in uninvited from another salad, or was Angelo's too cheap to put in another one or two of them?One would guess that an 11-ounce sirloin is the black sheep of the steak family. The better sirloin cuts will have long since been taken by other restaurants, or for heftier portions at this restaurant. Mine arrived rare (rather than the medium rare I'd requested), and without the thick char on the outside that the better steakhouses have mastered. It was, however, a better hunk of beef than you get at Outback Steakhouse.Well, what do you want for $20.99? Service was acceptable. The decor offers a nod to the faux art deco style, without actually committing itself to anything in particular. There is a cigar bar attached, which may be the most compelling reason to visit Angelo & Maxie's. The restaurant is part of a six-city chain, and they've got their own brand of steak knives. If it's great steak you want, you should buy a set, then take them up the road to Wolfgang's.A lunch special probably doesn't show off Angelo & Maxie's to its best advantage, so I'll probably try it another time at dinner. But I won't be in any rush.Angelo & Maxie's Steakhouse (233 Park Avenue South at 19th Street, Gramercy/Flatiron District) Food: SatisfactoryService: SatisfactoryAmbiance: SatisfactoryOverall: Satisfactory

The red neon sign at the corner of Park Avenue South and 19th St beckons me every time I drive by it in a taxi. I gave City Crab & Seafood Company a try last night, mainly because my ten-year-old son is fond of very few foods, but crab happens to be one of them.The space, on three levels, is massive - outfitted like an upscale beach town fish joint. Both Ruth Reichl and Eric Asimov reviewed it for the Times, and both of them said that it is loud when crowded. It was decidedly not crowded last night, although Boxing Day is probably atypical for a restaurant that caters to a business lunch crowd. We were seated at a high-top table with bar stool chairs, which was comfortable enough, but a curious choice given the many other empty tables.City Crab is one of those places that offers every seafood entree grilled, broiled, sauteed, fried, or blackened. I chose the blackened scallops, since I'd never had scallops that way before. I wasn't disappointed to receive five good-sized scallops (plus rice pilaf and cole slaw) for just $19.99. The heat of the cajun spices pretty much defined the dish, but I expected that.I foolishly allowed my son to be upsold on the crab legs. They were $29.99 a pound, which the server said was just three legs. \"Most people get a pound and a half,\" he said. So we ordered that much, which turned out to be a massive, $45 portion. Even my son, who is not especially price conscious, recognized the wretched excess. He could have had a new video game for that amount. The struggle to prize the meat from the claws eventually wore him out. Even the typical adult probably wouldn't have finished.The bread service was better than many higher-end restaurants, and I was especially impressed with the dessert menu. It was printed with the current date, and there was a named pastry chef, which I wouldn't have expected at this type of restaurant. My son particularly liked the oreo ice cream cake, which was perhaps the most impressive thing that we tried.Service was generally attentive until, most curiously, after we'd received our dessert. Finding our waiter to request a check proved to be a challenge, and we had a movie to catch. Thanks mainly to that ridiculous crab order, dinner for two was $80 before tax and tip.City Crab & Seafood Company (235 Park Avenue South at 19th Street, Gramercy)Food: SatisfactoryService: SatisfactoryAmbiance: *Overall: Satisfactory

It's the hottest new restaurant of the season-this year's equivalent of Per Se. Yes, it's Del Posto. Once upon a time, it would have been madness to open an upscale restaurant anywhere on 10th Avenue. Now, it's the home of Mario Batali and Joseph Bastianich's \"out-and-out bid for four-star recognition in a town where, as far as Italian restaurants go, three's the max.\" A $29 valet parking charge is the only nod to the restaurant's out-of-the-way location.Frank Bruni had a preview piece in the December 7th Times. The restaurant wasn't open yet, although with a swipe at the overlong menu, the setup for a three-star review is in place:Expect $240 rack of veal, $220 shoulder of pork and a $200 whole king salmon for four to eight people, to be carved within view of the table, in a flourish of high ceremony from the Old World.The proposed menu lists nearly 20 antipasti. It has more than a dozen pasta dishes, one with a jalapeno pesto, another with a tripe ragù, another with partridge.And there will be more than 15 other entrees, including duck wrapped in porchetta; guinea hen with pumpkin; squab with wild arugula.One can see where Bruni is coming from: none of the current four-star restaurants has so many items on the menu. Common sense suggests that when the kitchen is trying to do so many things well, there will be a few clunkers. Here's an early look at that long menu (hat tip: chowhound):Antipasti --PRESERVED TOMATOES, GRAPES, RADISHES AND BOTTARGA 17FIRE ROASTED PEPPERS and A SARDINE 13CAULIFLOWER SFORMATO with Skate Salad 15COTECCHINO with Lentils and Aceto Tradizionale di Modena 18GRILLED RADICCHIO TREVISANO with Fonduta 15VEGETABLE FRITTO MISTO with Bagna Cauda 15CARCIOFI alla Romana 13FUNGHI MISTI with Puntarelle 15SEAFOOD SALAD with Seaweed 19SWORDFISH CARPARCCIO with Lemon and Borage 17CUTTLEFISH and OCTOPUS in Zimino 16RUCOLA with Shaved Goat Cheese and Three Frichi 14TUNA, RADICCHIO, BORLOTTI and Agresto 13VEAL SWEETBREADS Picata 16SALUMI MISTI with Erbazzone 18FOUR ASSAGI DI PROSCIUTTO 17Primi --PASTA e FAGIOLI 12RIBOLLITA 12SPAGHETTI with Crab, Scallions, and Jalapeno 27RICOTTA and CHARD NUDI with Caciocavallo 21AGNOLOTTI dal Plin 23BUCATINI alla Gricia 18RAVIOLI di Brasato with Brown Butter and Thyme 23PICI with Cibreo and Black Truffles 30FRANCOBOLLI di Sugo Finto with Tripe alla Toscana 23GNOCCHI with Passato and Pesto 19ORECCHIETTE with Fennel Sausage and Swiss Chard 19PENNETTE with Skate and Fiorentina Tomatoes 19PAPPARDELLE with Wild Boar 21TAGLIATELLE VERDE al Ragu Bolognese 20BIS Two Tastes of Pasta Shared by the Whole Table 21/personTRIS Three Tastes of Pasta Shared by the Whole Table 25/personRisotto for 2 or more --RISSOTO with Pumpkin and Lardo 50RISSOTO with PorciniRISSOTO with LobsterRISSOTO with Barolo and CastelmagnoSecondi --ORATA in Cartoccio with Salicornia, Sweet Potatoes, and Puntarelle 27CACCIUCCO del Posto 29SWORDFISH Trapanese with Wild Spanish 28COD with Hake Mantecato and Clam Salad 28SQUAB with Wild Arugula and Sagrantino Vinegar 30DUCK in Porchetta with Savor and Celery 29RABBIT with Peppers Agrodolce and Eggplant 28GRILLED PORK CHOP with Cipolline and Cardoon Puree 28CALVES LIVER alla Veneziana with Polenta, Onions, and Brovada 27LAMB THREE WAYS Roman Style 30LAMB'S KIDNEYS Trifolati with Porcini, Scorzonero, and Hot Peppers 27GRILLED ROMBO for 2 with Stuffed Onions Briciolate 70STINCO DI VITELLO for 2 with Spaetzle and Krauti 70VEAL RACK for 2 with Chestnuts, Shiitake, and Black Truffles 85COSTOLETTA DI MANZO for 2 with Cesare's Beans and Escarole 100Per il Tavolo -- LEG OF LAMB with Carciofi, Almonds, and Rutabagas 210PORK LOIN al Arista with Wild Fennel AND Fig ConservaMIXED GRILL from the Macellaio for 6 with Chicory Salad 230SALT-BAKED ARCTIC CHAR with Cauliflower Ragu and Panelle 220Dolci -- GIANDUIA 15Chocolate-Hazelnut, Caramelized Pears, Creme SchlagBUDINO di Fichi 15Warm Fig Pudding, Pomegranate Sorbetto, Zabaglione, Salty CaramelKREMESCHNITTE 15Semolina Mousse, Celery Marmellata, Celery-Apple SorbettoCROSTATA di CIOCCOLATO 15Chocolate Tart, Orange Buttermilk Gelato, Cardamom SpumaAPRICOT CASSATA di Gelato 15Almond cake, Brown Sugar Meringue, Apricot-Moscato BrodoSTRUDEL for 2 30Cranberry and Apple Strudel, Stracchino Gelato, Apple Cider ConcentrateSPUMONE al Caffe e Cioccolato 15Amaretto Crumbs, Coffee and Chocolate CreamPALACINKE 15Chesnut Crepes, Persimmon Semifreddo, Rum GlassatoGELATI e SORBETTI del Giorno 12Three Tastes of our Housemade Gelati or Sorbetti There are also two tasting menus at $120 each.

You feel special the minute you walk in the door. The only other restaurant that has the intense warm high class feeling is the Four Seasons Grill room. Warm colors, great light. Everyone will look beautiful. There are few things that they did which were very clever. There is a large foyer down the middle of the restaurant which leads to a staircase and behind that is a glass enclosed kitchen. I would bet that 200 people could cook in there at the same time. It's enormous. On the right hand side there are tables for groups of 2-4 people. On the left side of the restaurant is the bar area which has sweet couches and a long sweeping bar. Up the stairs, on the left is seating for parties of 6 or more. In essence, the loud parties can't bother the intimate dinners for 2-4. Very clever. Here are early photos, courtesy of Eater:

V Steakhouse, Jean-Georges Vongerichten's high temple of Niman Ranch beef at the Time-Warner Center, is closing tomorrow. Vongerichten told the Times, \"We were not doing enough business to make it pay for the rent.\"The restaurant's business model was dubious from the start. Charging almost $70 for steaks available elsewhere for $40, V Steakhouse had to be almost impossibly good; it was merely average. Service was excellent, and V's appetizers were well above the typical steakhouse fare, but a thirty-dollar premium for the entrees just wasn't going to cut it.Frank Bruni's one-star review for the Times may have seemed unduly harsh at the time, but Bruni was prescient when he complained of \"Elaborate Dishes, Assembly Required.\" I was not impressed with V Steakhouse, particularly at its outrageous price point.The original concept of Time-Warner's \"Restaurant Collection\" was to create five restaurants under one roof that would all contend for three or four stars from the Times. Two of them in fact achieved the top rating: Per Se and Masa. Cafe Gray is apparently successful, despite a two-star spanking from Bruni. But Vongerichten has now failed, and the fifth tenant, Charlie Trotter, never materialized, due to escalating construction costs.Kenneth Himmel, who operates the mall for Related Urban Development, says he's now looking for a different kind of restaurant to fill the space. He told the Times, \"It has to be a bistro or brasserie, a kind of neighborhood place. We have to get food and beverage that people can eat every day and not just for special occasions into this building.\"Here's one more look at the quasi-bordello space that's now going to the scrap heap (courtesy Eater):

Note: Click here for a more recent review of this restaurant, which has been renamed David Burke Townhouse. Once upon a time, David Burke and Donatella Arpaia opened a hot little restaurant on the Upper East Side. They called it davidburke & donatella. The food was inventive and terrific. The space was noisy, but when the food was this good, who cared? It was packed every night. Flushed with success, Arpaia opened her own place in Soho (the undistinguished Ama). Burke took over the catering operation at nearby Bloomingdale's, launched a steakhouse in Chicago, and started planning another in Manhattan. With all of this extra-curricular activity going on, is anyone minding the store at the flagship restaurant that bears both their names? My experience last night suggests that one or both of them needs to start spending more time at East 61st St, ere DB&D becomes a sad caricature of itself. I still have fond memories of my first visit (eighteen months ago), but the restaurant is now misfiring. This was a year-end celebratory dinner with two friends who live in Boston, but have been working in New York. We knew that the transit strike would make it difficult to get uptown, and my friends suggested that we cancel. However, I was determined to keep the date. We hailed a cab immediately, but the driver had first to drop off somebody else, which required a bit of a detour. In all, it was about a 90-minute trip from our TriBeCa office to the restaurant, more than double than normal. Exasperated with the traffic, we left our cab behind at 57th & Park, and walked the last five blocks. (FYI, taxis during the strike are charging per person by the number of fare zones crossed; we were charged $15 apiece - $5 times three zones.) Transit strike notwithstanding, DB&D was fully booked. They graciously honored our reservation, although we were 40 minutes late. The noise level was just as I had remembered it: practically deafening. The server dropped off an amuse bouche, but we couldn't hear his description of it. We were barely able to ascertain that it contained no pork (which my companions do not eat). It was a small pastry filled with some kind of tangy meat-but what? The wonderful bread service that I wrote about last time remains the same. (\"Bread arrives - cooked in its own copper casserole, and steaming hot. The butter comes as a modern art sculpture that you almost regret cutting into.\") My companions are identical twins, and they ordered identically. They started with grilled oysters, which they described as unpleasantly gooey, and left unfinished. I had the Scallops \"Benedict\" ($15). This was two fried egg yolks, each atop a scallop, atop a slice of bacon, atop a potato pancake: in short, about two ingredients too many; a promising idea run amok. The bacon was salty and tough, as if left over from breakfast the day before. My companions did better than I for the main course. They had the Lobster \"Steak\" with curried shoestring potatoes ($40). They got an enormous helping of lobster, shaped like a fillet mignon, with which they were quite happy. Alas, I had no joy with the Halibut \"T-Bone\" ($38), which came with lobster dumplings that were both tough and gummy. The halibut was bland, and the portion was small. Although the restaurant has been open just two years, there is already a section of the dessert menu labeled \"DBD Classics,\" from which we ordered. My companions shared the famous cheesecake lollipop tree ($16), while I had the coconut layer cake ($10). This was the only course that all of us found successful, and the only part of the meal that I'll remember with any fondness. David Burke was in the restaurant last night, but he was in civilian clothes, talking on his cell phone. He's obviously not minding his kitchen, and he's not minding his website either. Visit http://www.dbdrestaurant.com/, and you'll be reminded that \"Thanksgiving is just around the corner.\" (It is Dec. 22 as I write this.) There are bugs in the site, and it takes several frustrating clicks to get to the online menu, which is outdated anyway. (The first click brings up David Burke's spring recipies, instead of a menu. The second click brings up a section called \"Our Little Nest.\" Another click, and finally you see the menu.) We wondered how difficult it would be to get a taxi home. Although there are plenty of taxis out, you can't easily tell whether they're available, because the meters aren't running during the strike. As we were all rather full, we decided to walk off some of the calories, and see how far we got. In the end, we just kept walking. It was about two hours from 61st & Lex to John & Gold, or about 6-7 miles in 30-degree weather. But it was a lot more pleasant than sitting in a taxi. As I observed last time, the tables at DB&D are packed as tightly as can be. Our table was near the front door, in front of the bar, and a long walk from the kitchen. Our server was pleasant and tried hard, but she was obviously very busy, and there were long stretches when we didn't see her. I ordered a glass of wine to go with the appetizers. I would have ordered a second glass of wine, but by the time she re-appeared the meal was almost over, and I didn't bother. They did manage to keep our water glasses replenished. Marian Burros of the Times rated DB&D at two stars. On the strength of my first visit, I thought that the restaurant arguably deserved three. On the weakness of last night's visit, it would earn only one. The bill for three was $228.50 before tax and tip, and there was only one alcoholic beverage (my glass of Riesling) in that amount. At these prices, DB&D needs to do better. For now, I would give the food two stars for good intentions, but only one for execution. Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

I'm now all caught up with posting my restaurant reviews, after a year in which I posted rather irregularly. Regardless of the posting date, all reviews were written within a few days of the visit. Most of the reviews are on eGullet also, although the ratings appear only on this site. The ratings are my impression of what a restaurant critic should award, if the restaurant always performed as it did when I visited. (In most cases, I have only one visit to go on, and obviously a professional review would need to be based on several visits.) My rating system is the same one-to-four star scale that the New York Times employs, although I allow half-stars. I also rate food/service/ambiance separately, in addition to providing an overall rating.

You could eat for a month at restaurants helmed by chefs who trained under Alfred Portale, whose Gotham Bar & Grill is one of New York's iconic restaurants.. After twenty years, Portale still delivers one of the most satisfying dining experiences you can have in this city. On a Wednesday night in November 2004, Gotham was packed.I started with the Gingerbread Crusted Foie Gras ($24), which was probably the best foie gras dish I've had. Who else would have thought of putting such a humble ingredient as gingerbread on foie gras? It was ingenious.It was really tough to choose an entree, as every item on the menu sounded good. I chose the Rack of Lamb ($39), which I suppose is a boring choice, but when in doubt the lamb will never disappoint. It came with two generous double-cut chops, mind-blowingly tender, and a potato puree that was a bit underwhelming. Portale's trademark is that he plates dishes vertically, so it was no surprise to have the chops delivered with the bones pointed upward, leaning against a potato tower.Service was impeccable. This struck me right at the beginning, when I took the plastic stirring stick out of my vodka & tonic, and laid it on the table. It can't have taken more than 30 seconds for someone to notice this, and come take the little stick off the table.My only complaint is the bread-a fist-sized wad of dough that seemed to have been baked many hours before. The crust had long since turned to concrete. If Kentucky Fried Chicken can turn out fresh, warm bread, why can't a three-star restaurant?Gotham Bar & Grill (12 East 12th Street between Fifth Avenue and University Place, Greenwich Village)Food: ***Service: ***½Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Nice Matin is beautiful to look at, but the entrees need some work.I ordered Sole \"Milanese\". It came inundated in an arugula salad of fennel, oranges, onions and olives. The salad was mentioned on the menu, but there was no mention it would be piled so high that you wouldn't know a fish was buried underneath. After some industrious digging I found the poor sole, which was not far removed from McDonald's filet-o'-fish.Another of my companions ordered the grilled sea bass, which she described as oily and over-cooked. My mother had a halibut dish that's not shown on the online menu. She said it was fine, but not at all what the description led her to expect.When we arrived, we were seated at a table so small and cramped that it would have been more at home at a cocktail bar. They agreed to move us, but we still ended up at one of the more claustrophobic tables for three that I've encountered at a legitimate restaurant.Nice Matin has the same chef, Andy D'Amico, as the dearly departed Sign of the Dove. When it opened, the critics generally were enthusiastic. William Grimes, never easy to please, was sufficiently enchanted to award two stars, which would be unusual for such a casual restaurant, even if the food were better. We didn't try one of the most praised dishes, the beef short ribs. However, on the strength of this performance, I don't expect to be back anytime soon.

Note: The Department of Health closed LCB Brasserie in March 2007, after it failed an inspection with 80 violations. Initially, there was a sign in the window that it was \"closed for minor alterations.\" But after a couple of months, owner Jean-Jacques Rachou decided to cash out and retire. Alain Ducasse bought the space, which has re-opened as Benoit, a clone of one of Ducasse's Paris restaurants.LCB Brasserie Rachou is an odd hybrid between the four-star destination that La Côte Basque once was, and the informal brasserie that it now aspires to be. The serving staff (many of whom pre-date the flood) are attentive and très correctement. The china and flatware would be at home in any three- or four-star restaurant. The patrons are all monsieur et madame. Every dish is served with a silver half-moon cover, which is removed with the obligatory voila!I ordered a cassoulet, while my mother ordered rack of lamb. Both of us were delighted. (I would note that the lamb came with four chops, which is generous as compared to the three I was served at Gotham Bar & Grill.) To accompany, we ordered a $35 cabernet that I reckon would have been $50 in many restaurants. In a restaurant of this calibre, $35 for almost any bottle is a steal.Most entrees are over $25, and many are over $30, making LCB Brasserie a bit pricey for a two-star restaurant, but for traditional French favorites it still offers an experience that has become scarce in Manhattan. I would happily return.LCB Brasserie Rachou (60 W. 55th St. between Fifth & Sixth Aves., West Midtown)Food: **Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: **

Tocqueville

***CONTENT
Note: This is a review of Tocqueville in its former location. The restaurant moved to 1 East 15th Street at Fifth Avenue, the opposite end of the block from its original space. The latter has become a Japanese restaurant, 15 East, by the same owners.Tocqueville offers a quiet, civilized dining experience. The design, muted and refined, has a calming influence, and unlike so many modern restaurants, doesn't call attention to itself. The dining room is small and the tables reasonably close together-yet, you hear your companion's voice without shouting, and you don't hear anybody else's conversation. Even if you knew no more, all of these attributes would recommend Tocqueville to the discerning diner looking for an evening's escape without busting the budget.I chose Tocqueville mainly to please my mother, who was visiting from out of town. She ordered six oysters on the half-shell, followed by the seared Maine diver scallops with Hudson Valley foie gras. She pronounced both superb-and she is not easily impressed.My choices, alas, didn't turn out quite so well. I started with a salad listed on the menu as: \"Cato Farm Connecticut Aged Dutch Farm House Cheddar\" with \"shaved fennel, frisee, roasted pears, hazelnut balsamic vinaigrette.\" That's quite a mouthful, and it looked wonderful, but was far too salty to my taste. I noticed that a diner at the table next to me left hers unfinished, so perhaps she had the same reaction.For the entree, I ordered the Niman Ranch Pork Chop, which is served with \"manila clams, fingerling potatoes and bitter greens with chorizo white wine and garlic.\" (All quotes from the restaurant's website.) The clams are an odd pairing with the pork chop. Once again, this dish was too salty, including the chop (which was thick and tender).Given my mom's endorsement of Tocqueville's cuisine, perhaps I just made the wrong choices. The restaurant was full on a Sunday evening, and I suspect many of the patrons were regulars. Service was efficient and friendly, although I grew mildly irritated at an over-eager server who punctuated each dish ordered with \"excellent! ... wonderful! ... great!\" On the other hand, over-eager is better than under-attentive.Appetizers are $12-28, mains are $27-36. Tasting menus are available for $75 (five courses) or $95 (seven courses). The wine list is pricey, with scarcely a bottle below $50. We lucked into a wonderful bordeaux at $48, which is about the cheapest you can do, but the pickings were slim at that price range. I don't think it would kill Tocqueville to offer a reasonable wine selection in the $35-45 range.Tocqueville (15 E. 15th Street, ½ block west of Union Square)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: ***Overall: **½

Just thought you should know the rift by Tocqueville on Pork with Clams is a Portugese dish. It is usually on the salty side.You did not mention the restaurant is moving a few doors down the street and going from 40 seats to 120 seats plus a private room.For the money I think the food at Tocqueville will surpass any food, even Per Se (I've been there 3 times) Maybe not the total ultimate dining experience, but in a blind taste test I'd bet most people would prefer Tocqueville food.

Note: Cafe Gray closed on June 21, 2008. Click here and here for later reviews, and here for my parting thoughts.A friend and I had dinner at Cafe Gray on a Friday night in November of last year. It was a 5:30pm pre-theatre dinner, but we reserved only on Monday. Even when we left at around 7:00pm, the restaurant was not yet full.At first, we were seated near a family with young children. (I can't comprehend taking small children to such a place, but one sees it all the time.) They were well enough behaved, but to be on the safe side we asked to be moved. The staff offered us a nice table for two right next to the kitchen area, and this worked out perfectly. Service overall was top-notch.So many people have recommended the mushroom risotto and the braised short ribs, so I ordered them. These dishes are indeed delicious, but they are also the most expensive items on the menu. After each of us had had a martini, a glass of wine, an appetizer, an entree, and a cup of coffee, the bill had come to over $200 with tax and tip. This is not an unreasonable sum to pay for dinner at a nice restaurant in New York, but the city has better bets for that amount of money.Some people love the space at Cafe Gray, and others hate it. After reading so many of the \"hate it\" posts, I'd expected something a lot worse. Cafe Gray is lovely, although the point of exposing the kitchen still eludes me. We had a nice time, but we were not transported. Putting such an elaborate place in the middle of a shopping mall looks like a gamble, and I'm not yet prepared to say whether it has paid off.Cafe Gray (10 Columbus Circle, 3rd floor of the Time Warner Center)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Wallse.Last November, a friend and I went to Wallse. It's a beautiful restaurant that could pass for an art museum if it weren't serving such wonderful food. On a cold fall evening, Wallse offers the perfect getaway from the elements.To start, I had the Spätzle (a kind of Austrian pasta) with braised rabbit, wild mushrooms, Brussels sprouts, and tarragon ($15). Our server guided me to this, and he wasn't mistaken: it was a wonderful dish. Both my friend and I were beguiled by the crispy cod strudel with a stew of carrots and ginger with black trumpet mushrooms ($27). Cod is the humblest of fishes. The highlight of the dish is the light, flakey, almost ethereal strudel crust that surrounds it.I don't normally have dessert, but who could resist when things were going so well? We shared the Quark \"cheesecake\" with chilled quince consomme and elderflower sorbet. The menu puts \"cheesecake\" in quotes because it's made with a very light cheese, giving the cake a consistency just slightly more solid than whipped cream. The quince consomme came in a separate dish, and it almost seemed superfluous to the excellent cake. Perhaps combining the quince with the cake would produce an even more successful offering.When Wallse called to confirm our 6:00pm reservation, they asked if we wouldn't mind showing up a little closer to 5:45. This happened to suit our plans, but I was mildly insulted by the suggestion. Although the request was phrased politely, the intent was obvious enough: \"we're trying to turn the table.\" My feeling was that they offered a 6:00pm reservation, and they should stand by it: serving the next customer was their problem, not mine. Indeed, I was just faintly aware that the efficient service was perhaps too efficient (the appetizers arrived just moments after we ordered them).None of this should take away from what Wallse achieves, which is creative Austrian cuisine, prepared to near perfection. Appetizers are priced from $11-19, entrees from $26-35. All desserts are $9. We had a tough time deciding what to order, which may mean that we have to go back!Wallse (344 W. 11th Street at Washington Street, West Village)Food: ***Service: **Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

***CONTENT
I had dinner last December at Scalini Fedeli. It is is a pricey restaurant that gets mixed reviews, whereas the New Jersey outpost of the same restaurant gets rave after rave. An underwhelmed William Grimes awarded just one lonely star in a 1999 review, but Bob Lape awarded three in Crain's New York Business. Michelin awarded one star, making it (in Michelin's view) one of the city's finer Italian restaurants.The on-line menu at Scalini Fedeli's website says that there are three options: prix fixe at $60, degustation menu at $70, or seasonal game menu at $75. Only the first was available when I visited. The menu showed over a dozen choices for both the first and second courses (some of which have price supplements). To these, the waiter added a recited lengthly list of daily specials. I find this extremely irritating. A restaurant of this calibre can afford to print a new menu as frequently as necessary, especially when the specials are so numerous. By the time the waiter gets to the end of his list, you've already forgotten the first thing he mentioned. It is too tedious to ask him to go through the whole list again.Anyhow, we both started with the Soft Egg Yolk Raviolo, with Ricotta and Spinach, covered in truffle butter. This was absolutely outstanding. The dish has been justly praised on several websites, suggesting it's a regular on the menu. Curiously, the menu on restaurant's own website doesn't list it, although the one on menupages does. By the way, the amuse was also an excellent raviolo, although I've forgotten what it consisted of.For the entree, I had the slow roasted breast of duck and leg confit with a mustard seed and black olive sauce. It comes with a Sicilian risotto. This was one of the more ample duck portions I've had, cooked beautifully to a medium rare temperature. There were a good 10-12 slices of duck breast, along with the leg-and-thigh confit served in a separate bowl. (I couldn't understand the reason for separating them.) The mustard seed and black olive sauce didn't quite work for me. It left an aftertaste that was just slightly bitter. It remains, however, one of the better servings of duck that I've encountered.My companion had the roasted veal chop in a porcini dijon and green peppercorn sauce. This looked terrific, and he pronounced himself pleased.After a pre-dessert of two sorbets, I had the carmelized apple tart (the waiter's recommendation), and my companion had the passion fruit panna cotta. I would judge the apple tart a success, but not anything special.Service was excellent. Tables are well spaced, and the noise level was low. The restaurant was a little under half-full when we left at about 8:00pm. On yesterday's showing, I would say the New York Times rating of one star definitely cannot be justified. Scalini Fedeli is at least at the high end of the two-star category. Further visits might show it to be worthy of three.Scalini Fedeli (165 Duane Street, just west of Hudson Street, TriBeCa) Food: **½Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: **½

Note: Click here for a later review of 5 Ninth.Frank Bruni's one-star review of 5 Ninth did not leave me with any eagerness to visit. That all changes when you receive an invitation, and your host is paying the bill. That's what happened one night last December.The building's facade conceals its intentions. It occupies an eighteenth-century townhouse that has seen better days. Amid the glitz of the meatpacking district, it's the building that time forgot. Only the brass #5 on the door tells you that you're in the right place. (My companion, who is not a New Yorker, had to ask at three different storefronts nearby before he was directed to the right one.)It's a narrow building, and therein lies part of the problem. The entire ground floor is the bar. Dinner seating is up a treacherous staircase (we saw one patron take a scary tumble during dinner). Most of the tables seat only two; all of them are small. No one takes your coat; your server just directs you to hooks on the wall.The menu at the website isn't much use. It doesn't show prices, and most of the offerings have changed anyway. Prices have also gone up. The Bruni review stated that entrees are $25-32. When I visited, they were $30-34. (I don't recall seeing any mains below $30, but if there were any, it was only one or two.) There was no amuse bouche, and at these prices I think there should be.Dinner starts slow at 5 Ninth. It was nearly empty when we arrived (6:30pm), but nearly full by the time we left (8:30 or 8:45). An empty restaurant is no guarantee of efficient service. A basket of bread was deposited on our table, along with a heavenly homemade whipped butter, but without bread plates or spreading knives. We thought that perhaps this was part of the meatpacking ethos-who needs plates when you can eat off the table?-but bread plates finally arrived after we'd had two slices apiece. Not that this bread was even worth the effort, as it was crumbly and stale.For starters, my companion and I were both attracted to the sardines. We each received two whole fish, quite a bit larger than usual, grilled crisp and just a bit spicy. Separating the meat from the bones required a bit of labor, although well worth it. We kept the same knives that we had used to spread the butter. I'm sure the staff would have replaced them had we asked...but you shouldn't have to ask.For the main course, my companion had the goat, which looked wonderful (it resembled duck breast, but I forgot to ask how it tasted). I ordered something called \"Mr. Clark's Pork.\" It turns out this dish is named for the farm where chef Zak Pellacio sources his pigs. From the description, you have no idea what you're getting. It turned out to be heaven for pig lovers: pork loin cooked in its own fat, along with another body part deep fried. This came with what could only have been a potato fritter, grilled flat, with a salsa paste on top.At the table next to me, a young lady also ordered Mr. Clark's pork. Unlike me, she didn't ask the server how the dish was prepared, and she was disappointed to receive a preparation with such a high fat content. It wouldn't hurt 5 Ninth to be a little less cute with their descriptions.We skipped dessert, but we were in the mood to finish with some scotch. \"Do you have any scotch?\" we asked. \"Hmmm...I think we have some Laphroig, a McCallans, a Johnnie Walker Blue, and maybe a few others.\" Here again, this seems basic. Either the server should know, or the after-dinner drinks should be on the dessert menu. Anyhow, we both chose the Johnnie Walker Blue. I'm a single-malt guy, but this was so smooth that I might just be converted to blends.5 Ninth has been open since May 2004. Service glitches should have been worked out by December. The artistry of Zak Pellacio's food deserves better.5 Ninth (5 Ninth Avenue btwn Gansevoort & Little West 12th Sts, Meatpacking District)Food: **Service: Not AcceptableAmbiance: FairOverall: *

Note: The Riverdale Garden closed in February 2007. The owners said they would re-open if they could find fifty couples to purchase $5,000 apiece in dining credits. Eater reported that they had found just 16.The Bronx is not exactly a hotbed of fine dining. The Zagat guide lists but twelve restaurants in the Bronx, and very few of them appear to merit a trip out of Manhattan. Well, at least one of them does. The Riverdale Garden is an oasis well worth the trip. Located just a block away from the 242nd St terminus of the #1 train, the restaurant is extremely easy to reach, and in a safe neighborhood. Valet parking is also offered.Inside the Riverdale Garden, you are transported by a cosy farmhouse decor, with white tablecloths and an exposed wood-burning furnace. There are a couple of sofas by the furnace, and on a cold night it was wonderful to relax there and soak up the heat. As you'd expect, The Riverdale Garden has...an outdoor garden. As you'd also expect, it was not open on Saturday night in January, but we peered outdoors, and it looks like a lovely romantic setting for a return visit in summertime.I ordered a wild mushroom risotto, followed by a braised lamb shank. The risotto was terrific, and the lamb so tender that a knife was entirely superfluous. My friend was equally pleased with the soup du jour and a tuna steak. For dessert, we shared a heavenly fruit compote with cinammon ice cream. We each ordered mint tea, which came in personal-size tea pots in a witty design I've never seen anywhere else.All of that, plus one glass of wine (my friend does not drink) came in for under $100 before the tip. I can't remember the last time I had a meal this good that stayed under $100. I was particularly struck by the fact that I had ordered practically the identical items recently at Cafe Gray (wild mushroom risotto and braised shortribs), and paid more than double that figure, although at CG we drank a bit more. There's no contest as to which restaurant I'll return to sooner.The restaurant was full on a Saturday night, with what appeared to be an upscale clientele. Service was friendly and efficient. Appetizers are in the $6-10 range, mains $16-27.

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Chanterelle. In mid-January, I had a business dinner at Chanterelle. My only prior experience at the restaurant was a lunch in 1990, which is too long ago to be relevant. Chanterelle is now just over twenty-five years old, with a ten-year stint in SoHo, followed by a move to the present TriBeCa location in 1989. The restaurant ranks high in New York's culinary scene, but just where is a matter of some dispute. Chanterelle earned two stars from Mimi Sheraton (1980) and Marion Burros (1984), four from Bryan Miller (1985) and Ruth Reichl (1993), before William Grimes took the restaurant down a peg with a three-star review in 2000. I have to wonder about the two-star jump from 1984 to '85-can any restaurant really improve that much in a year? By 2000, Grimes clearly thought that Chanterelle had lost a step, a view many of the web reviews confirm. However, since the Grimes review, the James Beard Foundation has twice lauded Chanterelle as best restaurant in America (2002, 2005). Yet, Michelin failed to award even a solitary star. My own experience puts Chanterelle close to the top of the three-star range. I cannot say that it is four stars. The menu at Chanterelle changes every four weeks. Many famous artists have designed menu covers for Chanterelle, but if that was the case on our visit, it wasn't drawn to our attention. Inside, we found calligraphy worthy of the Declaration of Independence. On the left was the table d'hôte three-course dinner at $95, on the right the six-course tasting menu at $115 (with wine parings, $60-85 additional). You can add a cheese course to the table d'hôte for $19. One of the entrees carries a truffle supplment of $20. Otherwise, it's just $95 per person, plus alcohol. As my host was buying, I didn't examine the wine list, although it is notoriously pricey. He found a wonderful Australian red, with which I was quite satisfied. We were served double amuses of chilled squash soup in a shot glass and a small crab cake (shaped like a ping-pong ball). Both were superb. While we awaited our appetizers, our server brought out two different butters for us to try with warm, home-made bread rolls. I started with the seafood sausage, which is well known to be one of Chanterelle's signature dishes. It's a sizable portion, and the explosive taste made it the meal's highlight. Might this be the best appetizer in Manhattan? My companion ordered the foie gras terrine, which he pronounced excellent. Almost five years ago, Bob Lape's review for Crain's New York Business complained that Chanterelle's kitchen doesn't always send out the advertised product. Both my companion and I ordered the \"Loin of Lamb with Moroccan Spices, Gateau of Eggplant Lamb Shank.\" I couldn't, for the life of me, detect any Moroccan spices in the dish that came out. There were four or five beautiful slices of rare lamb loin with a crusty exterior, but they were not Moroccan in any way that I could perceive. The braised lamb shank in an eggplant jacket was clear enough to the taste, if slightly bland. For dessert, I ordered the \"Pineapple Fruit Soup with Passion Fruit Souffle Glace.\" This was an unusual concoction, but I am positive that there was also grapefruit in it. Now, while I love pineapple and passion fruit, I am not a fan of grapefruit. I finished the dish, but had grapefruit been part of the description I likely would have chosen something else. After dessert, our server brought out two trays of petits fours. At this point, they were just showing off. A table of eight would have had trouble finishing the quantity of sweets that were presented to us. They looked wonderful, but my companion and I were too full to touch them. Our server also brought out a tray of small, freshly-baked cream-puffs, which I couldn't resist. Chanterelle takes a team approach to service. The dining room is small, and it appears that all of the staff perform all of the functions interchangeably. This leads to some service glitches, such as two separate servers coming around to take our bottled water order. Some of the plates weren't cleared quite as rapidly as I would have liked. These are minor complaints, which I would put in writing only because, at Chanterelle's level, I believe service should be practically flawless. I went home happy, but still feeling that Chanterelle is operating a step or two shy of its full potential.

Note: Click here for a review of Wolfgang's TriBeCa.In mid-January, I paid my first visit to Wolfgang's Steakhouse. I ate at the bar. The Gustavino ceiling is priceless, but it makes Wolfgang's noisy (and I was there before they really filled up). Carpeting, rather than hardwood floors, would probably make a big difference, but peace and quiet are clearly not the idea here.Like Peter Luger, Wolfgang's signature entree is simply labeled \"Steak for Two,\" \"Steak for Three,\" or \"Steak for Four.\" It's a porterhouse, but they don't say so. I was alone, so my options were the ribeye, the NY sirloin, the filet, or the lamb chop. They're all $36.50, so it's just a matter of preference.I ordered the ribeye, which was a hefty size and thickness, a perfect medium rare, and had heavy char on the outside. I was fully sated after finishing it. About four hours later, I had a distinct craving for another. One small strand of gristle was all that stood between my steak and perfection. It was still damned good.Also like Luger, Canadian Bacon is on the menu. It's $2.50 a slice, and you wonder why more appetizers aren't offered with that kind of flexibility. I knew I was in for a large steak, so I ordered just one slice. Oh my, but was that superb: thick, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside.Like many folks, I found the medical advice in Frank Bruni's review (\"Eat up, but don't tell your cardiologist\") of dubious value. It doesn't bother Wolfgang, though. A copy of the Bruni review is very prominently posted.There are plenty of FOH staff roaming around, although it can be hard to get their attention. As I was leaving, I was looking for someone to fetch my coat, and quite inadvertently I ended up presenting my claim check to Wolfgang himself. Momentarily flustered, he said, \"One of zee girls!\" (Any girl would do, I suppose.) A couple of minutes later I had my coat and was on my way. Until next time.Update: On a later occasion, two colleagues and I tried that porterhouse, which was amazing.Wolfgang's Steakhouse (4 Park Avenue at 33rd Street, Murray Hill)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: **

I had dinner at Sparks Steakhouse in late January. I was not impressed. The decor and servers come straight out of Central Casting. I suppose that somebody needs to act out the part of the cliche steakhouse, but because it's a cliche there's not a whole lot to distinguish it.My unscientific survey of the surrounding tables suggests that most Sparks patrons do as we did, and order the prime sirloin steak ($38.95). You get a thick hunk of meat, which the kitchen prepared it to a perfect medium rare. However, I found it a slightly tough, and also a bit too salty. The steak also didn't have much char on the outside. It was, in short, not the kind of world-class steak you expect from a high-end steakhouse.I knew a huge steak was coming, so my colleague and I decided to split a shrimp cocktail rather than order separate appetizers. Without prompting, the kitchen divided the portion onto separate plates. That was a nice example of going the extra mile: not many restaurants would do that, particularly when it was unprompted. I have no complaints about this dish, except that $17.95 is awfully expensive for four shrimps (two apiece).Sparks is known for its deep wine list. We shared a bottle of the 2001 Cakebread Cellars, which I mention only because it was terrific: an exceptional cabernet, at least to my untutored taste.It was not a bad evening, but with so many other steakhouses to choose from, I won't be rushing back.Sparks Steakhouse (210 E. 46th St. near Third Avenue, East Midtown) Food: FairService: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: Fair

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to BLT Fish.Back in May, two colleagues and I had dinner at BLT Fish. My sense was that Frank Bruni had awarded awarded one star too many. Mind you, a two-star restaurant is still very good. But this didn't feel like it deserved three.Our server got things off on the wrong foot. We said, \"Can we order some appetizers?\" He said, \"The kitchen prefers to receive your entire order at once.\" This is no doubt true, but it was an awfully clumsy way of telling us that the restaurant values its own convenience over that of its guests. Perhaps he should have just said, \"Sorry guys, but we have tables to turn here.\"BLT Fish wheels out impressive-looking whole fish. Red Snapper \"Cantonese\" Style was a gorgeous presentation, filleted tableside, but both the fish and the cantonese vegetables seemed a bit bland in the end. The appetizers, spicy Tuna Tartare and Softshell Crab Tempura, were more successful.There were two different amuses, both imaginative turns on \"bread & butter.\" But in one case there was too little bread and too much spread; in the other case, it was the opposite. No one came around to offer more bread.Vegetables are separately priced side orders, steakhouse style. Sauteed spinach was fine. Our server talked us into ordering Salt Crusted Sunchokes, which were mushy and not at all interesting.The sommelier helped us choose too excellent wines, both of which were a hit. All told, it was an uneven performance. I would certainly return, but the restaurant needs some fine tuning.BLT Fish (21 W 17th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, Flatiron District)Food: **Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: **

In early September, I took a friend to Annisa for her 40th birthday. It's a sweet-looking room. We were seated side-by-side on a banquette, which was an intimate twist on the usual arrangement.The Seared Foie Gras with Soup Dumplings and Jicama appetizer has been on the menu from the beginning. William Grimes loved the dish when he awarded two stars, and I guess the restaurant doesn't want to fiddle with success. Then again, when an appetizer is this good, why should they?For the main dish, I tried the Miso Marinated Sable with Crispy Silken Tofu in Bonito Broth, another dish Grimes loved. I suppose I should have trusted my instincts, as I've never been a tofu lover. The dish was beautifully prepared, but somehow it just didn't seem like tofu and sable go together. This item, like the foie gras, has been on the menu from the beginning, so I must be in the minority.Mind you, we had a wonderful time, especially my friend, and I can see why Annisa has garnered so many plaudits. In my book, it certainly ranks at the high end of two stars. Indeed, I am going with consensus, and awarding three.

Righteous Urban Barbecue (or \"RUB\") is my favorite barbecue restaurant in Manhattan. I've had several excellent meals there, and its location is convenient. Here are two reviews, the first from August 29, 2005:I went to RUB yesterday and ordered the burnt ends ($19.95). I've never had this dish before, but it sounded so appealing that I was willing to forego the St. Louis ribs, which are my usual order at 'cue restaurants.The burnt ends were really terrific. You get a plate full of juicy brisket squares, with perfectly charred ends and nice pink flesh with a real smoky flavor. I was not tempted to add any sauces, being content to let the intrinsically musky flavor do its own work. Side orders were the cole slaw (underwhelminig) and onion straws (addictive). To my surprise, the soda was free.In the mid-afternoon on a Sunday, I had no trouble getting seated. I'll certainly be back to sample more of the menu.This one was from just a couple of weeks later, on September 12, 2005:Another visit to RUB yesterday, this time for the Szechuan Smoked Duck. It's gotta be the strangest offering on the RUB menu, not at all typical for a barbecue restaurant. It's truly a hybrid dish, with the duck prepped as it would be in Chinatown, and then given the finish in Paul Kirk's smoker. The billowing layer of fat underneath the skin gives the duck a flavor explosion, while the flesh has the smokey bbq taste.You can have a half duck at $14.75, or a full duck at $26.75. Unlike most of the other entree dishes, it doesn't come with any sides, but the half-duck alone was sufficient for me. You have to be a bit careful, as there are a lot of bones to pick through, but the payoff is sufficient to justify the effort.The decor at RUB is really bare-bones. The food is what it's all about. (I later went back and tried the ribs, although I didn't write a review at the time. However, my experience on that third visit was comparable to the other two.)Righteous Urban Barbecue (208 W. 23rd Street, west of Eighth Avenue, Chelsea)Food: **Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *½Postscript: Though I remain a fan of R.U.B., it is no longer my favorite barbecue joint in Manhattan: Hill Country is better.

Note: My predictions of Mainland's success were ill-founded. It closed in 2006, re-opening as Ollie's Brasserie. That didn't last, either. As of August 2007, the space houses an Italian restaurant, Accademia di Vino.I dined at Mainland in early October. It's one of the few Chinese restaurants in the city that at least tries to be original. It is a lovely space. My friend and I were treated well. In this neighborhood, I believe it will succeedFrank Bruni's one-star rating was correct. The shrimp dumplings were good, but I've had better at 66. The Peking duck was good, but I've had better on Mott Street. The miso black cod was good, but I've had better at Nobu.Complimentary sweets served at the end of the meal were a nice touch. There were five little pieces of candy, each different from the other. Five doesn't divide by two, so I happily ceded the fifth piece to my dining partner.Mainland (1081 Third Avenue at 64th Street, Upper East Side)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: *

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Uncle Jack's Steakhouse.Uncle Jack's Steakhouse doesn't seem to get as much \"foodie\" attention as other New York steakhouses. I was working in the neighborhood one night in October, so I thought it was a good time to give Uncle Jack's a try. The restaurant claims to be \"New York's Best Steakhouse.\" While I haven't tried anywhere near all of them, on the strength of one visit the boast is not an unreasonable one.I ordered the rack of lamb, which came with a dijon mustard, rosemary demi-glace, and Japanese panko bread crust ($40). This was one of the top 2-3 lamb dishes of my lifetime. Absolutely outstanding. I also ordered the asparagus side dish ($10), which was cooked to perfection.I don't know where the custom arose that steakhouse portions are about double what they'd be in any other type of restaurant. The server described the lamb chops as \"lollipop sized.\" I suppose that's true, but even at that size, I don't think I've ever had more than four of them on one entree. Uncle Jack's served eight of them. The asparagus, too, was certainly ample for two people.Having said all that, I was ravenously hungry (having missed lunch), and with the food being as good as it was, I ate every morsel.My only pet peeve was the menu, or rather the lack of one. The captain said, \"I am the menu,\" and proceeded to recite the whole thing from memory. He was most patient, and his explanations were perfectly clear, but at these prices why can't they be bothered to put it in writing?The other sticking point is that diners not familiar with NY steakhouse prices might be surprised at the final bill, since the captain doesn't tell you the prices. You could ask about each item, but it's rather tedious to do so. He did make a point of mentioning that the Kobe steak was \"on special\" for only $100. I happen to eat out at steakhouses a lot, so I wasn't surprised at my $50 tab (before tax and tip). Others might be.That caveat aside, Uncle Jack's is wonderful. I'll be back.Uncle Jack's Steakhouse (440 Ninth Ave., between 34th & 35th Sts., Hell's Kitchen)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: ***

De Grezia is the foodie equivalent of a zero point one earthquake: it simply isn't noticed in this city of big, brash, publicity-studded restaurants. The family that runs it most certainly has no publicist, no menu consultant, no Internet site. Yet, if you put it anywhere else, De Grezia would be one of the finer restaurants in town. Here, it is barely noticed.The business associate who suggested De Grezia for a meal we shared in early October said he favors the restaurant because it is quiet, the food is excellent, and it's a pleasant alternative to yet another Smith & Wollensky dinner. He mentioned that the restaurant has several excellent private rooms that are perfect for a confidential business negotiation, because \"no one will know you're there.\"The restaurant is on the lower level of a townhouse. The decor is lovely and soothing. Service is highly professional. I started with an appetizer of black penne pasta studded with seafood (scallops, shrimps, calamari). The entree was a wonderful branzino, cooked whole. The waiter promised tableside filleting, but after showing me the fish as it had come out of the over, it was whisked away to be plated back in the kitchen.The 'buzz' some restaurants get is a curious thing. Two nights earlier, I found the Sea Bass entree at the much-lauded Hearth underwhelming. At the unheralded De Grezia, I had a far more pleasant encounter with another member of the bass family, the branzino. In my mind, there was no doubt at all which was the better restaurant.

On a Sunday night in October, a friend and I looked in on The Red Cat. The restaurant can thank Frank Bruni, because without his June review I would most likely have overlooked it. Things were only just warming up when we arrived at 6:00, but the restaurant was full by the time we left at 7:30 or so.Full marks go to an appetizer Bruni didn't mention: tempura of bacon, a wonderful if peculiar dish that's exactly what it sounds like. We both had the suckling pig entree (served only on Sundays), which Bruni mentioned near the end of his review. It was served \"pulled pork style\" on a bed of spicy, but slightly watery, vegetables and corn bread.The restaurant is to be commended for offering a reasonable selection of half-bottles of wine. When they were out of the $30 cabernet I wanted, they recommended a sensible alternative that was actually $3 cheaper.My friend doesn't follow the NYC food scene, but when I mentioned the minor controversy surrounding Bruni's review, she instinctively agreed with me. The Red Cat is a \"best-of-the-neighborhood\" kind of restaurant, precisely the type that deserved one star - as The Red Cat in fact received when William Grimes originally reviewed it for the Times.It is no insult for this type of restaurant to receive one star: indeed, the meaning of one star is \"good.\" The Red Cat is a good restaurant. We had a wonderful time and would happily go again. But for The Red Cat to receive two stars, a level carried by such restaurants as Annisa, David Burke & Donatella, Montrachet, and Cafe Gray, is overly generous.The Red Cat (227 Tenth Avenue between 23rd-24th Streets, West Chelsea)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

In late October, a friend and I had dinner at Gari. The place doesn't seem to be as crowded as reports after the restaurant first opened, so perhaps the buzz has died down. From the time we arrived (6:00) to the time we left (7:15), it wasn't full. I do realize that those are early hours for a Saturday night dinner in New York, but we had an opera to catch. If you're looking for another pre-Lincoln Center option, Gari should be on your list.We also saw no evidence of the service issues mentioned in some early reports. The staff was helpful, attentive, and efficient. We were also pleased to find that Gari is a rarity among Manhattan's newer restaurants: a place where you can actually hear yourself talk, without having to shout.It's rare that Frank Bruni covers a restaurant so well that there's really nothing much for me to add, but his two-star review on March 2, 2005, sounded all the right notes. I agree with the two-star rating. We weren't able to try as much of the menu as Bruni did, but we were most pleased with what we had.We had the sushi omakase. As Bruni mentioned, the restaurant actively discourages the use of soy sauce, and indeed there is none on the table. Our server made a point of mentioning that none was needed. I'm no expert, but this was some of the best sushi I'd ever tasted. Every piece was unique, and already perfectly seasoned. To dip in soy sauce would have been a crime, and we remained honest citizens.As others have mentioned, including Bruni, you aren't going to get out of Gari cheaply. The recommended omakase came with ten pieces each, which wasn't enough to sate us, so we had three more. None of the sake options was inexpensive, but we settled on a $47 bottle that we nursed through the meal. With edamame and dessert (a fig tart with green tea ice cream), the final bill for two including tax came to over $200 before the tip.This is sushi on another level of skill and creativity than one finds at most Japanese restaurants. I can't recommend Gari to people on a tight budget, but if you can afford the prices it's well worth it.Gari (370 Columbus Avenue at 78th Street, Upper West Side)Food: **Service: **½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

There was a good Sunday night crowd in the restaurant last night, but my friend and I were pleased that we could still hear ourselves talk.The restaurant features a market menu that relies heavily on local produce. The menu is printed on loose paper, and I suspect it is re-done every day. To start, I had the smoked bluefish. My friend had a pizza, which our server warned \"is one of our larger appetizers.\" Indeed, for many people it would serve as an entree. We both had the duck main course, an ample portion of juicy medallions with a luscious layer of fat around them.Main courses are generally between $20 and $30, except for the aged rib-eye ($34); appetizers are generally under $15. The wine list fits on a single page, but is not organized according to any system I could perceive. Nevertheless, I was delighted to find a modestly-priced cabernet that topped off the evening nicely.I suspect Cookshop will be a hit, and deservedly so.

Re Sette is an Italian restaurant (the name means \"Seven Kings\") on the edge of West Midtown, in a former 47th St Photo location.The designer pizzas are a great deal. The Pizza Del Re is composed of fig jam, prosciutto, carmelized pearl onions, and gorgonzola cheese. The shows it at $13, although I recall that it was just $10 when I visited there in early November. Anyhow, at either price it is a great bargain. The crust is thin and crunchy. This odd mix of ingredients comes together in a delightful candied flavor.The rest of the menu is formulaic. The fancy website's claims (\"A Feast Fit for a King....evokes a time when feasting and merrymaking ruled the day\") seem to me overblown.Re Sette (7 W. 45th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

***CONTENT
Here are two reviews of The Old Homestead (56 9th Ave btwn 14th-15th Sts, in the Meatpacking District). My first visit was in February 2005:I've been taking a leisurely tour of Manhattan's steakhouses, and last night was the Old Homestead's turn. The decor, the service, and the menu all scream \"old-fashioned steakhouse\" - in both the bad and the good connotations of that phrase.Where the Old Homestead diverges from the stereotype, it's in their extensive \"Kobe\" beef selections. (Perhaps their version really is from Kobe, but I suspect it's the American-bred \"Wagyu\" beef they're serving.) You can get a Kobe ribeye for two for something like $150. Also on offer: a Kobe burger at $41 or a Kobe frankfurter (the mind boggles) at $19.I went for the Gotham Rib Steak ($39), which they say is their signature item. Elsewhere it'd be called a ribeye. The cut of beef was practically a carbon copy of the ribeye I ordered at Wolfgang's a month or two ago. The preparation was respectable, but not quite as accomplished as at Wolfgang's: the char was less even, and parts of the steak were a tad overdone. The Homestead added a welcome helping of shoestring fries, which the Wolfgang's version didn't have.At another table, I overheard a couple who are clearly frequent visitors. They ordered the porterhouse for two ($75), which was served just as they do at Luger's, Wolfgang's, and Mark Joseph, complete with the familiar tilted plate, allowing the unserved slices to wallow in juice.The restaurant was not crowded, and there were plenty of servers hanging around. Despite that, the staff was not as attentive as it should have been, and my own server seemed rather bored with his job. I was served a piece of raisin bread that was practically rock-hard, as though it was a leftover from last Friday's bakery run.Although it doesn't get my vote for top steakhouse in the city, the Old Homestead is better than many. I'll probably be back, but not before trying a few other candidates. I was back on November 8th, 2005:I was back at the Old Homestead last night. I wandered in without a reservation. At 8:45pm, there was a fifteen minute wait for a table. The place was packed, and diners were still arriving as I left an hour later.On this visit, I had the New York Strip, which was perfectly charred and bright red inside, as I'd asked for. Aside from a tiny bit of gristle on one end of the steak, it was a top-quality cut, prepared as expertly as anywhere in town.The waitstaff look like they've been there forever, and they seem bored. I didn't receive a menu until five minutes after I sat down. I was not offered a wine list. When I asked for wine by the glass, the waiter declaimed as if annoyed, \"Merlot, Cabernet, Shiraz, or {inaudible},\" as if that were all one needed to know. I chose the Shiraz.On the plus side, at $36 for the strip and $9 for the glass of wine, I got out of the Old Homestead for several dollars less than one would pay for comparable quality at other Manhattan steakhouses. I didn't order any sides, but I noticed that most of them were priced at around $7 or less, which is less than the $9-10 that many steakhouses charge.In a neighborhood where there's a new restaurant every week, the Old Homestead seems to be just as popular as ever.

Note: After this review was posted, Shelly's moved down the street to 41 W. 57th Street. It has since re-branded itself as Shelly's Tradizionale, an Italian seafood restaurant.Shelly's New York, located at the other end of the block from Carnegie Hall, is ideally situated for a pre-concert dinner, which I suspect is where much of the clientele comes from. It was packed at 6:30pm on a Sunday night in November, but by 7:45 there was a noticeable clearing-out. With Carnegie booked every night, it's surprising that dining options nearby are not more compelling.There's a lot to like about Shelly's, including a terrific wine bar, designer martinis, and a large raw bar. My friend and I ordered the porterhouse for two, which was competently prepared, but won't erase my memories of the better Manhattan steakhouses.Shelly's isn't cheap, but for a steakhouse in Manhattan it is reasonable. For instance, the filet mignon is $38.75; at BLT Steak, a block away, it's $40. The NY Strip is $37.75, but it's $42 at BLT. The porterhouse for two is $73, but it's $79 at BLT. Overall, the steaks at Shelly's are a couple of dollars lower than you'd find at top-end steakhouses.The owners, Fireman Hospitality Group, are also behind the Brooklyn Diner, Trattoria Dell' Arte, Redeye Grill, and Cafe Fiorello. They don't aim high, but these places have all done well. Somebody knows what they are doing.Shelly's New York (104 W. 57th Street at Sixth Avenue, West Midtown)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Trattoria Dopo Teatro.The \"bow-tie\" (named for the street pattern where Seventh Avenue and Broadway cross at Times Square) isn't known for fine dining. On a Saturday in November, my 10-year-old son and I were getting hungry, and our options were dwindling. Neither McDonald's nor Bubba Gump's Shrimp Company seemed appealing. He doesn't eat ribs, so Virgil's BBQ was out.In this culinary desert, Trattoria Dopo Teatro was a happy find. Perhaps nyc.com exaggerates when they say that it \"has the feeling of a Trattoria that one might find near Rome's Spanish steps.\" Still, it is an attractive setting, located in a landmarked 1875 building. I especially liked the photos of the Italian movie stars that adorned the walls. According to the same site, \"The restaurant has a beautiful interior garden, called 'The Secret Garden.' It has elaborate mosaic designs, beautiful paneling, a working waterfall, a cigar room and a GRAPPA library.\"Pizza from the wood-burning oven can be heartily recommended. The one I had featured tomato and prosciutto. It was cut in eight slices, but folded back on itself, so that one would eat two slices at a time, sandwich-style. I don't recall a pizza being served that way, but it worked.We arrived (without a reservation) at around 4:30pm, at about the time the Saturday matinee crowd were settling in for a post-theater supper. Luckily, we were seated immediately. I should think a restaurant in the Theater District would be adept at getting patrons in and out quickly, but service was erratic.There is no children's menu-a fact I wouldn't ordinarily mention, except that one might expect it in this neighborhood. When I asked about it, the waiter said, \"We have pizza and pasta.\" My son was perfectly happy to have Penne Marinara (not actually on the menu, but any Italian restaurant can make it), although it came at an 'adult' price.Trattoria Dopo Teatro (145 W. 44th Street, between 6th Ave & Broadway, Theater District) Food: *Service: FairAmbiance: *Overall: *

Note: Click here for a later visit to BLT Prime, and here for an earlier one.BLT Prime is the only restaurant in Laurent Tourondel's empire that's open on Sundays. I had a BLT craving today [November 20, 2005], so I headed out to the restaurant, arriving at 5:00pm (opening time).Both BLT Prime and Steak serve a $28 entree that's a riff on the familiar BLT sandwich. Here, it's made with 'kobe' beef and foie gras, and served on toasted ciabatta bread. (You'll find a photo of it at the website of either restaurant.) It's about the cheapest meal you can have at BLT. I decided to give it a shot. It's a tasty sandwich indeed, but like the burger at DB Bistro Moderne, a bit of a gimmick. I could barely taste the foie gras, and the beef was nothing special. At the price, I rate it a dud.I had a couple of other complaints. The BLT sandwich comes with an enormous helping of french fries, but this isn't stated on the menu. It seems to be the only entree that comes with a side dish, so I had no reason to expect fries. My waiter happily took my order for a side of potato skins ($7), which left me with twice as much potato as I needed. (Probably four times, actually; either the skins or the fries came in portions far beyond what I could eat alone.) Had I known the sandwich came with fries, I would not have ordered the skins.By this time in the meal, the server assignments had been re-arranged. My new server came around to ask if everything was alright, and I told her I was a bit miffed that the menu didn't announce that the BLT came with fries. She remarked, \"I would have told you that.\"I was also unhappy with a cocktail called a Tamarind Margarita ($11). It came in about the smallest cocktail glass I've ever seen. The drink tasted fine, but one expects a margarita to be a little bigger than that.On the other hand, the restaurant is generous with extras. When I sat down, the server brought a helping of a wonderful pate and crispy bread. While I was devouring that, one of BLT's famous popovers arrived. The popovers, first introduced at BLT Steak, weren't initially offered when BLT Prime opened. I suspect they had some complaints, and now both restaurants have them. (They even provide a free copy of the recipe.) I did not order a dessert, but the kitchen sent out two half-dollar sized hazelnut ice cream sandwiches, which were excellent.Overall, it was a mixed performance for the restaurant. It is hard to believe that I dropped over $50 for a cocktail, some potato skins, and a glorified BLT sandwich.Well, despite my misgivings the second time around, I still award three stars based on superior overall performance.BLT Prime (111 E. 22nd Street between Park & Lexington Avenues, Gramercy)Food: ***Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: ***

Note: Django closed in September 2008. It was replaced by Vermilion, an Indian-Latin American fusion restaurant. A friend and I had dinner at Django on a Saturday night. There were tons of empty tables, both downstairs in the bar/lounge and upstairs in the dining room. I'm assuming the restaurant caters primarily to a weekday business crowd, and its location in East Midtown is ideal for this. Django is a very comfortable place. The downstairs lounge has huge armchairs, and there is a band playing light jazz in the background. The chairs in the upstairs dining room are equally comfy. This is a place where one can easily relax. I started with a simple grilled asparagus appetizer, and my friend with a risotto, both of which were out-of-this-world. Neither one is listed on the currently posted, and I'm afraid I can't report on the other ingredients. My friend pronounced herself highly pleased with a bouillabase entree ($29), which includes (per the website) \"Yellowtail Snapper, Clams and Lobster Stew, Salsify and Baby Leeks, Spicy Rouille Croutons.\" I decided to try the Ribeye ($35), which is actually a double-entree of ribeye slices and braised shortribs. Of the two, the shortribs were a bit more successful. The ribeye was fine, but didn't erase the memory of the better steakhouse ribeyes I've tasted. Our server earned plenty of brownie points early on. My friend likes sweet white wines. I had initially selected a $52 riesling. The server suggested that another bottle costing $2 less would be a lot better, and indeed it was. The $2 is obviously insignificant, but one grows so accustomed to \"upselling\" that it's almost a shock when it doesn't happen. The setting at Django is romantic, comfortable, and highly recommended. Django (480 Lexington Avenue at 46th Street, East Midtown) Food: **Service: ***Ambiance: **½Overall: **

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Blue Hill.A friend and I dined at Blue Hill on a Saturday night in November. I had the Foie Gras and the Stone Barns Pastured Chicken. The foie was competently executed (if nothing special). You expect ultra-tender chicken from Blue Hill-and you get it-but the dish was spoiled by an overpowering tomato sauce. My friend had the mushroom salad and the lamb. Oddly enough, she too felt that her entree was spoiled by a sauce that had too much tomato in it.On the plus side, my friend (who'd never been to BH) found the ambiance enchanting. When she left a third of her mushroom salad uneaten, the kitchen sent someone out to inquire if anything was wrong. (There wasn't; it was just a large portion, and she was saving room for the main course.) It's rare anyone will even bother to ask, and we were impressed that they noticed.IMO, there's a hole in Blue Hill's wine list, with not enough choices in around the $40 range. I'm not saying there aren't any, but they are few and far between. I asked the sommelier for a wine in that range that would go with the chicken and the lamb. She quickly produced a wonderful new arrival (not on the menu) at $38.Blue Hill remains a friendly place to which I'll return, but on this occasion both entrees slightly misfired.Blue Hill (75 Washington Place between Sixth Avenue and Macdougal Street, Greenwich Village)Food: **Service: ***Ambiance: **Overall: **

In late 2005, a friend and I enjoyed the tasting menu at Vong ($65) with paired wines ($45). The selections on our tasting menu were as follows:THE TASTING PLATECrab spring roll, tamarind saucePrawn satay, sweet & sour chili sauceLobster & daikon roll, rosemary ginger sauceDuck rolls, plumb sauceRaw tuna and vegetables, namprik vinaigretteNino Franco Rustico Prosecco, ValdobbladineThis was a large plate of appetizers, mostly looking like sushi rolls or dim sum. There were four of each item (two apiece), except for the duck rolls (one apiece). We were also each presented with a sauce dish with four compartments, one for each appetizer except the duck rolls, which already had the plum sauce inside. The sauces contrasted beautifully, and all of these items were immaculately prepared. We were delighted with this hefty start to the meal, and it was difficult to wrap our minds around the fact that four more courses were to come.CHICKEN & COCONUT MILK SOUP WITH GALANGAL & SHITAKESRudi Wlest Rhein River Riesling 2004, RheinhessenThis was a wonderful soup. I didn't taste much chicken, but the coconut and shitakes were plainly evident.STEAMED STRIPED BASS WITH SPICED CARDAMOM SAUCE, CABBAGE, & WATERCRESSJeanne Marie Viognier 2004, CaliforniaThis course was less successful. The bass was rather dull, and we were given far too much of the watery cabbage, which added nothing to the dish.ROASTED VENISON WITH PUMPKIN-LEMON PUREEAND JUNIPER BERRY JUSMas du Boislauzon Cotes du Rhone Villages 2003, RhoneThis was about as good as venison gets. It didn't taste gamey at all. Two slices were prepared rare, with a wonderful crunchy char on the skin.WARM VALRHONA CHOCOLATE CAKE WITHCOCONUT SORBET & PEPPERED TUILEDomaine la Tour Vielle Reserva Banyuls, BanyulsIs it any surprise that a Jean-Georges Vongerichten tasting menu would end with a chocolate cake? I'm not a big chocolate fan, but this was a dessert no one could pass up. It had a warm exterior and a molten center. Superb.Overall, the fish was the only course of the five that misfired. The cuisine had Vongerichten's fingerprints all over it, although one wonders how much time he devotes to Vong any more. (Pierre Schutz is the credited chef de cuisine.) The paired wines were generally well chosen, but I found that after three whites in a row, my tongue was a bit deadened to the red that came with the meat course.Service was attentive and precise. My only complaint was that our server spoke with such a heavy accent that we could not grasp his explanations of the courses as they were presented. After a while, we just gave up on him. (Thankfully, we were presented with a card listing the menu and the wines, which we kept with us all evening.)My companion and I felt that the courses came a shade too quickly. At more than two hours, no one would say we were rushed out of the restaurant. Yet, I sometimes had up to half-a-glass of wine remaining when the next glass was presented. Tasting menu courses tend to be small, and you don't want to be chugging the wine afterwards.By the time we left, the restaurant was full, and the noise level loud. Much as we had enjoyed our evening, we were more than ready to give our tender ears a rest.Update: Eight months after I posted this review, Frank Bruni of the Times issued a rare two-step demotion, downgrading Vong from three stars to one. It seemed a bit punitive to me, but perhaps some readers will dispute the continuing validity of my three-star rating.Vong (200 East 54th Street at Third Avenue, in the Lipstick Building, East Midtown)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: **½Overall: ***

Last year, Frank Bruni was underwhelmed at Capital Grille. Later on, the usually dependable Bob Lape of Crain's awarded two stars, which had me mystified. In September of this year, a vendor had suggested dinner, and I said my preference was a steakhouse. I grimaced when he suggested the Capital Grille, as I presumed Manhattan has much better to offer. However, he was buying, so I kept my thoughts to myself and trudged uptown.A wet-aged Delmonico (bone-in rib-eye) was done to the medium rare that I'd asked for, but as Frank Bruni put it, \"lacking the kind of crisp, charred exterior that would have given the flesh more variation from edge to center.\" A smoked salmon appetizer and creamed spinach side dish were competently executed, but unmemorable.I should add that all three of my companions ordered fillets, which appeared to have the charred exterior that my rib-eye lacked. However, a follow-up visit about a month later (again, someone else's idea) confirmed my initial impresions.Capital Grille has a slightly updated version of the classic steakhouse decor (mahogony surfaces, oil paintings). Service was slightly superior to the average steakhouse, including a genial waiter who explained the menu in considerable detail. The restaurant put us in a booth, and for four businessmen it was a bit cramped.Having said all that, Capital Grille illustrates the maxim that it's awfully tough for a steakhouse to fail in Manhattan. Despite executing the steakhouse formula with no particular distinction, the place was packed. Its location (practically adjacent to Grand Central) is well suited to weeknight diners who need to make a quick getaway to suburban homes.Capital Grille (155 East 42d Street near Lexington Avenue, East Midtown)Food: SatisfactoryService: **Ambiance: *Overall: *

***CONTENT
Note: Flames Steakhouse closed in November 2007, replaced in the same location by Giardino D'oro. Nick Vulli is still chef/owner. According to Restaurant Girl, belt-tightening on Wall Street led to a decline in lunch business, and the restaurant needed to morph into a less expensive concept. Apparently the excellent dry-aged steaks are still available, but as we define it here at New York Journal, the original restaurant is closed.Here's a review duet. First, my visit in August 2005:Flames Steakhouse has opened downtown. They've been there for about a month. It's operated by the same folks as Flames Steakhouse in Westchester County. The menu is identical in both locations. I paid their new digs late last week.Flames is modeled on Peter Luger, in that their specialty is billed as Steak for One, Two, Three, or Four; and the steak comes pre-sliced, served on a slightly tipped large plate so that the juices will accumulate at the bottom. Like Mark Joseph and Wolfgang's, they also have a broader menu featuring other meats, fish, and appetizers. There was a long list of daily specials (mostly fish and seafood) that the waiter recited. It always irritates me when a restaurant in this price range cannot be bothered to put its specials in writing, as it is difficult to keep them all in your head.The website says, \"You simply won't find a better steak than ours anywhere!\" That may be true in Westchester County, for anything I know to the contrary, but it is not the case in Manhattan. Their Steak for One was more-or-less comparable to Mark Joseph's identical offering, and a bit inferior to what I've had at Wolfgang's.Unlike Mark Joesph and Wolfgang's, the wonderful Luger-style Canadian bacon isn't on the menu. Appetizers all seem to be $15.95 or higher, and have in common the ridiculous steakhouse-sized portions that I cannot imagine how anyone with an ordinary appetite can eat. I had a superb New England Clam Chowder ($8.95) and was unable to finish my steak. Flames has the typical steakhouse side dishes. I ordered the creamed spinach, which was extremely watery and practically inedible.The clam chowder, Steak for One, and creamed spinach came to $70 with tax and tip, which I'm afraid is what you're destined to pay for a Manhattan steakhouse experience. The decor is rather unmemorable, but one doesn't go to a steakhouse for the decor.The verdict on this occasion is that the clam chowder was excellent, the steak was competent, and the spinach was awful. Service was uneven, but I recognize they're just getting their sea legs. As the restaurant is just one block from my apartment, I'm sure I'll be trying them again, although I'll give the spinach a pass next time. At the moment, they're open Monday-Friday; they'll be open Saturdays after Labor Day.It seems no restaurant category is more bullet-proof in Manhattan than the traditional steakhouse, and since 9/11 Mark Joseph has had the field to itself below Chambers Street. I don't think MJ has anything to worry about, but I suspect Flames will do well in a neighborhood where there isn't a lot of competition.And then, on December 8th:I dropped in again today, mainly because the restaurant is just a block from my apartment. I ordered a ribeye au poivre, which was an off-menu special. It was one of the best pepper sauces I've tasted. The enormous ribeye had a bit of gristle, but was nicely aged and flavorful.I have to wonder at the prognosis for this restaurant. The more recent Bobby Van's just a few blocks away was absolutely packed (I tried there first). Even the nearby Captain's Ketch was bustling. Flames was doing a decent trade, but had a number of empty tables-and that on a Thursday evening during the holiday season. Service was friendly and efficient; they wanted to please.

I dined with a couple of colleagues at Matsuri in early December. While William Grimes was convinced that the sushi was in the upper third, we considered it merely mid-range - which is to say, neither bad nor particularly distinguished.We ordered a sushi/sashimi platter that was described as a selection for five people, although the three of us went ahead and ordered a bit more after consuming all of that. A shrimp tempura roll seemed the best item on the platter, with honorable mention to some extremely tender tuna belly.The Times review described the restaurant's location as Chelsea. Nowadays, one would describe it as \"Meatpacking-adjacent,\" with the main drag of that clubby neighborhood within spitting distance of Matsuri's door. The restaurant is lovely inside, and we had a perfectly happy time, topping off the evening with Macallan 18's (and one of our party with an excellent creme brulee dessert).But we won't rush back.

A friend had asked where I'd like to be taken out for my birthday. I chose Asiate, where we dined on a wonderful Saturday evening in late November. This must be the most spectacular room in New York City, particularly at night. At one end of the room is a massive wall of wine bottles; on the ceiling, a glass tree-branch scuplture. Most striking are the wraparound windows offering unobstructed long-distance views of the skyline. On a clear evening, as it was last Saturday, we felt like we were suspended in space, looking out on a futuristic fantasy city.Asiate's evening menu is $75 for three courses, or $95 for the seven-course tasting menu. We selected the tasting menu with wine pairings at $145. Chef Nori Sugie has been at Asiate from the beginning. His adventurous way with food reminded me of what Wylie Dufresne has been doing at WD-50. He misfired occasionally, but the overall impression was highly favorable. Amanda Hesser's one-star assassination of the restaurant is a disgrace. Since I've been reading the Times, no review has under-shot the true merit of a restaurant by so wide a margin.The menu was as follows:Slow Poached Egg, Bonito, Ginko NutRuinart Brut Blanc de Blancs, ReimsThis amuse totally misfired. I did eat the whole thing, waiting for the pleasant taste sensation that never came. My girlfriend abandoned it after one bite. It resembled an eyeball suspended in a turd, and tasted not much better than that. I would guess that an awful lot of slow poached eggs have been sent back. Reading our minds, our server advised, \"It gets better.\" So it did.Seasonal Tasting DishesStrub Riesling Spatlese \"Niersteiner Paterberg\" 2003, RheinhessenTentaka Kuni \"Hawk in the Heavens,\" Junmai SakeThis is the set of six appetizers served in a bento box, much written about. The printed menu I took home doesn't note what they were, but for me the highlight was a candied foie gras that reminded me of WD-50's treatment of that same dish. There was an oyster suspended in a tangy green sauce. There was a delectable sliver of grilled striped bass. And three other items I don't recall. We much appreciated the pair of contrasting wines that went with this course.Caesar Salad SoupThis was totally funky - soup that looked like espresso, but tasted like caesar salad.Fish of the DayZoemie De Sousa Brut \"Cuvee Merveille,\" AvizeThis, I believe, was a black bass fillet, and probably the best single course of the evening.

The spaghetti squash salad and bitter chocolate beggars purse were rather more successful. After a string of perfectly chosen wines, the Robert Craig \"Affinity\" was an unremarkable cabernet-merlot blend that was not up to the elegance of the menu.Sakelees Goat Chees Bavarois,Beetroot Plum GraniteRoasted Pear Soup, Spiced Cake, Hazelnut Ice CreamGosset Brut Grand Rose, AyAt this point, we were ready to be wheeled out of the restaurant, after this much food and drink. On top of all this, we were served a birthday cake that was so good it should be added to the menu as a regular dessert.Our server was highly attentive, friendly, helpful, and professional. We were made to feel as if this was our special evening, as we had wanted it to be.Asiate is one of the most romantic spots in the city. If Chef Sugie's concoctions aren't always hits, certainly enough of them are, and he has my support for serving some of the most creative cuisine in the city. I look forward to returning.

This was my review of Bobby Van's, after its Financial District location had been open just a week:Steakhouses are busting out all over, and no wonder. The format seems infallible. The venerable Bobby Van's now has a Wall Street location in its stable. The place has been open just a week, and already it's packed. The new location is designed with an ample bar area, which no doubt will appeal to the after-work crowd.I had a steak craving this evening [October 20, 2005], and tried the Strip ($39). It was a wonderfully tender piece of flesh, cooked perfectly to the medium rare I'd requested, with a light char on the skin, the way I like it. As I live in the neighborhood, I'm sure I'll be back. The location serves lunch and dinner M-F, and dinner Saturdays. They are closed Sundays.Their prices are in the range of other Manhattan steakhouses, but perhaps a dollar or two higher per item. I particularly noticed this with the side dishes, which were $10 apiece. I've no objection to paying forty bucks for a steak, but another ten for the fries seems excessive. On the other hand the G&T was only $10, which at a nice restaurant in this town is on the low side.Service was pretty good, for a place just getting its sea legs.Bobby Van's Steakhouse (25 Broad Street at Exchange Place, Financial District)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Upstairs at Bouley Bakery.What happens when you cross three-star food with the service and ambiance of a diner at Grand Central Station? Upstairs at Bouley Bakery is the answer. I persuaded a friend to join me there yesterday evening [September 17, 2005].We misjudged our arrival time: at 6:45pm, all of the restaurant's indoor and outdoor tables had just filled up. It's all very frenzied. \"Find a table outside, if you can,\" the host du jour advised. When none was available, he reluctantly took our name. There is nowhere to wait-no bar, no lounge. We were advised we could hang out in the bakery, or take our chances and go elsewhere for a drink. (If you're not back when he calls your name, you're outa luck.)Fortunately, we timed it perfectly, arriving back at the restaurant just a few minutes before a table freed up. Once inside, a tighter fit is harder to imagine. Some people's master bedrooms are larger than this restaurant. We felt rather lucky to have a corner table, which was cramped like everything else, but at least meant that we had the din coming at us from two directions, instead of four. So tightly were we packed in, that our server had to lean over the backs of two other diners' chairs to speak to us.My friend and I both ordered the halibut that Frank Bruni raved about. This was uncommonly good, among the top 2-3 fish entrees I've enjoyed in New York, at any level of dining. Bouley himself was not in the restaurant, but his team is clearly knows what he wants.Service was generally acceptable until after we finished the halibut. We waited and waited for our server to come back, before we finally caught her attention to get our check.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Compass.As part of my effort to catch up on restaurant reviews, here's a duo on Compass. First, my visit in September of this year:I last visited Compass during its brief steakhouse phase, enjoying a wonderful rack of lamb on that occasion. The restaurant will still serve you a dry aged porterhouse or a rib-eye, but the emphasis now is on \"Creative American Cuisine.\" A friend and I looked in on the continuing experiment on Saturday night. She was last there with me three chefs ago, and pronounced the current version a significant improvement.There is a prix fixe menu at $32 (or $46 with paired wines). It looks like a good value, but the available entrees (chicken, salmon, or hangar steak) didn't suit our mood, so we ordered ALC. She chose the Gazpacho ($9), I the White Corn and Summer Truffle risotto ($18), a wonderful if slightly watery concoction.The restaurant calls its ALC main courses \"Compositions.\" There is also a section of the menu called \"Simply Roasted,\" which offers mostly steaks (anywhere from $24 for a fillet or $72 for the porterhouse for two); side dishes are extra, at $8. If you order one of the Compositions, I should think the side dishes were superfluous.Anyhow, I chose the Confit of Halibut, with Baby Squash, Artichokes, Picholine Olives, and Basil Sabayon ($28). She chose the Poached Maine Lobster with Potatoes, Summer Truffles, Leeks and Onions ($33). Both were happy choices, aided and abetted by a terrific Chardonnay on the wine list for about $40.We concluded with a selection of cheeses ($12), to which the restaurant added a selection of complimentary petits-fours (five apiece). As we were leaving, we were each handed coffee cakes to take home for Sunday's breakfast-a nice touch usually associated with higher-end places.Part of Compass's problem, I suspect, is that it's an unusually large space for the area. I don't think I've ever seen it full. Here's hoping that the latest formula will take root and flourish. And now, my visit of November 5th:I seem to keep returning to Compass, as it's one of the better mid-priced fine dining options near Lincoln Center. Last night, I returned with a new friend, and again I was not disappointed.We both had the $32 prix fixe, which for its quality is one of the better deals at this price point. I started with a salmon tartare, followed by braised shortribs that melted in your mouth. Dessert was a yogurt panna cotta.My friend and I dined at Blue Hill the night before. Now, if you asked a dozen knowledgeable people, most would say that Blue Hill is the more reliable, but my friend and I had no trouble concluding-at least on this occasion-that we had enjoyed our dinner at Compass more.With its checkered history of four chefs in four years, it would have been easy for Compass to wither and die. It has a large dining room to fill, but we found it busy last night. It's a pity Amanda Hesser demoted it to one star, back when Katy Sparks was at the stoves (which seems like ages ago). Compass is back.Shortly after I wrote this, Frank Bruni restored Compass's two-star rating at the Times.Compass (208 W. 70th Street, west of Amsterdam Avenue, Upper West Side)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

When this restaurant opened in 2002, the verdict over at eGullet was: \"Spicy food and slow service\". Three years later, Brick Lane Curry House has its act together. My friend and I arrived at 6:20 Saturday night and were out by 7:35, which was sufficient time for us to order drinks, appetizers, and entrees. The restaurant is now on OpenTable, which was what brought it to my attention.I started with Aloo Chaat, which is described as: potatoes tossed in a yogurt and mint sauce with spices. At $6 this is a bargain, as the portion is almost big enough to be an entree. My companion ordered the same thing with chickpeas, rather than potatoes. It has a lively flavor, and just enough heat to prepare the palate for the curry to come.Most of the curries come in a variety of preparations, usually chicken, lamb, goat, fish, shrimp, paneer, tofu, and vegetable, priced from $12-19. We both had vindaloo: she the lamb ($17), I the goat ($18). I'm not a curry expert, but there was enough heat to bring sweat to the forehead, water to the eyes. I found the bones in the goat a bit annoying. We ordered two preparations of rice and another of spinach to round out the meal, and had more food than we could eat.For the record, vindaloo is the restaurant's second-hottest curry. The hottest is Phaal, which is described thus: An excruciatingly hot curry, more pain and sweat than flavor. For our customers who do this on a dare, we will require you to state a verbal disclaimer not holding us liable for any physical or emotional damage after eating this curry. If you do manage to finish your serving of curry, a bottle of beer is on us.Brick Lane Curry House (306-308 E. 6th St. near Second Avenue, East Village) Food: *Service: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: *

The recent Michelin Guide for New York awarded the coveted stars to just thirty-nine restaurants, including just two outside of Manhattan: Peter Luger and Saul, both in Brooklyn.I never would have tried Saul, but for its recently-acquired Michelin star. It is actually a very close trip from my apartment in lower Manhattan - two stops into Brooklyn on the A; change to the F across the platform, and then one stop to the corner of Bergen and Smith Streets. Saul is just a couple of steps down from the subway exit, in the Boerum Hill section.The space is pleasant, but forgettable. The food is remarkable. You can see why the Michelin inspectors were impressed. We started with an amuse of hot curry soup. My companion and I both started with the smoky seafood chowder, which resembled a New England clam chowder, but with hefty chunks of smoked fish in the broth, and a helping of dainty micro-croutons served on the side. The soup was served in a slightly oval dish with its own ceramic cover, which the server removed tableside.For the main course, my friend ordered the sliced ribeye, while I ordered an off-menu special called the Lamb Tasting. This consisted of lamb cooked four ways with a bed of mixed vegetables and spices. The two most memorable components of the dish were a lamb sausage and a shreded lamb confit inside a fluffy pastry.For dessert, we both had the Baked Alaska, for which Michelin had printed the recipe in their guide. This was pleasant enough, although nowhere as memorable as what had gone before.I don't believe Saul carries a rating from the New York Times, but I have no hesitation in saying that the restaurant is serving three-star food - at least on the strength of this one visit. Dinner for two came to about $200 including tax and tip, which included a $45 bottle of wine.Update: After I wrote this, Pascale Le Draoulec of The New York Daily News awarded Saul the identical rating that I did: 2½ stars.Saul (140 Smith Street between Bergen & Dean Streets, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn)Food: ***Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **½

Note: Click here for more visits to Keens Steakhouse. Frank Bruni's review in last week's New York Times aroused my curiosity, so I dropped into Keens Steakhouse the next day to try that \"legendary\" mutton chop. I arrived around 6:45. The matre d' advised me that there would be no tables available in the dining room till 9:15, but I could put in my name for a pub table (where a full menu is served). I was advised there would be about a twenty-minute wait for that. I ordered a glass of cabernet at the bar, where the patrons were four-deep, and settled in. Keens may have New York's best collection of single-malt scotches (they say they've got 200 of them). The bottles cut an impressive figure across the back wall of the bar. Naturally they're available individually, but Keens also offers \"flights\" of four contrasting scotches, which go for anywhere between $28 and $48. I wasn't in the mood, but I'll probably sample them on a future visit. Before I knew it, the hostess advised me there was a table in the main dining room after all. It had only been ten minutes. I don't know if Bruni's review has influenced business, but I could see there were lots of people ordering \"mutton chops\" (which, as Frank has now told us, are actually lamb chops). Keens must have its own network of lamb purveyors, as I've never seen a cut anything like this before. Who else but Keens could be serving it? While I waited for the legendary chop, I enjoyed the complimentary warm bread service and chilled vegetables with creamy dipping sauce. I also enjoyed staring at the massive collection of churchwarden pipes that adorned the ceiling. The chop finally arrives. It looks massive, but this is a bit deceiving, as it's actually a T-bone, and the bone itself takes up a lot of space. After you savor a bit of the fat, you'll want to trim the rest away, leaving yourself with a substantial, but not unmanageable portion. Still, at two inches (or more) thick, with a peculiar wing shape, it's a meal to remember. Keens cooked mine superbly to medium rare, just as I'd asked. At $37.50, it's one of New York's better steakhouse bargains. (The chop came with sauteed escarole, which I didn't care for.) As I was leaving, the hostess inquired about my meal, and remembered me by name. That was impressive, given the hundreds of people in the restaurant, and the fact we'd only spoken briefly. I look forward to returning, and trying more of the menu. Including those scotches.Keens Steakhouse (72 W. 36th Street, east of Sixth Avenue, West Midtown) Food: ** Service: *½ Ambiance: ** Overall: **

Last January, a friend took me out to JoJo for a belated birthday dinner. This restaurant was Jean-Georges Vongerichten's flagship, before he opened the four-star temple Jean Georges. (JoJo is Vongerichten's childhood nickname.) Now that Vongerichten has a restaurant in every neighborhood, I suspect he seldom visits JoJo. I found it remarkably uninteresting on that first visit, but it was just interesting enough to merit a return engagement for the right occasion. Last night, I decided to give it another try.JoJo is located in a remodeled Upper East Side townhouse. There is a tiny bar space up front, with tables on both the first and second floors. We were seated upstairs, which is a considerably more romantic and intimate space than downstairs, where I was last time. When we arrived at 6:30, there was just one other couple in the back room. My friend whispered, \"Wouldn't it be great if we could ditch the other couple? We could imagine that this was the private dining salon of our elegant New York townhouse, and all of these servers were here to wait on us alone.\" We wondered why the fireplace wasn't lit on such a cold evening (perhaps it is not a usable fireplace).To start, she ordered the Peekytoe Crab Salad ($13), and I the Pumpkin Ravioli ($12), which was superb, especially at such a low price point. For the mains, she had the salmon ($24) and I the duck ($26). I had a taste of the salmon and found it bland, although my companion was satisfied. The duck was excellent: four thick breast medallions with a crisp crust and tender flesh; and a pastry filled with shredded leg meat confit. Several fingerling potatoes added to the lovely geometry of the presentation, but nothing to the taste. For dessert, she concluded with the molten chocolate cake ($10), and I had the cheesecake (also $10), which was again wonderful.Service throughout the evening was attentive and efficient, although I felt that both the appetizers and the entrees came a tad too quickly. However, the restaurant was not full, and at no point did I get the impression that we were being rushed out of the restaurant. We lingered for a long time over our desserts, and in total we were there for around 2½ hours.On the strength of this second visit, I retract my \"remarkably uninteresting\" verdict. JoJo is highly competent, and the upstairs seating areas are most charming. With plenty of appetizers in the low-teens and entrees in the mid-twenties, JoJo is one of the better restaurants at its price point. Still, there is a certain lack of sustained inspiration that one expects to find in three-star dining.Of course, we are in the Frank Bruni era. When The Red Cat attracts two stars, it's difficult to argue that JoJo isn't worth the three stars it currently carries at the Times. In a less grade-inflated era, I would probably have awarded two and a half.JoJo (160 E 64th St, just east of Lexington Ave, Upper East Side)Food: **½Service: **½Ambiance: ***Overall: **½

Two friends and I had dinner at EN Japanese Brasserie on Wednesday evening. EN is part of the city's new hip trend for big-box Japanese restaurants with Nobu-inspired menus. It is one of the pleasanter destinations in that genre. Our reservation was at 6:30, a time when the restaurant is still comparatively empty. However, we were impressed with the high ceilings and the wide spacing of the tables. Even at peak time, I suspect my companions and I wouldn't have had to shout (as we did at the comparatively claustrophobic BLT Prime).Service was about as efficient as one could hope for. Obviously it helped that the place was nearly empty at that hour, but a sparsely-populated dining room is never any guarantee of the server's undivided attention.As at other restaurants in the genre, you're encouraged to order a variety of small plates, and share. One is never sure precisely how many of these plates are enough to make a meal. Our waiter naturally advised us to err on the high-side; his upselling wasn't unctuous, but certainly we were aware of it. Anyhow, we chose four items, and once those were finished, ordered a fifth.We had two types of sushi rolls with different tangy dipping sauces, shrimp fritters, a tempura sampler, and the obligatory miso black cod. The latter didn't erase memories of the signature dish at Nobu, but all were wonderfully prepared. The tempura batter was crispy and light; the sushi rolls crisp and flavorful. This is definitely the way to order at EN, as I don't think any of these dishes would have been nearly as successful as one's only entree.If we had any complaint, it was the speed at which the dishes arrived. The trend at these \"small plate\" restaurants is to deliver the food at the chef's convenience, instead of the customer's. After we ordered, it seemed we barely had time to blink before the food came trooping gaily out of the kitchen. It's not that they needed our table; I just think it's the way the restaurant is put together.EN has one of the most ridiculously over-engineered, yet simultaneously unhelpful, websites . The menu shown there is far from complete. Frank Bruni complained of \"an extremely long, confusing menu\" in his one-star review. It appears there has been some simplification since then. The menu is now a single page, which makes it shorter than the Nobu menu.As at any Japanese restaurant, it's easy to spend a ton of money in a hurry. But our experience at EN showed that it is by no means necessary. We were out of there for $35 a head, including tax and tip, but without any alcohol.EN Japanese Brasserie (435 Hudson Street at Leroy Street, Hudson Square)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: **Overall: **

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to BLT Prime.I dined at BLT Prime last week. Laurent Tourondel has now refined the BLT formula to a science, and the third restaurant in the chain is a triumph. (See also BLT Steak and BLT Fish.)We started with two 'bread' amuses. The first was a sourdough bread with chicken liver pate. Second was a very fresh, soft garlic bread roll. For appetizers, two of us had the Grilled Double Cut Canadian Bacon ($9). These bacon strips are similar to those at Peter Luger. They aren't quite as thick as at Luger, but you get four of them on the plate, and they are lightly seasoned. My other colleague ordered the Tuna Tartare ($14), which was also an enormous helping, and he pronounced himself satisfied.BLT serves its porterhouse pre-sliced, as in the Luger/Wolfgang's model. Unlike those restaurants, it is offered only for two. As there were three of us, we ordered the porterhouse ($79) and the 12 oz. kobe ribeye ($72). We divided on which was the more flavorful, although the porterhouse, which feeds two with some left to spare, is clearly the far better deal.For side orders, we chose the onion rings ($8), the bleu cheese tater tots ($7), and the asparagus ($8). The menu at BLT Prime seems almost diabolically designed to encourage you to over-order. I don't believe a person with a normal appetite can finish an appetizer, their share of a porterhouse, and one of these ample side dishes, especially if you've also ordered wine. We ended the meal happy, but with quite a lot of food remaining on the table.Only one of us could even dream of entertaining dessert. My colleague ordered the banana cream pie, which he said was heavenly. I strenuously resisted his suggestion of after-dinner drinks, but he insisted, so we finished the evening with 18-year Highland Park whisky.For future reference, I'd say that three people of normal appetites would have plenty to eat if they ordered an appetizer apiece, and shared the porterhouse and two sides between them. Occasional glances around other tables confirmed that portions are enormous, practically no matter what you order.All three of the BLT restaurants have been instant hits. BLT prime was full to the gills, and it was hard to carry on a conversation over the din. That's about the only negative at a restaurant that clicks on all cylinders. Incidentally, BLT Prime is now the #1 steakhouse in the city on Zagat. It is tied with Peter Luger with a 27 food rating, but has higher service and decor ratings (23/23 respectively for BLTP; 19/14 for PL).BLT Prime (111 East 22nd Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, Gramercy)

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to db bistro moderne.db bistro moderne is the least formal of Daniel Boulud's New York properties. The menu is organized by ingredients, instead of the usual appetizer/entree split. The categories are in French (hommard, thon, artichaut, etc.), but the descriptions of the items in each category are in English. You have to notice an \"AP\" or \"MC\" next to the price to identify whether the item is an appetizer or a main course. You can also look at the price itself: db's entrees are remarkably consistent, at about $28-34 apiece regardless of the item.I just had to try the \"Original db Burger,\" to find out what a $29 hamburger tastes like. The menu says it's a \"Sirloin Burger filled with Braised Short Ribs, Foie Gras and Black Tuffles.\" I was not able to identify all of those ingredients from the taste. It's thick (to accommodate all of the goodies stuffed inside), but not very large. Getting your mouth around it is a challenge, somewhat like a three-decker sandwhich at a Jewish deli.Was it a very fine hamburger? Yes. Do I recommend spending $29 on it? No. Rounding out the meal was a smoked salmon appetizer ($14) that was perfectly competent, but not a patch on what I had at Ouest a couple of weeks ago.The burger and the salmon are both found in a section of the menu labeled \"Specialities De La Maison.\" Gimmicks of the house seemed more like it. I saw a lot coming out of the db kitchen that appealed to me. Neither of these really did the trick. If I go again, I'll try something else. At $72 per person (including drinks, tax, and tip), I think this town has better bargains for your money.db bistro moderne (55 West 44th Street between Fifth & Sixth Avenues, West Midtown)

Last night's Cheney-Edwards debate was a draw. Both men scored points. Both men missed opportunities. The \"insta-polls\" afterwards went either way, depending on which network you watched. There were no obvious gaffes on either side. Both sides can claim victory...of a sort.From Bush's point of view, Cheney had to stop the bleeding. With Bush having clearly lost last week's encounter in Miami, the campaign could ill afford another drubbing. Whether Cheney won or not, he was at least solid. I doubt that Cheney persuaded any Kerry supporters to switch sides, but at least he reassured a nervous Republican base.From Kerry's point of view, Edwards matched blows for 90 minutes with the Vice President and managed to appear substantially his political equal. When you're the challenger, your first goal is simply to demonstrate that you belong there. To the undecided voters who still matter, Edwards showed he belonged. No undecided voters will choose Kerry-Edwards as a result of this debate, but at least Edwards gave them no reason to choose Bush.So, it was a draw. Vice Presidential debates historically are not relevant to the final outcome, and it appears this wasn't the one to change that trend. The stakes remain high for the two remaining Bush-Kerry debates.

In the first of their three debates, John F. Kerry appears to have scored a victory over President Bush. I haven't found any source outside of the Bush campaign that believes the President won. Every journalist, pundit or commentator - of whatever party - declares it a Kerry victory or a tie.Assuming, charitably, that it was a tie, you have to assume that the debate helped Kerry. In any election involving an incumbent, the challenger's first task is to persuade the voters that he's a plausible commander-in-chief. No matter how vulnerable the incumbent may be (and Bush is as vulnerable as any), no challenger can be elected until he passes that threshold. Merely by standing toe-to-toe with Bush and not wilting, John Kerry, perhaps for the first time, seemed Presidential.I'm obviously not much of a pundit, because I initially thought Bush had won. Although Kerry was articulate and poised, he seemed stiff and humorless. Bush imbued his answers with the folksy, unsubtle, no-nonsense Southern twang that voters four years ago found appealing. There wasn't much levity in the debate, but such as it was, it came from the incumbent. On a gut level, I thought that Bush did a better job of making an emotional connection with his audience.But Bush stammered through several of his answers, and he was clearly on the defensive. I was disappointed that moderator Jim Lehrer spent so much of the debate (at least 2/3rds of it) re-hashing the rationale for invading Iraq. While the candidates clearly disagree on whether the war was a mistake, after an hour they were just repeating themselves.Kerry supporters shouldn't get too giddy. Post-debate insta-polls initially showed Al Gore winning the first debate in 2000. By the time the punditocracy was finished dissecting Gore's performance, he had lost. It will take a few days to see whether Kerry's solid performance last night actually made a difference to persuadable voters. What's more, there are two Presidental debates to go, plus a Cheney-Edwards tilt next Tuesday. Any one of them could produce one of those defining moments that changes an election.

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Danube.Last night, I had a wonderful dinner at Danube. A vendor was buying, and he asked if I had a favorite. I approach my restaurant life a little differently. An invitation to dinner is opportunity to try someplace I've never been. Danube came immediately to mind.This is one of those restaurants that hardly ever attracts an unfavorable comment. It is almost universally adored, and for good reason. From its Klimmt-inspired decor to its impeccable service, everything at Danube is well thought out and smartly executed. Whether it's a romantic occasion, a business dinner, or a birthday celebration, Danube delivers a memorable experience.The amuse bouche was a tiny salmon square on a bed of avocado cream. To start, my dining companion and I both chose the what I called the double foie gras ($19), which came with a conventional seared Hudson Valley foie gras and an odd confection called \"Crème Brûlee of Foie Gras with Harvest Corn Goulash.\" If you love foie gras, then twice as much of it is heaven. My only complaint is that the crème brûlee was at an in-between temperature: it had been allowed to cool a bit too long.I almost never order Wiener Schnitzel, but I figured that if any restaurant was going to make it memorable, Danube would. (I also concluded that if you're at an Austrian-themed restaurant, you should try some Austrian food. My colleague concluded the same, and ordered the goulash.) The Wiener Schnitzel came with austrian crescent potatoes, cucumber salad, and a lingonberry sauce. I must say that I was initially underwhelmed, but the dish grew on me, and I was sad to take the last bite. The light breading was just perfectly fluffy, the veal succulent and tender. Still, part of me wondered if this really deserved to be a $30 entree.Desserts at Danube are mostly Austro-Germanic specialities, such as Caramel Strudel and Sacher Torte. I tried a pina colada ice cream dish, which is not shown on the restaurant's website, and I can't quite recall how it was put together. After this, a plate full of chocolates arrived, which I struggled (in vain) to resist.Danube offers a vast array of menus. As at many uscale restaurants, the first page shows the tasting menu (five courses, $75; or, $135 with wine pairings). The nine-course degustation is $95. A four-course seasonal menu is $55. There are three à la carte sections of the menu: the Austrian specialties, \"Modern Eclectic,\" and the chef's weekly market choices. Appetizers are $9-19; entrees are $26-35.You'll pay handsomely for your experience at Danube, but it is well worth it. A glance at the bill showed a bottom line of $270, which included more wine than was strictly necessary. But then, there's no point in doing Danube half-way. Go and enjoy yourself.Danube (30 Hudson Street at Duane Street, TriBeCa)

Is the Clock Running Out on Kerry?

Slowly but surely, John Kerry is eating into George W. Bush's post-RNC lead. Yesterday, in fact, brought the first poll since August with Kerry in the lead, albeit by a statistically insignificant one percent.Poll results vary widely, depending on the method used to normalize demographic groups and identify \"likely\" voters. The same polling consortium (Investors Business Daily/Christian Science Monitor) showed just a 3-point Bush lead after the convention, which is a lot less than the 12-point lead that Gallup and some other polls showed. It will take a lot more than just one poll to persuade anybody that Kerry actually has lead.In the meantime, Kerry is fighting a perception of inevitability. Recent New York Times and Washington Post polls show that around 60% of voters - regardless of whom they personally favor - expect Bush to win a second term. The perception of being a loser infects a campaign like cancer. As Howard Kurtz puts it in today's Washington Post online: It's not just who's ahead-most of all the in Key Battleground States-but who people think is going to win. By that measure, the election is a runaway...Why does this matter? For one thing, it means Kerry hasn't really gotten over the threshold. If people don't think he's got a real shot at winning, it depresses interest in the election and means they spend less time, if any at all, trying to envision him as commander-in-chief. That, in turn, makes it harder for him to reduce the stature gap that any challenger faces against an incumbent.Also affected is the conventional wisdom in the press. Every story about Kerry is framed in some way by him being behind in the polls. By October, you might start seeing pieces about which of Bush's Cabinet members would stick around in 2005, or whether the president will get serious about tax simplification. That sends a subtle message as well: Kerry is looking like a long shot.So Kerry not only has to catch up (to the degree these volatile polls show him behind), but has to be perceived as catching up. Which is why the media zeitgeist after the first debate will be so important, because it will affect the other debates as well.Kurtz goes on to remind us what happened after Kerry's surprise victory in the Iowa caucuses. He became the instant favorite in all of the other state races (and eventually won nearly all of them), simply because swing voters like to go with a winner. So while Kerry gradually gnaws away at Bush's lead, an aura of inevitability still surrounds Bush's re-election, which in turn depresses the turnout the Democrats so desperately need if they are to capture the White House.

A Final Trip to Bedrock for 9/11 Families

On Saturday, relatives of 9/11 victims had the chance to descend to the bedrock at Ground Zero, as they've done very year for the last three, knowing -- as the Daily News put it -- that \"the descent to the hallowed ground may be their last.\" The reason is that, by this time next year, construction of the Freedom Tower, the new PATH terminal, and the memorial are expected to be well underway, meaning that \"unfettered access to bedrock is unlikely to exist again.\" Not all of the 9/11 families are happy about this:Michelle Stabile, 43, said the thought of construction equipment covering up the bedrock is painful. \"It's discouraging to see the construction going on around the site. It's disturbing,\" said Stabile, who lost fiancé Frank Koestner. \"And personally I would have rather they left the [site open].\"Far be it from me to dictate how somebody else should process their grief, but this is not a realistic point of view. Anybody who's visited the site can see that a 14-acre hole in the ground can't simply be left as a permanent gash in the streetscape. There needs to be an appropriate balance between recognizing their loss, and rebuilding what we lost. Those 9/11 families who fail to understand this balance do not offer much help in this ongoing debate.

Not-So-Clear Politics

***CONTENT
RealClearPolitics posted a commentary piece yesterday called \"John Edwards and the Shrinking Battleground.\" For those not familiar with it, RealClearPolitics is about as real and clear as FoxNews is fair and balanced. In other words, it's a Republican site.When John Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate, RCP wrote: While this pick may play well in the next three weeks I don't know how well it is going to work after Labor Day when the real contest begins...The Edwards pick is a poll-driven mistake...This is a very serious election, and the Bush-Cheney campaign will make that abundantly clear. Kerry would have been better off with the safe, solid choice of Dick Gephardt who at least would have helped potentially win Missouri.Two months later, RCP thinks it has a we-told-you-so moment: Senator Edwards did give Kerry a little bounce... A week before Kerry's VP announcement Bush was up about two points and a week after Edwards was chosen the Kerry/Edwards ticket had moved to roughly a three point lead. So Edwards delivered about a five point bounce that subsequently faded during the rest of July as Kerry headed into his convention in Boston.But now we are in the middle of September, and you have to wonder just what John Edwards is bringing to the table. The contrast with Dick Cheney that all the pundits were atwitter about in early July suddenly doesn't look so great from the Kerry perspective...Because of the unwise choice of Edwards as a running mate, even if Kerry pulls back to even in the national polls his route to 270 electoral votes is a big problem -- and almost impossible if he can't win either Florida or Ohio. Had he chosen Gephardt and put Missouri into play, the Kerry campaign's electoral math would look considerably kinder. Flipping Missouri alone would get Kerry over 270 EV's, and flipping Missouri and New Hampshire would allow for the loss of New Mexico. Wining Missouri, New Hampshire and Nevada would have allowed Kerry to lose Wisconsin and still win the election. Of course, it is not a sure thing that Gephardt would have been able to deliver Missouri. Given Gallup's latest poll showing Bush ahead by fourteen, maybe even Dick Gephardt wouldn't have been able to deliver his home state. But unlike North Carolina, Missouri is a much more competitive state for Democrats, and in a close election where Kerry had a chance to win, one would think Missouri with Dick Gephardt on the ticket would have been very much in play.Instead, Kerry is stuck with a running mate who brings nothing except a pretty smile. The Kerry campaign had run a pretty darn good campaign through June, but starting with the Edwards choice, a wasted convention, an insane comment at the Grand Canyon and no answer to his Vietnam and antiwar past, Kerry has dug himself what may be an insurmountable hole. Now, I have to admit that it's unclear precisely what Edwards brings to the Democratic ticket, but you have to be suspicious of advice coming from a source that wants Kerry to lose. Most commentators - Democrat or Republican - thought Edwards was a superior choice to Gephardt. As RCP notes, it is far from certain that Gephardt would have delivered Missouri. He is popular only in his hometown of St. Louis; he is actually a mild liability elsewhere in the state. Gephardt also reminds people of the Humphrey-Mondale-Scoop Jackson style ultra-liberal Democrat that most of the country has long since resoundingly rejected.RCP isn't done second-guessing the strategy of the candidate it opposes. They chastise Kerry's decision during the summer to put more states in play, saying: Arizona, Colorado Louisiana and Virginia? It's not complicated to figure out that if these states are close Bush is finished. So what was their strategy in spending time and money in states that they were only going to carry if they didn't need them to win the election? Maybe they bought in to the conventional wisdom over the summer that Bush was in big, big trouble. Whatever the strategic rationale, it was a major mistake and a misallocation of resources.With the wasted money and time in states they don't have a prayer of carrying and a VP nominee that can't make a difference in any state that will matter, the Kerry folks have boxed themselves into an electoral corner. So now they are not only staring at how they get this race back to even in the national polls but also how they are going to piece together the necessary 270 Electoral Votes.But RCP ignores one critical fact. Because John Kerry was such a prodigious fundraiser during primary season, the campaign had money to burn during the summer. And given the \"use-it-or-lose-it\" rules that govern modern elections, Kerry had to spend the money, because after the convention he was limited to the $75 million cap that constrains all candidates that accept federal funding, as both Kerry and Bush are doing. Naturally, Kerry invested heavily in the main battleground states where RCP believes he should be focusing, but at some point those investments reach saturation, and a candidate needs to expand his appeal. (If you see a Bush add in the safe Kerry state of California -- and you will -- it's the opposite coin of the same strategy.) It is far from clear that Kerry's \"route to 270 electoral votes is a big problem.\" The non-partisan daily political blog from ABC News, The Note, refers in today's entry to \"the semi-friendly contours of the Electoral College.\" There are actually quite a few ways to get Kerry to 270.In any event, although both candidates still have a lot of work to do, Kerry's prospects aren't as bleak as RCP would like us to believe. The latest national poll (jointly sponsored by the Christian Science Monitor and Investor's Business Daily) has the race at a 46%-46% tie. Rasmussen Reports has also been showing the race essentially tied.It will take a while to find out if the Bush convention bounce has truly faded, but it certainly looks like it has. That's why they call them \"bounces.\"

Blue Hill at Stone Barns

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Blue Hill at Stone Barns.In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, John D. Rockefeller amassed some 4,600 acres in the area that's now Tarrytown. There he built his family mansion, Kykuit (pronounced KY-kit). His grandson, Nelson D. Rockefeller, bequeathed Kykuit to the National Historic Trust, which maintains it as a museum, along with hundreds of acres of parkland and nature trails. Even in its reduced state, the old Rockefeller estate is still massive, and some of the family still live there, including Happy Rockefeller, the late Governor's widow.The Stone Barns estate is another gem in the Rockefeller crown. It's a former cattle farm that David Rockefeller (JDR's last surviving grandson) has renovated and opened to the public. As the website explains:Stone Barns Center for Food and Agriculture is a beautiful non-profit farm, educational center and restaurant in the heart of Westchester County. Our mission is to demonstrate, teach and promote sustainable, community-based food production. Open to visitors of all ages, we offer a unique experience: a chance to learn about farming firsthand on a real working farm, the only farm open to the public so close to New York City.Central to the mission is a working farm: By contemporary measures, our farm is small, but it is well diversified and extremely productive. We manage our livestock and crops in a symbiotic relationship, attempting to mimic nature's own methods. By working in partnership with our environment, instead of resisting its natural tendencies, we produce food without the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides. Our only amendments to the soil are compost made from humus-rich manure, minerals and organic material. We use an intensively managed rotation method in our garden and greenhouse beds, preserving the soil and locking in important nutrients.And lastly, there is a restaurant: Blue Hill Stone Barns. It's a cousin to Blue Hill NYC in the Village, but the Stone Barns version emphasizes locally raised ingredients. The menu changes regularly, with many of the vegetables coming directly from the Stone Barns farm itself. They also slaughter their own chickens and pigs. To avoid complete monotony, they do obtain ingredients (such as fish, beef, and lamb) elsewhere.The menu is simple to explain: you choose two, three, or four courses; and you pay $46, $56, or $66. Portion sizes are adjusted, so you're getting a full meal whichever option you choose. It's more a matter of whether you want four \"tasting-menu-sized\" portions, or two traditionally-sized portions, or something in between. On a recent visit, a friend and I each chose three courses.The menu is divided into four sections, with three or four options per section. On our visit, these were labeled \"Tomatoes,\" \"More Tomatoes,\" \"From the Pastures,\" and \"Hudson Valley Pastures.\" The restaurant encourages you to ignore the traditional appetizer/entree distinction, but the items in the first category (\"Tomatoes\") were undeniably appetizers. The \"More Tomatoes\" category consisted of seafood dishes that included tomatoes somehow. (Can you guess which vegetable was in season?) The last two categories offered chicken and meat dishes respectively.I started with a mixed tomato medley, which even included a tomato sorbet. My friend's salad included lettuce, tomatoes, and an astonishing confection of egg yolks with hazelnuts, sesame seeds, and homemade pancetta. This must be one of the restaurant's signature dishes, as practically every reviewer has mentioned it with approval -- as well they should.For the second course, we both chose crabmeat pressed between squares of yellow squash. I guess tomato must have been in there somehow. We got four of these little crabmeat sandwiches, resembling ravioli. This too was a hit.For the third course, we diverged again. My friend got the crescent duck, with asian greens and baby carrots, which she said was the best duck she'd ever tasted. I chose the braised bacon and roasted pig. The pig actually seemed to be prepared three different ways, and it's beyond my food vocabulary to describe them, but it was a superb dish. Incidentally, I noticed another diner who had ordered this dish as part of a two-course meal, and what the server said was true: if you order two courses, each one is a bit larger than what we had. But our three courses were more than enough for a full meal. We skipped dessert and went home very happy.Although Blue Hill Stone Barns is in a rustic setting, it is upscale dining. One of the food blogs told about a guy who turned up in shorts (designer shorts!) and was turned away. Well, it turns out his lady friend knows the chef, and they were able to wangle something, but don't turn up in shorts. The restaurant has been decorated elegantly and thoughtfully. You watch the patrons as they walk in, and you realize that most have come for a fancy evening out -- farm or no farm. (Informal dress is fine, though; just no shorts.)Reservations at Blue Hill Stone Barns aren't easy to come by. For prime times, you'll need to call a full two months in advance. Luckily, like many a new restaurant, Blue Hill Stone Barns offers dining at the bar, where no reservation is required. The bar here has a wide surface that easily accommodates placemats and stemwear. The bar stools have backs, so they are comfortable to sit in for a long meal.Indeed, if you sit at the bar nowadays for just drinks, the bartender may just vaguely hint that the seats are needed for more lucrative customers. We didn't observe that here, but it has been known to happen at other upscale restaurants that offer bar dining, such as Babbo. This is not likely to be an issue at Blue Hill Stone Barns, as there is an adjoining lounge with plush sofas and chairs, which seems to be preferred by those with reservations who want a pre-dinner cocktail. A bar, it seems, is no longer a bar.For a party of two or three, there is really no disadvantage to dining at the bar, and it means you can make the trip on the spur of the moment -- as we did. Give it a try! Tarrytown is about a 45-minute ride from Grand Central, and there are at least two trains per hour, even into the late evening. You'll find taxis waiting at Tarrytown station, and it's about a $10 ride to the Stone Barns Center.Perhaps we'll be back in the winter, when no doubt the fireplace will be roaring, and tomatoes will be replaced by whatever is then in season.Blue Hill at Stone Barns (630 Bedford Road, Pocantico Hills, New York) Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Bridge Cafe is located in a 1794 building at the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, on the corner of Water and Dover streets. One of the oldest buildings still standing in Manhattan, it has been consistently the \"site of a food and/or drinking establishment\" for the entire time, although the precise purpose for which it was used has changed frequently. For a while during the 18th century, it was a bordello. The current owners bought the building in 1979 and chose the current name, retaining an interior that is unchanged since the 1920s.Bridge Cafe is one of the few serious restaurants below Chambers Street, by which I mean a restaurant not serving tourist or \"formula\" food. The New York Times awarded it one star several years ago. Ed Koch, the former mayor, once said it was his \"favorite restaurant.\" The menu, which changes seasonally, is an eclectic mix of New American specialties. Appetizers are $7-11, entrees $16-27, making Bridge Cafe fairly expensive for the neighborhood, but mid-priced by Manhattan standards.Unfortunately, Bridge Cafe misfired on most of what my friend and I tried on Friday night. We both started with a cold cucumber and avocado soup, which was dominated by tabasco sauce. I happen to like spicy food, but when an ingredient takes over the soup, it ought to be mentioned in the description on the menu. My friend couldn't finish it.For the entree, I chose \"Our Famous Buffalo Steak,\" which comes with a lingonberry sauce and homemade potato gnocchi. The buffalo was tough and tasted gamey. The lingonberry sauce was dreary, and seemed to be there only to mask a piece of meat that never could have stood as an acceptable meal on its own. It was also the most expensive item on the menu. My friend ordered a vegetarian dish that was dominated by a white bean ragout, with the other promised vegetables getting literally lost in the sauce.Bridge Cafe has garnered mostly favorable reviews, so I have to think we caught it on a bad night, or that we just happened to order the worst items on the menu. Many of the other dishes certainly looked tempting, at least on paper. I'll give them another chance one of these days. The wine list offers mostly U.S. vintages, and there's a 30% discount on Tuesdays and Wednesdays.Bridge Cafe (279 Water Street at Dover Street, South Street Seaport)Food: *Service: *½Ambiance: *Overall: *

I had a great experience here - granted, it was nearly three years after you reviewed it. Everything was right on. The service was impeccable - the waiters were able to describe every dish distinctly.

The Bush Bounce, Part Deux

I wrote my earlier post first thing this morning. In the meantime, today's Rasmussen tracking poll shows an absolute dead-heat: 47.3% apiece for George W. Bush and John Kerry. (It is only in the last four days that Rasmussen started reporting his results in tenths of a percent. I personally think this imparts greater precision to the numbers than they deserve.)As I mentioned in my earlier post, Scott Rasmussen said that the results he published yesterday (a 1.1% lead for Bush) included an extremely pro-favorable Kerry sample on Saturday, partly offsetting pro-Bush results on Friday and Sunday. As Rasmussen is now showing a tied race, it means that two of the last three days have been pro-Kerry. Perhaps the Bush bounce is now retreating - as \"bounces\" invariably do.This is the first presidential race in my adult lifetime in which a candidate has support that I simply cannot comprehend. That candidate is George W. Bush. Oh, I'm not talking about Bush's core support among the Republican stalwarts, who clearly would vote for any member of their party - just as the Democratic base does for their candidate. But the party faithful get a candidate to no more than a 30-35% standing. The rest of a candidate's support are the so-called \"persuadable voters.\" And how any significant percentage of persuadable voters could be supporting Bush just baffles me.I mean, what has George W. Bush done that worked? He invaded Afghanistan, but failed to find Osama bin Laden or Mullah Omar. He invaded Iraq, but failed to find the WMD that were the reason for the invasion in the first place. Not one of his domestic programs has produced the result that was advertised. Not one. His second-term domestic agenda, which the conservative columnist George Will described as \"pedestrian,\" included nothing but a bunch of old Republican chestnuts that have been on the table for years, but have never come close to becoming law.In short, the Bush platform comes down to, \"Give me four more years, and perhaps I'll get it right this time.\" Or perhaps it comes down to, \"Whatever you may think of me, at least I'm not John Kerry.\" It's a sign of how feeble a candidate Kerry is, that he has managed so far to squander such an obvious opportunity.

If you're hoping for a Bush victory in November, you couldn't have been happier when first Time magazine, and then Newsweek, uncorked polls this week showing the President with an 11-point lead over challenger John Kerry. In the history of polling, no Presidential candidate with a double-digit lead on Labor Day has gone on to lose in November. Elections typically get tighter near the end, but they don't tighten that much.The plot thickens, however. Rasmussen Reports publishes a tracking poll every day. Since Kerry clinched the nomination in the spring, neither candidate been more than four points away from the other. Yesterday, Rasmussen showed Bush with just a 1.1% lead, 47.6% to 46.5% over Kerry. Rounding out the post-convention polls to date, Gallup shows Bush ahead by 7 points, 52% to 45%, among likely voters.What is going on here? Rasmussen was assailed with complaints after he failed to find the Bush bounce that Time/Newsweek did. All year long, his poll has been within the margin-of-error of all the other major national polls, and a 10-point difference surely indicates that something is wrong -- the polls shouldn't be that far apart.In a revealing article that should be required reading for anybody who interprets polls, Scott Rasmussen cleared it up. The short answer is that Gallup has it about right: a Bush lead of 5-7 points. You can follow the link, but here is a brief explanation:In both the Time and Newsweek polls, a plurality of voters surveyed identified themselves as Republicans. In the polling era, there has never been a presidential election in which Republican voters outnumbered Democrats. Republicans win only by getting a sufficient number of Democrats to cross over, which (luckily for Republicans) is a pretty easy thing to convince them to do. Nevertheless, party affiliation has remained pro-Democrat from one election cycle to the next.Now, however enthused you were about the Republican convention, do you believe these four days were enough to turn a plurality of the country into self-identifying Republicans, when it has been the opposite for generations? Or is it just possible that Newsweek and Time conducted their polls during the convention itself, when a high proportion of Republicans were likely to be home with their TV sets tuned in? Rasmussen concludes the latter.On the other hand, Rasmussen concedes that his three-day tracking sample included an extraordinarily good day for Kerry on Saturday, which explains why he shows just a 1.1% lead for the President. Excluding Saturday, Rasmussen shows a 4-point spread, which is in the zip code of Gallup's 7-point margin. The strong likelihood is that Bush's actual lead is somewhere in the 4 to 8-point range - not fatal to Kerry, but clearly not where he'd hoped to be. Gallup, incidentally, gives Bush a 2-point \"bounce\" out of his convention, which is right where the pundits predicted it would be, and comparable to the bounce that most pollsters gave Kerry after his convention.Reading all of the polling analysis on the web reminded me that modern poll numbers are \"cooked\" a lot more than people realize. Most pollsters, for instance, report the views of \"likely voters.\" This means that the poll is not reporting the \"raw\" results, but the results after eliminating those judged unlikely to vote. This is a reasonable methodology, for polls show that many more people state an intention to vote than actually do. The no-shows tend to be predominantly Democratic, and a poll that failed to exclude them would consistently predict Democrat victories that fail to materialize on election day. But predicting \"likely voters\" is not an exact science. If turnout is higher than historical norms, it will favor Kerry.Although Bush does not have an 11-point lead, by any measure he does have a very real lead that is right at, or perhaps slightly outside of, the margin of polling error. That lead will most likely subside a bit - that's why they call the post-convention surge a \"bounce\" - but Kerry still has some ground to make-up. In addition, although the Time and Newsweek polls were clearly erroneous, Bush gets the benefit of the perception, however inaccurate, that he enjoys a potentially insurmountable lead. Kerry, on the other hand, has suffered through a 2 or 3-week period in which he has largely been responding to news (most of it unfavorable to him), rather than shaping it himself. Comparisons to the lead Michael Dukakis squandered in August 1988 are apposite.If this election is going to be a real race, Kerry is going to need to make it so. And soon.

Justice Kennedy Condemns Harsh Federal Sentences

***CONTENT
An unlikely advocate has urged the federal government to take a long look at revising America's approach to criminal sentencing -- and especially incarceration. In a blistering speech to the American Bar Association in August 2003, conservative Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy lashed out at America's obsession with locking up non-violent offenders and tossing away the key:Were we to enter the hidden world of punishment, we should be startled by what we see. Consider its remarkable scale. The nationwide inmate population today is about 2.1 million people. In California, even as we meet, this State alone keeps over 160,000 persons behind bars. In countries such as England, Italy, France and Germany, the incarceration rate is about 1 in 1,000 persons. In the United States it is about 1 in 143. We must confront another reality. Nationwide, more than 40% of the prison population consists of African-American inmates. About 10% of African-American men in their mid-to-late 20s are behind bars. In some cities more than 50% of young African-American men are under the supervision of the criminal justice system. While economic costs, defined in simple dollar terms, are secondary to human costs, they do illustrate the scale of the criminal justice system. The cost of housing, feeding and caring for the inmate population in the United States is over 40 billion dollars per year. In the State of California alone, the cost of maintaining each inmate in the correctional system is about $26,000 per year. And despite the high expenditures in prison, there remain urgent, unmet needs in the prison system.It is no secret why this has happened. Since about the mid-1970s, Congress and the state legislatures have routinely stiffened the criminal codes, mandating generally longer sentences and reduced opportunities for parole. (The federal system abolished parole entirely, meaning that an unreasonably harsh sentence can almost never be corrected afterwards.) The trend is less pronounced at the state level, because states usually need to raise taxes to build new prisons. Indeed, as states face decreasing tax revenues in light of sluggish or negative job growth, many are enacting shorter sentences as a way of reducing correctional budgets. The federal government faces no such constraints. Its capacity to rack up deficits is essentially limitless, and the Justice Department budget -- staggering though it is -- pales to other budget-busters like defense and entitlements. It's therefore not surprising that, where the same crime can be prosecuted at either federal or state level, the federal sentence is nearly always higher. It is usually a lot higher. Justice Kennedy again:Consider this case: A young man with no previous serious offense is stopped on the George Washington Memorial Parkway near Washington D. C. by United States Park Police. He is stopped for not wearing a seatbelt. A search of the car follows and leads to the discovery of just over 5 grams of crack cocaine in the trunk. The young man is indicted in federal court. He faces a mandatory minimum sentence of five years. If he had taken an exit and left the federal road, his sentence likely would have been measured in terms of months, not years.It is difficult to fathom the public policy benefit of locking up a kid for five years, with no possibility of parole, when his offense is one he has inflicted upon himself. Mind you, I'm not suggesting that the kid deserves any awards for screwing up his life with drugs, but screwing up his life with prison is not any improvement. Justice Kennedy continues:United States Marshals can recount the experience of leading a young man away from his family to begin serving his term. His mother says, \"How long will my boy be gone?\" They say \"Ten years\" or \"15 years.\" Ladies and gentlemen, I submit to you that a 20-year-old does not know how long ten or fifteen years is. One day in prison is longer than almost any day you and I have had to endure. Alexander Solzhenitsyn describes just one day in prison in the literary classic \"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.\" Ivan Denisovich had a ten-year sentence. At one point he multiplies the long days in these long years by ten. Here is his final reflection: \"The end of an unclouded day. Almost a happy one. Just one of the three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days of his sentence, from bell to bell. The extra three were for leap years.\" Under the federal mandatory minimum statutes a sentence can be mitigated by a prosecutorial decision not to charge certain counts. There is debate about this, but in my view a transfer of sentencing discretion from a judge to an Assistant U. S. Attorney, often not much older than the defendant, is misguided. Often these attorneys try in good faith to be fair in the exercise of discretion. The policy, nonetheless, gives the decision to an assistant prosecutor not trained in the exercise of discretion and takes discretion from the trial judge. The trial judge is the one actor in the system most experienced with exercising discretion in a transparent, open, and reasoned way. Most of the sentencing discretion should be with the judge, not the prosecutors. Professor James Whitman considers some of these matters in his recent book Harsh Justice. He argues that one explanation for severe sentences is the coalescence of two views coming from different parts of the political spectrum. One view warns against being soft on crime; the other urges a rigid, egalitarian approach to sentence uniformity. Both views agree on severe sentences, and both agree on mandatory minimum sentences. Whatever the explanation, it is my hope that after those with experience and expertise in the criminal justice system study the matter, this Association will say to the Congress of the United States: \"Please do not say in cases like these the offender must serve five or ten years. Please do not use our courts but then say the judge is incapable of judging. Please, Senators and Representatives, repeal federal mandatory minimums.\"Justice Kennedy's point is that, while drugs may indeed ruin lives, ten or fifteen-year sentences imposed upon twenty-year-olds accomplish much the same thing--at government expense. Somebody locked up for that long has virtually no chance of ever becoming a productive member of society, once the most productive years of his early adulthood are taken away. One could write all day about the inequities in the federal system. The ABA report that Justice Kennedy's speech spawned elaborates:Aside from the fact that mandatory minimums are inconsistent with the notion that sentences should consider all of the relevant circumstances of an offense and offender, they tend to shift sentencing discretion away from courts to prosecutors. Prosecutors do not charge all defendants who are eligible for mandatory minimum sentences with crimes triggering those sentences. If the prosecutor charges a crime carrying a mandatory minimum sentence, the judge has no discretion in most jurisdictions to impose a lower sentence. If the prosecutor chooses not to charge a crime carrying a mandatory minimum sentence, the normal sentencing rules apply. Although prosecutors have discretion throughout the criminal justice system not to charge offenses that could be charged and thereby to affect sentences, their discretion is pronounced in the case of mandatory minimums because of the inability of judges to depart downward.The report continues:Federal drug sentences also illustrate some of the possible effects of mandatory minimums on racial disparity. When compared either to state sentences or to other federal sentences, federal drug sentences are emphatically longer. For example, in 2000, the average imposed felony drug trafficking sentence in state courts was 35 months, while the average imposed federal drug trafficking sentence was 75 months. In 2001, the average federal drug trafficking sentence was 72.7 months, the average federal manslaughter sentence was 34.3 months, the average assault sentence as 37.7 months, and the average sexual abuse sentence was 65.2 months. These lengthy sentences largely result from the impact of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986 (ADAA). The ADAA created a system of quantity-based mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug offenses that increased sentences for drug offenses beyond the prevailing norms for all offenders. Its differential treatment of crack and powder cocaine has resulted in greatly increased sentences for African-American drug offenders. The Act set forth different quantity-based mandatory minimum sentences for crack and powder cocaine, with crack cocaine disfavored by a 100-to-1 ratio when compared to powder cocaine. Thus, it takes 100 times the amount of powder cocaine to trigger the same five-year and ten-year mandatory minimum sentences as for crack cocaine. The Act does three other things: (1) It triggers the mandatory minimums for very small quantities of crack -- five grams for a mandatory five-year sentence and 500 generates a ten-year term. (2) It makes crack one of only two drugs for which possession is a felony. (3) It prescribes crack as the only drug that triggers a mandatory minimum sentence for mere possession. The overwhelming majority of crack defendants are African-American, while the overwhelming majority of powder cocaine defendants are white or Hispanic. In 1992, 91.4% of crack offenders were African-American, and in 2000 84.7% were African-American.There aren't many ways to escape a mandatory minimum, but one of them is to provide \"substantial assistance in the investigation or prosecution of another person who has committed an offense.\" There are many problems in the administration of this superficially wise provision of the law. Only the government can petition the sentencing judge for a \"substantial assistance\" departure, and jurisdictions vary widely in the kind of assistance they'll accept as \"substantial.\" Moreover, as many have noted, this provision is biased in favor of an offender who's part of a conspiracy, and who's sufficiently entangled in that conspiracy to implicate many others. Individual offenders and low-level conspirators -- those who would seem to have offended least -- typically have no substantial assistance to provide, and therefore cannot escape mandatory minimums. When a conservative like Justice Kennedy says it's time to reform federal sentencing laws, he deserves to be taken seriously. There's as yet no evidence that a majority of congress is prepared to agree with him.

New York Times Proposes to Abolish Electoral College

In an editorial last Sunday, the New York Times proposed abolishing the electoral college. It marked a reversal for the gray lady's opinion page, which a few years ago had argued in favor of the current system.If ever there were an idea guaranteed to go nowhere, this is it. A Constitutional amendment would require approval from two-thirds of both Houses of Congress and three-fourths of the states, which could never happen. It takes only thirteen states to derail an amendment (assuming it somehow gets by Congress), and there are far more than thirteen states that would lose influence if the current mechanism were abolished.The electoral college doesn't just benefit less-populous states. It also benefits many minority groups. As a national constituency, Cuban-Americans hardly matter. But in Florida, where the election is razor-close, Cuban-Americans have outsized influence. It's no surprise to find the candidates tailoring their message to South Florida's huge Cuban population.I come from a Jewish family, and my father always used to point out that the electoral college benefited the Jews. That's because, although Jews are a small proportion of the national electorate, they are a huge proportion in several key states, such as New York and Illinois. However, in recent years those states have been so dependably Democratic that the Presidential candidates ignore them anyway, so the Jewish influence isn't what it once was.Of course, not wanting to put it that way, the Times emphasized other inequities in the current system: Barring a tsunami of a sweep, heavily Democratic New York will send its electoral votes to John Kerry and both parties have already written New York off as a surefire blue state. The Electoral College makes Republicans in New York, and Democrats in Utah, superfluous. It also makes members of the majority party in those states feel less than crucial. It's hard to tell New York City children that every vote is equally important -- it's winner take all here, and whether Senator Kerry beats the president by one New York vote or one million, he will still walk away with all 31 of the state's electoral votes.The apparent closeness of the current race - which could easily change by election day - has raised the spectre of an electoral college tie (269-269). In one of the more bizarre and anti-democratic provisions of the Constitution, the House of Representatives would choose the President in that case, with each state's delegation getting one combined vote. As the Times puts it, there would be \"one [vote] for Wyoming's 500,000 residents and one for California's 35.5 million.\" These are valid points, one and all, but I can't see the system changing in my lifetime.

Note: Duane Park Cafe has closed. There are new owners (Marisa Ferrarin and Frank Locker) and a new chef (Shawn Knight), whose new menu will have \"a Louisiana accent.\" The space has been re-decorated, and the restaurant is now called Duane Park.A group of six of us had dinner at the Duane Park Cafe the other night. Our host was a vendor my employer does business with. He ordered a knock-out Bordeaux, the name of which unfortunately I can't recall. As he owns a vineyard in Australia on the side, I suppose he knows his grapes. The restaurant had decanted it for us, and it was already airing itself out at our table when we sat down.Put six carnivores at the same table, and the orders are almost predictable. Three of us ordered the grilled tenderloin, and the other three ordered the rack of lamb. I ordered the lamb. It came with three wonderfully flavorful, tender, decent-sized chops. The tenderloin crew seemed happy too.For the appetizers, we had only slightly more variety. One ordered the pan-seared scallops and shrimp, two more the tuna tartare, and three the scallop and crab cake. The latter item looked pretty damned good, but I had the tuna tartare, which came with \"black sesame tuille and tahini sauce\" (that's a quote from the website -- I wouldn't otherwise recognize those ingedients). It was just slightly spicy and most enjoyable.Dessert was the only disappointment. A peach cobbler broke apart all too quickly into an unappetizing mess, and it was served only lukewarm.Our host had suggested Duane Park Cafe because it's a quiet place, where you can actually hear your dinner companions talk - an advantage many restaurants lack these days. Service was friendly and efficient, but the restaurant was a bit under half full.Duane Park Cafe is also reasonably priced for the neighborhood, with appetizers in the $7-10 range and mains $19-25.Duane Park Cafe (157 Duane St. between W.

Return to Babbo

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Babbo. A friend suggested Babbo last night. I'd been there alone about a month ago, but Babbo's one of those places that never wears out. We ate at the bar. At 7:00pm there were still several bar stools available, but they didn't stay empty for long. On a second visit, Babbo was even more impressive. I ordered the Three Goat Cheese Truffles ($12) to start. Three balls of cool goat cheese were covered lightly in colored spices, which the menu calls \"Peperonata.\" I could have eaten a dozen. For my entree, I tried another Babbo signature dish, the Mint Love Letters with Spicy Lamb Sausage ($18). These are squares of pasta, with mint and lamb pressed inside. It's a wonderful explosion of contrasting flavors. Apropos of my visit, this week's NYTimes had an article about dining at the bar, a phenomenon that has practically deprived many restaurant bars of their original raison d'etre. In fact, the article featured the very bartender that has served me on both of my Babbo visits: \"I was told you were dining,\" said John Giorno, the bartender at Babbo in Greenwich Village two weekends ago, snatching a menu away from me as I settled into my seat and explained I was drinking. Mr. Giorno's smile vanished like the sun and his face went as dark as a sky before a storm. I asked to see the menu and contritely ordered food. According to bartenders, managers and owners across New York, bar space at most restaurants has become de facto dining space. Even people with reservations for a table trying to enjoy a drink at the bar first, as an enjoyable prelude, have to fight the good fight as drinkers contending with diners at the bar. For those involved, from the staff to the patrons, the new setup has its advantages and its disadvantages. And for every separate peace, there is a potential for awkwardness that requires diplomacy. Mr. Giorno at Babbo, realizing his brusqueness in challenging me as a drinker, quickly served me a smile with my wine. \"I treat everyone the same,\" Mr. Giorno said, \"but that's kind of what we do. We're a dining bar.\" Babbo's bar that night was solid eaters; the host's station was taking reservations for the seats at the bar. Drinkers who had naïvely waited to sit at the bar were told by the bartenders that the seats were not available. They seated diners who had arrived later than the drinkers. Tension was palpable. The manager spoke with one drinking couple about the seats they were about to take, because he was negotiating with another couple at his desk who had walked in to eat and couldn't immediately get a table. We all held our breath. The other couple decided to wait for a table. The drinkers were allowed to stay, resting their red wine and beer on the bar with some relief. \"We don't mind them, drinkers,\" Mario Batali, Babbo's creator and co-owner, said with generosity when I spoke to him last week. \"But drinkers that don't have dinner? That's not what we're about.\" It might be inconvenient for drinkers, but dining at the bar is win-win for restaurants and diners. You can walk into a place like Babbo on a whim, and although it's booked solid, a seat is there waiting for you - as long as you don't mind sitting at the bar. My companion last night said he does it all the time. Babbo (110 Waverly Place between MacDougal St. & Sixth Ave., Greenwich Village) Food: ***Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: ***

V Steakhouse

***CONTENT
Note: V Steakhouse closed in December 2005. My final thoughts are here. The space is now occupied by Porter House New York.V Steakhouse is part of the much-ballyhooed \"restaurant collection\" at the Time-Warner Center. With Masa ($300 prix fixe) and Per Se ($125-150 prix fixe) as neighbors, V Steakhouse with its $66 steaks starts to look like bargain-basement dining. Actually, you can order the chicken entree at V for $19, and dine at the world's most expensive food court without spending a monthly rent payment. But it's no accident that V is called a steakhouse, and it's as a steakhouse that it must succeed or fail.The Time-Warner restaurant collection was designed to be three and four-star restaurants, one and all. The nominal chef of the eponymous V, Jean-Georges Vongerichten, was none too pleased to get just one star from the Times's Frank Bruni. Bruni's review seemed an anomaly (three stars from the Post's Steve Cuozzo; a rave in Newsday) till New York Magazine came along with a review titled Steak, Not Well Done.Vongerichten told New York Magazine, \"Eighteen years in New York, and I never had a one-star review; I don't even know how to do a one-star restaurant. The hardest part is the staff. Nobody wants to work in a one-star place.\" Maybe it would help if they sometimes saw the boss. As Vongerichten has over half-a-dozen restaurants in New York alone, to say nothing of his global empire, you can rest assured he's seldom there.I had a business dinner at V Steakhouse last night. The decor has been much written about. You love it or you hate it. It reminded me of the interior of the Metropolitan Opera House, with its plush velvet reds and shimmering chandeliers. To that, V adds a grove of gold-painted aluminum trees. To some, it resembles an upscale whorehouse. I found it charming, and so did my companions, who are from Boston.They pamper you at V. Jean-Georges may not know how to do three-star steak, but he certainly knows how to deliver three-star service. It is a large dining room, but the tables are generously spaced. By the end of our evening, it was about 90% full, but not at all noisy. Most of the tables had parties of four or more. There are hardly any two-seaters at V.One of my companions had a foie gras appetizer, which he loved, while two of us shared steak tartare, which was wonderful. However, a steakhouse must be judged mainly on the quality of its steaks, and V fails to deliver the goods. My porterhouse was unevenly charred, had an unacceptably high fat and gristle content, and offered a flimsy and under-sized filet on the smaller side of the cut. It was done correctly to the medium-rare temperature I had ordered, but it was otherwise a porterhouse no restaurant of this purported calibre should serve. The other porterhouse at our table was a bit better, but we quickly agreed: this was not a $66 steak. At half that price, I would have considered myself over-charged.I went to the men's room, and a couple of guys asked me about my steak. I shared my experience. \"Mine sucked,\" one fellow said. \"So did mine,\" said another. To be fair, I should report that my other table companion ordered the Waygu, which he said was the best steak he'd ever had in his life. Undoubtedly V has the equipment to put out great steak on occasion, but they must be accepting whatever wildly inconsistent inventory appears on their loading dock every morning.V has an ample selection of side dishes. I ordered the \"fripps,\" which are like large potato chips prepared in a tempura batter. These are superb, but it's a problem when they utterly out-class the steak. A selection of complimentary sauces came with our meal. These added a little spice to an otherwise humdrum steak, but in my view the best steaks shouldn't need them.For dessert, I ordered the berry cheesecake. Like so many of the V desserts, the kitchen hasn't assembled the pieces. You have a small slice of cheesecake, and a berry goo in an accompanying glass, which you're encouraged to sip through a straw. How this is supposed to be superior to a traditional cheesecake utterly eludes me. Try the assorted cheese platter instead.The NY Times doesn't give separate ratings for service, decor, and food. But if it did, I'd say that three stars is appropriate for the first two categories, but that one star is awfully generous for the third. The kitchen desperately needs a wake-up call.V Steakhouse (Fourth Floor, Time-Warner Center, Columbus Circle)Food: SatisfactoryService: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: *

Pacific Grill has been open since June 30th on Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. It's run by the same people who operate Ixta, which led a number of writers to speculate that the the Seaport was ready to escape its \"all tourists, all the time\" mentality.For instance, Time Out New York wrote, \"This new marine-themed restaurant stands out among the TGI Friday-type establishments in the South Street Seaport.\" Andrea Strong, the doyenne of what's hot-but-cool, wrote: When was the last time you went to the South Street Seaport for a meal? I think I was in high school. I seem to remember lots of bars…and then I blank out completely. Anyway, there may be a reason to return. Pacific Grill will open on June 30th at 89 South Street Seaport in the Pier 17 Mall. (Mall dining is very chic now? Good heavens.) The menu features Modern Pan Asian seafood by consulting chef Kenneth Tufo, currently of industry (food).Well, I paid a visit on Sunday evening. Pacific Grill is located in the space that was formerly \"Cajun.\" The menu is mostly seafood, with a Seaport tourist-friendly spin. I'm probably a tad more likely to frequent Sequoia next door, with its unobstructed harbor views. However, I'll not render judgment on one visit. I had a lobster club sandwich, which was a traditional club with lobster and avocado replacing turkey and lettuce, not exactly a Pan Asian specialty. It came with crispy shoestring fries and made an enjoyable light supper, but there is much more to sample before I'll say whether it's just another Pier 17 restaurant.

The fine restaurants south of Chambers Street can be counted on the fingers of one hand, making any new arrival in this neighborhood a news event. Battery Gardens opened a month or two ago, occupying the space that was formerly American Park. It's located in Battery Park, just steps away from the Staten Island and Statue of Liberty ferries.The space has been remodeled in pale greens, paper-thin white shear curtains, marble table-tops, and plush ultra-comfortable off-white slipper chairs. It reminded us either of a 1930s cruise ship or a movie star's boudoire; we weren't sure which. The dining room offers floor-to-ceiling picture window views of New York Harbor and the Statue of Liberty. There is an ample outdoor dining area, with an open-air bar.The menu is a serious one, under the direction of executive chef Tommy Lee, who comes to Battery Gardens from the Pierre Hotel. Per the website, \"Specializing in American continental cuisine, his menus reflect his Korean heritage and vast knowledge of seafood.\"Appetizers and salads are $8-15 (most under $12). Soups are $5-7. The menu offers several gourmet pizzas at $10-12, meat entrees ($17-27), pasta ($14-16), and fish ($18-26). There is also a raw bar, with Little Neck Clams ($7/half-dozen), Blue Point Oysters ($12), or Fruits of the Sea ($30, $55 or $75). The fish category on the menu offers the most choices, which is unsurprising given the chef's background and the location of the restaurant.I started with the Grilled Diver Sea Scallops ($10), which are served with Spicy Asian Peanut Sauce and Red Cabbage Slaw. This came with three scallops, and the inspiration to serve it with asian peanut sauce was heavenly. For the main course, I chose the Miso Glazed Chilian Sea Bass ($25), which comes with Jasmine Rice, Sesame Hinted Shitakes and Green Beans. The miso glazing was just hinted at (as opposed to Nobu's version of it, where it's far more powerful), but this allowed the beautiful flaky fish to do the talking. It was an enormous portion, which I devoured.My friend started with the Tempura Sampler, which isn't currently shown on the website. It came with 7 or 8 tempura pieces -- a mixture of potatoes, shrimp, and chicken with a tangy dipping sauce. I tried a few pieces myself, and it really was done to perfection, although the sauce perhaps was a bit too ordinary. She continued with the Pan Seared Tuna ($24), which (per the website) came with Corn Fritters, Red Onion and Tomato Salad, Cilantro-Chili Aioli. This was a nearly porterhouse-sized portion, which she enjoyed, but I found it a bit blander preparation than the sea bass.There were some service glitches. When we arrived, they took my order for a cocktail, but neglected to ask about a glass of wine with dinner. By the time they got around to it, I was nearly finished eating. Two cups of decaf coffee arrived lukewarm. When we asked for fresh cups, they returned a bit warmer, but still shy of the correct temperature.Battery Gardens hasn't been \"discovered\" yet. On a Saturday evening (8:00pm reservation), it was less than half full. One very large, elegantly-dressed party seemed to be having a celebration. Most of the other diners seemed to be at least \"smartly\" dressed, suggesting they considered their visit here a night on the town. My friend and I came casual, but we did not feel out-of-place. I suspect the restaurant does a better weekday business, as it is steps away from the row of office towers on Water Street.Battery Gardens offered us a thoroughly enjoyable meal, with dramatic views to match. On a nice evening (which regrettably this wasn't), a scenic walk along the Battery Park esplanade would be the perfect nightcap. In any event, Battery Gardens offers serious food in a locale where there has historically been precious little of it. I hope the restaurant succeeds.Battery Gardens (Battery Park, opposite 17 State Street, Financial District)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Note: Owners Wayne Nish and Joseph Scalice closed March at the end of 2006, re-opening in early 2007 as a more casual restaurant, Nish. Alas, the new version was no longer the destination restaurant that March had been, and there wasn't enough neighborhood traffic to keep Nish in business. Despite favorable reviews, it was gone by the end of June.March restaurant is an occasion place. I visited recently to celebrate a friend's birthday. Without question, we were treated lavishly. The maitre d' presented her with a bouquet of roses. Service throughout was impeccable. But for the price, none of the courses at March wowed us. Or perhaps, as my friend suggested, Wayne Nish's cuisine is just too subtle. Mind you, it was all good, but I expected to be transported, and we weren't.March's menu is an interesting hybrid between the tasting menu and the prix fixe. You choose a number of courses, from three to six. ($68, $74, $85, or $102). Wine pairings are another $10 per course (or, like anywhere, you can just order from the wine list). You can select which courses you want -- listed in broad categories like \"raw,\" \"vegetarian,\" \"shellfish,\" \"fish,\" \"poultry,\" and \"meat,\" with about three or four options per category. Or, you can put yourself in the chef's hands.We selected the four-course menu with wine pairings and allowed the chef to choose for us. Each of us got different items, and we swapped plates about halfway through each course. This, indeed, is encouraged at March. Another of the menu options is called the Five Course Dual Tasting Menu ($270 for two, including wines), with which it's assumed that a couple will share plates.Now to the food ... and here I'm afraid I've failed as a food writer. I can't remember exactly what we had. The first plate for each of us was a cold item, then a fish course, then a meat course, then dessert. What were they? I don't recall, except that they were all very good without being transcendent. At these prices, I wanted at least some of the courses to reach culinary orgasm, and none did.March is located in a gorgeous East Side townhouse. The tables are on three levels, with ample space between them. It is a lovely and romantic setting that makes you feel like you're in another world. The food failed to transport me, it is true, but I would still try March again on the right occasion.March (405 East 58th Street, just east of First Avenue, Sutton Place)Food: **Service: ****Ambiance: ***½Overall: **½

New Jersey Governor James McGreevey resigned in disgrace last week, after revealing that he'd had an extra-marital affair with another man. It wasn't that he's gay, or that he'd cheated on his wife, that forced the Governor to resign. Rather, it was a threatened sexual harrassment lawsuit by McGreevey's former lover, Golan Cipel. McGreevey and Cipel tell very different stories, and it will be some time before the truth comes out -- assuming it ever does. But even construing the facts in McGreevey's favor, the story is an ugly one. Cipel briefly held a six-figure job in the McGreevey administration as New Jersey's Head of Homeland Security, a position for which Cipel was monumentally unqualified. As a non-U.S. citizen, Cipel wasn't even eligible for the security clearances required to gain access to the classified information a Homeland Security director must inevitably deal with. Cipel says McGreevey raped him, then offered him a cushy government job as the price of his silence. McGreevey says the relationship was consensual, and Cipel's lawsuit is just thinly disguised blackmail. But the unavoidable conclusion, even accepting McGreevey's version of it, is that Cipel was on the government payroll so that the Governor would have easy access to him for sex. Never has such a high-profile politician come out and admitted he was gay. But despite McGreevey's sudden candor, it's clear this wasn't a voluntary confession. Rather, after weeks of agonizing reflection, the Governor was forced to accept that the truth could no longer be concealed. The picture of a conflicted man living a private life of lies, while publicly trying to persuade the world that he was \"normal,\" is hardly the image the gay community wants to portray. McGreevey isn't a poster-child for gay America. He's just another corrupt politician who couldn't keep his pants on.

Swish: Shabu Shabu in the Village

***CONTENT
There are plenty of Japanese restaurants in New York, but not many that specialize in shabu shabu. Swish takes its name from this less familiar branch of Japanese cuisine. As the restaurant's website puts it: Shabu shabu is the Japanese phrase for swish swish. This form of cooking received its name from the sound of food being skimmed through boiling broth. It is an Asian tradition of food preparation that has been around for thousands of years. Typical of long-established Asian dishes, shabu shabu is simple, healthy, low in carbs, and incredibly delicious. The process is simply to place your food into the boiling broth, allowing different foods to cook for different lengths of time. You control the amount of cooking time. If you prefer crisper spinach, a brief swish will do it. If you like your mushrooms to melt in your mouth, allow them to swim in the broth for a few minutes. Once you remove your food from the broth, it has a delicate flavor from the absorbed broth, and can be eaten as such to enjoy the food's full flavors. It is also traditional to use special dipping sauces. Swish offers a variety of sauces to excite your taste buds.Swish is in the middle of NYU territory, and its menu is priced attractively for students. You can order a personal size shabu shabu priced from $12.95-$16.95. If you're more adventurous, you can choose your own broth (five offered, $3) and select the ingredients à la carte -- anything from vegetables ($2 apiece) to Prime Rib eye ($8). There are seven available dipping sauces ($0.50 each). It's like Craft on a budget. There are also composed shabu shabu platters for two, and last night my friend and I ordered from the top of the menu: the Swish Special Combo (beef, seafood and vegetables) for $38, which came with the house broth and all seven sauces. Shabu shabu is a do-it-yourself eating experience, a Japanese fondue. The restaurant kindly provides a laminated card instructing you how long each item should be cooked. It can be anywhere from 10 minutes (potatoes) to 30 seconds (beef, which comes sliced paper-thin). The broth comes in a crock pot and is placed on a burner with a blue flame. It soon comes to a near-boil. As it evaporates, your server will come around and add more. Some items just go into the pot, and you retrieve them later. Others you hold in place with a fish-net ladle. For the items that cook quickly, especially the beef, you can just swish them around while holding them with your chopsticks. Over time, the broth takes on the flavors of everything you've cooked. You spoon it into the bowls provided, and it becomes the soup course that ends your meal. The restaurant touts its cuisine as low-carb, but offsetting that is a high salt content. Drink plenty of liquids. I've been to some shabu shabu places where the broth bowl is suspended below the table surface. Swish is able to do that for the personal-size servings, but when the order is for two, they serve it on a burner that sits on the table itself. This is a bit less convenient, as you have to reach up to cook the food. Eating Swish's special combo is like a decathalon of chopstick skills. Some items are easy, such as the beef, shrimp, mushrooms and scallops. But others are cumbersome for the chopstick-challenged, either because they're unwieldy (cabbage, noodles), or because they tend to fall apart after cooking (crabmeat, whitefish, tofu). However, it all tastes delicious, and besides that it's just plain fun.Shabu shabu strikes me as a perfect adventure for groups - Swish's tables seat up to four. With all of that self-help cooking going on, there's plenty to talk and laugh about. The boiling broth creates plenty of steam, which will be especially welcome on cold winter nights. The restaurant's literature also touts it as a good first-date place, but I would not recommend that. There's too much opportunity for accidental slapstick humor as you fumble around with your chopsticks. I don't know why you'd go if you're not interested in shabu shabu, but Swish does have other things to offer. There's a small selection of curries and rice dishes. There are lunch specials as low as $6.95. We began our meal with an order of vegetable dumplings. These were wonderful, and I had to pinch myself to believe that we paid just $3.95 for six of them. The drinks menu offers a variety of teas and smoothies ($2.50 or $3.00 each). For sake, the only options were \"hot\" or \"cold,\" but $4.50 for a small bottle was a very fair price. Swish gave me my first chance to try table1.com, the newest of the online reservation services. Every table1 reservation comes with a discount, but you pay $1.50 per person. For a smaller restaurant, table1 is clearly a good deal, because they don't have to install proprietary software or hardware, as opentable requires. Anyhow, I paid $3 to reserve on table1, and got a $10.42 discount off of our $52.10 bill. Swish's spare decor of blond wood and bamboo mats is just about perfect, creating a sense of escape and discovery. We wished the background music were more suited to this serene environment. It was not at all loud, but it was a generic jazz/new age soundtrack that one could have heard anywhere. Our server was friendly, helpful, and extremely attentive, but dressed as if she were on her way to the gym. Swish is owned by a couple of young NYU grads. It has been open just three months. With just nine tables, I suspect it will get busy once the students return to town and discover this little gem.

Note: Maurizio Trattoria has closed. The space will re-open in Febuary 2009 as another Italian restaurant, Da Andrea, which is relocating from Hudson Street. Maurizio is an unexpectedly good neighborhood trattoria at the north end of the Village. The eponymous Maurizio delivers a hearty greeting. No doubt he is delighted to have the foot traffic, as heavy construction on that block of 13th Street must be a serious damper on business. On a Sunday night, the waitress emphatically recommended the veal chop, which happened to be the menu's most expensive entree that day, at $24. I took her advice and was glad I did. This was one of the thickest, juiciest veal chops I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy. Just recalling it makes my mouth water all over again. Nothing particularly imaginative was done with the chop. It was just grilled and lightly seasoned. However, my eyes lingered enviously at several other creations that drifted out of Maurizio's kitchen. There is a standing menu, as well as a printed list of daily specials. Maurizio's impresses quietly. I'd certainly be pleased to return. If you happen to be in that area of the Village, take a look.

What if the Election's a Tie?

***CONTENT
An article today on electoral-vote.com raises a fascinating prospect: what if the election is a tie?I don't mean a popular vote tie (virtually impossible), but an electoral vote tie. If George W. Bush wins exactly the same states as he did in 2000, the election would be decided 278-260 in the Electoral College. Now, suppose John Kerry peels off New Hampshire (4 E.V.) and West Virginia (5) -- both of them battleground states in which Kerry currently holds a polling lead. That would make the election a 269-269 tie. Not likely, perhaps, but certainly plausible.Under the Constitution, if no candidate receives a majority of the electoral votes, the House of Representatives chooses the President, with each state's delegation getting one vote. Republicans control 31 of the state delegations today, with 14 in Democratic hands, and 5 tied. Nobody thinks the Democrats can do well enough in this year's election to take control of a majority of the state delegations. Therefore, a 269-all tie in the Electoral College is as good as a Bush win. But in one of the more peculiar Constitutional provisions, the Senate would get to choose the Vice-President in case of a tie. The Democrats have a decent shot at taking over the Senate in this election. Not a superb shot, but at least an average shot. It could therefore happen that the House chooses President Bush, but the Senate chooses Vice-President Edwards, sending Dick Cheney into early retirement. Needless to say, a Vice-President Edwards wouldn't be welcome in the Bush White House. Indeed, you could expect Edwards to have a good deal of time on his hands, showing up in the Senate only occasionally to do the one thing the Constitution allows all VPs to do: cast a tie-breaking vote. At least, he'd have plenty of time to plan his 2008 Presidential race, while drawing a handsome government salary (and a beautiful home at taxpayers' expense) for doing essentially nothing. Oddly, this would mark an unintended return to the original system. Before 1804, electors didn't vote separately for President and Vice-President. Instead, each elector just wrote down two names. The candidate receiving the most E.V.'s - provided he was named on a majority of the ballots - became President, and the candidate receiving the second-most votes became Vice-President. It was thus quite possible that the President and V.P. would not only come from different parties, but indeed would be complete ideological opposites.The system of separate choice for a President and V.P. was adopted after the 1800 election, when Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr tied in the Electoral College. After 1800, the House of Representatives chose the President just one more time. That happened in 1924, when Andrew Jackson won the popular vote handily (43.1%), but the electoral votes split among four candidates, and the House voted John Quincy Adams President. Jackson supporters were outraged, and he easily defeated Adams four years later.

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Barbuto.Last Friday night, a friend and I paid a happy visit to Barbuto. The neighborhood is technically the West Village, but the phalanx of black cars and beautiful people tells you you're \"Meatpacking-adjacent.\" Like many of the clubs and restaurants in this neighborhood, the building has been repurposed from less glamorous origins. This place seems to have been a garage. On a beautiful summer evening, Barbuto slides open the doors, and it's wide open to the nearby river breeze on two sides. The decor is spare, with exposed brick, industrial ceilings, and an open kitchen at the back. Chairs are painted brightly, tables are polished wood, napkins are gingham plaid. They print a new menu every day. A link on their website to \"today's menu\" is, in fact, that of July 22nd, which is similar to the one we saw. We both chose the appetizer of zucchini leaves with goat cheese, a dish in which I thought the cheese lacked a suitable accompaniment. For the entrees, my friend chose the sea bass, while I chose the grilled skirt steak with chilli sauce. I had a taste of the bass, which was moist and succulent. The steak was an ample portion, hot and spicy. The chilli sauce brought just the right level of heat to the dish, overcoming a steak that was neither tender nor thick enough to be satisfactory on its own. Both entres were $19, which for food of this quality is a great deal in NYC. Barbuto takes its spare surroundings a bit too seriously. Who ever heard of an Italian restaurant that doesn't offer bread with the meal? Instead, we were given just a small plate with a few nuts and olives. We made fast work of these, and had little to occupy us while we waited for dinner to arrive - which took a bit longer than it should. On the other hand, this gave us ample time to enjoy the lovely summer evening.Barbuto (775 Washington Street at West 12th Street, Meatpacking District)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Note: Click here for a more recent visit to Nobu.A vendor took me to lunch at Nobu yesterday. Just like the last time, we appeared promptly at the opening time 11:45am and were seated immediately, promising to vacate our table before 1:30pm.Nobu offers several sushi and sashimi assortments for lunch, priced between $22.50 and $26.00. Any one of them is a steal, in my opinion. I ordered the \"Special Sushi\" at $26.00, which came with somewhere between 12-15 pieces, plus Miso Soup. The ingredients were first-class, as one would expect at this temple of Japanese cuisine. This must be one of the best upscale sushi bargains in town.One of my dining companions offered me a piece of his softshell crab sushi, an astonishing composition. Another of the composed lunch plates offers Sashimi with Soft Shell Crab Roll at $23.50. I shall have to try that next time.Nobu (105 Hudson Street at Franklin Street, TriBeCa)

Outfoxed, an exposé on the right-wing bias at FoxNews, is now playing at the Quad Cinema (34 W. 13th St, between 5th & 6th Aves). Subtitled \"Rupert Murdoch's War on Journalism,\" the film: ...examines how media empires, led by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, have been running a \"race to the bottom\" in television news. This film provides an in-depth look at Fox News and the dangers of ever-enlarging corporations taking control of the public's right to know. The film explores Murdoch's burgeoning kingdom and the impact on society when a broad swath of media is controlled by one person. Media experts, including Jeff Cohen (FAIR) Bob McChesney (Free Press), Chellie Pingree (Common Cause), Jeff Chester (Center for Digital Democracy) and David Brock (Media Matters) provide contexamines how media empires, led by Rupert Murdoch's Fox News, have been running a \"race to the bottom\" in television news. This film provides an in-depth look at Fox News and the dangers of ever-enlarging corporations taking control of the public's right to know. Outfoxed is like a junior Fahrenheit 9/11. It is only playing at small arthouses in cities that have huge anti-Bush audiences to draw upon (NY, D.C., L.A., San Fran, Berkely). The Quad seats about 150, and it was nearly full last night. If you enjoyed Michael Moore's film and would like a second dose, Outfoxed might be for you. The Quad is offering seven screenings a day, but I don't expect this film to have \"legs\" the way Fahrenheit did. The film's not-so-shocking revelation is that FoxNews is unabashedly an organ for the Republican Party. I doubt that anybody in the audience will be surprised by this, so most of the film's 1:15 running time is just reinforcing what we already know. As in Fahrenheit, the director has cleverly chosen the most damning evidence, and edited it with an intent to ridicule. Perhaps the funnist moment is when FoxNews anchor Brit Hume claims that the chances of dying in the line of duty in Iraq are about the same as the chances of being murdered in California. More damning is that about 83% of Hume's guests on his 1-to-1 interview show are Republicans. Hume can interview anyone he wants, of course, but not when the network claims to be \"fair and balanced.\" But Outfoxed doesn't know where to stop. Pompous \"experts\" lament \"the dangers of ever-enlarging corporations taking control of the public's right to know.\" To the contrary, Rupert Murdoch hasn't taken control of my right to know anything. It's up to us, as citizens, to seek out what we need. The information's out there -- indeed, more of it than most anyone can possibly absorb. It's people's own damned fault if they choose to let Bill O'Reilly and Sean Hannity spoonfeed them. In this sense, Outfoxed lacks Fahrenheit's sure touch. No one would accuse Michael Moore of objectivity, but even he stops short of such sweeping over-generalizations. Outfoxed is worth a look for the laughs it gives us at Fox's expense -- if you're into that sort of thing. I had a good time, but I could have done without the over-blown fears about the collapse of our democracy. Luckily, most of Outfoxed is more solid than that. And more fun.

I don't know what First Lady Laura Bush majored in, but I'll go out on a limb and guess it wasn't biology. In an interview with the Associated Press, she praised her husband's policy virtually banning stem cell research in any lab that receives Federal funding.To be exact, the Bush policy limits stem cell research to the 78 stem cell lines that were in existence on Aug. 9, 2001 -- the date the ban was announced. It has turned out, for a variety of reasons, that only 21 of those lines have been useful. Some of those lines have other problems that limit their practical utility. About 99.9% of the lines that could potentially be studied are unavailable. The ban doesn't apply to privately-funded research, but there are few laboratories and/or scientists that don't receive Federal funding at some point, making the ban extremely effective at very nearly shutting down this avenue of research.Laura Bush said, \"We don't even know that stem cell research will provide cures for anything -- much less that it's very close.\" But of course, one seldom knows for sure that a scientific breakthrough is \"very close\" until it happens. The Bush policy ensures that progress, whether close or not, will come a lot more slowly than it should.

***CONTENT
If you passed ninth grade civics, you know that electoral votes -- not popular votes -- decide U. S. Presidential elections. There are 538 electoral votes available. That corresponds to the number of senators (100) and representatives (435) in Congress, plus three for the District of Columbia. The actual electoral voters are local party officials who are totally unknown to people like you and me. Being named an elector is their reward for years of toiling anonymously but loyally in partisan politics.Taken together, the group of electors is called the \"Electoral College.\" I don't know why they're called a \"college\" -- they're nothing of the kind -- but we might as well get used to it. By the way, the correct pronunciation is e-LECT-or-al, not e-lect-OR-al. You can show your political savvy by pronouncing it correctly.It would take too much space to explain why the Founders chose this peculiar system, which most Americans don't seem to understand. Some people would like to see the Electoral College abolished or modified, but this has no chance of happening. The system overwhelmingly benefits the less-populous states, because each state, no matter how few citizens it has, gets at least 3 electoral votes. This means even Alaska, which is almost all wilderness, carries 0.55762% of the votes necessary to elect a President. Many of the thinly-populated states have considerably less than 0.55762% of the nation's voters, so the electoral college gives them a lot more influence than they would otherwise have.A constitutional amendment to abolish the Electoral College would require a 2/3rds vote by both Houses of Congress, followed by the approval of at least 3/4ths of the state legislatures. A lot more than 1/4th of the states benefit from the present system, because they have more votes than a purely proportional allocation would give them. Any amendment to make the system more democratic would therefore be opposed by enough states to prevent its passage. This simply goes to show that we're going to have the Electoral College with us for a long time. Probably forever.In 2000, George W. Bush beat Al Gore in the Electoral College 271-267 (with 270 needed to win), making it one of the closest elections ever. Actually, one of Al Gore's electors abstained in protest, so his official total was just 266. I'm giving Gore credit for 267, because I don't think the elector would have done this had her vote mattered. Gore would have been President had he won just one more state -- and he barely lost in several, most notably Florida, but also in New Hampshire, among others.The available electoral votes get reapportioned among the states every ten years, after the census. Over many decades, this process has gradually worked against the Democrats, as Republican-leaning states in the deep south and far west continue to gain in population compared to the rest of the country. Had Michael Dukakis in 1988 managed to win the states Al Gore won in 2000, Dukakis would have been President. (Dukakis, of course, ran one of the most inept campaigns in modern times, and came nowhere close to winning enough states to be President.)Since the 2000 election, another census has rejuggled the electoral votes, giving the Republicans a further advantage. If George W. Bush wins the same states as in 2000, he'll win in the Electoral College by a margin of 278-260. Of the states Al Gore won, just California has gained an electoral vote, while six of Gore's other states have lost them. Four Bush states have lost an electoral vote apiece, but seven others have gained a vote or two.Of course, neither party is guaranteed to win the same states as last time, but the electorate is more polarized than it has ever been before. By most accounts, there are about thirty states that are essentially non-competitive. Indeed, there are eleven states (worth 62 electoral votes) that have voted Republican in every election since 1964. Another eight states (worth 60 electoral votes) have voted Republican eight out of the last nine. In total, that gives George Bush 122 electoral votes in states he can win without ever paying a visit.No states are as dependably Democratic as the nineteen the Republicans have in their hip pockets. As recently as 1984, Ronald Reagan carried 49 out of 50, losing just Walter Mondale's home state of Minnesota. Richard Nixon had done the same in 1972, losing only Massachusetts. (People think of Kerry's home state as a liberal bastion, but it voted for Reagan twice, and it has a Republican governor.) In 1988, the first Bush won 40 out of 50 over Michael Dukakis. Oh, the Democrats did carry the District of Columbia in those landslides, so that gives them just 3 electoral votes that are rock-solid.Turning to more recent history, there's a core group of states that have been solidly Democratic for the last several elections, and in which John Kerry currently enjoys very large leads that even Republicans would concede are insurmountable. Although there are only eleven states (plus D.C.) in this category, it includes three of the five largest prizes: California (55 E.V.), New York (31) and Illinois (21). Altogether, Kerry has at least 168 electoral votes locked in, which is just 102 shy of the number needed for election.The remaining twenty states are commonly called the \"battleground states.\" If you live in one of these states, you're going to be seeing an awful lot of George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, John Kerry, and John Edwards. These are the states that both sides recognize as competitive. They could go either way. Most polls in the battleground states show either no meaningful lead, or a lead for one candidate that's well within the margin of polling error. That's why they call them battlegrounds.Nevertheless, the news in the contested states is better for Kerry than it is for Bush. In every such state that Al Gore won in 2000, Kerry has consistently led in the polls (even if only slightly). In other words, there is no state that Bush lost four years ago that he can feel particularly good about winning in 2004. Kerry's lead is weakest in Minnesota (10 E.V.), Wisconsin (10), Iowa (7), and New Mexico (5), but he is ahead in all of them. On the other hand, should Bush make inroads in the larger Kerry states, such as Pennsylvania (21) or Michigan (17), it would be a sign that Kerry's in big trouble.Bush, on the other hand, is already in some trouble in several states that he won in 2000, particularly New Hampshire (4), West Virginia (5), Missouri (11), and Florida (27). Whether he holds the lead in these states can change almost daily, but at this writing it looks like he would lose at least three out of the four. Bush is also vulnerable (that is, within the margin of polling error) in several Republican strongholds he once expected to win easily, such as Nevada (5), Ohio (20), Arkansas (6), Arizona (11), Tennessee (11), and Virginia (13). John Kerry is unlikely to win all of these, but he doesn't need them. If Kerry holds Al Gore's states, he only needs to peel away 10 electoral votes that George Bush won four years ago. As of today, Kerry stands a very good chance of doing that. We'll have to see if that's still true after the Republican National Convention, when Bush can expect at least a modest \"bounce\" in the polls.A Presidential election is actually fifty-one separate elections that happen to be held on the same day. Nationwide public opinion polls, which are the most common kind we see, tend to obscure the state-by-state races where the election is really decided. Both campaigns have Electoral College strategists who are experts in all the different ways of counting to 270. Just look at where George Bush and John Kerry spend their time over the next three months, and you'll have a very good idea where the battle is being fought.

Note: Shore closed, as did Coast. Fresh remains open, and well worth a try.Part of the affectation at fresh. (105 Reade St) and shore. (41 Murray St) is that a period always follows the restaurant name, even in the middle of a sentence. Hence, you do not order the Fresh Salad, but the \"fresh. Salad.\" Neither the Shore Chicken, but the \"shore. Chicken.\" A sibling called \"coast.\" is to open around Labor Day on Liberty Street downtown.They're run by the same outfit that supplies seafood to the likes of Alain Ducasse, Le Bernardin, and Bouley. Fresh and Shore (forgive me for eschewing the periods) share a common chef, Daniel Angerer. Fresh is the upscale version (two NYT stars), while Shore got a favorable \"$25-and-under\" review from Eric Asimov earlier this year.Coincidentally, I tried both within a couple of days of each other. (I didn't know that a business associate was planning dinner at Fresh on Monday night, when I chose Shore on Saturday night.)At 41 Murray Street, Shore is just barely in TriBeCa. Actually, it is technically not in TriBeCa, although some real estate folk now use \"TriBeCa South\" to refer to the thin wafer of streets bounded by Chambers, Vesey, Broadway, and the West Side Highway. It's a bit like the rebranding of Hell's Kitchen.But I see no evidence that Shore is trying to capitalize on its TriBeCa proximity. Indeed, the exterior seems positively designed to discourage walk-ins. It looks like just another one of the dive bars that permeate the area. The restaurant's name is on a fading tie-on banner, lending the place a makeshift appearance that makes you wonder if they're still deciding whether to stay.With such a seedy exterior, you have no idea that the inside will look so warm and inviting. It's an airy sea-shore esthetic, with ample space between the tables, a raw bar, space for live musicians, and service that's both friendly and efficient. Shore wasn't full the night I visited - far from it. An exterior facelift would certainly help.Shore has a specials menu that changes daily. Thankfully, they print it and attach it to the menu, instead of forcing us to memorize a list recited by the server. Their main menu changes seasonally. I placed a hopelessly contrarian order: Smothered Barbequed Baby-Back ribs. Well, forgive me, but I was just in a mood for ribs, and it turns out Shore does a damned good job of them. My friend ordered the Boston Batter-Fried Combo Plate, which comes in a paper basket as if you'd ordered it at the shore. It includes shrimp, scallops, lemon sole, clams, and fries. I tasted a good deal of her plate, and it was delightful.Overall, Shore is a great escape - like going to the shore without leaving Manhattan. Appetizers are anywhere from $4 for a cup of soup, to $16 for a pail of steamers. Mains are anywhere from $8 (fried lemon sole sandwich) to $22 (baked stuffed shrimp).At Fresh, which I tried two evenings later, the menu changes daily. The decor is bright and airy. You'll either welcome it like a fresh breeze, or you'll find the sea-blue murals decidedly kitschy. Take your pick, but I liked it. Service was superb, although we had an early reservation, so there was plenty of staff available to attend us.There's a six-course $65 tasting menu, with two choices per course, which is what my associate and I ordered. I'm afraid I can't remember most of the courses, aside from the foie gras, which was out-of-this-world. A tomato soup came highly recommended by our server, but I was underwhelmed. The main fish course was a hit. Overall, I have had more awesome tasting menus, but at $65 this one is a comparative bargain.

The post-convention polls are in, and there isn't much for John Kerry to crow about. His \"bounce\" is, at best, a modest 1-2 points, which is statistically irrelevant when you consider that the margin of error in most polls is 3-4 points. Indeed, the Gallup/USA Today poll actually had him losing ground to Bush after the convention. I am inclined to discount the Gallup result because it is so far askew from all of the other polls. Nevertheless, Kerry's bounce shapes up to be the smallest of any challenger since the Democrats nominated George McGovern in the middle of the night in 1972.Naturally, the two parties have contrasting views as to why this happened. Republicans say that the voters finally got a good look at John Kerry, and they don't like what they see. Democrats say that most voters had already made up their minds, and they never expected a large bounce. Neither explanation is particularly convincing, although surely the Democrats hoped for a bounce greater than zero, which is about what they got.An article in today's USA Today gives eight possible reasons for the non-bounce, but concludes: \"Check back in five weeks\" -- that is, after the Republican convention. Kerry's convention performance can be compared to the top half of the first inning in baseball. The visiting team failed to score. Bush's convention will be the bottom half of the inning. If most voters have already decided who they're voting for, then Bush won't get a bounce either. If Bush does get a bounce, he could head into the fall election season with a significant advantage, since the candidate ahead as of Labor Day has almost always won in November.The New York Times noted this morning that Kerry had two clear shots to change the dynamics of the race during July. The selection of John Edwards as his running mate was the first, and his convention speech was the second. Neither has significantly helped him, and Bush figures to dominate the headlines during the month of August. Kerry will need to play defense until after Labor Day, when the debate season will offer his last chance at swaying that ever-shrinking segment of the electorate that has not already made up its mind.

The 67-year-old post office at 90 Church Street -- across the street from Ground Zero -- reopened today for the first time since September 11, 2001. On the outside, the building had no obvious damage, but the insides were contaminated with 9/11 pixie dust. The facility had to be almost entirely gutted, and most of the windows replaced.The building is still girthed in scaffolding, which I hope will come down soon, but as of this morning it was open for business once again. I was one of its last users before the terrorist attacks, having stopped there to mail a package early that morning.Any return to normalcy is to be welcomed, but I have particularly selfish reasons for welcoming back the Church Street post office, because it's on my route to work every morning. For the last three years, I've had to go well out of my way to buy stamps or get an overweight package mailed. From now on, I'll be back home at Church Street.Update: If you never thought a building from the 1930s could look and smell brand-spanking-new, then visit the post office at 90 Church Street. I spoke to one of the employees about it. They love the fresh paint and bright lighting. And all of the self-service kiosks actually have pens that write! (I wonder how long that'll last.)

I paid my second visit to Artisanal the other night (earlier visit here). My friend and I had a 7:00pm reservation. Most tables were still empty at this time (this being an early reservation), but they were certainly full by the time we left.We had the fondue. The menu lists five fondues, but they also had two specials. We chose the \"100 cheese\" fondue, which was excellent. Artisanal's fondues come with a bowl of bread squares for dipping, but you can also order side dishes (\"Les Baigneuses\"), at $6.50 apiece. We chose the beef tips and the air-dried beef. The latter item deserves a more enticing description. It was thinly-sliced dried beef, something like cured ham, and extremely tasty. The beef tips were lightly cooked, very rare, juicy sirloin.We also asked for a side order of the Gougeres, which are available in small or large portions ($7.50 or $10.50). These are hopelessly addictive, so I recommend ordering the small size unless you want to ruin your dinner.The fondue comes in two sizes (petite and grande), serving 1-3 or 4-6 persons respectively. For two people, it's quite filling enough to be a meal, so we just ordered a cheese plate for dessert. Artisanal offers numerous composed thematic cheese plates, but you can also choose your own. We chose four cheeses ($18), with the able assistance of the fromagier. For the record, they were:Robila Due Latte, Italy (\"Yielding, Lactic, Subtle\")Manchego, Spain (\"Briny, Nutty, Sturdy\")Ubriaco del Piave, Italy (\"Crumbly, Hints of Pineapple & Wine\")Keen's Cheddar, England (\"Creamy, Earthy, Meaty Finish\")These were wonderful choices. The Robila Due Latte and the Ubriaco del Piave were my favorites. The Manchego and the Keen's Cheddar were wonderful, but not (for me) sufficiently differentiated from the others. But then, where a choice is offered, I usually ask for the most ridiculously exotic choices available. My friend was in a bit more conservative mood. Many of the posts on the food boards have reported service issues at Artisanal. I didn't have that reaction on my first visit, but this time was another story. It took two hours to get through all of the above, mainly because we were left waiting for such ridiculously long times. When I sat down, my server asked if I'd like a drink. I asked for tap water, while I perused the wine list. The tap water came instantly, but twenty minutes later the server hadn't returned to take my drink order.It seemed like 15 minutes after we were done with the fondue before our server came by to ask about dessert; another 15 minutes before the fromagier came over; another 15 minutes before the cheese actually arrived. I didn't actually time these things, but two hours had gone by before we knew it.On the other hand, once you did order something, it usually came quickly (other than the cheese). Dirty plates were cleared promptly, and they were attentive about refilling our water glasses. But if you needed your server, you were in for a very long wait. We were in no hurry, so it didn't really bother us that much. I wouldn't recommend Artisanal for a pre-theater dinner!Another friend recently visited Artisanal and had a similar experience with poor service. She, too, was sufficiently wowed by the food, and says she will quite happily return, as will I. Just don't go there when you're in a hurry.Artisanal (2 Park Avenue at 32nd Street, Murray Hill)Food: **Service: FairAmbiance: *Overall: **

Downtown JFK Rail Link Gets a Boost

***CONTENT
The White House has agreed to recommend that $2 billion in post-9/11 Federal aid be converted to a direct grant that would help fund a rail link between JFK airport and Lower Manhattan. The funds had previously been allocated to the Liberty Bond program. Congress must still approve the shift, but with White House backing approval seems likely. It's thought that the rail link would cost at least $6.0 billion. The MTA has allocated $400 million for the link in its next capital program, and the Port Authority says it will contribute about $560 million. That means Gov. Pataki, who strongly backs the rail link, still neads to find about another $3.0 billion -- and that assumes the initial cost estimates are accurate. (The $6.0 billion figure seems low to me.) Another $500 million could come from canceling the unpopular West Street tunnel, which at almost $700 million is surely the most wasteful of the Lower Manhattan rebuilding projects. West Street could be widened to eight lanes at-grade for just $175 million, freeing the surplus for much worthier projects.

I feel compelled to note for the record that I tried 71 Clinton Fresh Food a couple of weeks ago. It's part of the gaggle of high-end Lower East Side eateries that have opened in recent years. Star chef Wylie Dufresne made his name here, but Dufresne hopped across the street to the award-winning WD-50.71CFF is now under chef Jason Neroni. I never visited the restaurant during Dufresne's tenure, so I can't make comparisons. However, I was underwhelmed. I have already forgotten the appetizer, and a duck entree seemed unimaginative.Mind you, I didn't consider myself ill-served at 71CFF. But with appetizers in the $11-19 range, and main courses $19-27, it's not a cheap evening out. The city, and indeed the neighborhood, has better to offer at that price.Postscript: Not long after our visit, Frank Bruni reviewed 71 Clinton Fresh Food in The New York Times, re-affirming its two-star rating. The restaurant closed in March 2006, after the chef, Jason Neroni, left to cook for \"some kind of billionaire.\" The billionaire must not have been smitten, because by November Neroni was back in New York, helming the stoves at an \"unpretentious Italian bistro,\" Porchetta. That's now closed, too.71 Clinton Fresh Food (71 Clinton Street between Rivington & Stanton Streets, Lower East Side)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: *

Some restaurants have the buzz, and some don't. Thalia is one of those restaurants that's never mentioned on the food boards, but it carries a two-star NYT rating from 2000, and based on my visit there the other night, it deserves a lot more attention.I started with the Seared Herb Crusted Tuna Sashimi, which comes with pickled vegetables, sweet soy, chive oil & hot mustard. (I am copying from their website, else my identification of the ingredients wouldn't be so precise.) The tuna was wonderfully fresh, and the soy sauce, which artfully decorated the plate, added a tangy finish to the taste.For the main course, I had the Jerked Florida Grouper, which is served with lump crabmeat pico de gallo, sweet plantains & chipotle pepper sauce. This too was a wonderfully inventive combination, giving life to a fish that I usually find dull.I have to report that my friend was a bit less enthusiastic. She had the crab cakes appetizer and the rack of lamb entree. No particular complaint, but she wasn't as wowed by her choices as I was.To conclude, we shared a Trio of Creme Brulee, which comes with three small servings of raspberry, lavender, and chocolate Pot de Creme. No complaint here, and at $10 a bargain.Appetizers are $7-18 (the latter for a lobster salad; all others are $14 or less), entrees $13-27, and desserts $7-10 ($14 for the cheese tasting). There is also a raw bar, which we did not sample.Service was prompt - perhaps to a fault. Our appetizers arrived seemingly within minutes, which was so quick that our server hadn't yet arrived with the wine. The wine list seemed to us expensive in relation to the menu. We settled on a $38 red that was acceptable without being special. The next level up would have required us to spend quite a bit more, which we weren't of a mind to do.The noise level at Thalia was mercifully lower than at many restaurants I've tried lately, although there is still an audible buzz around the place. We enjoyed a leisurely meal and were able to hear ourselves talk, which is never a given in New York restaurants.Thalia (828 Eighth Avenue at 50th Street, West Midtown)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: *½Overall: **Postscript: On a subsequent visit, Thalia seemed to me less impressive than the first time. The two stars I awarded were probably too generous.

Note: Click here and here for more recent visits to Babbo. In New York, there's hardly a tougher table to come by than at Babbo, chef Mario Batali's flagship in Greenwich Village. Reservations are accepted up to one month to the calendar date in advance, and if you want one you'd best call at 10:00am on that exact date. But if you don't mind eating at the bar, you can amble in any day at the 5:00pm opening time. Babbo offers wonderful service at the bar itself, and there are also several tables in the area that are first-come, first-served. I gave Babbo a try last Saturday night, sitting at the bar as many reviews had recommended. I had my heart set on the pasta tasting menu, but I was surprised to learn that they won't serve their tasting menus to parties of one. What an unfriendly policy! It's their loss, as I ended up spending less money. Anyhow, I proceeded to order à la carte. Babbo is well known for offal, so that's where my priorities lay. I started with Pig's Feet Milanese. This looked a bit like a large potato pancake, crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside. It was a wonderful taste sensation. I then had the dish so much talked about, the Beef Cheek Ravioli. Perhaps it was inevitable that it couldn't exceed its reputation, but it is a wonderful creation, putting traditional raviolis to shame. Babbo offers plates of 3, 5, of 7 cheeses for dessert, priced at $12, $15, and $18 respectively. I chose the 5-cheese plate, which was really far too much for one person after a full-size appetizer and main course. A waiter came around and gave a back-story for all five cheeses (one of them came from a farm run by Mario Batali's wife's parents) and recommended the order in which they should be eaten, from least-to-most \"assertive.\" In an unusual custom, Babbo serves its single-serving wines by the quartino, rather than by the glass. A quartino is about 1/3 of a bottle, so you get about two glasses for around the price many restaurants charge for just one. I'm not a big drinker, so that was about all I needed to pace myself through the meal. The New York Times's new restaurant critic, Frank Bruni, chose Babbo as his first review, re-affirming a three-star status first conferred by Ruth Reichl six years ago. I agree with Frank Bruni that Babbo is a bit too crowded to qualify for four stars, but he complained of \"relatively hard rock\" music, played too loudly for comfort. I found none of this. Perhaps the soundtrack changes later in the evening? Although I was there alone on this occasion, I believe my dining companions - had there been any - would have heard each other a lot easier than in most New York restaurants I've tried recently. The Bruni review led me to expect the hustle-bussle of a brasserie, and that Babbo is not. Service was excellent, particularly considering that I was a bar patron. Babbo has so much to offer, and I felt that I saw just the tip of the iceberg. I will have to go back.

Laurent Tourondel got a raw deal the last time he opened a restaurant in New York. Right out of the gate, the much-lauded Cello earned three stars from the Times, but his backers got cold feet after 9/11. They pulled the plug one night when he was out of town, and he returned to find he no longer had a restaurant. At BLT Steak, it looks like Tourondel has a winner on his hands. The place seems to fill up every night, and it's in a part of town where there's not much competition in the genre. And it's just close enough to be a suitable pre-concert haunt for the Carnegie Hall crowd. \"BLT\" stands for Bistro Laurent Tourondel, although I believe they'll actually serve you an upscale version of the BLT sandwich if you visit at lunch time. As the name implies, you'll get a steak there and be happy. The choice surprised some critics, however, as Cello was best known for its seafood. A companion restaurant called \"BLT Fish\" is said to be in the works. A friend and I tried BLT Steak for dinner last Friday night. The restaurant has a split personality, with the decor seeming more upscale than a bistro, but the specials menu posted on the back wall screaming, \"Don't take us too seriously!\" Our table seemed larger than the typical table-for-two, and at first it seemed like we had to shout a bit to hear each other above the din, for BLT Steak is certainly a loud place. However, we needed all of that space once the side dishes started to arrive. After we sat down, a server brought sliced bread and goose liver pate. This was followed by the celebrated popovers - enormous fluffy pastry balls the size of a barbell - with soft butter. At this point, those with small stomachs will feel half-full already, but there is a dinner to be eaten. We both fixed our gaze on the heirloom tomato appetizer, and a fine choice this was. The tomatoes were thick, rich, and perfectly seasoned. Several reviewers had said that BLT Steak was actually a better place for fish. However, we were in a carnivorous mood, so we ordered the Ribeye for Two, with sides of french fries and creamed spinach. We also chose our sauces: horseradish and three mustards. This seemed to us a competent presentation, but nothing to rush back for. Our feeling was that BLT Steak deserves another look...but next time, for the fish. We ordered a $48 cabernet from the specials board. It too was acceptable without wowing us.

Note: Montrachet closed in May 2006-ostensibly for \"renovations,\" but it never re-opened, and its wine cellar was sold. It is scheduled to re-open in late summer 2008 as Corton, with Paul Liebrandt in the kitchen.In March 2004, New York Times interim restaurant critic Amanda Hesser made a stir when she demoted Montrachet, the long-time three-star standout in TriBeCa, to two stars. Whether Montrachet deserved the slap-down may be debated, but the review stood out for its soul-lessness.I had a chance to find out for myself last week. Hesser's comments about the decor seemed to me completely wacky. She wrote:Entering the restaurant is a bit like stepping through the looking glass. There is no coat room in the tiny foyer. A small portable heater set on top of a wine cask buzzed at the coat checker, who took my coat, hung it on a metal rack in the dining room, then looked up my reservation. She was polite, warm even.Before me stood a dining room with sponge-painted walls and self-consciously modern paintings. It felt like a scene from \"Wall Street.\" I could picture Michael Douglas sitting at a red banquette, bellowing into a first-generation cellphone the size of a shoe.I hadn't been to Montrachet in years, and I suddenly felt the disappointment of returning to a childhood home and finding that the backyard is not so big as you remembered, that the curtains are kind of shabby. Montrachet even smells old.I can't comment on the coat rack and space heater-it being high summer, these accoutrements were entirely unnecessary. But the space itself seems elegant and refined. It didn't smell old.I was there with a party of three. Two of us chose the appetizer of Marinated Sea Scallops with Gazpacho Sauce. This was a bit disappointing, as the gazpacho overwhelmed the scallops, leaving them flabby and dead to the taste. The third member of our party ordered a Wild Mushroom Bisque, which he pronounced a success.We had three different main courses, which all were pleased with. Between us, we tried the Magret of Duck with Pistachios and Cherry Endive Compote, the Chilean Sea Bass \"en Barigoule\" with Parmigiano Reggiano, and the Grilled Rib Eye Steak with Morels, Texas Sweet Onions and Truffles.Montrachet has one of the most revered wine lists in the city, and it takes a connoisseur (or the sommelier's guidance) to make sense of it. One of my companions knows his wines, and he chose a PlumpJack Cabernet Sauvignon - a brand previously unknown to me - that I found superb.For the record, appetizers at Montrachet are $11-22, mains are $24-32, desserts $10-11. A cheese course runs to $16 per head. All three of us tried that, and I was gratified to find that it included good-sized samples of five contrasting cheeses, which is more than you get for the money at many restaurants in town.Montrachet also offers four fixed menus. There are two three-course prix fixe options at $30 or $46, a six-course tasting for $79, or an eight-course tasting for $95. The latter is available only Monday to Friday.Montrachet certainly seems to me superior to most two-star restaurants in New York. While one cannot judge fairly on a single visit, on this showing I would say that Hesser's demotion to two stars was an injustice.Montrachet (239 West Broadway between White and Walker Streets, TriBeCa) Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Federal Criminal Sentences in Limbo

***CONTENT
The Federal criminal sentencing process is in turmoil. It's all because of a U. S. Supreme Court decision issued in June, Blakely vs. Washington. It now appears all-but-certain that the Federal sentencing guidelines, which are nearly twenty years old, are unconstitutional.Here's the background:Until 1984, Federal judges had wide discretion to decide punishments. There were some Federal crimes for which the sentencing range was anything from probation to life in prison. Crimes with ranges of zero to ten or zero to twenty were quite common. Naturally, there was significant disparity between sentences. Defendants who committed seemingly identical crimes were received vastly different punishments, depending on which judge they were lucky (or unlucky) enough to get.The pre-1984 scheme also allowed for parole. So, if a defendant was sentenced to ten years in prison, a parole officer would later recommend how much time he really served, based on his behavior in prison and a guess about his state of rehabilitation. In a way, it was really the parole officer, not the judge, who eventually decided the length of the sentence.For many years, Congress had wrestled with revising the criminal code to provide for more determinate sentences. Ultimately, the task proved too daunting, and Congress instead passed the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 (\"SRA\"). The SRA punted the responsibility for reforming Federal sentencing to a newly minted Sentencing Commission. The Commission was tasked with designing prescriptive guidelines that would leave the judge very little room for discretion. The Act also abolished parole, although it did allow time off for good behavior. Nevertheless, under the Act, defendants were assured of serving at least 85% of their sentences.The Sentencing Commission's guidelines are a mind-boggling collection of formulas that run longer than a small town telephone directory. Based on myriad characteristics of the offense and the offender, the judge is given a narrow \"guideline range\" in which to sentence the defendant. A typical guideline range is something like 120 to 150 months (10 to 12 1/2 years) in prison. The judge can depart from this range if there are mitigating or aggravating factors in the case that the guidelines didn't cover. Given the level of detail embedded in the guidelines calculation, this rarely happens.Some people argued at the time that Congress had exceeded its authority in enacting the SRA. The argument was that only Congress can pass laws deciding what the punishment will be for specific crimes -- it can't delegate this authority to an unelected Commission. However, the Supreme Court ruled 8-1 that the SRA was a constitutionally permissible delegation of legislative power. Justice Scalia dissented, calling the Commission a \"junior-varsity Congress.\"Applying the guidelines is no easy task. I recently highlighted the peculiar fate of Jamie Olis, who was convicted of accounting fraud at the energy firm Dynegy. For the fraud itself, Olis's sentence would have been about 1-2 years. But the guidelines called for an \"enhancement\" based on the amount of money investors had lost because of the fraud. The probation office argued that Olis was entirely responsible for the $100 million that a California retirement plan had lost on Dynegy stock over 2001-2002 -- ignoring other factors that had battered the market that year (the 9/11 attacks; the broad collapse of energy stocks generally; the Enron scandal; Dynegy's failed bid for Enron; and so forth). Crediting Olis with a $100 million loss increased his sentence to a range of 24-30 years. Accepting the probation office's recital of the facts, the judge then sentenced Olis to 24 years in prison, the bottom end of the permitted range.We should pause to emphasize that, while the judge in Olis's case had no discretion to depart from the guideline range, he had absolute discretion to determine the amount of the fraud, which in turned determined the applicable guideline. Unfortunately, many Federal judges these days do as Olis's judge did: they accept the probation office's assumed facts, even when those facts are vigorously disputed by the defendant and were never found by a jury.For several years, the Supreme Court has been wrestling with modern sentencing regimes that expose a defendant to long prison terms, based on the judge determining the existence of various \"sentencing factors.\" The burden of proof for a sentencing factor is usually a lot lower than the burden of proof for guilt. In the Federal system, sentencing factors need only be demonstrated by a \"preponderance of the evidence.\" As the Jamie Olis case shows, sometimes judges give short shrift even to that low standard.The Federal sentencing regime was thrown into disarray in June, when the Supreme Court decided a case called Blakely vs. Washington. Ralph Blakely had pleaded guilty to kidnapping his estranged wife. Washington state law called for a sentence of 49 to 53 months. However, Washington's criminal code calls for an enhanced sentence in cases where the defendant acted with \"deliberate cruelty.\" Finding that Blakely had done so, the judge sentenced him to 90 months in prison. The Supreme Court reversed, because Blakely's sentence depended on an extra finding of fact (deliberate cruelty) that the defendant had not admitted. The Court said that any fact increasing the minimum sentence must either be admitted by the defendant or found beyond a reasonable doubt by a jury.The critical point is that Washington's sentencing system is virtually indistinguishable from the Federal system created by the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984. In Blakely, the Court wrote in a footnote, \"The Federal Guidelines are not before us, and we express no opinion on them.\" However, this is typical of the Supreme Court, which seldom rules on more than is necessary to decide the case before it. Anyone could see that, by the logic employed in Blakely, the Federal guidelines could not survive intact.Sure enough, within weeks, several Federal Courts of Appeals had ruled the Federal guidelines unconstitutional, by the same rationale the Court had employed in Blakely. An even larger number of trial courts had done so. Several of these cases are already on the Supreme Court's doorstep, with motions urging the Court to expedite consideration. It seems virtually certain that the Court will agree to do so.Predicting how the Supreme Court will rule is always tricky, but almost no one expects the Court to find the Federal guidelines entirely Constitutional. The system is just too similar to the one the Court tossed out in Blakely. The more difficult question is what to do about it -- which lawyers refer to as the \"severability issue.\" In short: are the guidelines that pass constitutional muster \"severable\" from those that do not? The problem is that Congress clearly intended the guidelines to be used in all Federal criminal cases. What kind of strange system would we have, if they applied in some cases, but not in others? On the other hand, if the Supreme Court tosses out the entire Sentencing Reform Act, federal sentencing would return to the indeterminate scheme as it existed in 1984. Yet, that scheme assumed the existence of parole, which is no longer available under Federal law. So it is indeed a quagmire.Blakely, like so many cases at the Supreme Court these days, was decided by a 5-4 margin. However, the division was not the Court's usual conservative-liberal split. Instead, the two most conservative Justices, Scalia and Thomas, were joined by three of the most liberal, Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg. Justice O'Connor, who is seldom on the losing side of a case, said of the case that, \"It looks like a No. 10 earthquake to me.\" And in a rare public show of frustration for a Justice, she said she was \"disgusted in how we dealt with it.\"A wide range of judges and legal experts consider the twenty-year-old Federal guidelines a noble failure. They are too inflexible, too draconian, and too unfair. The current Congress, however, has done nothing to fix them. A Supreme Court ruling applying Blakely case to the Federal system would force Congress to try again.

For many years, the New York Times has employed two restaurant critics, the only paper in town to do so. The main critic reviews the \"high-end,\" and another critic writes a column called \"$25 and Under.\" Just how the Times defines a $25 meal is unclear, but it seems to include only the entrees. For instance, in April Eric Asimov reviewed August, a Greenwich Village newcomer with entrees ranging from $16-24. Clearly, you're not getting out of there for under $25, unless you drink sodas, skip dessert, and order from the bottom end of the menu. Indeed, my own solo meal at August ran to about $75 all-in, which included three courses and two drinks. I did not order the most expensive things, by any means. The definition of a meal's cost on Zagat's website is far more sensible, and consistent with the way other guides define it: \"The cost column reflects the estimated price of a dinner with one drink and tip.\"Part of the Times's problem is that the \"$25 and Under\" label has been unchanged since the 1980s. At one time, you probably could have eaten at these places for under $25. Asimov admitted to the New York Observer recently that the label is no longer strictly true:Twelve years ago, The New York Times launched \"$25 and Under,\" a weekly column cataloging good (or at least decent) restaurants for cheap. A spokesperson for The Times declined to comment on whether the paper would consider changing the column to reflect today's elevated prices. On April 14, 2004, its writer, Eric Asimov, reviewed the meatpacking district's Barbuto: \"Best of all,\" Mr. Asimov wrote, \"the main courses are under $20 and almost all appetizers are under $10, providing a rare opportunity to try a celebrity chef's work without celebrity prices.\" Err, just what is our definition of \"celebrity prices\" these days?Recently, Mr. Asimov hit Shore in Tribeca, which boasts a $29 steak, and La Nacional on 14th Street, with a $15-per-person paella and \"tiny lamb chops,\" also for $15.\"It wouldn't be incorrect to say the literal meaning of '$25 and Under' doesn't always apply anymore,\" Mr. Asimov said. \"It just so happens that in Manhattan, the neighborhood restaurant has greatly increased in price. In the 1990's, when the economy was cruising along, all these neighborhood restaurants started serving foie gras.\"The fault lines were even more brutally exposed with this week's pair of NYC reviews. The main critic, Frank Bruni, reviewed Ici (246 Dekalb Avenue, Brooklyn), where entrees are $12-17. In inflation-adjusted terms, it might be the most inexpensive restaurant ever to earn one star. It was also a rare venture outside Manhattan by the main critic. In the \"$25 and Under\" column, Matt and Ted Lee reviewed Maia (98 Avenue B), where entrees are $12-21. Thus, the so-called \"$25 and Under\" restaurant, which was ineligible for a star under the Times system, was actually more expensive than the restaurant the main critic covered this week. Whether the brothers Lee would have awarded Maia a star had they been allowed to is somewhat beside the point. There is no doubt in my mind that August warranted a star [it subsequently received two].It must be pointed out that the \"$25 and Under\" critic sometimes reviews obscure, hole-in-the-wall places that are no more than an over-achieving sandwich shops or taco stands. To award these places a star would stretch the Times rating system beyond what it will bear. There's a certain minimum expectation of service and pampering that one expects even at the low end of the star scale. A sandwich joint, no matter how good, just doesn't deserve one star. But increasingly, the $25 and Under\" column overlaps the main reviewer's territory. Yet, these restaurants can't have a star - and the cachet that goes with it.This isn't the only oddity in the Times's reviewing system. The main critic actually writes two reviews a week: the main review on Wednesdays, and a shorter column called \"Diner's Journal\" on Fridays. Restaurants covered in the Diner's Journal are never eligible for stars, but sometimes the critic comes back and grants those restaurants a full review soon afterwards. A recent example was V Steakhouse in the Time Warner mall, which was the subject of a Diner's Journal column on June 18th, and then a full one-star review on July 14th. The full review made essentially the same points as the Diner's Journal column less than a month earlier. Had the restaurant been inclined to take any of Bruni's points to heart (and I don't know that they were), a month was clearly not enough time for them to do so.The upshot is that the Times has three columns a week that walk, talk, and squalk like reviews, but only one of which awards the coveted stars. On eGullet, one writer thought that the two reviewing positions fall between two stools:As it is right now, we have a \"highbrow plus a little middlebrow\" reviewer and a \"lowbrow plus a little middlebrow\" reviewer. In both cases, the reviewers are delving into somewhat inappropriate territory when they reach into the middle. Also, every time a middlebrow neighborhood place is reviewed by the high end guy, we're missing out on a potential review or re-review of a haute place. Likwise, we're missing out on a potential review or re-review of a cheap eats place every time the <$25 guys review a middlebrow neighborhood restaurant. There is also somewhat of an inequity as to which middlebrow restaurants are reviewed by which reviewer. There is no denying the fact that a review by the high end guy, even if some faults are mentioned, is more prestigious and beneficial to the restaurant than a glowing review by the <$25 guy. The inevitable result is that quality middlebrow neighborhood places are underrepresented with reviews. What we're left with is a situation where certain middlebrow places are raised above their peers with a big review (e.g., Ici), others are given a <$25 review that doesn't devote the kind and depth of scrutiny they deserve (e.g., Franny's), and most of them are simply never reviewed (e.g., @SQC). I'd like to see a system whereby all thee of these places would have an informed, well-written review that was made by a reviewer who was familiar with middle-level dining, and that could be viewed against the history of other such reviews. This is a particular shame considering that middlebrow dining is one of the largest segments of NY dining. Having said all that, I don't see the slightest bit of evidence that the Times has any interest in fundamentally rethinking its system. But if they do, there's certainly plenty to think about.

Last week, domestic diva Martha Stewart was sentenced to five months in prison, plus five months' home confinement, plus a fine of $30,000, for lying to Federal authorities about her sale of ImClone stock. Stewart has vowed to appeal her conviction, but I haven't found a single independent legal commentator who thinks she has a credible shot at winning. Judge Cederbaum has allowed her to remain at large until the appeal is concluded, for while her chances may be slim, the appeal would be essentially meaningless if she were forced to serve her full sentence before it is heard.Stewart is not a very sympathetic figure. After her sentence was handed down, she gave an interview in which she compared herself to Nelson Mandela. Given that Mandela was imprisoned for twenty-seven years on trumped-up political charges, it is hard to see how anybody could find such a comparison even remotely appropriate. Stewart also continues to insist that her case was \"a small personal matter.\" I have a feeling that Judge Cederbaum might have been a tad less generous had these comments been made before the sentencing.At the same time, while I am repulsed by Stewart's arrogance and lack of contrition, I think Cederbaum's sentence - the minimum allowed by law - was appropriate. Stewart was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C Section 1001, which provides:(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, whoever, in any matter within the jurisdiction of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government of the United States, knowingly and willfully - (1) falsifies, conceals, or covers up by any trick, scheme, or device a material fact; (2) makes any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or representation; or (3) makes or uses any false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry; shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.This section of the United States Code was originally designed to punish liars who obstruct Federal investigations. But increasingly, the government uses Section 1001 to manufacture crimes when they know the defendant did something wrong, but they don't exactly have a case they can put to a jury.If you're a prosecutor or FBI agent, the formula is simple enough. Just get the suspect to lie about a question to which the government already knows the answer. The suspect can then be prosecuted for that lie, even though the underlying offense can't be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.If the government asks the right questions, prosecutors can manufacture as many counts of lying as they want. The suspect doesn't need to be under oath, and the interviewer doesn't even need to keep accurate notes of precisely what was said. And remember, each lie carries a sentence up to five years in prison. Without much trouble, the government can easily rack up an indictment that threatens decades in prison, without even charging the underlying crime that they were originally investigating.This is precisely what happened in Stewart's case. The government eventually concluded that it could not prove the underlying offense - insider trading - beyond a reasonble doubt. But they did catch her lying, and those lies could be prosecuted as independent offenses. (The government also alleged other \"collateral crimes,\" of which Stewart was not convicted.)Now, I don't have any sympathy for Stewart's lies. The government did not entrap her. While the law does not require the government to tell the people they interview that lying is a crime, Stewart was certainly sophisticated enough to know this without being told. There is also ample evidence that she did lie. But in the grand scheme, her lies were victimless, as the government already knew the answers to the questions it was asking.In context, therefore, I think that Stewart truly deserved to be sentenced at the lower end of the Federal guideline range, which is precisely what Judge Cederbaum did. Even five months in the Federal pen will be a harrowing experience for Stewart, who has also seen her personal wealth and reputation dramatically reduced as a result of this affair. Her well-publicized fall from grace offers a sufficient deterrent to others who may find themselves faced with a Federal investigation. You can always take the Fifth, but if you submit to questions, your answers had better be true.

Do Running Mates Matter?

Every four years, the news media follows the VP selection frenzy with rapt attention. The choice is described as the nominee's first truly \"Presidential\" decision. The pundits debate where and how the VP choice will help the ticket - or if will help at all.After all that debate, the conventional wisdom is that running mates typically don't matter very much. However, nobody knows for sure, because there isn't an alternative universe where the same election is run with different VP candidates, to see if it turns out differently.In my lifetime, most of the Presidential elections have been electoral college landslides. When that happens, it's hard to argue that any conceivable VP candidate could have affected the outcome. In 1988, Michael Dukakis made a sound choice in southerner Lloyd Bentsen, but he still lost 40 out of 50 states. Just about everyone agrees that Dan Quayle was a slight drag on George H. W. Bush that year, but Dukakis ran one of the most inept campaigns in living memory. When that happens, you could have Thomas Jefferson as your running mate, and you are still going to lose.I suppose common sense dictates that comparatively few voters make up their minds because of who's running for Vice President. But in a very close election, \"comparatively few\" votes might be the difference between victory and defeat. In 2000, Al Gore barely lost in a handful states. Since all he needed was just one more state, it is emminently possible that the right running mate would have pushed him over the top - not because running mates make a huge difference, but because a slight difference was all Al Gore needed.I'd say Joseph Lieberman turned out to be a poor, and perhaps fatal choice, for Al Gore. Lieberman's two clear constituencies, Connecticut voters and Jewish voters, figured to vote for Gore in large numbers anyway. Gore chose Lieberman, in part, because Lieberman had been so publicly critical of Bill Clinton's moral shortcomings. If that trait mattered, surely there are others who could have supplied it. Choosing a running mate from a swing state would have been better advice, and had Gore heeded it, he'd most likely be President today.Most polls show the current Presidential race a statistical tie. If the race remains that close, every little factor, however slight, could figure in the eventual outcome. My bet is that John Edwards is a net positive for Kerry, and no other available choice would have been a better one. It will be a while before we know whether the race is close enough for it to matter.

It wasn't quite \"Dewey Defeats Truman,\" but the New York Post has egg on its face this morning. The paper's cover story announced that John Kerry was about to select Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt as his running mate. A few hours later, Kerry did indeed announce a running mate, but it wasn't Gephardt. Instead, it was the populist Senator from North Carolina, John Edwards. The Post had quoted \"unnamed sources,\" but it is hard to imagine that the right-leaning New York tabloid is any Democratic insider's first call. More likely, the Dems were having a little joke at the Post's expense.According to news reports over the last week, three candidates were at the top of Kerry's list: Edwards, Gephardt, and Iowa Gov. Tom Vilsack. It's hard for me to see how Vilsack ever made it that far. I'm sure he's a competent governor, but he's virtually unknown outside of his home state. Collective yawns would have greeted his appointment, and more yawning is the last thing the Kerry campaign needed.The choice between Gephardt and Edwards was a lot tougher. Gephardt is a seasoned national campaigner, and there's little doubt he would be a capable President if something happened to Kerry. After more than twenty years in the spotlight, it's unlikely Gephardt would commit a major blunder, and it's equally unlikely that any surprises are lurking in his background. If ever the words \"squeaky clean\" applied to anyone, it's Gephardt. He also polls strongly with the union voters who could help Kerry capture the midwestern industrial states that the Democrats must win to beat Bush. Lastly, Gephardt hails from Missouri, which practically defines the phrase \"bellweather state.\" No one since Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 has won the Presidency without winning Missouri.But Gephardt is often singularly unexciting - just as Kerry is. He has trouble turning on an audience, unless it is an audience of people who are already rabid supporters. Those aren't the supporters Kerry needs; they're voting for him already. Gephardt has polled poorly both times he ran for President, and there's a good reason for it. The political influence of union households has been waning for the last twenty years, and most non-union Americans perceive Gephardt as being far too liberal. Among many conservative-leaning and undecided voters, the prospect of a Vice President Gephardt wouldn't be a happy thought.Edwards, on the other hand, brings to the campaign the excitement, charisma, and energy that Kerry so often lacks. Recent test polls suggested that, among the plausible VP choices, only Edwards would boost Kerry's standing with undecided voters. Edwards has already polled well in the midwestern state of Iowa, where his unexpected 2nd-place showing in the January caucuses first propelled him to national attention. His populist image should help Kerry in key midwestern states where the economy has not recovered as rapidly as it has done elsewhere. Edwards also waged a remarkably civil campaign during the primary season. He seldom criticized Kerry directly, and his views are similar to Kerry's on most issues.By choosing Edwards, a southerner, Kerry has signaled that the Democrats don't intend to write off the South. But can Edwards actually pull any southern states into the Democratic column? Recent polls have suggested that a handful of southern states could be in play, but no poll has actually shown Kerry leading in any of them. VP nominees are seldom relevant to the race anywhere but in their home state, and and it is far from certain that Kerry can win either of the Carolinas, even with Edwards on the ticket. Few men have won the Presidency without winning the VP's home state (Nixon in 1968 was the last to do it), and few VP nominees have had significant influence on the race elsewhere (Johnson in 1960 may have been the only one who did).Republicans are sure to point out Edwards's comparatively shallow resume. After a long and lucrative career as a trial lawyer, Edwards was elected to the Senate and has served a single term. That is the extent of his political career. Lack of experience has never prevented anyone from getting elected Vice President -- just ask Spiro Agnew or Dan Quayle -- but in an era when war and global terrorism dominate the agenda, Edwards's lack of international experience looks like a gaping hole in his credentials. He will need to study hard, to avoid getting smoked when he debates Dick Cheney.The Presidential race has been a statistical tie for months now, with Bush and Kerry polling around 45% apiece. Just 10% of the voters prefer another candidate (typically Nader) or are undecided. This is a lower undecided percentage than is typical for this stage of the race. It suggests what many pundits have recognized - that the race is polarized, with far more Americans than usual having already made up their minds. This month, culminating in the Democratic National Convention in Boston, is Kerry's last good chance to put some distance between himself and Bush. The President can reasonably be expected to dominate the month of August, leading up to the Republican national Convention around Labor Day. If Kerry hopes to win, he needs to have and hold a lead by then. Historically, the candidate with a Labor Day lead nearly always goes on to win in November.Although there was no absolutely safe choice, Edwards represented Kerry's best chance to put some juice into a race that has been stagnant since Kerry wrapped up the nomination in March. As another batch of polls comes out late in the week, we'll find out if he has succeeded. My bet is that he has.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of this restaurant, which has been renamed David Burke Townhouse. The restaurant davidburke & donatella is the creation of chef David Burke and colleague Donatella Arpaia, who minds the front-of-house. Burke made his name cooking in other people's restaurants (Park Avenue Cafe) before opening this restaurant with his friend Donatella late last year. A friend and I visited on Saturday night. It is the best two-star restaurant I've been to, and I wouldn't be surprised to see it gunning for three if a re-review comes along. It's a beautiful space, decorated with the kind of wit that you find in Burke's inventive menu. There are two dining rooms, and we were seated in the larger of the two. It seems the owners were determined to use every inch of available space, as there was barely room to navigate between the closely-spaced tables. It was hard to hear over the din. When we sat down, a folded paper menu was on our plates. This was the day's tasting menu - five courses, $75. It was a typeset menu, on top of which Burke had scribbled additional daily specials and witty artwork. I was tempted, but my friend was not, so we moved onto the main menu, which our server came by and handed out. Bread arrives - cooked in its own copper casserole, and steaming hot. The butter comes as a modern art sculpture that you almost regret cutting into. There wasn't quite enough time to appreciate this before the amuse-bouche, a small confection of salmon ribbons. To start, I ordered the foie gras and lobster appetizer. It came in two hollowed-out egg shells, each with its own tiny little spoon. My friend had the gazpacho, which came with a shrimp profiterole and a mound of guacamole. I had read about the origins of Burke's \"Bronx\" veal chop on eGullet (it's a cut Burke invented), and I had to give that a try. The difficulty with this dish is that the chop itself is an awkward shape, and it's a struggle to find an anchor point for your fork. It was a tasty piece of veal, but I don't like to fight fight for my food. My friend had the pork chop, which I tasted. It had a wonderful char and was perfectly tender. The wine list is a confusing jumble. Within the standard categories (red/white), the wines are grouped by degrees - that is, each of the main headings is a number with the little \"degree\" symbol. Was this the degrees latitude where the grape was grown? The temperature at which the wine is stored? We could not tell. It is also a pricey list, and we struggled to find a good choice in our range. Finally we asked the sommelier for a suitable choice under $60 a bottle, and he produced an off-the-menu shiraz at $55 that we were pleased with. db&d is known for its desserts. The table next to us were friends of pastry chef James Distefano, and they got a free sample of everything on the menu. You would have to carry me home if I ate that much dessert, but it certainly gave us an idea of the range of creativity on offer here. I had the Coconut Layer Cake, my friend the Dark Chocolate & Praline Torte, which were both winners. David Burke himself seemed to have a few friends in the house last night, as he came out of the kitchen several times to greet diners. I expected a light turnout, given that it is a holiday weekend, but the restaurant was packed. However, we got an 8:00pm reservation that I called for only on Wednesday, which perhaps wouldn't be available on an ordinary weekend. There is much to appreciate at db&d, and on one visit I thought we had barely scratched the surface. I will have to return. davidburke & donatella (133 E. 61st Street between Park & Lexington Avenues, Upper East Side)

Fiddler on the Roof

***CONTENT
Last night, a friend and I looked in on the revival of Fiddler on the Roof at the Minskoff Theatre. In my view, Fiddler is one of the great Broadway masterpieces of the twentieth century. It has seldom been equaled, and it has never been surpassed. The current production is in many ways problematic, but the material is indestructible, and despite whatever quibbles I may have, it still moves an audience as few shows can. Like all great art, Fiddler succeeds on many levels. It is, of course, a compelling story, full of vivid characters and emotional situations that strike us as intimately personal and genuine. But it is also about the end of a civilization. Within a generation, Russian Jewish villages like Anatevka were obliterated. Fiddler ends with its characters' hopes of making it to America, but we know that not all of them did. Those not fortunate enough to make it out of Europe most likely fell victim to Stalin's pogroms or Hitler's gas chambers. Fiddler's characters don't know what the future holds for them, but we do, and it is not a pretty thought. Fiddler is also about the conflict between tradition and modernity. At the center of it is Tevye, as orthodox a Jew as any, but also curiously open-minded. Fiddler opens with a solo violin: It's no accident that this is the daughters' theme from \"Tradition\" (\"And who does mamma teach...\"). It's their rebellion against tradition that animates the story. The theme is repeated, with the pappas' theme against it in counterpoint: How many people have listened to this opening without realizing that it's a musical evocation of the conflict between daughters and fathers? Fiddler ends quietly, with a repeat of the daughters' theme, but the meaning is ambiguous. Are we meant to feel optimism for the future, or to be in tears for what has been lost? Perhaps it's a bit of both. In the current production, the fiddler hands his violin to a small boy, who bows and leaves Anatevka, while the fiddler stays put. The message, at the very least, is that the tradition is now in the hands of a new generation. But the audience knows of the coming cataclysm that the little boy does not. He seems to leave the stage happy, or at least hopeful. Can we share his dreams? I am unable to. Alfred Molina got mixed reviews for his Tevye, but he's had four months to grow into the role. As now presented, it is a warm, sensitive, naturalistic portrayal -- unlike Zero Mostel, whom I never saw, but whom I'm told was a larger-than-life storybook character. I thought Molina was a bit too ingratiating in \"Tradition.\" There was a \"please love us\" attitude that, had it persisted, would quickly have become cloying. But after that number, Molina settled in for a more nuanced performance that quickly won me over. Most of the men get high marks, although John Cariani's stammering impersonation of the tailor Motel was a one-joke performance that outwore its welcome. None of the women's roles really worked. Tevye's five daughters seemed interchangeable, and I had trouble telling them apart. Randy Graff's Golde lacked warmth, and Nancy Opel's Yente seemed more Shaker Heights than Shtetl. The production credits David Leveaux as director, with choreography still credited to the original director, Jerome Robbins. Exactly how much Robbins is left I can't say. The big production numbers (\"To Life,\" \"Sabbath Prayer,\" Tevye's Dream, \"Sunrise, Sunset,\" the bottle dance) all worked well. \"Far From the Home I Love\" had a simplicity that made a direct emotional connection, but elsewhere the production had a clinical chill that failed to find the soul of the story. Three of Tevye's daughters fall in love, and not one of their relationships was believable. The problem was at its most obvious during \"Do You Love Me?\" Tevye and Golde stood fifteen feet apart for the entire number, never making physical contact -- or indeed, even eye contact. When the answer to the question posed by the song is \"Yes,\" it would seem obvious that this staging was monumentally misguided. These misgivings aside, Fiddler is still a can't-miss proposition. I had my doubts about this revival, given all I had read, but I was glad I saw it, especially for Alfred Molina's Tevye, which is worth the price of admission.

The Tunnel to Nowhere

Of all the rebuilding projects proposed for Lower Manhattan, perhaps none has generated so little enthusiasm as the West Street tunnel. The New York State Department of Transportation -- backed by Governor Pataki, but hardly anyone else -- proposes to build a four-lane tunnel along West Street, between Vesey and Albany Streets, leaving four lanes at ground level.The origins of the project can be found in the early design concepts for the World Trade Center site, dating from the summer of 2002. Although widely derided as uninspired, one idea from these first designs caught the public's imagination: turning West Street into a tree-lined promenade resembling Paris's Champs-Elysee. For that to be possible, much of the traffic along the highway would need to be routed underground.As first conceived, the promenade would have run from Chambers Street all the way down to the Battery. But as the staggering costs of such a long tunnel became apparent, it was shortened into what is now the present proposal: a tunnel that runs for just a bit more than the length of the World Trade Center site. The purported aim is to reduce the amount of at-grade traffic adjacent to the memorial, but there would still be four lanes at ground level to allow access to local streets. The project would cost $860 million, and would tie up the West Side Highway for years, blocking both pedestrian and vehicular access to Battery Park City.A group called Taxpayers for Common Sense has cited the West Street tunnel as one of the 27 most wasteful highway projects in America. That's because the alternative - widening West Street to eight lanes at-grade - could be done for just $175 million. The savings of almost $700 million could be appropriated for the downtown JFK rail link, a far worthier project that is as yet unfunded, and has considerably more community support.Neither of the tunnel's alleged benefits makes much sense. The first is to provide an \"appropriate and respectful\" setting for the memorial, but as there would still be four lanes at ground level, I hardly see how this would be achieved. The other is to provide better pedestrian access to the memorial, but this could be done with bridges passing over the roadway, as was the case before 9/11. In addition, a pedestrian tunnel below West Street is already part of the WTC site plan. All in all, pedestrians will have plenty of safe routes to cross West Street without the need for any tunnel.The tunnel has plenty of commuity opposition. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, Sen. Charles Schumer, New York City Council Member Alan J. Gerson, New York State Assemblymembers Sheldon Silver and Deborah Glick, New York State Senator Martin Connor, Manhattan Borough President C. Virginia Fields, Community Board #1, the American Automobile Association of New York, the Civic Alliance to Rebuild Downtown, the Regional Plan Association, the Coalition to Save West Street, NYPIRG-Straphangers, and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign (TSTC), are among those opposing or seriously questioning it.According to the TSTC, at a recent public hearing there were 31 speakers, and all but one opposed the project. (The speaker in favor represented a coalition of construction workers.)Our elected officials have generally made good decisions about the rebuilding process, but this project is a turkey.

The original long tunnel concept made sense and was favorably reported in mid 2002, before the emergence of a fraternal bunch of organizations' centralized decision against it, (without any sort of public debate), plausibly to siphon its funds, though hardly for avoiding surface construction disruption that we have today without the benefit of a tunnel.Alas, Pataki panicked and replaced it with short tunnels with various ramp problems (e.g. being so close to the existing BBT and BPT) rather then being directly connected, and without consideration of the effects of improving the Gowanus Expressway at the other end of the BBT- ahh, planning in a vacuum driven by those in Manhattan who like having their collective heads in the sands regarding anything to improve vehicular flow, such as the truckers that deliver the city's food, with \"environmentalism\" based upon the movie The Day After where no food comes into the city for months, yet starvation appears to be no problem.So much for NYC planning vision.

Number One in Edinburgh

Edinburgh has two Michelin star restaurants: Number One and Martin Wishart. I tried the tasting menu at Wishart's a couple of months ago, and last week I decided to see what Number One could do. While both restaurants have their strengths, I would have to give the slight edge to Number One.Located in the basement of the Edinburgh's marquis hotel, the Balmoral, Number One exudes a sense of luxury. There is an ample and comfortably appointed lounge area to enjoy a drink before sitting down for your meal. The walls have a dark, highly polished sheen. They're covered with small modern artworks that don't distract you, but in fact are witty and eclectic if you take the time to study them. The tables and banquettes are plush and generously spaced.The service at Number One is impeccable. As I watched them operate over two and a half hours, I couldn't help but be impressed by the teamwork and precision. A team of five servers covered the whole restaurant (it is not that large, and not all the tables were taken), and while they had their individual duties, they operated as a coordinated unit. Now the sommelier serves you a glass of wine, and the next moment he's serving appetizers at the next table. Now the lovely French woman is serving your souffle, and the next moment she's refilling wine glasses at the opposite corner of the restaurant.I ordered the chef's tasting menu with paired wines, which clocks in at £85 before tip. There were five courses plus two amuses and six glasses of wine in this degustation. Although most of the portions were small, as you'd expect on a tasting menu, I walked out quite full, and in fact skipped breakfast the next morning. All of the dishes were plated beautifully, in designs clearly intended to delight the eye as well as the stomach.I had never ordered a full wine pairing before. It adds a significant premium to the meal, but I have to say it's worth it. You get a selection of diverse wines that is expertly chosen to suit the menu, quite a few of which you probably would never order on your own. They are smaller pours than wine ordered by the glass, but with six of them included it's about as much as most people care to drink. I did have trouble pacing myself, though: you were never sure how much time you had before the next course was to arrive.Your meal begins with freshly-cut bread. A server wheels over a cart, with six large breads baked that day. You choose one (mine was walnut grain), and he cuts off a slice. Soft butter is already there on your table. A few minutes later he's back to offer more. The bacon bread tempted me, but I held off, knowing there was much to come.The amuse-bouche was a tiny cup of tomato consomme, which I found a bit disappointing. The more successful amuses-bouches display some culinary wit, which this uninspired dish lacked. The champagne paired with it was similarly unexciting.A wonderful foie gras came next, served with oatcakes and mushroom chutney. It was paired with an intense New Zealand fruit wine that complemented the liver taste perfectly. The fish course was a scallop in a light curry sauce, accompanied by braised oxtail. This was the hit of the evening, and unfortunately that lonely scallop was gone all too quickly. This is the drawback of a tasting menu.The meat course was less successful. Six slender lamb medallions were sufficiently tender and tasty, but I've had far better lamb elsewhere. Sauces are Number One's strength, but this lamb was served in its own juices. Nothing was done to raise it above the ordinary. The grilled sweetbreads that came on the plate were far more memorable. Some writers have suggested that meat courses are not as well suited to a tasting menu, because they require larger portions to make a culinary statement. I can certainly see the point, although I'll have to try the format a few more times before deciding whether that's true.The cheese course was generous to a fault. The server wheeled over a cart with a wide range of selections. I told him I preferred the exotic and offbeat, and he cut six thick slices. It's easy to order a $15 cheese course in New York and get three skimpy pieces, so this was refreshing indeed. He asked if I wanted any more, so there didn't seem to be a hard limit. Anyhow, at six pieces this was a more substantial course than the entrees had been, so I thought it best to stop there (with dessert still to come). I can't describe cheeses, but the six I sampled were wonderful. They were paired with a sweet port wine.There was a small pre-dessert of apricots and cream, followed by the main dessert, a raspberry and white chocolate souffle. This is a specialty dish at Number One, which I've had on previous visits. It came with a white dessert wine, which the sommelier described as a palate-cleanser. I'm still trying to guess what that means.At US$200 (including tip), my splurge at Number One was well worth it. This could turn into an expensive hobby.

Jean-Georges Vongerichten's '66'

***CONTENT
Note: 66 closed in 2007, supposedly to be replaced by a Japanese \"sushi-and-soba\" place that (as of November 2007) has yet to appear.A vendor took me out to dinner at 66 on Monday night. That meant I wasn't paying. We had a fun night out, but I wouldn't rush back to spend my own money there -- not because there's anything wrong with 66, but because there's plenty of other fun places I haven't tried yet. My feeling now about 66 is, \"been there, done that.\"66 is Jean-Georges Vongerichten's riff on Chinese cooking. Neither the menu nor the wine list is long, but this is not a complaint. Vongerichten has narrowed the stereotype Chinese menu down to the things his kitchen can execute well. Aside from a dessicated plate of overcooked spareribs, every dish was fresh, tasty, and inviting.The menu is divided into appetizers, dim sum, rice/noodles, and entrees of vegetables, fish and meat. The apps top out at about $14, although most are under $10. The entrees top out around $26, although most are around $20-22. As at Spice Market, plates are brought out when ready. Our server assured us that all of the dishes are designed for sharing (which wasn't always true), and encouraged us to do so-which we did.There's a tasting menu for $66 (get it?), which our server advised was \"personally selected by Jean-Georges\" (no surname required). Three of us were willing to go that route, but one of our party was skittish about trusting the famous chef's judgment, so we created a more conservative tasting menu of our own. Our server advised ordering one app, one dim sum, and one entree/vegetable course per person, which turned out to be an ample amount of food, and indeed perhaps a tad too much.I can't find a menu for 66 online, and I can't remember everything we ordered, but I'll run through a few of the highlights. The two standout appetizers were cubes of pork belly and shrimp prepared two ways. We ordered four different kinds of dumplings, of which I remember three: foie gras, mushroom, and lobster. All were excellent, and you're not going to find them on the typical Chinese menu.We ordered a fish entree, which I believe was a grilled sole. It was an undivided fillet, and it quickly crumbled into bitty pieces when we tried to divide it among the four of us. It was a wonderful dish, but hard to split among a large group. The traditional duck with scallions and pancakes was more successful in this regard. Here, Vongerichten was just replicating a Chinese standard (albeit with happy results), without putting his own stamp on it. A plate of mixed vegetables (including the inescapable snow peas) and a sweet & sour chicken dish completed the main courses.The cocktail menu included a concoction called Mother of Pearl, with rum and coconut milk, which was so wonderful I ordered a second. After dinner, I ordered a 14-year-old Oban (single malt scotch), which was very reasonably priced at around $15, and included about twice as much as you normally get in a restaurant portion. Our meal concluded with chocolate fortune cookies-once again, Jean-Georges is winking at us.The Richard Meier decor has been much written about. It is spare, sleek, and doesn't at all resemble your typical Chinese restaurant. The entrance on Church Street (between Leonard and Worth Streets) is so subtle you could easily miss it. My hosts had no trouble getting a 6:30 reservation, and when we left about two hours later 66 was not yet full.66 (66 Church Street between Leonard & Worth Streets, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: **

Bloomie Froze NYCO out of Ground Zero

According to today's Times, the Bloomberg Administration was pivotal in freezing the New York City Opera out of the cultural equation at Ground Zero.Long unhappy with its current home at the New York State Theater, the NYCO had lobbied hard to be part of the site plan at Ground Zero. The Opera was thought to have the inside track, long before the LMDC issued an invitation to cultural institutions that eventually drew some 115 responses.But if the NYCO moved out of Lincoln Center, the State Theater, which the city owns, would be without a tenant for the 22 weeks a year that the opera performs and rehearses there. That's a budget hole that Bloomie would rather not have to fill.To be sure, there were other objections to the Opera's downtown plans, including the fact that most of the rebuilding officials simply aren't opera fans, and therefore don't see much merit in an opera house. But the Mayor's influence seems to have been pivotal, especially as Governor Pataki didn't seem to have strong feelings one way or the other.The NYCO went so far as to hire noted architect Rafael Vinoly to design an Opera House that would fit the peculiar geometry that the Liebeskind site plan imposes. The main performance space would actually have been cantilevered over the sidewalk, with space in the building for a smaller stage, a restaurant, and even a movie theater. It was all for naught, and the NYCO now finds itself with nowhere to go. Staying where they are remains an option, but the Opera has been largely ignored in the Lincoln Center redevelopment plans, since everyone assumed they were moving.The Times included a conceptual drawing of the Opera House we could have had. I'm sure the NYCO still hopes to erect it ... somewhere.

The cover story in this week's New York magazine is all about Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff's expansive plans for the Far West Side of Manhattan, particularly a new stadium for the New York Jets.Of course, to Doctoroff it isn't a stadium, but a multi-purpose facility for conventions, concerts, restaurants, the Olympics ... and, oh yes, the Jets would play there too. I'm still skeptical about the idea, but I must admit the article makes as as good a case for the project as can be made, while also pointing out the drawbacks. Most of the arguments have been pretty one-sided, so it's refreshing to see a feature piece that's balanced.A 6,000-page environmental impact statement is expected in a few weeks' time. I'm sure it'll make light bedtime reading.

***CONTENT
Wonderful Town is the kind of feel-good musical that I thought was gone forever -- that is, until Thoroughly Modern Millie came along a couple of years ago. Both share a similar premise: midwestern yokels come to New York to find their fortunes. Town and Millie, written half-a-century apart, appeal to the post-9/11 Broadway audience that wants to be sent home smiling. Enjoying its first revival, Wonderful Town is bouncing along nicely at the Al Hirschfeld Theatre (the former Martin Beck, on W. 45th St, just west of 8th Avenue). Our matinee performance was full, but the weekly stats on playbill.com show that it's grossing only about half of capacity, so the show might not make it past the summer. That would be too bad. Wonderful Town offers some of the best fun I've had on Broadway in a long time. The slender plot concerns sisters Ruth and Eileen Sherwood, who've come to New York from Ohio. Eileen wants to break in as an actress, Ruth as a writer. Eileen captivates every man she meets, while Ruth laments that there are \"One Hundred Easy Ways to Lose a Man.\" They rent a studio apartment in Christopher Street, sharing the neighborhood with a motley crew of colorful supporting characters. The songs are by Leonard Bernstein, with lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green. For a show with such distinguished pedigree, it's surprising there's no certifiable hit among the bunch, but they're all a bucket-load of fun. Many of the shows of this era haven't worn well, but Wonderful Town still seems fresh. Give it a try, while you still can.

Daniel Liebeskind's site plan for the World Trade Center includes placeholders for two cultural buildings. On Thursday, we finally found out what will go inside. The LMDC's bake-off of 115 candidates concluded with four cultural institutions chosen:The Joyce International Center for Dance, which would build a 900-1000 seat theater for a rotating series of international dance companies. The Joyce has smaller spaces in SoHo and Chelsea, which it would keep. The Signature Theater, which would build three theaters of 99, 299, and 499 seats. Known for presenting seasons dedicated to a single playwright, the Signature would offer up to seven world premieres a year, and would also share the space with the TriBeCa Film Festival. The Drawing Center, which would offer exhibits of international artists and also provide community education programs. It would move from its current home in SoHo to the WTC site. The Freedom Center, the only one of the four that doesn't currently exist anywhere, which would offer programs that \"symbolize the indomitable spirit of the people of this land, the indomitable spirit of people from other lands, of the people of this city who may have been down but certainly not out.\"The New York City Opera, once considered the favorite to anchor the WTC's cultural center, finds itself on the outside looking in. LMDC chairman John Whitehead had strongly pushed the opera, which he believed would be better able to attract the high-profile donations needed to fund the cultural buildings and the memorial. But the NYCO needed a 2,200-seat theater, and many doubted whether such a big space could be filled during the many months of the year when the opera isn't in season. Rebuilding officials also questioned whether the opera was a logical fit for the kind of tourist traffic the site is likely to attract.Although I'm an opera fan, I have to admit that the Joyce-Signature proposal is a more compelling use for the limited space. The four proposed theaters, ranging from 99 to 1000 seats, will create a new cultural center rivaling Lincoln Center, and I have to agree that it will be a lot easier to keep these theaters bustling all year round. The NYCO's 2,200-seat opera house would have been dark more often than not.I know little about the Drawing Center, but it sounds promising. The proposed Freedom Center makes me yawn. The last thing we need is pompous assurances of the value of freedom, particularly as the memorial planned for the site is likely to make much the same point. Perhaps the Center's blue-ribbon sponsors can persuade me, but for now it sounds like an underwhelming concept.The NYCO still wants to get out of Lincoln Center. Whitehead and City Councilmember Alan Gerson have pledged to find another home downtown, but I'm hard pressed to imagine where it could be. Lots that could accommodate a big-box opera house aren't exactly plentiful, and the City Opera needs a magnate location -- something that's even more scarce.In the meantime, the four selected cultural institutions have a tough road ahead. The two cultural buildings will cost hundreds of millions to construct, of which only a token sum will be available from the LMDC. None of the four has any track record of fundraising on this scale. Several prominent community business leaders have already turned down the job of fundraiser-in-chief. A six-month \"feasibility study\" is to be launched next month. Now it gets interesting!

Thalassa: Greek Seafood in TriBeCa

Note: For a more recent visit to Thalassa, click here. Thalassa is a Greek seafood restaurant. The Hellenic influence is on display everywhere, but with fish imported daily from all over the Mediterranean, you can think of Thalassa as simply a very fine seafood restaurant.Thalassa means \"the sea\" in Greek. The letter theta is everywhere, from the china, to the banner outside, to even the doggie bags. The design radiates cool blues, making Thalassa a most soothing place. Billowing fabric covers the exposed brick walls. Perhaps it is meant to suggest sailing ships, but it also absorbs the sound, making Thalassa a place of calm, even when it is full.Our party of 3 shared a starter of calamari. We're all used to strings of calamari, breaded and immersed in the deep fryer. This dish was totally unexpected. The calamari was wrapped in the shape of a sausage around stuffing of feta cheese, parsley and pine nuts. We were simply amazed.Thalassa's menu offers a number of standard entrees, as well as a whole page of fish by the pound, which varies depending on what's available. The restaurant recommends one pound of fish per person, but you have to order a whole fish, and not every selection is available at every weight. You're dependent on your server to explain all this, and our server had a bit of trouble getting it across.In the end, my friend and I settled for a two-pound sea bass, which we shared. A pound of fish sounds like a lot, but remember this is the uncooked weight. After the head is removed and the fish de-boned, this turns out to be just the right portion size. It was a nice flakey fish with a rich taste. The fish-by-the-pound selections don't come with anything else, so we ordered a side of asparagus to go along with it.My mother chose one of the standard entrees, Snapper Spetsiota, which is described as \"oven-baked in a clay vessel with tomatoes, onions, fresh oregano and white wine.\" This turned out to be a very large portion, which she enjoyed immensely, but she had half of it wrapped up to take home for tonight's supper.Thalassa boasts a long and varied wine list. We settled on a modestly-priced but obscure cabernet, which was such a hit that we asked the staff to give us the label, so that we can buy ourselves some more. (Yes, I know: red wine with fish ... do forgive us!)We passed on dessert, but at the end of the meal we were each presented with a silver box with the familiar letter theta printed on it. Inside was a sugary pastry puff to send us on our way. All evening long, service was superlative. It's a big town, but at least from my own experience, Thalassa is the best restaurant in town that has never had a rated review from the New York Times. Two subsequent visits have confirmed my extremely favorable impression of this restaurant.Appetizers at Thalassa are $8-18, mains are $24-36. The market fish selections available last night were at $26-45 per pound, with most in the $26-32 range.Thalassa (179 Franklin Street between Greenwich & Hudson Streets, TriBeCa)Food: ***Service: ***Ambiance: ***Overall: ***

Note: For a later visit to Artisanal, click here.Artisanal is chef Terrance Brennan's ode to cheese. I understand he has his own factory in Manhattan, where many of the chesses are manufactured. The distinct odor of eau du fromage permeates the whole restaurant. One lucky table gets to sit in \"The Cave,\" where many of the cheeses are stored. We weren't that lucky, but cheese is everywhere. There's even a retail counter, where you can buy a hunk of your favorite cheese to take home.My mother, who's visiting from out of town, has traveled in France extensively, and even lived there for a year. She said Artisanal immediately transported her to a brasserie in Paris. The Adam Tihany-designed interior conjures up the original brilliantly. The tile floor and other exposed hard surfaces makes it a bit noisy, but we had no trouble hearing our own conversation.Your server greets you with a bewildering array of menus. There's the dinner menu, with wines on the reverse side; a separate premium wine menu; a cheese menu that lists themed servings, optionally paired with wines; and a cocktail menu. Later on, there's a dessert menu and a new cheese menu with the cheeses listed individually.The main dinner menu, however, is packed onto just one page. Starters run $7.50 to $21.50, mains $17.50 to $29.50. Fondue is either $24 (petite, serves 1-3) or $40 (grande, serves 4-6). A $30.04 prix fixe is available every night, though it's worth noting that if you add a flight of cheese, a party of two is still going to have trouble getting out for under $100.Things start well with a basket of fresh bread and a dish of butter so soft it spreads like whipping cream. I ordered an appetizer of Bleu Cheese and Walnut Crisp, served with asian pear, watercress, and warm bacon vinaigrette. It looked like a green salad, but the flavor of Brennan's astonishing bleu cheese put all others to shame. I'm no cheese expert, but I've never experienced anything of this quality.I then had a lamb porterhouse, a cut that neither of us had ever heard of. It was a bit smaller than the typical New York Strip steak, but for lamb it was an enormous piece of meat, very tender and cooked perfectly to the medium rare I had ordered. (The lady at the next table asked for medium, but she also got medium rare, and was dissatisfied; after she sent it back, it returned well done.) The lamb was served on a bed of stewed rice, tomatoes and olives that was a perfect compliment to the meal.You can't visit Artisanal without sampling the cheeses, so we ordered a plate of three. What do you call the guy who comes over and takes your cheese order? Is he the fromagier? Anyhow, he looked like he was about 16. We asked for two goat cheeses and an \"exotic\" bleu cheese. As at Picholine, you get back your own copy of the cheese menu, with your choices circled. One of those he gave us wasn't even on the printed menu, and it was probably the best of all.At the end of the meal, our waiter looked at my plate, and said, \"You did good!\" I'm glad to know he approved. We certainly did!Artisanal (2 Park Avenue at 32nd Street, Murray Hill)

The arrival of any new restaurant in the Seaport district is newsworthy, because there are so few of them, and what's there is in general so bland. Pier 17 itself is the haunt of tourists and weekend revelers, although Sequoia at the end of the pier is worth a visit for satisfactory seafood and some of the best views in Manhattan.Salud is about a block away from the Seaport's main drag. The space was formerly a sushi bar called Orange Peel. The place has been gutted, and it is now the most civilized dining space so close to the Seaport. Walk in, and the hubbub nearby is left behind. There is a cool dark glow to the polished wood tables and white walls. An live ensemble plays Spanish music, but although Salud's space is small, the noise doesn't overwhelm table conversation.The cuisine is described as \"South American,\" of which I have no other experience with which to compare. The menu offers both Tapas (about $8-12 each) and entree-sized mains (about $17-25 each). Fish/seafood dishes, the restaurant's specialty, outnumber meat/vegetable dishes. I wasn't that hungry, so I ordered two tapas. Rellenos stuffed with seafood were a big hit. The plate came with three hot cupcake-sized rellenos, each with baby shrimp, clams, and calimari inside (at least, that's what I took the ingredients to be). Crispy & spicy chicken was not as happy a choice, as the chicken had been a bit over-cooked. The dish had potential, though. It reminded me of General Tso's chicken, but it was a cut well above the freeze-dried versions found in so many Chinese restaurants; it just needed to come out of the deep fryer a bit sooner.My mother ordered hanger steak, which she reported as flavorful, but having too much gristle. This is the hazard of ordering steak in a restaurant that doesn't specialize in steak.I was especially taken with how witty the platings were. My mother's french fries, for instance, came stacked like Lincoln Logs. The crispy & spicy chicken came with diced green and red peppers arranged around the outside edge of the plate, framing the food. The rellenos had a white cream sauce, overlaid on the seafood in the shape of a letter Z.I don't mind hopping on the subway, but this is my neighborhood, and sometimes I want to stay close to home. In a part of town where there haven't been many options, any new arrival is something to cheer about. It'll take a few more visits to take the measure of Salud, but for now I'm happy it's on the scene.Salud (142 Beekman Street at Front Street, South Street Seaport)Food: *Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *

Note: Click here for a more recent review of F.illi Ponte.For years, I've seen the huge, faded sign along the West Side Highway pointing the way to F.illi Ponte. The sign alone made me skeptical: if you need to toot your horn that loudly, maybe the smart money is going elsewhere. So although I work in the area, I was never motivated to give the place a try. A lunch invitation the other day finally brought me to F.illi Ponte.The restaurant has been on this desolate edge of TriBeCa since 1967, a time when the area was still largely an abandoned warehouse and factory district. Recovery has come slowly to Debrosses Street. The immediately surrounding area still seems to be a land that Time forgot, although I don't think this feeling will last long. Just a couple of blocks away, loft conversions proceed apace. The dining room is on the second story, offering nice views of the Hudson river, and less inviting views of still-abandoned warehouses, parking lots, and dilapidated piers. The dining room was about half-full for lunch, with a clearly up-scale crowd.I went for the restaurant's supposed signature entree: \"Angry Lobster,\" which takes its name apparently from the crushed red peppers and other spices in the mix. It is not 'fra diavolo', but just pleasantly spicy. I have never seen such a huge lobster, which seemed to weigh about eight pounds. It came on a rectangular plate around two feet long. I probably enjoyed this more than any lobster I have ever had, thanks to the dizzying array of spice flavors.I was also reminded why I seldom order lobster: it is just too much hard work to tease the meat out of the creature's crevices. My colleagues admired my industry, but I don't like expending so much effort for my food. Even with the four utensils provided, it was difficult to get a grip on the recalcitrant claws, and I began to think that the name of the entree said more about the lobster's revenge for the terrible end it had met.The server announced a number of specials, including a vegetable soup, served hot or cold. Three of us ordered it cold, but the kitchen served us the hot version. The waiter rushed out a few moments later, profusely apologetic, but we decided to eat the soup as presented. We also weren't offered soda refils, which I'd chalk up to inefficiency rather than policy.F.illi Ponte carries two stars from the New York Times, and it's not the place for a cheap date, with entrees ranging from $28-46. I didn't ask what the lobster cost (it was shown on the menu as a market price item), but I'm sure it was above $40. Everyone at my table was pleased with his meal, and several had been there a number of times before, which suggests that F.illi Ponte is sending patrons home happy, even with an astronomical bill. I wouldn't mind a trip back, but at these prices I'll wait till another vendor invites me!F.illi Ponte (39 Debrosses Street at West Street, TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: *½Ambiance: ** Overall: *½

Note: Dominic has since closed. For later visits, see reports here and here.I dined at Dominic last night. It opened last summer under the name \"Dominic Restaurant & Social Club,\" but the mildly odd \"Social Club\" seems to have been dropped. Dominic replaced a Portugese restaurant called Pico, which I never visited, but I recognize the same high-backed chairs that I always used to see when I passed by. I believe it is still under the same owners. Chilled spring pea soup with spiced shrimp was a lively start. I hadn't read the menu too carefully, so I would have been happy with just a solid pea soup, which this was. The unexpected spiced shrimp offered a flavor explosion, making me regret there was just one of them in the bowl. Onto a main course of crispy Atlantic skate with endive marmelada and pink peppercorn vinaigrette, on a bed of stewed cherry tomatoes. Yes, the fish was delightfully crisp on the outside, with just a hint of the marmelade flavor suggested in the description. I couldn't perceive the pink peppercorn vinaigrette, but the palate here seems to lean towards the subtle. The fish came with warmed greens and a three of a large vegetable I couldn't recognize -- shaped like sausages, but tasting like onions. Appetizers are $9-12, pastas $8-12 for starter portions, $16-20 as mains. Other main courses (a mixture of meat and fish) are $19-26. Side dishes are $5. The prix fixe is $38 for any three dishes on the menu, or $52 with wine pairings. My meal of appetizer, main course, and a glass of the house wine was $46 with tax and tip.Dominic's decor is mostly unchanged from its Pico days. It's comfortable, spacious, and friendly to the eye. Service was smart and attentive. I will definitely be visiting Dominic again.Dominic (349 Greenwich Street, TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: *½

Ronald Reagan

***CONTENT
Ronald Reagan, 40th President of the United States, died on Saturday, just short of his 93rd birthday, after a decade-long battle with Alzheimer's disease. His death also fell a day shy of the fortieth anniversary of the D-Day invasion. On the twentieth anniversary of that event, Reagan gave one of the most memorable speeches of his Presidency. It was a riveting oration on the Normandy Beaches that I saw again on C-Span the other night. The speech remains great theater even today. Cynics will say that Reagan was no great statesman, merely a skilled deliverer of speeches written by others. Even if true, which I don't entirely accept, it is no small accomplishment to capture a moment as brilliantly as Reagan did that day. Anyone who doubts it should watch George W. Bush's pale and unsuccessful attempts to do the same. Ronald Reagan is the most prolific vote-getter in American history. There are fifty million more eligible voters than there were when he ran for President, but no one yet has captured the electorate's imagination as he did. Whether you agreed with all of his policies or not, there was no denying that Reagan was an intensely likeable man. He is one of the few Presidents to have left office more popular than when he entered it. Even his Administration's scandals and missteps, some of them serious, have not stuck to him personally. To be sure, Reagan was the beneficiary of exquisite timing. In his first election, he had the great gift to have Jimmy Carter as his opponent. Despite a blazing intellect, Carter was an incompetent chief executive. He projected an image of self-defeat and aspirations to be merely mediocre. The failed mission to rescue the hostages in Iran, although not his fault, embodied for many the downfall of his Presidency. Any reasonably attractive Republican nominee was going to beat Jimmy Carter. A President's re-election is generally a referendum on the economy. By November 1984, the economic cycle was in full rebound. It's doubtful that any Democrat could have beaten Reagan, but Reagan could hardly have had a more generous opponent than Walter Mondale, a retro liberal whose politics were about ten years out of date, and whose most memorable campaign pledge was to raise taxes. Mondale's one enduring contribution to Presidential politics was to name the first woman to a major national ticket, but Geraldine Ferraro did him no good in November.Even if some of Ronald Reagan's accomplishments were handed to him by the Democrats, we must be careful not to underestimate his legacy. Ronald Reagan defines the modern Republican Party, which now controls both houses of Congress, most of the Federal judiciary, and has won four of the last six Presidential elections. Just as most modern Democrats want to be Kennedy, most modern Republicans want be Reagan. Indeed, Reagan's legacy is by far the more powerful one. Kennedy was martyred, but he accomplished little; he is more important for the promise he showed than for what he delivered. Reagan's policies are still with us. The leaders of his party continue to preach what he preached. Their greatest modern political defeat, George H. W. Bush's loss in 1992, is attributed to his decision to endorse a tax hike, something the Party's orthodoxy insists Reagan would never have done. Most credit Reagan with the end of the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact, a process that began during his term and ended during that of his successor. To be sure, Soviet communism was running on fumes by the time Reagan came to power, and its eventual demise might have been inevitable, but Reagan's hawkish stance certainly helped topple it. His speech in Berlin - \"Tear this wall down, Mr. Gorbachev\" - is one of the searing memories of the Reagan Presidency. It is a telling counterpoint to the famous Kennedy speech - \"Ich bin ein Berliner\" - which sounded a chord of pan-Atlantic solidarity, but didn't exhort anyone to do anything. Reagan's greatest failure is a fiscally irresponsible tax-and-spend policy that, sadly, is still with us. His platform certainly sounded appealing: cut taxes, increase defense spending, shrink the rest of the government, and balance the budget. Unfortunately, only the first two happened, and the national debt tripled on his watch. The economic theory he endorsed - that reducing taxes would actually increase government tax revenues - has failed again and again. Yet, George W. Bush has sold the Congress and the American public the same bill of goods, with the same predictable results. A purported \"tax simplification\" bill passed during Reagan's second term actually managed to make the tax system more complicated. Whether you agree with Reagan's tax-and-spend policy or not, its influence cannot be denied. On domestic policy, today's Republican Party is essentially a one-note band, with tax cuts disproportionately aimed at the wealthy as the only substantive economic idea they have to offer. Republicans who favor fiscal responsibility and deregulation as engines of economic growth have been largely frozen out of the debate by party leaders who view themselves as Reagan's political disciples. I have mixed feelings about Reagan's accomplishments and to what extent he was personally responsible for them, but I voted for him twice. Whatever faults he may have had, he was better for the country at the time than either Jimmy Carter in 1980 or Walter Mondale in 1984. I also favored the first Bush over Michael Dukakis, but I haven't voted for a Republican Presidential candidate since. Reagan was what the country needed in 1980, but the party hasn't had a serious original idea in decades. George W. Bush, who has none of Reagan's charisma or charm, seems content to leave the government in the hands of clueless idealogues.I must admit, I haven't seen any great ideas out of John Kerry either, but as I noted at the top of this essay, a second-term election is a referendum on the incumbent, and it is hard to name anything that has gone particularly well under George W. Bush. Just as the 1980 election was more a rejection of Carter than an endorsement of Reagan, the 2004 election should be a rejection of Bush. Reagan took the opportunity that Fortune gave him, and turned it into one of the great Presidencies of the twentieth century. What Kerry will do is anyone's guess, but at the moment neither party has a Ronald Reagan.

I enjoy living in Lower Manhattan, but my friends have often heard me complain about the lack of good brunch restaurants east of Broadway. Not the lack of restaurants (as there's a good supply of them), but specifically the lack of restaurants with great brunch menus. I don't necessarily mean \"great\" as in Normas, Sarabeth's Kitchen, Bubby's or Balthazar, but simply a solid weekend brunch place with a variety of omlettes, pancakes, waffles, etc.Well, such places don't seem to exist east of Broadway, which restauranteurs perhaps still think is a Monday-to-Friday neighborhood. A place around the corner from me called Cafe 92 serves low-end diner food, but it's so limited and ordinary that one quickly tires of it. It's a bit embarrassing to take guests there, although on occasion I have done so. That leaves the west side, where - thanks to Battery Park City and TriBeCa South - options are a bit more numerous. However, it is a longer walk. This weekend, I found a romantic brunch setting that might just be worth it: Steamers Landing, located on the Battery Park City esplanade between Liberty and Albany Streets.I'd often walked by Steamers Landing while enjoying the view on the esplanade - one of Manhattan's least known scenic treasures - but for some reason it never occurred to me to walk by for brunch. Turns out they have a wonderful brunch menu. Steamers Landing will never eclipse the city's more famous high-end brunch eateries for its food alone, but they do a fine job, and on top of that is a spectacular view of the Hudson that beats just about any other restaurant in the city. Steamers Landing serves lunches and dinners too, but that'll be a topic for another day.Some Saturday or Sunday morning, when the weather is nice, head on out to Battery Park City and try out Steamers Landing for brunch. Be sure to sit in the outdoor garden. After that, take a nice long walk on the esplanade and walk off the calories you just inhaled. You'll be glad you did.Steamers Landing (375 South End Avenue between Liberty and Albany Streets, Battery Park City)

Miracle on John Street

***CONTENT
\"Miracle on John Street.\" It's not quite good enough to be a movie title, but I felt blessed last week when my rent renewal arrived, and there is no increase! When I moved in almost five years ago, my rent was exactly $2000, which for those not au fait with rent stabliization law in New York City, is the lowest rent level that is not regulated. That is, the landlord can charge whatever the traffic will bear. A year later, it went up by 5%. Ok, I could live with that. Another year later, they hit me with a stiffer 12.4% increase. This was right at my pain threshold, but as there was no assurance of getting a better deal anywhere else, I stayed put. Then 9/11 hit. In the immediate aftermath, the landlord volunteered a 10% rent cut. Residents were bailing out of Lower Manhattan in droves, and while tenants theoretically could be sued, there wasn't a jury on earth that would side with a landlord under such circumstances. Rather than be stuck with apartments they couldn't fill, landlords offered concessions and hoped the tenants would stick it out. Most did. In the meantime, Congress appropriated funds for a Lower Manhattan Residential Grant program. Tenants in my part of town - below Chambers Street, and east of Broadway - were eligible for a $250per month subsidy if they committed to the area for two years. (Had I lived west of Broadway, the subsidy would have been $500/month.) At my next renewal, the landlord raised the rent by 7.5%, which if you're keeping track is still about $76/month less than pre-9/11 levels. With the HUD subsidy, my effective rent was $2034/month for two years, starting August 1, 2002. As last weekend approached, I was bracing for the worst, knowing it was about the time of year when my rent renewal would be coming. Not only I about to lose my HUD subsidy, but the landlord would have the first chance in two years to raise my rent. If a May 30 New York Times article can be believed, vacancy rates downtown are just 5%, which (if true) would suggest that any post-9/11 reluctance to live in Lower Manhattan has largely evaporated. In short, I was convinced I was in for a very significant increase. Well, it didn't happen. My HUD subsidy will of course expire in August, but my base rent will be the same for the third year in a row. What happened? For me, the HUD subsidy was a happy dividend of living downtown, but I intended to stay no matter what. I suspect, however, that there were many who moved in only for the subsidy, and for whom the rents were just barely affordable. Those leases are now expiring, and the residents are most likely headed elsewhere. With their apartments now coming on the market in large numbers, I would guess the time wasn't ripe for jacking up downtown rents. I don't expect this to last forever. But with several big residential buildings coming on-line in my neighborhood over the next year, thanks to the Liberty Bonds program (another post-9/11 helping of pork from Congress), a healthy supply of new market-rate units should act as a drag on rents for the next year or two. Or so I hope!

Note: For a more recent review of Public, click here.Public is a double James Beard award winner for both restaurant design and restaurant graphics. The motif is that of a public library circa 1964. Who knew that card catalogs and leaded glass restroom doors would be modern chic? Even the menu comes on a clipboard that looks like it's been pulled from manilla card stock.Unfortunately, you can't eat decor. When it comes to food, Public's catalog entry is: almost, but not quite. My friend's Grilled Mayan Prawns with asparagus were very good, but she thought the chef was too parsimonious with the ingredients, especially the asparagus. My sister-in-law's Tasmanian Sea Trout was very good, but a tad too spicy. My brother's Roast New Zealand Venison Loin was \"very good, but not great,\" for reasons he didn't specify. My Roast Lamb Chump was stringy, and in fact not as good as the accompanying vegetables.So we had a happy evening, for which we had no regrets, but no one in our party of four felt that the food quite lived up to the design. Luckily Public is very reasonably priced for a high-concept place, with mains in the $18-25 range. However, they do clean up on the appetizers (we weren't that hungry, and didn't order any), which are expensive compared to the rest of the menu at $8-19. Desserts are $8.50-$11.50; we shared two between us and were satisfied without being overwhelmed.Public (210 Elizabeth St. between Spring St. & Prince St., NoLIta)Food: *Service: **Ambiance: **½Overall: *½

You're running out of time to see the Whitney Biennial at the Whitney Museum (945 Madison Avenue at 75th St). This bi-annual exhibition of modern art captures a wide range of media and styles. The works elicit reactions ranging from \"Wow!\" to \"Huh?\" Whatever you may think of particular works, the range is extraordinary. It's best experienced if you allow the art to assault your senses directly, and ignore the curators' attempts to explain what you're seeing. Otherwise, you're likely to be distracted by mumbo-jumbo such as the following (copied from the website): While the Biennial represents the work of individual visions, it is also more than that. Given that the curators themselves come from somewhat different generations, it is not surprising that the leitmotif of this Biennial is intergenerational dialogue, a conversation that is based on distinct commonalities and threads of influence extending in both directions--from older to younger artists, and vice versa. In addition, the curators have proposed certain affinities shared by subgroups among these artists, and although the exhibition does not have a thematic structure per se, it has an inner coherence. Upon discovering links between such diverse artists, the curators in effect cried \"Eureka!\" realizing that distillation is as much about discovery as it is about invention. That certainly clears it all up. Why not just enjoy the art instead! The exhibition officially closes today (May 30th), but signs at the Whitney indicated several of the galleries are being extended another couple of weeks.

A few years ago, Bond Street was the Japanese restaurant of the rich and famous. Every review mentioned the celebrities and fashion models one encountered there. It is still doing a healthy business, but you can land a reservation easily on OpenTable, and you score a 1,000-point bonus for requesting an off-peak time, which we did.BondSt has a suave decor of cool earthtones. My brother said it's the kind of restaurant that the chicks on Sex and the City frequent, but which he always assumed didn't really exist. From the unassuming frontage of a townhouse on the eponymous street in NoHo, you don't imagine that such an oasis lies waiting for you inside. An elevator took us to our table on the second floor, emphasizing the feeling of being transported to another world.I ordered the $60 tasting menu for me and my two guests. (Tasting menus are also available at $40, $80, and $100.) We were served eight courses, as follows:1. Steamed, salted edamame.2. Vegetable tower in a preparation so fancy it seemed a crime to bite into it.3. Small squares of tuna tartare, with a respberry sauce and szechuan peppercorns.4. BBQ quail wings with a beehive of fried soba noodles. The crispy quail wings were a highlight, although gone all too quickly, but the soba noodles were ruined by an overly salty soy sauce.5. Scallop and shrimp over a sweet potato puree. This was the hit of the evening.6. A sushi plate, six or seven pieces, with a mixture of salmon, whitefish, yellowtail, tuna roll, and others.7. Noodle soup with seafood tempura.8. Dessert - each of us received something different, which we shared, and all of which were wonderful. One was a bento box of mixed sorbets and ices; another was a heavenly preparation resembling strawberry shortcake with heavy cream, served in a sundae bowl; and third, a vanilla custard.We ordered from the lower end of the sake menu, a $45 bottle that was smooth and fruity to the taste - one of the best sakes I've experienced, which may just tell you that I am not a true connoisseur. Service was friendly, attentive, and unpretentious. I can't say that Bond Street equaled the amazing lunch I had at Nobu a few weeks ago, but it was a great meal nevertheless, which I'd be happy to recommend to anybody.Bond Street (6 Bond Street between Broadway and Lafayette Street, NoHo) Food: **½Service: ***Ambiance: **½Overall: **½

***CONTENT
The musical Movin' Out is all about Twyla Tharp's dances. It takes its title from the famous Billy Joel song, and in fact the whole score is by him. People of a certain age will know most of these songs by heart. It's to the cast's credit that you almost forget that it's not Joel singing, but another guy doing his damndest to sound like him. But since we've grown up hearing these songs sung by the man who sings them better than anybody, it's for the choreography that you should go to Movin' Out. And indeed, the dances are a real trip. So energetic, clever, and brilliantly conceived are they, that it scarcely matters that they're set to Billy Joel's songs. As my brother observed, you could have done these dances to anybody's songs. It really doesn't matter. Tharp developed a slender plot knitting her dances together, which the ensemble cast play out in mime. It involves three pairs of couples who meet in high school, break up when the boys go off to the Vietnam war, and reconnect afterwards. This doesn't matter either. Often the Joel songs go with the story; sometimes, they don't seem to. Movin' Out is all about the dances, which are riveting.

Note: After 28 years, Le Madeleine closed in March 2007, when they lost their lease.My brother and his wife are visiting from California. They bought tickets the other night for Movin' Out, and on short notice we needed a restaurant reservation. We're dropping some major dough on food this weekend, so I wanted to keep things on the inexpensive side. It's here that OpenTable.com came to the rescue. I chose Le Madeleine, a French bistro slightly to the left of the Theater District.Entrees are generally in the $15-20 range, with an entrecote steak priced at $25. Appetizers are from $6-11, and side dishes all at $4. However, as all of the entrees come with appropriate vegetables I really see no need for the side dishes unless you want to load up on such things as braised red cabbage, Israeli couscous, or creamed cannellini beans. You can read the menu at Le Madeleine's website, although the at present it's showing the winter menu; what we saw was a bit different.My sister-in-law chose the Spice Crusted Duck \"Aigre Doux,\" which is served with creamy polenta, braised red cabbage, and caper-currant-cranberry sauce - a clever preparation that was full of diverse flavors. My brother chose the braised Berkshire pork (I didn't know the Berkshires were known for that), which he described as wonderfully tender. I had the grilled marlin, an off-the-menu special, which tasted a lot like swordfish. It was served in a sweet lemon butter sauce.Le Madeleine is clearly oriented to the pre-theater crowd, and service is organized to get patrons out to their shows on time. Service was friendly, if occasionally frantic. There is a lovely garden room with a skylight, as well as a more conventional indoor room that resembles a hundred other bistros.This is a solid pre-theater restaurant off the beaten path of Restaurant Row. It offers inventive fare that, at its relatively low price point, is well worth a try.Le Madeleine (403 W. 43rd Street, west of Ninth Avenue, Theater District)Food: *Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: *Overall: *

Note: Amuse has since closed-I believe in 2007. The restaurant with more lives than a cat finally ran out of them. Some of the Amuse team has since landed at the North Fork Table & Inn.Amuse has had as many lives as a cat. It was once Harvey's Chelsea, and then it was The Tonic, and last year it became Amuse after Garry Heyden (formerly of Aureole) took over as chef. William Grimes of the New York Times reaffirmed its two-star status, while observing how improbable it was that a restaurant so often re-invented has managed to maintain its culinary standards.It's been about a year since Grimes's review appeared, and Amuse has evidently changed its concept again. On May 21, 2003, Grimes wrote:Amuse is short for amuse-bouche, the French term for the bite-size preappetizers intended to titillate the palate. They serve multiple functions. They help keep hunger at bay, but they also inspire the chef to create an eye-catching bit of whimsy that can serve as a preview of coming attractions. Mr. Hayden has elevated the status of the amuse-bouche and designed an entire menu around small tastes, doing away with the appetizer-entree dichotomy.His menu offers a half dozen choices in four price categories, $5, $10, $15, and $20. With each increase in price, the preparations become more complex and the ingredients more expensive. The portion size increases, too, so the more expensive dishes look like abbreviated entrees. Five dollars buys a silver julep cup filled with herbed French fries. Twenty dollars earns an upgrade to peppered duck breast with endive marmalade and a sweet, syrupy reduction of black mission figs. Other reviews I found on the web seemed to be based on the same menu Grimes saw, which you can still read on menupages.com. That menu is no more. Although many of the same dishes are still there, the menu is now organized in the more conventional appetizer-entee format. Amuse is no longer trying to be a tapas bar. It does retain some hints of the original idea - the appetizer section is labeled \"Tastes for Sampling and Sharing.\" One who didn't know what the former menu looked like would simply conclude that this is a longer name for \"appetizers,\" and that indeed is how my friend and I took it.Some of the dishes cry out to be shared. I ordered Crisp Cod and Yukon Gold Potato Cakes with Truffle Tartar Sauce to start. Out came four thick half-dollar sized fish cakes - a dish perfectly suited for sharing. Heyden's preparation gave a crispy and spicy excitement to a dish that could otherwise seem an upscale version of Mrs. Paul's fish sticks. My friend ordered Atlantic Salmon Two Ways (house smoked & tartare, with a chive potato cake). This dish was not quite as easy to divide, although I had a taste.Every review has mentioned with approval the Five Hour Braised Short Rib of Beef with Carmelized Sea Scallops, so I had decided well in advance that this would be my main course if it was still available - which it was. The short rib was so tender that one hardly needed a knife, and it tasted like home-cooked brisket. The scallops were a hearty size, with a crisp exterior that led to a tender, beefy center.My friend ordered the Grilled New York Strip Steak, which arrived pre-sliced. Some restaurants serve porterhouse this way, but I've never seen it done to a New York Strip. This, too, could be a vestige of the restaurant's earlier tapas-style menu. The steak had a crispy charred exterior and and a wonderful tender flavor. I'm usually skeptical of ordering a NY Strip anywhere that doesn't specialize in steak, but this dish is worth a try.In sum, Amuse offers an inventive and eclectic menu, beautifully presented, and fairly priced given the overall standard in the city for fine dining restaurants. There are 28 appetizers (priced from $4-18) and 8 mains (priced from $20-30). We sampled but two of each, so your mileage may vary, but everything coming out of the kitchen certainly looked good. There is also a chef's tasting menu (obligatory these days at any restaurant claiming to be serious about food): amuse bouche, four courses, and dessert for $55, or paired with wine $75. This looks to me to be a bargain.I reserved Amuse on opentable.com. The restaurant called me twice to confirm I was coming, which led me to think, \"Wow, they really must have heavy demand for tables.\" To the contrary, it was nearly empty when we arrived at 7:00pm, and only about half-full by the time we left at 8:30. The space is comfortable and the contemporary decor pleasant on the eye, with rooms called the apartment, the lounge, the salon, and the library. Both the bar and dining area are amply proportioned, and there appear to be private rooms upstairs, which we didn't investigate.Amuse (108-110 West 18th Street, between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, Chelsea)Food: **Service: **Ambiance: **Overall: **

The Trouble With Zagat

***CONTENT
The Zagat Guide is a wonderful restaurant directory. It allows you to search on a wide variety of criteria (neighborhood, cuisine, etc.), and it provides just about all of the basic information you need (address, phone number, hours, map, price range). The comments provided, although brief, are often witty and scathingly accurate.But the one area where Zagat falls down is the statistic most often quoted, and for which Zagat is best known: the numeric ratings of each restaurant. Zagat separately rates Food, Decor and Service on a 1-to-30 scale. If properly used, this scale would provide sufficient amplitude to distinguish the neighborhood taco stand from Alain Ducasse and Per Se. In practice, it does nothing of the kind. This is ironic, given that restaurants love to post their so-called \"Zagat rating,\" and some will say that they're \"Zagat rated.\" What is this so-called \"rating\"?For starters, Zagat is a raw popularity contest, with very little guidance given to the voters. Someone who thinks Olive Garden is a pretty good restaurant is going to rate all of Little Italy off-the-charts, while an experienced high-end diner will pooh-pooh anyplace that lacks a chef's tasting menu. The upshot is you have a hot dog stand like Gray's Papaya carrying a Zagat food rating of 20 out of 30, which (according to Zagat's own definitions) is supposed to mean \"very good to excellent,\" when the highest rating in New York is just 28.Zagat's own voting mechanism is largely at fault. Individual voters are allowed to vote on a 0-to-3 scale. Zagat says that \"1\" is supposed to mean \"good,\" but psychologically a \"1\" vote feels like \"below average.\" People will realize that \"3\" must be pretty damned good, so there's a tendency for almost everything to get rated \"2\". For the final rating, Zagat multiplies the average by 10 and rounds off, resulting in the familiar 1-to-30 scale.A look at the details shows that this is a serious problem. Of the 1,454 restaurants in Zagat's 2003 New York guide, 74% of them carry a food rating between 18 and 23. What's more, 97% of them carry a food rating of 16 or higher, and none carry a food rating worse than 9. The upshot is that what's claimed to be a 1-30 scale is, for all practical purposes, a 16-28 scale. You can safely say that any restaurant with a Zagat rating of 25 or higher is very good. But ratings below 25, which is almost all of them, are in an undifferentiated scrum, and aren't statistically significant.Oddly, voters are considerably more discriminating in their Decor ratings: just 62% of New York restaurants have a Decor rating 16 or higher, and just 36% are clustered in the 18-23 range. When it comes to Service, Zagat voters rate about 80% of restaurants 16 or higher, and 54% are in the 18-23 range. So the Zagat Service ratings are nearly, but not quite, as useless as the Food ratings, while the Decor ratings actually do seem to mean something.The pernicious tendency of the ratings to cluster around 20 is shown in the following graph: I am not sure why voters are least discriminating about the one thing that should matter most at a restuarant - the food - but perhaps it's because the qualities that make food great are awfully difficult to describe. Yet, everyone knows an ugly room when they see it.I think Zagat would be considerably more reliable if they collected votes on the same scale they report, from 0 to 30. Voters would then tend to rate an average restaurant \"15\", instead of \"2\". The higher Zagat ratings would be harder to get, and the scale overall would be a lot more meaningful.[Update: After I posted this, a colleague on eGullet observed that the Zagat food ratings are almost a proper bell curve, if you consider \"average\" to be 20 rather than 15. The problem is that the standard deviation is only about 2, which means that the scale simply fails to offer a meaningful spread between the best and the worst.]Of course, there's no chance of Tim and Nina actually changing anything, so the Zagat ratings will continue to be the least useful part of what is otherwise a very useful service.

I was invited to lunch yesterday at (The Mercer) Kitchen, one of the ubiquitous Jean-Georges Vongerichten's many properties. (Its proper name is written out with parentheses around \"The Mercer.\") The restaurant occupies part of the ground floor and basement of a hotel at the corner of Mercer & Prince Streets, in SoHo. It's an impressive space. The ground floor is a bar, with comfortable chairs and small cocktail tables generously spaced. In the back of this area are floor-to-ceiling bookshelves, suggesting a library.The restaurant proper is downstairs. Part of it is in the vault space below the sidewalk. Look up from your table, and you see (and sometimes hear) people walking over the grillework up above. There is glass in the interstices of the grille, but keep reading: evidently the seal isn't quite perfect. Near the back are several long communal tables - evidently a staple of Jean-Georges Vongerichten's restaurants. These tables look on an open kitchen - yet another JGV staple. The decor is dark and sleek.I ordered from the $20 prix fixe lunch menu. An appetizer of Wild Mushroom Bruschetta with Prosciutto failed to impress. I am the world's worst cook, so when my reaction to a dish is, \"I could easily do that,\" it's not a good sign. It seemed to be no more than mushrooms and ham on slightly soggy rye toast.Things improved as we moved to the main course: Roast Duck Breast with Bok Choy, Ramps and Rhubarb. The rhubarb, a pale pink sauce framing thin duck slices, was what made the dish.Dessert - Gianduja Parfait with Coconut Soup - was heavenly. One of my lunch companions speaks seven languages, and he explained that gianduja is a hazelnut chocolate. I wonder why the restaurant couldn't tell us that on the menu. Is \"gianduja\" a common word? I don't think so.In the middle of the meal, we noticed a flurry of activity around the tables near us. It turned out the staff were hanging umbrellas on the sprinkler pipes just below the grillework that separates the restaurant from the sidewalk above. By the time they were done, the entire front section of the restaurant was ringed with a protective cocoon of upsidedown umbrellas, resembling the famous scene from Mary Poppins. What a bizarre sight! Rain was forecast, but none fell before we left, so I didn't get to see what that was like.It was a satisfactory meal, but I won't be dying to go back.(The Mercer) Kitchen (99 Prince Street at Mercer Street, SoHo)Food: SatisfactoryService: *Ambiance: SatisfactoryOverall: Satisfactory

Olympics Plan Advances

New York City's bid to host the 2012 Olympic Summer Games cleared a hurdle today, when the International Olympic Committee (IOC) narrowed the field from nine cities to five. Paris, London, Madrid, and Moscow join New York in the final round, with a decision expected in July 2005. Havana, Istanbul, Leipzig and Havana fell out of contention. The decision was not really in doubt, given the well publicized conclusions of an IOC technical committee, which found \"a high level of confidence\" that Paris, London, Madrid, and New York could stage the games successfully. It found Moscow's capabilities just barely adequate, so the inclusion of Moscow in the final five is about the only surprise. The report found that the other four cities \"do not have the requisite level of capability at this time.\" Bookmakers have installed Paris as an 11-10 favorite to land the 2012 games, with London at 5-4, Madrid 7-1, New York 8-1, and Moscow 20-1. Paris scored highly on all of the IOC's criteria, it has already been through the bid process twice (1992 and 2008), and it hasn't hosted an Olympics since 1924. New York suffers because Vancouver, B.C., has already been awarded the 2012 Winter Games, and the IOC doesn't like to hold consecutive games on the same continent. New York's bid has other problems. Significant infrastructure, much of it as yet unfunded, would need to be built between now and 2012. The Olympic bid has garnered at best lukewarm public support, and internationally there could well be an anti-American backlash among the highly politicized IOC voters, because of the Iraq invasion. One major piece of unbuilt infrastructure is the Olympic Stadium, officially known as the \"New York Sports and Convention Center.\" Promoters chose that name to deflect attention from the fact that, should the Olympics bid fail, the facility will be primarily known as the new home of the New York Jets. The Jets are proposing to contribute $800 million of their own money, but they also expect about $600 million of public money, and some community leaders are skeptical about appropriating such a hefty sum so that a profitable football team can play eight home dates a year. The stadium design was unveiled today. It's a thing of beauty - at least in the artist's renderings. The Jets and Deputy Mayor Doctoroff desperately hope to break ground before next July, both to demonstrate to the IOC that New York's Olympics plans are real, and to give the stadium a raison d'etre other than hosting Jets football games. The Jets are clearly eager to demonstrate that the stadium is more than just corporate welfare for a carpetbagging football team. They say: The NYSCC will have something for everyone in the neighborhood. Beyond the projected schedule of 17 stadium events, 30 conventions, and two super-events per year, the Center will host daily events and activities for the members of the community and visitors. Along 34th Street, the full city block will be dedicated to a grand public space, ceremoniously connecting the Hudson River and the Highline to 34th Street. The revitalized 34th Street corridor will feature a promenade transforming one of the city's most overcrowded streets to provide pedestrians with a peaceful and stunning view of the stadium and river, amid trees, gardens and benches. The promenade will also conveniently provide street level access through a series of ramps and stairs around the Center and onto the Highline as it threads its way south. I remain highly skeptical that the new stadium will really enjoy that much use, and with the Olympics bid remaining a long-shot, it's a dubious investment.

Note: Click here for a more recent review of Nobu.A vendor invited me out to lunch at Nobu on Friday. That meant he was paying. We had no reservation, but we were waiting by the door when they opened at 11:45am, and we were seated immediately. My host had done this before, so apparently it's a dependable way to get into Nobu without a rez. We only had to promise that we'd vacate our table by 1:30pm. It was my first visit. For lunch, Nobo offers a wide variety of sushi and sashimi plates, soups and side dishes, several sushi/sashimi assortments in the $23-$28 range, a prix fixe package at $20.04, and the chef's omakase at \"$55 to $65 and up.\" There's also a two-column list running to a closely-spaced half-page, which the waiter called \"Chef Nobu's signature dishes.\" The menu had another name for them, but the waiter's term sticks in my memory. The waiter advised us to skip the sushi, and to order 4 or 5 of the signature dishes, which he told us are served \"Tapas style.\" That means they come one at a time, to be shared by the table. We chose 5 of the signature dishes - basically the ones the waiter recommended - as well as the Spicy Seafood Soup, which my host had enjoyed on his previous visit. The waiter's descriptions went by at blazing speed, and frankly I wasn't entirely sure what we'd chosen. He told us about a few special dishes not on the menu, and we chose one of these, but I always wonder why a restaurant can't be bothered to put the daily specials on a piece of paper. I think Nobu could manage it. At any rate, it all sounded good. The Spicy Seafood Soup came first, and it reminded me of that old commercial about the soup so chunky you want to eat it with a fork. There was just an amazing amount of seafood packed into the soup bowl. Then came yellowtail with cilantro and jalapeno peppers; I thought the last two ingredients slightly overwhelmed the first. It was the only dish about which I had even the slightest reservations. Our second signature dish was kobe beef, thinly sliced, and prepared with two kinds of spices. A tuna sashimi salad was sheer perfection, with several large slices of rare tuna. Then came squid pasta (hard to explain), and finally a black sea bass so rich and flavorful that I can still taste it. I can see why the waiter steered us away from sushi. My host, who had ordered sushi the last time he visited, confirmed this. The so-called signature dishes are extraordinary and without parallel. The sushi, he said, is of course among the best that can be had, but doesn't stand out from what's available elsewhere quite so conspicuously. With five dishes shared among two of us, plus soup, I left Nobu quite full, and yet sorry that the meal was over. Every dish was creative, full of flavor, perfectly seasoned, and prepared with an obvious attention to every detail. While enjoying our own meal, my host and I watched the parade of plates arriving at adjoining tables. No matter what you order, every dish entertains the eye as much as the taste buds. They are all works of sculpture - \"Art in Food,\" as my host observed. He promised to invite me back again, this time for dinner, in a couple of months or so. I can hardly wait.Nobu (105 Hudson Street at Franklin Street, TriBeCa)

Port Authority Confronts Silverstein

***CONTENT
The New York Post reports that the Port Authority has asked WTC developer Larry Silverstein to explain how he expects to pay his share of rebuilding costs. Now that Silverstein has lost a lawsuit against most of his insurers, the most he could receive is $4.6 billion, and it could be as little as $3.5 billion depending on how the remaining court battles play out (and he has lost all of them so far). That's a far cry from the $7.0 billion Silverstein would have received, had he persuaded a jury that the 9/11 attacks counted as two separate occurrences. Now, $4.6 billion isn't exactly chump change, but Silverstein has already blown $1.48 billion of it on legal fees, mortgage payments, and his $120 million-a-year lease with the Port Authority. It's estimated he'd owe another $630 million on lease payments before the 1,776-foot Freedom Tower, on which he's breaking ground this summer, could start generating income. Silverstein estimates it will cost $1.6 billion to build the Freedom Tower, but the Port Authority believes he also owes a contribution to the sub-grade infrastructure, which could run to another billion. Add it all up, and it's more money than Silverstein is known to have. Banks are unlikely to lend Silverstein any more money when the Freedom Tower as yet has no principal tenant. The bet here is that the Port Authority will have to find a way to buy Silverstein out of his lease.

***CONTENT
Note: This is a review of August under Executive Chef Tony Liu, who has since left the restaurant to take over at Keith McNally's Morandi.I had a very happy experience the other night at August. Eric Asimov was absolutely right about the heavenly smell. Arriving at 6:30pm for a pre-theater dinner, I had my choice of tables. When I left an hour later, they had started to fill up but still had two tables free. By 8:30pm, you would definitely have a wait. An outdoor garden is to open within the next couple of weeks. It will have a retractable roof, allowing it to be used year-round. This will double the capacity of the restaurant. I ordered a Ramp Vichysoisse soup to start, which misfired. It is supposed to be served cold. If this were a blind taste test, you'd have trouble deciding whether it was a hot soup that had been left at room temperature too long, or a cold soup that had been allowed to warm up. Things improved markedly with Softshell Crabs Grenobloise, served over a bed of haricots verts. The crabs, served whole, were done to perfect crispness, and an explosion of flavor greeted the tongue as I bit inside. Incidentally, the dish appears on the menu as \"Skate Grenobloise,\" but for now softshell crabs have replaced the skate. (This was fully disclosed before I ordered.) I finished with the daily selection of artisinal cheeses, a selection of three very flavorful and contrasting chesses that the manager informed me he had selected and purchased himself. He recommended a glass of Castilla y Lyon Rioja that perfectly complemented the cheeses without overwhelming them. Service was friendly and prompt, although I thought it took a tad too long for the cheese course to arrive. However, I had left plenty of time to finish dinner, and the Rioja kept me amused. One minor complaint is that the dessert menu had no prices. Silly me, I assumed the desserts would be priced in proportion to the rest of the menu, and didn't bother to ask. Turns out the cheese course was $15, which was only $2 less than my entree. Although I've no regrets about the evening, I really had no clue that I was selecting a $15 dessert. August doesn't take reservations, but apparently there are exceptions if you get to know them. While I was there, a lady came in and booked a table for 8pm on Sunday for her mother's 91st birthday. \"We don't take reservations, but call me at 6pm Sunday to remind me, and I'll set aside a table for you.\" It was obvious from the conversation that the lady had been in before. I overheard a couple of other conversations along similar lines. It really is time to rename the Eric Asimov's New York Times column, \"$25 and Under.\" The arrival of a new critic starting June 1st may provide the occasion to do so. My 3-course meal, with two glasses of wine, ran to $73 including tax and tip. By no rational definition can this be considered a \"$25-and-under\" restaurant, unless you eat a one-course meal and drink sodas, which is probably not what most people have in mind. Nor is August the first restaurant the Asimov column has covered that stretched the $25 ceiling way beyond plausibility. The name hasn't changed for about 20 years. Thanks to inflation, restaurants that realistically fall within that range, and yet are still worth reviewing, are a vanishing breed. Perhaps \"Informal Dining,\" although less catchy, would be a more sensible title.August (359 Bleecker Street, between W. Tenth & Charles Streets, West Village)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *½Overall: *½

The MTA has posted the Draft Environmental Impact Statement (DEIS) for the Fulton Street Transit Center (FSTC). This is one of the major transit projects receiving Federal funding as part of the post-9/11 aid package. The FSTC is a massive reconstruction of the Fulton-Broadway-Nassau station complex, the 9th busiest in the subway system, where the Broadway (2,3), Lexington (4,5), Eighth Avenue (A,C) and Nassau St (J,M,Z) Lines meet. It was originally four separate stations, constructed early in the 20th century by three competing companies that had no interest in working together. Free transfers between the lines were added when the city took over the entire subway system at mid-century, but the design of the complex was never rationalized. It is a bewildering array of ramps and staircases, with dozens of entrances, many of which are poorly located and far too narrow to accommodate peak passenger loads. As part of this project: The 2/3 and 4/5 stations, which are basically unchanged since they were built in the early 1900s, will be rehabilitated. The A/C mezzanine will be totally rebuilt, eliminating a confusing series of ramps, and improving connections to the 2/3 and 4/5. The whole station complex will become ADA compliant. There will be a new \"grand point of entry\" on the east side of Broadway, between Fulton and John Streets. Five buildings on that block will be demolished, with only the historic Corbin Building (on the corner of John and Broadway) surviving. There will be new entrances Broadway and Maiden Lane. The entrances on the west side of Broadway will be totally rebuilt, including a new headhouse at the corner of Dey and Broadway (with the low-rise building on the south corner of that intersection demolished). Most other entrances will be widened and made more accessible. There will be a new underground passageway along Dey Street, connecting the complex to the World Trade Center. There will be a new free transfer between the N/R and the E at the World Trade Center. The MTA considered ten alternatives, of which two will receive further analysis in the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) later this year. The two surviving alternatives differ mainly in how they deal with the Corbin Building at the corner of John and Broadway. In one alternative, the Corbin Building is untouched; in the other, the Corbin building is acquired as part of the project, and integrated into the new entrance building along Broadway. The description in the DEIS strongly suggests that the MTA prefers this latter option. Construction is set to start in late 2004, with completion in 2007.

There are two online food boards that I follow regularly: eGullet and Chowhound. Both have discussion forums organized by geography. You'll find eGullet's New York board here, and you'll find Chowhound's Manhattan board here. (Chowhound management tosses a hissy fit if you mention Peter Luger on their Manhattan board, even though Luger is economically part of the Manhattan market. They insist it belongs on an \"outer borough\" board.) eGullet is superior to Chowhound in almost every respect. It has a more intuitive user interface, it is easier to find things, and the average post is considerably more sophisticated. This is not to deny that you sometimes find useful comments on Chowhound - otherwise I wouldn't bother to read it - but they're fewer and far between. I am particularly amused by clueless Chowhound posts like this one yesterday: Looking for recommendations for good eats (dinner) in the West 50's. Scene/buzz/beautiful people _not_ of interest; just wonderful eats. All cuisines are in the ballpark except for Mexican and Indian (thanks to spice allergy). Now, there are hundreds of restaurants in the West 50s. Menupages lists 274 of them, and of course not all restaurants are on Menupages. So to ask for \"good eats\" in the West 50s, with the only requirement that it not be Mexican or Indian, is an idiotic question. I mean, I'm pretty tolerant of those who are intellectually challenged, but this is just not a thoughtful question. And there are a few howlers like this on Chowhound's Manhattan board almost every day. And am I the only one who finds the ridiculous word \"eats\" totally unnecessary? I'm alright with \"foodie\" (another recurring word on these boards), as there is no other word of comparable length that conveys the same meaning. It is, in other words, a useful addition to the language. But \"eats\" merely means \"food,\" as far as I can tell, and both are four letters.

It has been a busy week for the Lower Manhattan rebuilding program. In a speech today before the Association before a Better New York, Governor Pataki gave his semi-annual report on progress downtown. As usual, he took the occasion to make a bit of news: Freedom Tower. Construction of the 1,776-foot skyscraper will begin on July 4, 2004, about two months earlier than previously announced. The Memorial. Schematic drawings will be completed by the end of 2004 and detailed drawings by the end of 2005, with construction to begin by 2006. Some $350 million will need to be raised to pay for it. Major League Baseball got the ball rolling with a $1 million contribution. Fulton Street Transit Center. Design of the new transit hub that will link 12 subway lines at the corner of Fulton & Broadway will be unveiled on May 26, 2004. Deutsche Bank Building. Demolition of the crippled shell that was once Deutsche Bank's (and, before that, Bankers Trust's) downtown headquarters will begin in the fall and be completed in 2005. West Street Promenade. The project intended to turn West Street into New York's version of the Champs-Elysee will begin in September, and the first section - from Washington Street to West Thames Street - will be complete by the end of 2005. South Ferry Terminal. A new subway terminal at South Ferry has completed initial design and should open by 2007. The project will replace an antiquated subway station dating from 1905, and will also provide a new free transfer to the Whitehall Street Station on the Broadway Line. Battery Park Ferry Terminal. Construction on a new Battery Park City Ferry Terminal has begun, with completion scheduled for 2006. Pataki also elaborated on plans leaked to the press earlier in the week for a JFK-LIRR-Lower Manhattan Rail Link. The Governor favors a new East River tunnel, which (along with infrastructure on either side of the river) would cost at least $6.0 billon. No one yet knows where such a vast sum would come from, but Pataki pledged to begin the environmental review process this summer, and to find the money somehow before that process is completed. The study will also consider using the existing Montague Street Tunnel, which serves M and R trains today, but has some spare capacity. The Montague option, although less expensive, would severely constrict the subway system's capacity to grow or adapt to service outages. The Governor believes the new tunnel could be operational by 2013. He says it would carry 100,000 passengers a day and would result in an increased economic output of $6 to 8 billion annually in Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn, and as much as $9 to 12 billion in the region as a whole. You can expect that there will be plenty of skeptics wondering where those figures come from.

Last night, a friend visiting from out of town invited me to join him for dinner in midtown. Restaurant plans were loose, and I cringed when he suggested the Famous Oyster Bar. The neon \"Seafood\" sign suggested it catered to tourists who are looking for something a bit better than Red Lobster. I'm sure the clientele is nearly all walk-ins staying at hotels like the Sheraton and the Milford Plaza. The restaurant has been there since 1959, and it probably hasn't had a renovation since then. Not even Zagat has noticed it. The decor is a trite assemblage of maritime detritus (a life preserver, an oar, etc.). The laminated menus are worn and and frayed, with a predictable offering of steaks, seafood, pasta fra diavolo, frutta di mare, clam chowder, and so forth. When you've finished your diet coke, the server brings an iced tea refill (that is, when she manages to notice you need one). There are specials written on a board, and it is here that the Famous Oyster Bar comes alive. A whole trout stuffed with crabmeat was a pleasant surprise, crispy on the outside, and succulently moist inside. This was an entree that actually required some thought, and they managed to get it right. My friend ordered soft-shell crabs and was also pleased. We both had clam chowder to start; although unremarkable, it was a bargain at $3.95 for a cup. The seafood entrees were generally in the $19-23 range. The bill for two came to $82 (with only one of us drinking alcohol). I'm willing to try anything once, and the Famous Oyster Bar managed to exceed expectations. It helps to have expected nothing.Famous Oyster Bar (842 Seventh Ave at 54th Street, West Midtown)Food: *Service: SatisfactoryAmbiance: FairOverall: *

Silverstein's Loss is Lower Manhattan's Gain

Yesterday, developer Larry A. Silverstein lost yet another battle to collect a double insurance payment for the loss of the World Trade Center towers. Silverstein, who signed a lease for the property six fateful weeks before 9/11, argued that each airplane attack was a \"separate occurrence,\" entitling him to a double recovery. Had that argument prevailed, Silvertstein would have been entitled to a whopping $7.0 billion payout, which he would have used to erect a glut of office space in Lower Manhattan. The property was covered by a consortium of insurers, and the dispute has turned on which of two coverage forms, or \"binders,\" was in effect on 9/11. It's a complex skein to unravel, because Silverstein negotiated with many insurers simultateously, and each one might have had a different understanding of what they were agreeing to cover. But one after another, courts and juries have held that Silverstein's insurance treated 9/11 as a single event. There are still a few insurers for which the issue has yet to be decided, but even if Silverstein wins every remaining battle--which is highly unlikely given his track record thus far--the most he could collect is $4.68 billion. However, he has aleady collected $1.9 billion, of which $1.6 billion has gone to legal fees and rent payments. The bottom line is that there will be far less insurance money to rebuild the World Trade Center than Silverstein and the Port Authority had expected. While that's undoubtedly bad news for Silverstein, it's good news for the city. As it is, Silverstein has two massive projects underway at the site: 7 World Trade Center (already under construction) and the 1,776-foot-tall Freedom Tower (to be started shortly). Neither has attracted a principal tenant. The last thing we need is for Silverstein to continue this glut of construction, as he had every intention of doing, despite the clear lack of appreciable demand. Silverstein swears that he will continue to rebuld anyway, up to the 10 million square feet of commercial space he controlled previously. But no bank will lend Silverstein the money for more office towers until it's demonstrated he can fill them, and for the foreseeable future that seems highly unlikely. Last year, the Port Authority bought out Westfield America, who had held the lease on the retail mall at the Trade Center. Westfield was balking at plans to build street-level retail, preferring to duplicate the subterranean mall that was on the site before 9/11. Getting rid of Westfield simplified matters for everybody. With Silverstein now losing money hand over fist in lease payments to the Port Authority, and with no chance of him rebuilding all of the lost space anytime soon, Silverstein becomes increasingly irrelevant. I wouldn't be surprised to see him out of the picture, or with his influence severely curtailed, by year's end.

Scotland is cool. Scotland is hip. Major food magazines are discovering Scotland, as well they should. You can eat like a king in Scotland, and the scenery ain't bad either. By way of background, I've been working off-and-on in Edinburgh for the last ten months. For much of last year, I was there three weeks out of every four. Lately, it's one week out of four. I've eaten in dozens of different restaurants, and on each trip I sample at least one place I haven't been before. This week, I took in three restaurants that were new to me. Oloroso (33 Castle Street), which is only about two years old, won Tony Singh \"Scottish Restaurant Chef of The Year\" in 2003. The website observes: Oloroso, which is Spanish for aromatic and is also a style of sherry, occupies a key top floor corner site on Edinburgh's bustling George Street. Due to its unique position, the large roof terrace provides stunning views across both the Firth of Forth and Edinburgh Castle. The decor is modern, sleek, and spare. As there is no street entrance, Oloroso's foot traffic is probably next to none. Nevertheless, it was comfortably full on my Monday night visit, so the word has gotten out. Note that the lifts go only to the third floor, so you need to be able to climb a flight of stairs. Until Oloroso, I had found only two types of fine dining experiences in Edinburgh: Scottish and French (or some mixture of the two). Singh finds his own way, and this alone makes Oloroso worth a visit. A few of the dishes have an obvious Indian inspiration, but it is not an Indian restaurant. I ordered crawfish and asparagus risotto to start, followed by filet of ostrich. If you haven't had ostrich, it's a red mea tasting somewhat like venison. It came with a tangy dipping sauce, which is perhaps a nod to Singh's Indian roots. The menu changes daily, with most appetizers priced around £7 and most mains around £17. There is also a grill menu offering several cuts of Scottish beef. My dinner, with one drink and without wine, came to £31, including tip. To sample the work of a fine chef like Singh, this is an extraordinary bargain, and there seems to be no other restaurant in Edinburgh quite like it. Oloroso is definitely worth a look, both for the food and the scenery. Edinburgh has just two Michelin star restaurants: Number One, in the basement of the Balmoral Hotel, and Martin Wishart, at 54 The Shore in the port district of Leith. I've been to Number One several times, but Tuesday was my first trip to Martin Wishart. While Wishart's food may be comparable to Jeff Bland's at Number One, the surroundings most assuredly are not. Enter Number One's basement location, and you are instantly transported. In Wishart's storefront on a busy street, the food must compete with noisy distractions. Martin Wishart's mission is to persuade you to order one of the tasting menus. The five-course tasting menu is priced at £48. (There is also a six-course menu.) Order an appetizer and main course a la carte, and it will set you back about £40 before dessert, so you might as well take the tasting menu. The waitstaff hints disingenuously that Wishart sometimes throws surprises into the tasting menu, but in fact everything they served was available a la carte. I compared notes with some colleagues who'd been to Wishart's recently, and they had the same experience of \"surprises\" hinted at, but not delivered. Every course arrives with an essay-length oration about what you are eating. Nothing at Martin Wishart is simple. The amuse-bouche was four tasty bites, all different, arranged like an art sculpture. Amusing indeed, but I forgot the essay and had no idea what they were. A starter of asparagus and tiny strings of calimari failed to impress, but the next three courses were all winners: rabbit terrine, monkfish over a mackerel puree, and duck (marinated for two days, we're told). All of these came with similar essay-length descriptions that I cannot recall. The meal ended with a \"pre-dessert\" (some kind of yogurt confection) and a small dessert course (cherries, pistachio ice cream, and something else from the bakery oven that tasted absolutely heavenly). As with most tasting menus at restaurants like Wishart's, the sommelier will happily recommend a different wine for each course, but that's more wine than I can take on a work night, or indeed on most any night, after I've already had a pre-dinner cocktail. He did recommend a sensible glass of white to go with the first part of the meal, and a côte du rhone to go with the end of it. All of this cost about £71 for one, including tip. I have seldom found a truly impressive steak in Britain, but I keep trying to find one. The search has ended. Champany Inn cannot be bettered. Located in the town of Linlithgow, Champany is about 30 minutes' drive from Central Edinburgh. It's run by a husband and wife team, Clive and Anne Davidson. Anne is visible all evening long, while Clive heads the kitchen. This quote is from the website: The buildings at Champany Corner that now make up Champany Inn, date from the 16th Century and the time of Mary, Queen of Scots. These buildings now house sixteen luxury bedrooms, the Main Dining Room specialising in Aberdeen Angus beef and Shetland Salmon and our award winning cellar which has been voted the Best in Britain on two occasions. The smaller Chop and Ale House offers bistro style meals and serves probably the best hamburger in Britain. The ill-defined Michelin ratings claim that one star is \"worth a stop,\" two stars is \"worth a detour,\" and three stars is \"worth a trip.\" By this definition, Champanys is a two-star experience. It is without doubt worth a detour, and indeed a very significant one. Given that it is located in the middle of nowhere, many have obviously found it worth a trip on its own. This is the most memorable meal I have had in Edinburgh, and I have had plenty of very good ones. The restaurant will happily offer you a choice from any number of non-beef dishes, such as duck, salmon, langoustines, or lobster. But beef is Champany's raison d'etre, and it's beef that all four in our party had. Three of us chose the porterhouse, one the sirloin. Champany's offers a variety of cuts, including stip loin, ribeye, Pope's eye (ever heard of that), or chateaubriand. Whichever you choose, you get a thick, hearty piece of meat cooked to perfection. The website explains: Clive Davidson is proud of his meat. He selects his beef from herds of prime cattle grazing off acres of lush Aberdeenshire countryside. The carcasses are hung for a full three weeks during which all the succulent flavours that have made Scottish beef such an internationally renowned delicacy, are held and matured. Before placing on the grill the beef is first dipped into an exclusive sauce created specially by Clive for sealing the meat so that none of the precious flavours escape. As he explained, \"All steaks should be sealed before grilling, and you can do this quite simply by sprinkling them with brown sugar. Once on the grill this will caramelise, sealing the meat and encouraging the outer flesh to cook quickly while the inside remains pink and moist\". However, Clive's secret recipe for his sauce contains other special ingredients that will enhance still further the flavours of the naturally tender meat. Starters are similarly impressive. Champany's smokes its own salmon. Served hot, with hollandaise sauce, the taste is exquisite. As at many steakhouses, portions are enormous. This so-called \"starter\" could have been a main course at many restaurants. Quoting the website again: Words almost fail me to describe the subtle excellence of the hot smoked salmon. Fleshy and succulent, it can be cut with a fork which breaks it into pungent morsels of sublime Scottish salmon warm and aromatic with a surprisingly gentle woody bouquet. Champany's is elegantly decorated, with its oak panel dining room and candle-lit tables. Service is luxurious. To go with the ample wine list previously mentioned, Champany's has an impressive selection of liqeurs, aperitifs, and single malt whiskys. They even distil their own cognac (while of course offering many others), which we found surprisingly good. Dinner for four, including before and after-dinner drinks, appetizers, steaks, side dishes, and two bottes of modestly-priced wine, ran to £370.

Note: For a more recent review of Landmarc in TriBeCa, click here. For a review of Landmarc at the Time-Warner Center, click here.Landmarc is the latest cool restaurant in TriBeCa, a neighborhood that already has plenty of them. It's named for chef-owner Marc Murphy, who cut his teeth at Le Cirque, La Fourchette, Layla, and Cellar in the Sky, among other places. Landmarc has more humble aspirations than these temples of haute cuisine. It has the feel of a neighborhood hangout, with exposed brick walls and waitstaff in black t-shirts. The menu offers a range of French, Italian, and plain old American comfort food.I ambled into Landmarc today for lunch. It was about 1pm, and the restaurant was around 1/3rd full. It actually got a tad busier by the time I left, but the downstairs was still well under 1/2 full. I took a look upstairs, where only two or three tables were occupied. There is a gorgeous 3/4ths-enclosed booth that the manager said is available for parties of 6.I don't like to drink before the evening. The ample selection of half-bottles of wine was duly noted, but the staff did not mind that I preferred tap water. I ordered the asparagus soup (yummy) and steak au poivre. Not much can be done to improve an age-old recipe like steak au poivre. Landmarc served a thick piece of meat, crusty on the outside and cooked to a perfect medium rare on the inside, topped with onions. The pepper sauce got the job done, but it was a bit runny and soaked the bottom layer of french fries. The fries that the sauce didn't get to were crisp and medium-thickness. Landmarc offers six choices of desserts for $3 apiece, or you can have one of each for $15. I was far too full to try even one, but it has to be the best dessert bargain in town.Service was attentive and efficient at the beginning of the meal, but visits to my table seemed to tail off near the end. They kept me waiting for the steak a bit longer than they should, but all was forgiven once I tasted it. The manager did make a point of coming around to every table and saying hello.For a place that doesn't take reservations for parties less than six, both the placement and the size of the bar seem to be a miscalculation. It's at the back of the restaurant, so patrons who want to wait at the bar before their table is ready have to pass through the downstairs dining area. There are only five bar stools, so I suspect it will get crowded back there, potentially a distraction for those who've already been seated.I don't know if Landmarc will take a cell phone number and call you when they're ready. If so, I suspect Buster's Garage, the NASCAR-themed sports bar across the street, will pick up a lot of the overflow. I read in the minutes for Community Board 1's March meeting that there have already been compaints in the neighborhood about the noise at the newly-opened Buster's.It hasn't been open long, but Landmarc is already a destination restaurant. In an LA Times article yesterday, \"Dining Frenzy Takes Gotham,\" Landmarc was listed as one of eight hot new restaurants in New York. Amanda Hesser's review in the NYT gave Landmarc one star, which seemed to me correct (in a system that doesn't allow half-stars).Landmarc (179 West Broadway between Leonard and Worth Streets, TriBeCa)Food: *½Service: *Ambiance: *Overall: *½

Am I the only one who thinks \"Baluchi's\" should be an Italian joint? Well, it's not. Baluchi's is a chain of about a dozen Indian restaurants, with locations all over town. The newest branch is at the corner of Greenwich & Warren Sts, in the southwest corner of TriBeCa.The site hasn't been a lucky one. It's a bit far from the TriBeCa dining mainstream, situated across the street from a parking lot and caddy-corner from a grade school. Some of the apartments of southern Battery Park City are just a few short blocks away, but Baluchi's doesn't seem to be drawing crowds yet. Its predecessor on that site was a nice Mexican restaurant that closed after 9/11.After a late night at the office, I wandered in to find Baluchi's empty, except for a large table of about 15 investment bankers, who no doubt were happy to be able to talk shop without annoying anyone. That they bypassed the nearby, and better known, Salaam Bombay, is a clue that Baluchi's is attracting the smart money.The authentic decor is tastefully done, while avoiding any of the usual Indian restaurant cliches. Dark wood tables give a feeling of solidity, and they're a comfortable distance apart. The laminated menu is a liability, reminding one of a coffee shop. The magic begins when the food arrives, served in individual copper pots. Salmon curry was exceptionally tender, perfectly cooked, and accompanied with a flavorful sauce. The waiter even threw in the basmati rice for nothing. The dish disappeared off my plate all too quickly. The service was attentive, but with the restaurant practically empty it had damned well better be.Baluchi's in TriBeCa is one of those hidden neighborhood gems that will never get a newspaper review, but quietly delivers the goods. If you're in TriBeCa and in the mood for Indian food, it's worth a detour.Baluchi's (275 Greenwich Street at Warren Street, TriBeCa) Food: *Service: **Ambiance: *Overall: *

Common-Sense Airport Security

Cross your fingers. Pittsburgh is about to be the pilot for a long-overdue overhaul of airport security rules. If it's successful, picking up and dropping off passengers might just get a whole lot easier. Since 9/11, only ticketed passengers have been allowed past airport security checkpoints, with only limited exceptions (e.g., adults accompanying minor children). Anyone else had to say their hellos and goodbyes outside of security. Pittsburgh Airport has been lobbying hard to get the rule changed, because sales have slumped at an upscale shopping mall that resides entirely inside the security checkpoint. And because Pittsburgh has just one large checkpoint for the entire airport, it's an ideal place to try loosening the restrictions. Mind you, it's not that I'm overly sympathetic to the fate of a Pittsburgh shopping mall. But I long for the good old days when you could escort a friend or family member all the way to the gate. And when arriving in an unfamiliar city, it's a lot easier to meet at the gate than to make your way to a confusing meeting point somewhere beyond baggage claim. If the rule is to be changed, the major sticking point is ensuring that the added traffic through security doesn't slow down the process for the people who really need it--those who are traveling. Frankly, I think a number of related policies need to be re-examined at the same time. At airport security, the two most time-consuming requirements are: 1) Taking laptops out of their briefcases; and, 2) Requiring most passengers to remove their shoes. I have traveled extensively in Europe, where you are required to do neither, and I don't think the Europeans are lax about security. They're just smarter. The security staff also check boarding passes a few too many times. Depending on the airport, and which way the wind is blowing, boarding passes and/or IDs are checked up to three times before you get to the gate, but it isn't consistent--sometimes, they only check once. You never know when it's safe to put your ID away. The 9/11 terrorists have changed air travel forever, but I think the system can get a lot more convenient without sacrificing security. Many of the post-9/11 restrictions have since been lifted, as officials became more comfortable with the risks. This is, I hope, yet another example.

Cigar entrepreneur Bill Rancic, 32, is Donald J. Trump's newest employee. Rancic prevailed over fifteen other candidates on the NBC-TV reality series, The Apprentice. He won a $250,000-a-year job managing the construction of a 90-story luxury tower in Chicago, his home town. How's that for an entry-level job! Over the course of 13 weeks, Trump gave the candidates a series of business tasks, \"firing\" one of them at the end of each episode. The choice came down to Rancic and Harvard MBA Kwame Jackson. In Thursday's season finale, Rancic had to manage a celebrity golf tournament, and Jackson a Jessica Simpson concert. Bill and Kwame presented contrasting management styles. Despite the artificiality of a made-for-TV job interview, the outcome was a textbook lesson in business. Both candidates chose a trio of cast members fired in previous episodes, who served as their \"employees\" for this final project. Kwame delegated everything and asked his staff almost no questions, assuming they would complete their assignments without direction. Bill was immersed in the details, at times annoying his team by constantly reminding them what needed to be done. But in the end, Bill's golf tournament came off without a hitch. The closest he came to a mishap was when a sponsor's promotional sign was misplaced. Bill himself found it just in time, when he had the inspiration to look for it in a dumpster. Bill was probably more visibly tense than a golf tournament director should be, but given the stakes you can't blame him for leaving no stone unturned. In contrast, Kwame was always calm in the eye of the storm, but his team kept dropping the ball. His only defense was, \"As an executive, you have to delegate, and trust that your people will get things done.\" In fact, successful executives delegate only what their employees have proved they can handle. As the Russians used to say, trust, but verify. After thirteen episodes with these people, Kwame should have known their weaknesses. Kwame's biggest mistake was relying on the series villain, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth. Over and over again, Omarosa had proved she couldn't be trusted. We the audience knew more of Omarosa's treachery than Kwame did, but Kwame surely had seen enough to know that Omarosa was a loose cannon. And Kwame's other employees, Troy and Heidi, were also poorly coordinated. None of their errors were fatal in the end, but perhaps that's just because Kwame got lucky. Kwame seems to just trust everybody, and hope for the best. Even had Kwame been lucky enough to stay out of trouble, I suspect that Trump would have chosen Bill anyway, as his hands-on style is much more to Trump's liking. Kwame's blind faith in a team that kept letting him down made Trump's decision easy. Kwame is a likeable guy, and I believe he'll be very successful over time, but his actual performance throughout the series was just mediocre. There's more to good management than just delegating and being a nice guy. What are we to make of Omarosa? Throughout the series, she fought with teammates and fumbled one task after another. Not content with blowing her own chances, she also sank Kwame's. After her firing, she complained to a national magazine that another candidate had called her a nigger. The other candidate vigorously denied it, and producers say there's no videotape evidence. Omarosa was caught lying outright several times, so there's little reason to believe her. Omarosa has acquired a variety of nicknames on Apprentice fansites: Assarosa, Assinina, Assahola, Assorama, and most wickedly, Osamarosa. For a more glowing portrait, you can visit her own website, http://www.omarosa.com/, but I suspect her fifteen minutes of fame are about up. I don't watch much TV, but The Apprentice had me riveted. Unlike most so-called \"reality\" series, The Apprentice actually resembled real-life. Sort of. The tasks were constrained to fit in weekly one-hour episodes, but they were real projects that we could all recognize: selling lemonade, renovating an apartment, developing a marketing campaign, securing donations for a charity auction, and so forth. Contrast that with Survivor, another show that knocks off a contestant every week till only one is left. In that show, the weekly \"challenges\" are elaborate made-up games that wouldn't occur anywhere else. The Apprentice's least realistic conceit is the requirement that someone be fired every week. Some episodes had a clear-cut goat, but other times there was no candidate who obviously deserved to go. Nevertheless, Trump summoned the losers to his \"boardroom\" for a ritualistic performance review, ending in the trademark phrase no candidate wanted to hear, \"You're fired!\" We often winced along with them, but Trump's critiques were always fair, specific, principled, and dead-accurate. The Apprentice was compelling, because as Trump observed, \"Everyone's been hired, and everyone's been fired.\" I disagreed with a couple of his firings, but in the end Trump found the right apprentice: Bill was the cream of a very fine crop. Don't shed any tears for the non-winners. They all seem to be doing very well indeed. Three have gotten engaged since the series wrapped last fall. Another is pregnant. Trump was so taken with winsome Amy Henry (the last to be fired before the final episode) that he has offered her a job as head of sales in Trump World Tower, at Columbus Circle. Amy has other options, and is mulling the offer. Troy McLain is considering a career as a motivational speaker, at which I think he would excel. Kwame has been offered $25,000 for a one-week gig pitching chicken for KFC. Omarosa is doing a shampoo commercial. Two other candidates have started a clothing line. The series' other loose cannon, Sam Solovey (fired in the third episode, but indelibly memorable nonetheless), is so flush that he offered Trump $250,000 for the chance to work for him. A dumbfounded Trump accepted Sam's suitcase full of cash and said he'd think it over, but I expect him to politely decline. NBC has Trump signed for two more seasons. In a recent casting call, 250,000 people submitted applications for the chance to get fired next fall.

NYC Apartment Ownership an Impossible Dream

Today's New York Times reports that the average apartment price in Manhattan hit $1 million during the first quarter of 2004, a new record, and an increase of 32% over the same period last year. The previous record was $920k, set during the third quarter of 2003. The median apartment (or middle of the market) is now at $625k, which is up 21% from a year ago. This suggests that the super-heated high-end of the market (apartments that cost well above $1 million) is what's pulling up the average so quickly. But for $625k in a decent neighborhood, you're only going to get a one-bedroom. If you want two bedrooms, you're going to be spending over $1 million, or making serious compromises (a bad building, a bad location, or both). The article discusses a recent transplant from California, who was shocked to discover that she couldn't get a decent two-bedroom apartment for under $1.8 million. The survey is limited to Manhattan below 112th St on the West Side, and 96th St on the East Side, which are the traditional boundaries separating the Upper West and East Sides from Harlem. These divisions are increasingly irrelevant, as Hudson Heights and Washington Heights become more gentrified. But don't expect any great bargains up there either. Half-a-million dollars in Washington Heights doesn't buy much any more. In Manhattan, at least, home ownership for most of us is becoming the impossible dream.

Today, Lincoln Center announced the first stage of redevelopment, a stunning transformation of West 65th St between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. The $325 million project will turn the desolate street into the complex's \"dynamic front door.\" I must admit I had my doubts that West 65th was capable of the dramatic improvements promised for it, but the photos on Lincoln Center's website convinced me. Some highlights from the press release: The West 65th Street project will feature new street-level entrances, transparent street-level facades, dramatic lighting, elegant modernist variations on the traditional theater marquee, and informational and directional signage to give a strong street identity to each of the seven constituents and facilitate visitor orientation. The cultural corridor will also provide easy access to new indoor and outdoor facilities for dining and refreshments..... The street would be narrowed, eliminating one car lane. The curb cuts in the center of the block also would be removed. On the south side of the street, the sidewalk would be expanded to 27 feet in width, creating a safer pedestrian street environment for the thousands of pedestrians who throng across the street in the pre-theater hour. A narrow, translucent footbridge that opens up the street to sunlight and enhances visibility would span West 65th Street and provide safe and easy access for Juilliard and School of American Ballet students. Paul Milstein Plaza could be configured to encompass the reflecting pool and terrace in the North Plaza, further enhancing the overall unity of the new design..... At street level along West 65th Street, the now solid travertine base of the [Juilliard] school will be opened up with a transparent new facade. This facade will reveal Juilliard's theaters and their lobbies and frame a sweeping grand stair to a welcoming, light-filled lobby and student lounge on the second floor overlooking the rest of the Lincoln Center campus. High technology graphic displays incorporated into the facade would provide comprehensive event information on the hundreds of free public presentations offered by Juilliard. Now, let's see them raise the money!

JFK Airlink: Two Weeks and Counting

In January, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation announced four design alternatives for bringing JFK Airport and LIRR trains to the World Trade Center, with the preferred alternative to be announced in April. It's mid-April, so we should know their decision within the next two weeks. According to Newsday, the LMDC is leaning strongly towards contributing the $1.2 billion remaining in its coffers to the JFK-LIRR rail link. Multiple surveys (e.g., see here) have shown that the community would prefer to see that sum devoted to broader-based initiatives, such as affordable housing, job training, parks, and so forth. I wouldn't necessarily put much weight in surveys, as the average person doesn't really appreciate the economic effects of building a new rail line, but the impact of repairing a dilapidated sidewalk is immediately visible to all. As the LMDC has already spent $2.3 billion on the kind of tactical initiatives the community prefers, perhaps it is not unjust to commit the remaining $1.2 billion to a Big Idea that could be transformational in the way that little grants here-and-there cannot. But even the lowest estimates put the cost of a JFK-LIRR downtown rail link at $2.0 billion. History shows that initial guesses for projects of this complexity are usually wildly off-the-mark. If the real cost is more like $5.0 billion, then the LMDC's contribution only gets us 25% of the way there. What's good is that? Even more important than the actual design is whether there's any way of paying for it. Let's hope that it's not all smoke-and-mirrors, like the Mayor's Far West Side development program.

Second Avenue Subway to be Built In Stages

***CONTENT
The Daily News reports that the first phase of the Second Avenue Subway will run from 96th to 63rd Streets, connecting to the existing Q line at 57th and Broadway. The phase would add just four new stations (96th & 2nd, 86th & 2nd, 72nd & 2nd, and 63rd & Lex). Construction could be underway by the end of this year, and the extended Q line could be in service in about seven years. The full-length Second Avenue Subway (\"SAS\"), from 125th St to Hanover Sq, could be completed by 2020 if all of the funding comes through, but New Yorkers have every reason to be skeptical. Several tunnel sections for the line were completed in the early 1970s, but were never used because the city ran out of money. A Long Island Railroad tunnel under the East River at 63rd St was built around the same time, and it still has never carried a single passenger. (A project called East Side Access, which will finally put that tunnel to use by bringing LIRR trains into Grand Central, is still years from completion.) However, it seems entirely reasonable to phase in the SAS's benefits, and the section from 96th to 63rd is the most logical starting point. It allows the SAS to connect to the existing unused connection to the Broadway Line, and it will reduce crowding on the Lexington Avenue Line by giving UES reidents another way to get downtown. Details of the plan should appear on the MTA website within the next several weeks.

Churrascaria Platforma has been serving Brazilian Rodizio in midtown (316 W 49th near 8th Ave) since 1996. As the website explains:Churrascaria (choo-rah-scah-REE-ah) is the name used to describe a restaurant that serves meat, mostly grilled, and Rodizio is a method of serving the different cuts of meat that originated in the south of Brazil in the early 1800's.The concept is to serve a wide variety of different cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, etc., in succession, to each diner individually right at their table, thus there is not a traditional menu. The restaurant features a fixed-price continuous tableside service.A TriBeCa branch opened 2½ months ago. According to the maitre d', it's smaller than its uptown cousin. The high-gloss decor keeps up with the Joneses on a street that has Montrachet just to the north, and Bouley just to the south.The young lady who escorted us to our table initially took us to a spot at the back of the restaurant, up against a wall. \"I'm not supposed to do this,\" she said, \"but would you prefer a better location?\" Of course we would. She next showed us a table adjoining the kitchen, which didn't seem to be an improvement. Finally we got a table with a great view of the appetizer bar, the live band, and the sommelier's station. Why didn't she just start with that?The maitre d' brought two coaster-sized plastic discs, which he placed in front of us with the red side facing up. He explained that dinner starts with the appetizer bar, but he cautioned us not to fill up, because there are 18 main courses after that. When you've finished your appetizers, you flip the plastic disc onto its green side. That signals the servers to bring on the meat and fish courses, and they'll keep coming till you turn the disc over once again.The appetizer bar was hard to resist, offering a range of salads, cheeses, sushi bites, and seafood. Tuna tartare was perhaps the most memorable of the bunch, but there were many I just had to ignore, knowing that the 18 main dishes were the reason we had come. You could go home well fed if the appetizer bar were the whole meal, but of course it is not.The main courses arrive faster than you can eat them, but not in any kind of order. Generally they come on skewers (a few are wheeled around on carts), and the server cuts off as small or as large a piece as you want. They tend to offer small portions, which is sensible considering there are 18 of them. Anyone who can try them all must have a prodigious appetite. I could not.No single dish makes the meal, and indeed they are uneven. Ribeye steak and filet mignon were mouth-wateringly tender, and two different lamb dishes were done to perfection, but a chicken entree was leathery, and pork ribs stubbornly clung to the bone. Yet, the overall impression is so favorable that one hesitates to criticize the occasional item that fails to work. For fish-lovers, Plataforma offers salmon and sea bass, but don't make the trip unless you're a carnivore.Plataforma has no menu, so you're never sure what you haven't seen yet. By the time beef ribs and suckling pig came along, I was simply too full to give them a try. Had I known they were on offer, I would have made sure to leave room. If you happen to know that you'd like a particular dish, the maitre d' will have it brought to you. But you don't always know what you haven't seen.A menu would also help clarify in advance what the $45 prix fixe actually includes. It turns out the appetizer and main course are in, but dessert and coffee are not. I didn't feel the least bit overcharged at $7 for a piece of cheesecake and $2 for coffee, but when you're told \"fixed price\" you might reasonably assume it includes everything but the liquor.Churrascaria Plataforma is a fun night out. I stumbled home several pounds heavier, but satisfied.Churrascaria Plataforma (221 West Broadway between White & Franklin Streets, TriBeCa)Food: **Service: *½Ambiance: *½Overall: **

Mad for Meatpacking

***CONTENT
It'll tell you how hopelessly un-hip I am, that, until yesterday, I had never been to the Meatpacking District since it became anything other than a neighborhood where wholesale meats are sold. The area is bounded roughly by Gansevoort St on the south, 14th St on the north, and Ninth and Tenth avenues. I say \"roughly,\" because like any hip neighborhood its boundaries are stretching. My Manhattan street atlas limits the district to the two square blocks bounded by Little West 12th, 14th, and Ninth and Tenth Avenues. But nowadays, even places on 15th St have Meatpacking aspirations.A lot of the district's hip nightclubs hadn't opened their doors when my friend and I walked by in the late afternoon, but we were able to get a look in many of the restaurants. After a long walk from the Financial District, we were ready for a short break. Zitoune (46 Gansevoort St) snootily refused us an outdoor table when we ordered soft drinks, claiming a $10 minimum outside. We tried Macelleria next door, where they happily accepted our order for soft drinks and biscotti (ironically, we spent more than $10 anyway). The whole time, Zitoune never did use the outdoor table they denied us.There's a large triangular space where Gansevoort, Little West 12th, Ninth Ave, and Greenwich St converge at odd angles. At one of the outdoor tables at Zitoune, Macelleria, or nearby Pastis (9 Ninth Ave) you get a panoramic view of the Meatpacking crowd's comings and goings. The intersection seems to demand a life-size statue of Mr. Gansevoort (or whoever/whatever that street was named for). If we were in Europe, it would have one.I wanted to see what Spice Market (403 W. 13th St.), Jean-Georges Vongerichten's latest hit, was about. From the outside, you'd barely know it's a restaurant. Inside, the $5 million decor overwhelms the senses. It seems no one opens a destination restaurant in New York these days on the strength of the food alone. We peeked in around 6pm, as the place was just beginning to fill up, and the staff didn't mind terribly that we were there only to gawk.We were particularly intrigued by the sensuous private rooms at the back of the downstairs bar, where you pass through curtains of gauze into a world of your own. I wonder how those creamy white luxuroious sofa pillows will look after red wine is spilled on them a few times, but for now they look inviting. Whether or not Spice Market deserves the three stars the Times awarded, as eye candy it amazes.Many other restaurants caught our eye, but we were struck by the friendly reception we received at Vento (intersection of 9th Ave and 14th St), which doesn't even open to the public until April 19th. The staff are just practicing for now, and the tables were all set for a friends-and-family dinner. The flatiron-shaped building, dating from the Civil War, is all the decor Vento needs.

The New York Times hasn't had a full-time restaurant critic since William Grimes stepped down from the post at the end of last year. As Grimes is still with the Times, working on other assignments, you'd think the paper could have persuaded him to stay in the chair a few months longer until a permanent successor could be named, but for whatever reason that wasn't possible. Evidently Grimes couldn't take eating out 10-12 times a week (and the rumored $150k+ expense account that goes with it) for a day longer. Marian Burros filled in for a while, and for the last couple of months it has been Amanda Hesser. Hesser is a fine writer, but she has made a mess of things, and no doubt the Times will heave a sigh of relief when a permanent successor to Mr. Grimes takes over.Hesser got herself in trouble with a glowing, almost fawning, 3-star review of Spice Market (403 West 13th Street at 9th Avenue), the Jean-Georges Vongerichten-Gray Kunz homage to Asian street food that's the latest rage in the trendy meatpacking district. Well, it turns out that JGV wrote a glowing jacket blurb for Hesser's book Cooking for Mr. Latte. It is safe to say that Hesser benefited enormously from such a high-profile endorsement, and her review looks like a quid pro quo.Bear in mind that, according to the Times, there are just five 4-star restaurants in New York City, and all of those are temples of French haute cuisine. A 3-star review of a place that sells \"street food\" is thus highly unusual, if not unprecedented. Coming from the Times, such a review instantly puts Spice Market at the top of the pile. To add insult to injury, Hesser failed to mention JGV's partner, Gray Kunz, and she praised the desserts while failing to credit the pastry chef. The review mentioned Mr. Vongerichten's name eleven times.The embarrassed Times says it stands by the review (how could it do otherwise?) but had to issue a correction:A restaurant review in the Dining section last Wednesday about Spice Market, on West 13th Street in Manhattan, awarded it three stars. The writer was Amanda Hesser, The Times's interim restaurant critic. Last May, before her assignment to that post, Ms. Hesser published a book, \"Cooking for Mr. Latte,\" that was praised in a jacket blurb by the restaurateur Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who later opened Spice Market. He wrote: \"Amanda Hesser's charming personality shines as the reader experiences the life and loves of a New York City gourmet. `Cooking for Mr. Latte' is perfectly seasoned with sensuality and superb recipes.\" The review should have disclosed that background.Reviews of Spice Market have been mixed, which only adds to the perception--whether justified or not--that Ms. Hesser had no business awarding it three stars. (Although Hesser's lack of disclosure may raise eyebrows, the rating is defensible. Andrea Strong praises Spice Market just as highly as Ms. Hesser did, sans conflict-of-interest. So does Hal Rubenstein in the April 19th issue of New York.)Hesser's problems didn't start or end there. On February 24, she reviewed Asiate, awarding just one star. Now, from all I've read Asiate is an extraordinary restaurant that isn't yet clicking on all cylinders. Nevertheless, to award just one star is practically an insult, and nothing in the review itself seemed to justify such a hard slap. She ends the review with this bon mot:There is also the view. You sit atop an urban canyon, as the sheer cliffs of Midtown drop off into the park. From this height, the traffic below seems to glide and swirl without an ounce of contention. The pressures of city life ease a little. And for that alone, I might order a glass of sake, stay for the gougères, then feign illness and steal across Columbus Circle to Jean Georges for a meal that never disappoints. Once again, a bouquet for Jean-Georges Vongerichten.When not praising her favorite restauranteur, Hesser has been stripping restaurants of stars previously won. On March 17 Montrachet was demoted from three stars to two, while today Compass got the shove from two stars to one, despite the installation of a new highly regarded chef, Katy Sparks.This passage of her Compass review showed another lapse in judgment:A renovation is planned, and I hope it includes the service, which vacillates between comically inept and smothering. One night, I asked the waiter if he could describe the venison entree. \"It's awesome!\" he said. Later, when we were having dessert, the waiter popped open a half-bottle of Bruno Paillard Champagne and began pouring. \"What did we do to deserve this?\" I asked.\"It's nothing,\" he said. \"I forgot to serve it to another table, and I didn't feel like taking it back to the bar. So here you go.\"It's pretty well known that the Times does not permit its critics to accept free food or drinks. Does Ms. Hesser really believe that the waiter was unaware whom he was serving, or the lame excuse he offered for giving her a drink she neither ordered nor paid for? Obviously the restaurant's largesse did them no good in this instance, but why did Ms. Hesser accept it, in clear contravention of her paper's stated policy?And if a \"renovation\" is planned, why review Compass now? Given that the Times cannot re-review a restaurant very often, would it not have made considerably more sense to wait until after the rehab was complete?Between keeping up with new openings, and cleaning up the mess Ms. Hesser has made in her brief tenure, the Times's new restaurant critic will have his or her hands full. (Update: The Times has now announced that Frank Bruni, presently the NYT's Rome bureau chief, will become the new restaurant critic. His first review will appear June 9th.)

Note: For a subsequent review of Thalassa, click here.In Steve Cuozzo's Menus from Hell piece in yesterday's Post, he reserved the bulk of his criticism for Megu (cited below) and Mix in New York. But he also mentioned that \"Manhattan's modern Greek seafood places make you order fish by the pound; miscalculate and you'll go broke on enough livraki to feed the whole room.\" I wondered where on earth that could be, but sure enough I wandered yesterday into Thalassa. Sure enough, its pricey entrees are listed by the pound. I didn't stay for supper, but I was sufficiently intrigued to take a tour. Now, Cuozzo's exaggerating when he says that you could order enough to feed the whole room by mistake, but he nevertheless has a point. Precisely how much Dover Sole are you getting, and how much will it set you back, when you choose that entree? Thalassa is yet another suave, chic, designed-to-the-hilt newcomer in TriBeCa. Coincidentally, two colleagues were there yesterday sharing pre-dinner drinks and munchies, and they urged me to check out the raw fish on ice, \"so fresh, they wink at you.\" I was startled when a prawn wiggled its legs. The lobster didn't seem to move, but the maitre d' assured me they're just sleeping. As the real dinner crowd hadn't arrived yet, he was only too happy to show me around the place and explain every fish on offer that day. Thalassa has been open fifteen months, but it has yet to earn a mention from the Paper of Record.Thalassa (179 Franklin Street between Greenwich and Hudson Streets, TriBeCa)

Call it the Law of Unintended Consequences. In today's Post, Steve Cuozo railed against restaurant menus that are \"less comprehensible than the federal tax code.\" As Exhibit A he cited Megu, the 13,000 sq. ft. Japanese destination in TriBeCa.Cuozo is absolutely right. But because Megu is on the way home, his non-review prompted me to stop by anyway. In a word, Wow! This place is designed to the hilt. At Nobu prices it'll have to be good, but the place is spectacular.I dropped in just to have a drink. I wound up having two, plus a couple of pieces of sushi, and that set me back about $45. However, it is not busy yet, at least not at 6:30pm on a weeknight, and the bartenders treated me like royalty. They conceded that the menu is a work in progress, and they admitted the version they showed me was half the size of what they started with.You can see what Cuozo was getting at. As he put it, \"What it lacks are such basic facts as which items are suitable for starters and which for main courses; which dishes are best shared - to say nothing of what 'mysterious vegetable' might be.\"But Megu astounds with the gorgeous modern Japanese fusion decor. To judge the food on two pieces of sushi would be unreasonable, but the menu certainly competes with the best of high-end Japonoiserie. For now, two stars.Megu (62 Thomas Street between Church Street and West Broadway, TriBeCa)

Two friends and I popped into the Brooklyn Diner last night after a concert at Carnegie Hall that ran late. The place pulls in a lot of post-concert business, as it's one of the better choices in the area for a light bite. Unfortunately, the kitchen closes at 11:30pm, and we just missed the chance to order real food. We were able to order desserts, but my diabetic friend was out of luck. Now, I accept that the Brooklyn Diner can choose to serve dinner whenever it wants, but we all found it odd to find the kitchen closed at a place that caters to late dining, in a neighborhood where one expects to be able to do so, and at an hour when business was still brisk.Brooklyn Diner (212 W. 57th St. between Sixth & Seventh Avenues, West Midtown)

Mayor Bloomberg and Interior Secretary Gale Norton have announced that the Statue of Liberty will re-open in August. Visitors have been able to go to Liberty Island, but the Statue itself has been closed since the 9/11 attacks, while it was retrofitted with enhanced security and a new emergency staircase. The cost of the renovation was covered by some $19.6 million in public money and about $7 million in private donations, with Mayor Bloomberg himself ponying up $100,000. The New York Daily News also threw in $100,000, while raising $60,000 more from its readers. There's a catch: the public will be admitted only to the Statue's 16-story pedastal. For now, and possibly forever, the steps leading up to the Statue's crown will be closed. Secretary Norton claimed that the Statue's designer \"never intended visits to the inside of Lady Liberty.\" Intended or not, the long climb was a rite of passage for visitors to NYC, although the old joke was that natives almost never did it. I myself made the climb twice, both times as a tourist. My son will evidently never have that chance. It's a cliché to say that \"the terrorists have won,\" but this time that just might be true.

New York Magazine Touts Second Avenue Subway

It has been called the world's most famous un-built subway. If the cover story in this week's New York magazine is right, construction on the Second Avenue Subway could be underway by early next year. First conceived in 1925, the \"SAS\" has suffered one delay after another. The MTA actually broke ground in 1972 and completed three short tunnel sections, but the city's near-bankruptcy stalled the project. Now, it seems, the stars are finally in alignment. Peter Kalikow, the MTA's politically well-connected chairman, has lined up support in Albany and in Washington, and most of the funds to build the first segment have already been earmarked, or will be shortly. The need for the SAS is obvious. Of Manhattan's five major north-south trunk lines, only the Lexington Avenue line is on the East side. That line is ridiculously over-crowded, a problem that will only become worse after the MTA completes East Side Access, a project that will bring Long Island Railroad trains into Grand Central Station. Some bristle at the cost (now estimated at $17 billion), but New York hasn't expanded its subway system in any significant way since 1940. Unless you believe in standing still, the SAS is the next logical step. I do have my concerns about the design. As now conceived, the SAS is two tracks between 125th St and Hanover Square. I wonder if this decision is short-sighted, as all of the other major north-south trunk lines in Manhattan are four tracks. I am also concerned about the spacing between the stations. The line starts out promising enough, with stations planned at 125th, 116th, 106th, 96th and 86th. But after that, the stations are at 72nd, 57th, and 42nd Streets, gaps of 14, 15, and 15 blocks respectively. Below 42nd Street, the gaps between stations are once again more reasonable, aside from the roughly 14 blocks between 14th St and Houston. Nothwithstanding my reservations, the SAS is a tremendous step forward for the New York City subway system.

This week's issue of Downtown Express offers a comprehensive progress report on post-9/11 rebuilding. I was especially struck by Madelyn Wils's article, \"Finding the right arts mix at the new W.T.C.\" Wils, who heads Community Board 1 and is on the board of the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, surely has an insider's view of the rebuilding process. The article talked about the cultural institutions that the LMDC has shortlisted for the cultural institution to be built at the WTC. Of the New York City Opera, she said: The New York City Opera has aggressively pursued a Downtown home. They could be a welcome addition on the site, but it is still unclear whether they physically fit. If they do, the question is would it be in lieu of other organizations that might have more direct impact on the community? The opera's programming may be successful Downtown, but how this 2,200-seat theater would be used when the opera is not in season is still unanswered. It would not be in anyone's interest to have a performing arts complex that is dark much of the year. That doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement.

A friend pointed me towards Table1.com, which offers yet another way to make your restaurant reservation online. When you reserve through Table1, you're guaranteed a discount between 20-50% off your pre-tax bill. In return, you pay Table1 a fee of $1.50 a head. It's a bargain in theory, given what it costs to eat at even a moderately-priced restaurant these days. But Table1 has a long way to go. The service has only about 20 restaurants signed up so far. I suspect the guarantee of a discount on every reservation will consign Table1 to offering us only those restaurants that are desperate. Indeed, all of those offered now are in the back water of NYC's restaurant scene. I'm sure you can have enjoyable meal at many of them, but no restaurant that's doing well will have the slightest incentive to join Table1. The site promises discounts between 20-50%, but in practice nearly all of them are at the lower end of that range. In contrast, DinnerBroker.com has a wiser idea. Rather than promising a discount on every reservation, it offers them only if you book at off-peak times. And instead of charging a fee for every reservation, it charges only if you want certain coveted time slots (although, in that case, its $10-15 fee is higher than Table1's). DinnerBroker also has a lot more restaurants to choose from (about 100), and more importantly, it actually has quite a few well-known ones. Since the discount isn't mandatory, the restuarant needn't be desperate to join DinnerBroker's network. If choice is what you want, OpenTable.com is your best bet. It has about 300 NYC restaurants signed up, which is still only a fraction of what's out there, but is far ahead of the other two services. OpenTable is the only one of the three that never charges you to make a reservation, but it also never offers a discount. It's simply a more convenient way of reserving than calling all over town. Anyhow, I'll be keeping my eye on Table1.com, but for now it's not quite ready for prime time.

Sentencing Mayhem in Dynegy Case
***AUTHOR
Marc Shepherd
***DATE
2004-03-26 12:49:00
***CONTENT
On Thursday, a Federal judge sentenced former Dynegy accountant Jamie Olis to 24 years in prison for mis-classifying a loan as recurring income. Prosecutors said that Olis and his colleagues knew their accounting was improper, and that they concocted the scheme to artificially inflate Dynegy's stock price. The sentence was one of the harshest ever handed down for a white collar crime. Most observers agree it is far too harsh. Olis had no prior criminal record. Unlike more highly publicized defendants from Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia, or Tyco, he did not commit the fraud to line his own pockets. He also wasn't a CEO, or even a CFO; he was just a mid-level executive in the accounting department. Now, I don't mean to minimize the seriousness of Olis's fraud. Olis knew that he was violating accounting rules, and he did it to mislead investors about Dynegy's true financial condition. But at 24 years, Olis's sentence was more serious than a rapist or a bank robber would face. And we're not exactly soft on rapes and robberies these days. Twenty-four years is probably, by a factor of ten, more excessive than necessary to meet the public's legitimate penological interest in deterring crime and meting out punishment. As a point of comparison, Andrew Fastow, who presided over a virtual crime wave at Enron and lined his pockets with tens of millions of dollars, is expected to be sentenced to just ten years. In the 1980s, junk bond king Michael Milken served under two years for a long-running fraud that ran into the multi-billions. I wouldn't say that Milken got off easy. He was also fined something like $500 million and banned from his profession for life. In contrast, Olis's crime seems almost petty. He caused a single $300 million loan to be wrongly booked as income. Yes, of course it was wrong, but Olis's one-time accounting trick was comparatively small beans. Is this isolated mistake, willful and fraudulent though it was, sufficient justification for locking up Olis, 38, until he is a senior citizen? (Under the Federal system, which has no parole, Olis must serve at least 85%, or 20 1/2 years, of his 24-year sentence.) Olis ran afoul of several pernicious trends over the last several decades that have turned criminal sentences into a Draconian farce. First, he had the poor judgment to reject a plea bargain. (His two fellow-conspirators pleaded guilty to reduced charges, and are expected to be sentenced to under five years apiece.) Given that the jury took only about two hours to return a verdict against Olis, this was evidently not a close case. Olis's decision to take his chances has cost him dearly. Nowadays, the difference in the consequences between a plea bargain and a jury verdict are so vast that even those who sincerely believe they are innocent are routinely advised by their lawyers to plead guilty. The risk they face is just too great. One must question the competence of Olis's representation, in that his lawyer rested without calling a single witness. Second, the Federal laws that govern white collar crime allow prosecutors to stack up the counts, so that one crime becomes half-a-dozen. Olis was convicted of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail fraud, and three counts of wire fraud. This is despite the fact that he, in fact, committed only one actual crime. Yet, Federal law allows prosecutors to charge Olis for planning the fraud (conspiracy), committing it (securities fraud), sending a letter (mail fraud), and using a phone, fax, or e-mail (wire fraud). As the old saying goes about white collar crime, it's impossible to commit just one. Prosecutors routinely play this game, expecting to bully defendants into pleading the case down to just one count. But when they don't reach a deal, the defendant finds himself facing multiple charges for what is actually just one crime. Here again, Olis would have been better off committing a murder, which is a much more serious offense, but one that doesn't offer prosecutors the opportunity to pile on. Third, Congress about twenty years ago revoked most of trial judges' traditional discretion to match sentences to offenders, transferring it instead to the U. S. Sentencing Commission, a blue-ribbon panel of bureaucrats that developed reams of mathematical sentencing formulas that judges were required to follow more-or-less robotically. Judges were allowed to deviate from the Commission's formulaic guidelines only in limited circumstances. Judicial discretion has become even more limited recently, thanks to further Congressional action that even Chief Justice William Rehnquist, not exactly known as a coddler of criminals, decried as overly harsh. Judges now routinely announce their displeasure with the sentences the Commission's formulas saddle them with, as did the judge in Olis's case. And fourth, in the wake of the Enron scandal, the Sentencing Commission tweaked its formulas to make the sentences in cases like Olis's dependent on the amount of money investors lost. The guidelines changed after Olis committed his crime, but before he was charged. Under a Constitutional loophole that the Supreme Court has endorsed, this ex post facto change is perfectly legal, because Olis's sentence was still within the range Congress had prescribed, even though no one before Olis ever would have faced it. Well, it turns out that the California Retirement System says it lost more than $100 million as a result of Olis's fraud, because it bought at the top and sold right after the story broke. This makes Olis a criminal kingpin under the Commission's guidelines, and elevates his sentence from the roughly 1-2 years he would have faced previously, to a range of 24-30 years. The judge sentenced him to the minimum the Commission's guidelines allowed. There are all kinds of pernicious evils here. Olis should reasonably have been expected to know that his accounting was improper. But he could not have known how many shares a particular investor owned, at what price they had bought, or under what conditions they would sell. He cannot have known how his fraud, if it became known, would affect the stock price. In any event, the plunge in Dynegy stock clearly was influenced by many factors well outside of Olis's control. A murderer knows that he has killed, and a robber knows that he has stolen. But the Sentencing Commission's guidelines force the judge to punish Olis for market factors that he cannot possibly have been expected to foresee. A few years back, there was a spate of highly publicized car-jackings. Congress, eager to show that it was alive to the crisis, passed a law making it a Federal offense to commit a car-jacking across state lines. The law was utterly unnecessary. Car-jacking was already a serious crime in all fifty states. No one suggested that car-jacking was going unpunished, or under-punished. It was just a publicity stunt, to demonstrate to constituents that Congress was \"doing something\" about the problem. It was, as one writer put it, therapeutic legislation, that is, legislation that doesn't solve an actual problem, but makes people feel safer. The Sentencing Commission's reaction to the Enron-era scandals was similarly therapeutic. It was meant to make the public \"feel good\" that \"something was being done\" about securities fraud. But it was utterly unnecessary, and probably an over-reaction in the heat of a highly charged political environment. Even before these revisions, Federal law treated securities fraud as a very serious offense, as it should. The latest sentencing rules have managed to turn Olis into a very sympathetic and tragic felon. He should, of course, pay a just price for his crime. But this mid-level executive who poses no future threat to anyone will be a senior citizen before he gets out of prison. His infant daughter will not know her father before she is an adult. If all of this isn't enough, Federal law allows the government to file criminal and civil charges simultaneously against the same defendant, for the same crime. Naturally, they did so against Olis. The civil case is punitive in all but name only, flagrantly violating the Constitution's double jeopardy clause. For some reason, the Supreme Court has fallen for this trick. It allows the government to go after Olis twice for the same offense, but because it's branded a civil case, the burden of proof is much lower. So while Olis spends a majority of the rest of his life in prison, his legal troubles are far from over. To the extent his fraud produced ill-gotten gains, there's little he can do to enjoy them in the slammer. The brunt of the feds' pursuit will fall disproportionately on his innocent family. It's an outcome that would make you happy if you're the sort who rooted for Inspector Javert in Les Miserables.

West Side Stadium Plan to be Unveiled

***CONTENT
The NYT reports that the New York Jets, Governor Pataki, and Mayor Bloomberg will unveil plans tomorrow to build a new stadium for the Jets on the far West Side of Manhattan. The stadium would be sited between 11th & 12th Avenues, and between 30th and 34th Streets, over the MTA rail yards. There has been no professional football in Manhattan since the New York Titans lost to Buffalo on December 14, 1963, at the Polo Grounds. The Titans (later renamed the Jets) moved to Shea Stadium the following season, and to the Meadowlands home they now share with the Giants in 1984. The Jets' lease expires in 2008, and construction would need to get underway promptly if they're to have any hope of moving by then. The stadium is also critical to the city's long-shot bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. The IOC is to choose a host city by next summer, and New York wants to demonstrate that promised infrastructure is already well underway. Recent troubles in Athens, which is struggling to complete construction for the 2004 Summer Games, will probably make the IOC skittish about vaporware subway lines and stadiums that exist only on paper. Yet, the Bloomberg Administration needs to be careful not to couch these projects as solely an Olympics play, because a majority of New Yorkers don't seem to want the games. The City thinks its West Side projects will more than pay for themselves in increased property tax revenues, even if, as most observers expect, the 2012 Olympics go elsewhere. (The IOC has already awarded the 2010 Winter Games to Vancouver, and generally the IOC voters don't award consecutive Games to the same continent.) The far West Side (8th to 11th avenues, 27th to 42nd Streets) is the last great urban renewal opportunity in midtown. The Jacob Javits Center was supposed to herald the area's rebirth when it was built in the 1980s, but it never happened. That's partly because the Javits is too small to host many larger conventions (it is only the 18th largest convention center in the U.S.), and partly because the West Side is not easily reachable by mass transit. Today, the Javits stands alone, surrounded by tenement housing, derelict space, and the MTA rail yards. The gorgeous watercolor rendering on the NYT site shows a West Side reborn. A new 75,00-seat stadium with a retractable roof would be built over a deck covering the MTA rail yards. The Javits would be extended two blocks north, to 40th Street. New hotels, office towers, restaurants, and park space would transform what is now Manhattan's least desirable neighborhood south of Central park. The Javits extension is a no-brainer; virtually no one opposes it. There are dozens of conventions every year that New York can't even bid for, because the Javits is outgunned by larger convention centers in other cities. For New York to lack a competitive convention center is simply unacceptable. The Jets stadium, however, is more controversial. America has been on a stadium-building orgy for the last twenty-five years, much of it with public money. Many studies question whether the investment is worth it, particularly for pro football stadiums, which are used for only ten dates a year. Anticipating criticism, the City describes it as a multi-use facility, which could host rock concerts, conventions, and big-ticket sporting events like the Super Bowl and the Final Four. (Of course, the City already has Madison Square Garden, which can host many of these events now, although obviously not a Super Bowl.) The other problem is traffic. The City believes that most Jets patrons would reach the stadium by mass transit, but not everyone is convinced. Given that most people use their cars to reach the Meadowlands today, the skepticism is amply justified. Expect the environmental impact statement to receive plenty of scrutiny. To give the Jets credit, they are offering to put in $800 million of their own money. In this respect, the Jets stand apart from the mine run of sports team owners that have threatened to take their teams elsewhere unless lavish stadiums were built for them. Still, the project (including the Javits extension) will require about $2.0 billion in public money, which the state and the city will need to raise from various sources, not all of which have been identified. As I've mentioned previously, the city intends to fund the project, in part, through a device known as tax increment financing. The basic idea is that the city borrows the money and pays it back through increased property tax revenues later on. Although the technique has worked in other communities, it has never been attempted on anything remotely approaching the scale required here. I remain intrigued by the West Side development project, but agnostic on whether the numbers add up. I am also concerned about whether office towers on the Far West Side would impair Lower Manhattan's rebirth as a competitive as a business district. Stay tuned.

Virgin Atlantic's New Lounge at JFK

Virgin Atlantic recently moved from Terminal 1 to Terminal 4 at JFK. With the move comes a new lounge for Upper Class passengers. (Upper Class is Virgin's business class; Virgin does not have a first class.) Virgin's lounges have always exceeded the competition by a wide margin. Just as at Terminal 1, the new lounge has a fully-stocked open bar, abundant comfortable seating, and a restaurant menu that beats eating on the plane. The new lounge screams \"product placement.\" Advertising for Bombay Sapphire gin adorns the bar, and the featured drink is something called a \"Sapphire.\" In the business center, the Internet PCs are iMacs rather than Windows machines. Virgin must have gotten a sweetheart deal from Apple, since Macs are invariably more expensive at retail. Business travelers, most of whom are likely to be more familiar with the Windows interface, probably won't think that Virgin has done them any favor. At the moment, I can't fathom what Virgin was thinking. The new lounge is just fine, but so was the old one. Indeed, the old lounge may have been a tad more spacious. What upside did they see? I rode over to London in Virgin's Upper Class Suite the brand name for Virgin's flat beds, which are the roomiest in any business class. It's the third time I've been in \"the Suite,\" and it continues to amaze. However, on an ominous note, my seat's electronic retractable table was on the fritz, and the aircraft I was on is only four months old. The crew were able to fix it, but the hardware shouldn't be falling apart so soon. The cabin crew hand-delivered a letter from Sir Richard Branson, in which the Virgin Chairman concedes that the service still needs a bit of tweaking. Only a few planes in the fleet are Suite-equipped as yet, so there shouldn't be too much retrofitting required.

Debate Rages on Downtown Rail Link Funding

***CONTENT
Articles over the weekend in both The New York Times and Downtown Express (here and here) discussed the prickly subject of how to pay for a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Queens, which could bring a faster transit connection to JFK airport and LIRR riders. Downtown business interests describe the rail link as essential, but residents and workers have given the idea a tepid response. The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation has slightly less than $1.2bn of its post-9/11 funding left. LMDC officials are cagey on their intentions, but evidently the Act of Congress that appropriated the money would permit the LMDC to shoot the wad on just one project, if that's what the LMDC board decides. I'm a supporter of the JFK-LIRR-downtown project, which could indeed transform Lower Manhattan, but we need to find some other way to pay for it. Even if LMDC puts all its eggs in this basket, it won't even come close to fully paying for the project. (Well, it would if you believe the low-end estimates of $2.0bn, but I don't think it can be done for under $4.0bn.) The LMDC has done a good job so far allocating its resources to smaller initiatives: a Chinatown study here, a housing grant there. Throwing all its weight behind one rail link that, even in the best of scenarios, won't see service for another decade, would be the wrong way to go. Meantime, the MTA is to tell us sometime in April which of four design options for the rail link will be chosen for further development. Expect plenty of controversy, no matter which way the decision goes. I think this project is less than 50-50 to actually get built.

The Eos Orchestra continued its traversal of the Ring Cycle, compressed and adapted for chamber orchestra, in an arrangement originally developed in the 1980s by Jonathan Dove and Graham Vick for the City of Birmingham Touring Opera. The production was given at NYU's Skirball Center, on the south side of Washington Square Park--a considerable improvement over the cramped Ethical Culture Auditorium, where the same team's Rhinegold was given two years ago. Director Christopher Alden set the entire opera in a sparsely-furnished kitchen, emphasizing the domestic conflicts that pervade the story. The reduced orchestration brought Wagner into the compass of singers (all of them superb actors) who would otherwise never attempt it. Led by Sanford Sylvan (Wotan) and Linda Pavelka (Fricka), the ensemble cast delivered an interpretation that was at once shocking, yet beneath its surface respectful of the story's emotional core. The abridgement took the opera down to three hours with a single 20-minute intermission, meaning that about 75 minutes of music was lost. I don't mind cutting Wagner, which even the haughty Met used to do in times past (admittedly not to this degree). Generally, Dove's cuts are seamless. But the the two-act structure compels the loss of the great musical climaxes with which Wagner ended the original Acts I and II, and a new musical climax is \"invented\" where Wagner never intended one, to take us to the evening's lone intermission. Dove's arrangement for an orchestra of eighteen players works better than one would think. Most of the time I was lost in the drama, and not really conscious that 80% of the instruments Wagner wrote for were missing. But at times the loss was glaring. The Ride of the Valkyries sounded tinny, as did the Magic Fire music that ends the opera. The fault seemed to be with the upper strings--just two violins and one viola--which didn't always play together, and just couldn't produce enough sound. (Dove's scalpel didn't fall equally on all instruments. He writes for two horns, which is 1/4th of the eight that Wagner used. The two cellos are 1/6th of Wagner's complement, and the one double bass is 1/8th. But the lone viola is 1/12th of a full Wagner orchestra, and the two violins just 1/16th. I think the sound would be about a hundred times better if the upper strings were doubled.) Conductor Jonathan Sheffer deserves all the praise he can get for bringing this production to life. There was a significant claque of boo-ers when he appeared for his bow, which I did not understand. Let us hope that Siegfried and Twilight of the Gods won't be far behind!

Last night was the second performance of the new production of Salome at the Metropolitan Opera. As widely reported, soprano Karita Mattila bares all in the Dance of the Seven Veils, but if you blink you'll miss it: she's au naturel for just a second. Vocally, Mattila doesn't quite have all the chops for this role. Still, it's a courageous total performance, by an artist at the top of her game. I didn't mind the idea of an updated production, but the set design just didn't work for me. Jochanaan's cistern was crammed into a small space downstage left-center. Although there was plenty of open and little-used space elsewhere on the Met's cavernous stage, too much of the action seemed handcuffed by the bulky, ugly scaffolding that surrounded the cistern.

#7 Train Extension in Doubt

***CONTENT
The New York Times reports that state and MTA officials are unenthusiastic about extending the #7 subway line from its current terminus at Times Square, to the Jacob Javits Center at 34th St & 11th Ave. The state and the MTA believe that East Side Access (which will bring LIRR trains into Grand Central) and the Second Avenue Subway are more urgent transit priorities. Mayor Bloomberg and Deputy Mayor Daniel Doctoroff believe that the #7 extension is essential to long-term commercial growth on Manhattan's West Side. The city's bid for the 2012 Olympics also assumes that the train will be there. But the Olympic bid has always been a long-shot, and the New York Jets, who want to build a stadium over the MTA's west side rail yards, say they don't need the subway. The city has offered to pay the #7 extension's $1.8 billion cost out of its own coffers. The theory is that the train will bring commercial development, which will bring higher property tax revenues, which will allow the city to pay off the bonds used to finance the project. But it would be unprecedented to promise future tax revenues to fund a transit project on this scale. My own view is that the MTA has enough big-ticket projects on its plate, and I have yet to see a compelling case for letting this one go forward. Let's see how the West Side evolves before betting the ranch on future tax revenues that might not materialize.

Why blog? Everyone blogs, or perhaps it only seems that way. On the Internet, to blog is to be. I had to have a blog. What to talk about? This blog is about my passion for New York City ... its restaurants, its neighborhoods, its transit system, its theatre, its opera companies, its museums. Along the way, I'll probably editorialize about politics, law, travel, and other topics that interest me. After all, it's the Supreme Blogger's Right to follow fancy's whim, and write as one pleases. Yet, I do hesitate. Blogging seems so hopelessly self-indulgent. The Internet is full of blogs read by no one, serving no purpose but to satisfy the blogger's desire to see himself talk. But I decided to give it a try anyway. Whether anyone's reading is beside the point ... but hopefully somebody will be.
