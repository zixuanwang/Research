When I started this blog in 2007, I saw it as a semi-public place for me to practice writing. I never expected any of my friends to read it regularly, and I certainly didn't expect any strangers to find it. I'm really grateful and amazed that I had any readers. Ah, the wonders of the Internet!So I hope you'll continue to read me at the blog's new location at www.oneforkonespoon.wordpress.com. I'll be blogging about a new project, a Korean cookbook that I'm working on with my friend Diane Choo. The book will be published by East Rock Publishing, a new publisher focusing on East Asian culture, sometime in 2010. I'm really excited about it, and especially about our upcoming research trip to Korea. Regional specialties, learning from master housewives, it's my dream come true!

This is my last post about Argentina. It's been over a month since I got back, but I still think about it all the time--the things I saw, the people I met, and of course the food I ate. So after the mildly snide comments I've made about Argentine food, it seems fair and right to write my last post about a delicious Argentine meal we ate that was not steak.Café San Juan in San Telmo wants you to feel comfortable and cozy. There are no menus, just substantial blackboards that the servers will prop up on your table. One is devoted to tapas, the other to main dishes like rabbit and lamb chops. (I love lamb chops but I love them even more when they're called \"chuletitas de cordero.\") The kitchen is open, but not in the flamboyant way you see in the U.S., since it's small and just pushed off to the side. It almost feels more like the restaurant just didn't want to separate the chefs from the dining room and vice versa. The décor in general is quiet and unassuming, clean but a little bare. The warmth of the room comes completely from the food and the happy people eating it.We ordered two tapas and two entrees. The waiter seemed a little surprised, and when the food arrived, we realized why. The portions were huge, so that even before we started eating, we could see we were clearly in the New World. We Americans, North and South, love our food big!But I can't complain that the roast pork tapas were too big. I loved every bite I had, both my piece and the half I got from my friend. Thick slices of roast pork were layered on a piece of good, crusty bread, with more than just a drizzle of a green cilantro sauce. The gazpacho was served in its own shot glass, but there was nothing precious about the presentation. I made a mess on the tablecloth pouring the gazpacho over my share. I didn't care.Likewise, the olives were speared onto equally thick and generous slices of cheese. Simple, delicious, and totally satisfying. The rabbit was also very generous--it looked like the entire rabbit was on our plate. Though there was nothing wrong with it, we agreed there was something about the uniformly rich and braised flavor that didn't really suit our palates.But what impressed me the most was the beautiful canelones de mollejas, or cannelloni stuffed with sweetbreads. They were monstrous tubes of pasta, reminding me again of how the New World super-sizes everything from the Old World, but I wanted as much of it as I could get. The sweetbreads had been mixed with a wonderful ricotta, and the pasta itself defied all my expectations with its firm al dente resistance. The tomato sauce was incredibly rich, obviously full of some kind of fat, but it still added the tartness and brightness necessary to make the dish unstoppable. I don't know if sweetbread cannelloni is particularly Italian, but it felt very beefy and Argentine.My friend, who had found other Argentine desserts impossibly sweet, loved our dessert. It was just a sweet little rice pudding with an icy mango sorbet and some very jaunty tuiles.The Guía Oleo, an Argentine online food guide, describes the food at Café San Juan as \"porteño,\" the Argentine word to describe the people who live in Buenos Aires, even though I'd heard it described on Chowhound as Spanish. Now that I've been there, I think the Guía is right. This is true porteño food.

\"Voulez\" in French means, \"You want.\" When you arrive at Voulez Bar, a French bistro and cafe in Buenos Aires, it's pretty clear, yes, you do want. It's not just that you might be tired of steak and excited to eat a little quiche/tarta with some fresh greens dressed in a very French way. Of course, the space is beautiful, with large windows that let in the kind of light that makes the most lowly glass of white wine gleam and glimmer. It is obviously popular, despite being a little expensive by porteño standards, filled with ladies lunching, businessmen dining, and a trio of Americans who seemed more like expats than tourists judging by their self-satisfied conversation. (I would be self-satisfied, too, if I managed to figure out a way to live there.) It's just the magic that's always in the best cafes. It's that perfect low-level buzz of noise that comes from the echo of voices and clinking silverware, and the feeling that you can sit as long as you want looking out the window. You can be alone but have conversations surround you. And the quiche there really is very good.

Chinese food, and the possibilities of life in Buenos Aires

For me, love comes with familiarity. So it was only in my second week in Buenos Aires, and my third week in Argentina, that I really began to love the city. I knew at least a few of the major bus routes leaving off of Avenida Santa Fe. I could carry a vague map of the city in my head. I had my favorite café, where I could drink a café cortado and eat medialunas all day and even plug my laptop into an outlet. (New Yorkers love Buenos Aires because it shows them life in a big city doesn't have to be quite so hard.)But what really moved me to love Buenos Aires, and to be able to imagine living there for more than a week or two, was the discovery of great Chinese food. Yes, Buenos Aires has great Chinese food. Great Chinese food is a good thing, wherever you are, but it's particularly noteworthy when you're in a country where the culinary standard seems to be a serious aversion to garlic, spices, and heat. (I try really hard to accept a country's food on its own terms, but a Korean girl has her limits.) Chinatown in the leafy, outer neighborhood of Belgrano turned out to be just a few blocks, but like all Chinatowns around the world, there were gold and red tchotchkes for sale and tourists and Argentines looking for exotic thrills. The kind of thrills Zizou* and I were looking for, we happily found at a place called Lai Lai, from a Chowhound tip. It was very \"Chinese,\" to be sure--red lanterns, red walls, red light. There were postcards of Taiwan lined up in right above the tables all around the room, that made me wonder what the owners longed for, especially when Zizou, whose family is from Taiwan, told me the staff were speaking Mandarin with a Beijing accent. Unlike many of the restaurants we normally go to in San Francisco and New York, this restaurant could not be bare-boned. It had to prove its Chinese-ness to its non-Chinese clientele.At the same time, the menu was oddly reassuring in its Spanish translations. There was very little in the way of bird's nest soup or abalone, and the chicken, beef, and pork that was there was translated in a way that claimed, \"This is very much like this that you already know.\" Tofu was \"queso de soya\" or \"soy cheese\"; wontons were \"raviolines.\" It made me realize how flexible American culture is, that we happily learn new words for the new foods we eat, even if we might mangle their pronunciation. We say \"panna cotta,\" not \"Italian custard,\" and \"taco\" instead of \"Mexican pancake stuffed with meat.\" In the end, what we loved about the food wasn't that it was just like the mapo tofu I've had at Grand Sichuan in Chelsea, or the dumplings we've had at Koi Palace in Daly City. Everything we ate was a little unexpected, a little surprising, and all good. Our appetizer of spicy dumplings was served in a hot, oily broth, rather than the pool of chile oil we expected, but the broth was so tangy and restorative, we spooned it up.The lamb with scallions was a little tough with gristle, but the taste of the scallions was a joy, like chewing on springtime after all the vegetable-less dishes I'd eaten. The beef with Chinese broccoli had an intense flavor of star anise, but it was curious and interesting because it had a flavor that wasn't one of the three dominant flavors in Argentine food.The best part, though, was the mapo tofu. Not only was the tofu slightly firmer and more resilient than usual, it tasted of beef! Not pork! I've seen recipes for mapo tofu that call for beef, not pork, but it just seemed so appropriately Argentine to replace the most common meat in Chinese food with their beloved beef. We first were concerned it wasn't red enough, but then we realized the red light of the restaurant was hiding the amount of chiles in the sauce. It was absolutely delicious.At one point, Zizou asked me, \"Do you think this would taste as good if we were in New York or in San Francisco?\" Probably not, given that the food tasted the way I imagine manna tasted to the starving Israelites, but in a way, it didn't really matter. It was Chinese food, the Argentine way. And that is how I fell in love with Buenos Aires.*Zizou, the alias of my privacy-seeking friend and traveling buddy.

Found in a sign-in book at the Cervecería Artesanal, a restaurant in El Chaltén:Sunday 20th March 2005-Dear Mr. Bar Man,We came in this afternoon and noticed that you were really hot.............So we brought our friend back to meet you.....Only to discover that there was a different (but equally hot guy) behind the bar....From talking to you the night before we knew a bit about you so we asked the (new) guy if he was your friend and you were traveling together.........He seemed a bit confused and so did we...........until we realized that you are in fact THE SAME GUY and must have had a shave!Patagonia is magical like that.Hot guys aside, there really is something strange, wild, and magical about Patagonia. Most of it is empty of almost everything but wind. There are no bounds to what you are looking at--the sky keeps going, as does the land. And then, in the midst of all this emptiness, there are the glaciers. There is no way to describe what a glacier looks like, only what it did to me to look at them and to feel some of the strongest yearning I have ever felt for something to exist and continue existing, no matter what were to happen to me. But after gazing and hiking and yearning, you must eat. And the best place to eat in strange, wild, and magical El Chaltén is the Cervecería Artesanal, the very same restaurant in which we found this funny story. You could almost miss it from the outside, just another wood-hewn building among others, with no clear sign indicating its name. We might have walked right by it the first day, if it weren't for the hikers who looked so happy sitting outside drinking the home-brewed cold beer. When you walk in, though, you can see immediately how much the owner loves her restaurant. The walls are papered in articles and photos, from James Dean to Leo Tolstoy, and there are sturdy, good-looking cakes on the counter. The aforementioned sign-in books are scattered on the tables, and you can spend a very pleasant afternoon flipping through the happy memories of people from France and Australia and Spain while the light streams in the windows. It is always a refuge, whether it's hot or windy, and I'm sure even when it's cold. That same love and attention is obvious in the food. The salad is composed beautifully and creatively. Everything, the pears, tomatoes, celery, walnuts, blue cheese and cream, tasted clear and sure, cut and placed authoritatively in the bowl. The lamb ravioli was firm and tender at the same time; no fear of sub-par Argentine pasta here. In classic Argentine fashion, you can pair any pasta with any sauce, but I think I did well in picking the light and tangy tomato sauce.Bodegon is a good place to have a beer with some complimentary peanuts and popcorn at any time, but I highly recommend going there especially if you have camped for five days eating nothing but Knorr instant food.That is Patagonia. Yearning for something you can't even identify, and then finding happiness in a hot shower, a bowl of ravioli, and a quiet place to read funny stories.

There is no shortage of hipsters in Buenos Aires, kids in high tops with surprisingly good-looking mullets. But there is also no shortage of restaurants like El Desnivel, or Manolo, or my favorite, Nuevo Hermann, restaurants that don't seem to have changed in 50 years. It's what makes Buenos Aires feel like a rich city, rich in a diversity of lives and memories. We walked into Nuevo Hermann almost on a dare. It was just a block or two from our first apartment on Guemes in Palermo, it was our last night in Buenos Aires before we left for Patagonia, and I wanted to eat someplace that wasn't listed in any of our guidebooks, just walk in blind. I was afraid to risk not just my stomach but also that of my friend Zizou*, but I had to try it.The waiter was old and gruff. The menu was enormous. There were dishes that were vaguely German and dishes that were vaguely Spanish, and the usual gamut of Argentine meats and pastas. Milanesa, anyone? We asked him, \"What would you recommend? What is the best?\" And the answer was, \"Everything is the best.\" This was not said with much enthusiasm.But it became clear why the question was so foreign to him as we watched the restaurant fill up with regulars from the neighborhood. Elderly and middle-aged couples came in, didn't even glance at their menus, and ordered their dinners. One couple, according to Zizou, didn't even order, the waiter just brought their food. The restaurant was pristine and proud. It wasn't being retro; it wasn't even aware its time had passed. So how was the food? Zizou's pork chop was overcooked but still strong in flavor. But I was really scared when my Vienna sausage and ensalada rusa came out. I knew that my ensalada rusa, a classic Spanish tapa, would be full of mayonnaise and not in a good way, but I felt this perverse desire to order it. The sausage looked like my worst nightmares, so pink and clean and consistent. But it was delicious. The smoothness of its texture didn't mean that it was lacking in character. And even the ensalada rusa was comforting and satisfying, because it was exactly as I had expected it to be.That's why everyone else was there, to get food exactly as they expected it. To be so sure of having one's expectations met--that's a beautiful thing, isn't it?*Zizou, aka my friend and traveling companion, not Zinedine Zidane.

Scannapieco at Avenida Cordoba 4826. Flavors like Crema Armenia, a boozy fig and anise, and limoncello, as light and refreshing as anything called \"limoncello\" should be. It's true, most Argentine gelato is too sweet, but it's hard to fault a city where ice cream gets delivered by bicycle.

There were moments in Buenos Aires when I thought, \"Thank God, I chose to study Spanish in Mexico.\" These were not the moments when I was dancing till 4 a.m. or eating luscious steaks for criminal prices. I missed small-town Oaxaca the most when I sat staring at my \"ensalada caprese,\" a sorry mass of tasteless arugula, hunks of \"mozzarella\" or pizza cheese, and the saddest, blandest tomatoes to ever bear the name. To be fair, I was at an all-night eatery, as Zizou* and I had few choices after getting back to BA late at night. But Argentine traditional cooking just can't compare to the zingy surprise of a street emapanada de mole amarillo or the complex curiosity of mole negro.When there wasn't steak, there were Argentine empanadas, and as Zizou found, most empanadas were a doughy excuse to carry some meat around in an easy way. When she complained the dough was utterly forgettable, we imagined gauchos carrying them cold in their saddlebags, caring little for texture or flavor. This is where La Cupertina came in, to make us more gracious towards our host country. Located in Palermo Soho, and specializing in food from the province of Tucuman, La Cupertina is a very pretty place--heart cut-outs in the wooden chairs, green plants spilling over an antique stove. The owner, whose fame is apparent in the framed articles on one discrete wall, clearly cares a lot about what she is doing. I love people who care, and I loved her food as much as I'd hoped as we sat waiting in the sunny dining room.The empanadas were baked, the ham and cheese empanadas with sugar. The tamal, more meat than masa, was moist and so good we ordered another one after finishing the first. The locro, though, was my favorite. A traditional stew of whole corn kernels with white beans, beef, and sausage, there was an intensity and range of flavor that I'd been missing while chewing the excellent Argentine beef.Their desserts, too, are beautiful to behold, and although they were as sweet as all Argentine desserts, they weren't so singular in their sweetness. (But to be totally honest, the best empanadas we had the entire time we were there were from El Mazacote, the corner pizzeria in Montserrat. Flaky, buttery, revelatory--Zizou felt vindicated--\"I told you the dough could be flaky!\")* aka, my non-\"French soccer star\" friend and traveling companion.

Most people who love to travel are running away from something. I know this because that's why I travel. That can be bad, when you're avoiding persistent problems in your life, but it can also be good, when you ignore your preferences from back home and learn to accept things on their own terms. In short, Argentinian pizza is quite good if you accept it for what it is. Not New York pizza. Not Neopolitan pizza. Not Chicago-style, nor New Haven. But Argentinian.Our first pizza experience horrified Zizou,* and she didn't even taste it. We had gone to Kentucky Pizza (what a name!) after lots of dancing to La Bomba de Tiempo at Ciudad Cultural KONEX with some new friends. I was so hungry I ate my pizza without comment or even consciousness, but Zizou could not forget it. \"It was so thick and doughy! It looked disgusting!\"She wasn't mollified when I ordered the above fugazetta, an onion-intense pizza at Bodegon, our favorite restaurant and local brewery in El Chalten. We had just come off five days of camping, where we ate nothing other than instant oatmeal, Frutigram cookies, and gummy Knorr-mix pasta. I was not going to complain about the crazy amount of cheese or the flatbread crust. It wasn't the most delicious thing I had ever eaten, but it was good enough that I ate it cold for breakfast the next day. When we got back to Buenos Aires, and I mentioned that my former boss's grandmother had invited us to have pizza, Zizou looked scared. But it was she in the end who steered us, even before we went to dinner with Nilda, to El Cuartito, one of the oldest and most famous pizzerias in Buenos Aires. The look of relief on her face when she bit into her slice! \"It's good!\" The cabresa was layered with cheese, many pieces of longaniza (essentially pepperoni), and a strongly tomato-flavored tomato sauce, which is not a redundant thing to say in Argentina. (For a country populated by Italian immigrants, they have sadly forgotten the taste of a true tomato.) The crust was crunchy, but not doughy. The famous faina, the thin chickpea flour pancakes Argentines like to eat literally on top of their pizza slice, was tasty, too. It must be a descendent of farinata, no? It wasn't like any pizza we'd ever had before, but it had everything right-cheese, bread, and sauce.El Cuartito itself is wonderful. It proudly declares that it began in 1934, thanking its customers, their parents, and their grandparents for their patronage. The walls are covered with memorabilia, except unlike TGIF, the memorabilia has age. Marilyn Monroe sits next to Diego Maradona, as well as Muhammad Ali.But the crowning moment for Argentine pizza came on our last night, at dinner with Nilda, an 84-year-old former human rights lawyer who I would call feisty if that word didn't sound so inadequate when applied to a woman like that. Sitting at her kitchen table with her pale gold hair, she watched closely as she asked us, \"What do you think of Fidel Castro?\" This is a woman who said, \"Of course I am not Communist, just in my thoughts!\" The pizza she served us, urged on by my former boss, was from the family's favorite pizzeria, El Mazacote, a neighborhood place in Montserrat on the corner of calles Chile y Jose. It was a revelation. The dough was yeasty, chewy, flavorful. The sauce and cheese were sharp with salt. We loved it, the Argentinian pizza.*Zizou, a pseudonym for my good friend who wishes to remain anonymous, and not an indication my good friend is Zinedine Zidane.

Medialunas (literally \"half moons\") are the Argentine version of the French croissant, except they are very different and very delicious at the same time. They come in three variations--de grasa, de manteca, and dulce. The first kind is my favorite, the skinniest, more of a thin crescent than a half moon. They're almost crunchy while also being flaky and more than a little salty. The second and third, I have to confess, I have a hard time distinguishing. They both flake in softer layers and have a shiny wash of sweetness. All of them are small and lovely. I had a bagel this morning in commemoration of my return to New York, but I miss my café con leche con tres medialunas.

You may have already heard my theory on how a country's junk food reveals a lot about its culture. Ta-da, here is Argentina's rendition of the Oreo: An alfajor is two cookies bound together with a filling, dulce de leche in Argentina, and then covered in a thin layer of chocolate. Like all Spanish words that start with \"al,\" it's derived from the Arabic word for \"relleno\" or \"filled,\" and entered Spain with the Moors during the time of Al-Andalus. Hmm, that would explain their extreme intense sweetness. And then there are the chocolate cookies with beef fat in them: And cows everywhere:

I don't want to sound like an ass, but you haven't lived until you've had some whiskey on ice from the glacier you're standing on. It doesn't even need to be good whiskey. It can be Famous Grouse, and it will still leave you with a weird and wonderful feeling of chilliness, warmth and delirium.Zizou* and I arrived in El Calafate in southern Patagonia bleary-eyed and dog-tired. We'd stayed up all night drinking with new friends before getting on a 5 a.m. flight, which was unfortunately dominated by a very loud and boisterous group of French tourists. Despite being half-awake, with only one eye open, I distinctly remember hearing one of them say, \"J'ai peur! J'ai peur!\" (\"I'm afraid! I'm afraid!\") as the pilot went for a second try at landing around the giant lake. I was especially surprised that I understood what he was saying, because I don't understand spoken French.But we somehow managed to haul ourselves to our hostel, America del Sur, and to book ourselves for a \"mini-trekking\" trip on the glacier the next day from Hielo y Aventura.We approached the ice by boat on water that was a milky blue from the sediment in the glacier. Marco, our guide, was waiting for us. As Zizou said, \"Good God! You get off the boat and there's a handsome Argentine waiting for you on the dock!\" There is mucho eye candy in this country, mucho.The guides tied crampons, giant metal teeth, onto our boots, and we soon marched onto the ice in groups of ten. The crampons felt fantastic--we could walk up steep slopes like we had been given Spidey powers. Our group was the \"English-speaking group,\" though it was mainly Germans and French people, which meant we got to hear Marco say in his very flat and funny way, \"Now we go hi-gher,\" with a hard \"g.\"We marched up, we marched down, in a quiet single file, too awed by what we were seeing to say much. We walked around pools of water and looked down deep blue holes. We cupped water into our mouths, and I surreptitiously crunched on ice. The glacier, as smooth as the ice looked from far away, was made up of tiny little bits of ice, so that we were walking on a path of crunchy glass shards. We were told to wear gloves, despite it being a warm day, because if we fell, we could cut our hands.There is so much more texture and color and variation in a glacier than I'd ever imagined. I had learned, from a book, that glaciers move, but nothing could have prepared me for the sense of movement beneath my feet. From the viewing balconies, the peaks had looked like giant teeth crowded and pushed against each other. Up close, there were also soft, undulating waves that reminded me of Gaudi.Near the end, we marched up one last slope and found a little tableau, like a movie set, two small tables with glasses, a bucket, and a few bottles of whiskey. We stood around, finally laughing, while Marco poured drinks and we ate alfajores, the national sandwich cookie.The whiskey tasted sweeter than any whiskey I'd had before. I could feel happiness spreading through me. It was the best drink I have ever had.*My friend has asked me to identify her as \"Zizou\" to protect her privacy. I, unfortunately, am not a traveling companion of the great Zinedine Zidane.

In all the news coverage following the election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, one small blip involved Oprah Winfrey talking on her show about the middle-aged white man she had been leaning on, literally crying on his shoulder, during the celebratory rally in Grant Park, Chicago. Everyone called her, asking, \"Who was that man?\" And she confessed she didn't know who he was, that he was simply Mr. Man. But of course, because she is Oprah, Mr. Man was soon identified as Sam Perry, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Obama campaign volunteer, and he appeared on her show.It's such a small thing, Oprah leaning on the shoulder of an unknown man while she cries listening to President Obama's speech, but the more I think about it, the more it encapsulates what I saw in this campaign.We won this together. We won, not just with friends and family we cajoled, but with complete strangers across the country. We won with Oprah, media mogul and superstar, and with my friend Mimi who had never volunteered for a campaign before. We won with Shaddai, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and with Joe, the union dry-wall finisher, who stood outside our polling site with me all day. We won with Chung, the woman my mother's age who made phone calls to Korean-American voters for hours, and if you are not impressed, it's because you don't know what it takes for a Korean person to call strangers. We won with the stream of men and women who came into Childs Elementary School in South Philly to vote, African-American mainly but also white and Vietnamese-American and Chinese-American. I had never seen any of them before in my life and will probably never see any of them again. But like Oprah, we felt a connection to each other that moved us to hug each other, cry together, and celebrate together. Even three days after the election, as I walk around my Brooklyn neighborhood, I smile at strangers and they, miraculously, smile back. Obama didn't just declare that we are one nation, we are one people. He made us feel it and know it in our hearts as well as our minds. I thought I had always loved my country and the ideals on which it was founded, but now I know, this is love.\"So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.\"

Despite all my complaints, there are several things I've enjoyed as an immigration lawyer. My clients, for the most part, have been wonderful people with stories I feel truly privileged to hear. Winning, of course, always feels great. But almost as much as winning, I've loved the opportunities I've had to eat with my clients. I've eaten Dominican food at the home of the warmest Dominican family. I've been given cooking tips by an Egyptian caterer. I've tasted a crumbly and sweet anise-scented Palestinian dessert that is such a homey item, you can't buy it in stores. This one case took over my life in the weeks leading up to the trial, but I ate very well, the Middle Eastern food that I love, culminating with the amazing strategy meal I had at Assayad Restaurant in Clifton, New Jersey.But now the hearing is finally over. There's still a written summation to write and the judge won't render a decision before September, but four days of testimony have been completed. And I am no longer a lawyer. It may not be the last case I work on, but it is for the foreseeable future. So it seems like a good time to end this blog as well, for the few of you who were still expecting something new to be posted. I'm hoping to have other opportunities to write now, including working on a book on regional Korean food with a good friend of mine. But thank you to everyone who faithfully or even sporadically checked in. It was nice to have an audience!

Since I got back from my travels, I've been drawn to simpler meals and simpler flavors. Partly, it's because working two part-time jobs is exhausting. But mostly, it's because the trendy American obsession with food--and my obsession with food--has gotten a little exhausting as well. One of the things I loved most about eating in Mexico, Spain, and Korea, was how good food felt very easy. I didn't have to search for it, I didn't have to pay a lot for it, and most of the time, it came from a stand or restaurant that specialized in one thing. More and more, I want to feel that way about the food I cook and eat. I'm still drawn to recipes for Georgian chicken broiled with yogurt or Tunisian chickpea stew, things I can only cook with a carefully drawn out grocery list and a propped-open cookbook, but I'm not making three-course meals for myself these days. My favorite food memories are small and singular, one dish or sometimes even one new, bright fruit, and it feels good to be building new memories that way at home. So in that spirit, I've been cooking things like pasta in tuna-tomato sauce, or squid sauteed with bitter greens and a splash of soy sauce and lemon juice. And when I'm feeling up for a challenge, like a Rick Bayless fish enchilada recipe, I'm happy not to take on a salad, rice, and a roasted meat at the same time. That way, I can reserve energy to make my own tortillas.I can't say that I've mastered them, as easy as they are supposed to be with masa harina, the instant tortilla flour. (You can't make truly authentic tortillas at home without fresh masa dough, and because fresh masa dough goes bad so quickly, you can only get fresh masa dough in the U.S. by living next to a tortilla factory.) But they were better than the last time I tried, more flexible and less doughy in my throat. Making tortillas is almost therapeutic, to roll each ball of dough, flatten it in the tortilla press the way I'd seen women do all over the streets of Oaxaca, and toss it on a cast-iron griddle. The filling was a bit more work. There was the tomatillo-serrano sauce, made by first broiling 12 ounces of tomatillos and 2 serrano chiles under a broiler, about 5 minutes on each side. The tomatillos and chiles then melded in a food processor. In the meantime, I sauteed half a diced white onion until rich and brown, stirred in 2 chopped cloves of garlic, and when that had just cooked a minute more, the onions and garlic got added to the tomatillo-chile mixture and pureed until smooth. The whole sauce had to be transferred to a skillet to be fried, its flavor getting deeper with a bit of fish broth. Then there was the half a pound of sea bass I bought to poach. I ignored the potatoes in the recipe and focused on the fish, flaking it and then mixing it with half a cup of the tomatillo sauce. Finally, following Bayless's recipe, I added a bit of thick Greek yogurt to the remaining tomatillo sauce, since I couldn't find any creme fraiche or sour cream at the corner bodega. The assembly was the easiest part: spoon some fish on a tortilla, fold it over, and then ladle on more sauce with a sprinkling of crumbled cotija cheese (my substitution for the queso anejo I didn't have) and some chopped raw onions and cilantro. I ate nothing else that night, just these enchiladas with a beer. I was very happy.

When I told my friends I was coming to San Francisco, Erin suggested that we cook a big dinner together and invite the rest of my San Francisco friends. She and her roommate, who I will continue to call \"Zizou\" out of politeness to her and fantasy for me, share a beautiful apartment with the kind of kitchen only rich New Yorkers can dream of. It's filled with light, equipped with an island and even a prep sink, and the stove has some gaseous power that I can't even grasp, something about BTUs. All I know is that it boils up water like you wouldn't believe. We started our shopping at Alemany Market, my favorite farmers' market in San Francisco. Unlike the famed and rather bourgeois Ferry Building, Alemany doesn't truck in artisanal chocolate sprinkled with grey sea salt. So there are few tourists, and instead plenty of resident yuppies, Chinese bargain-hunters, and those who really want a live chicken, which probably overlaps more with the Chinese bargain-hunters than the yuppies. While Erin and I bought meyer lemons, strawberries, asparagus, and lilacs, Zizou took it upon herself to buy a few dozen Kumamoto oysters. She doesn't cook, but she sure knows how to eat.The rest of the meal we picked up here and there, from the prosciutto I bought at the Cafe Rouge meat counter (not so exciting) to the walnut bread Lika picked up from Tartine (unbelievable, made me feel slightly less annoyed at Tartine). And Diane brought the wine from Sonoma. She had called me the night before, telling me she was packing and wanting to know what I was serving for dinner. I momentarily forgot she makes wine for a living and asked, \"Does the food you're going to eat affect what you're going to wear?But what really amazed me is how relaxed I was planning and cooking the dinner. Partly it was that Erin was there. I don't normally cook well with others, but I trust her cooking judgment, especially when it comes to risotto. It's nice working with someone when you don't have to worry that she'll \"dice\" carrots into uneven chunks. And partly it was that after we baked our anise-almond biscotti, we took off to go eat sausages at Rosamunde's and then went for a walk at Crissy Field, where it was unusually sunny and characteristically gorgeous. I've never done that before, go somewhere in the middle of cooking an elaborate dinner for anything other than a missing ingredient. So when we ended up being late getting home, and Anne had to stir the citrus risotto for another hour after all the guests arrived, I didn't really care. I did care how good the Zuni pistachio \"aillade\" was on the roasted asparagus, which required Lika to pound away at 2 ounces of pistachios for a good 20 minutes, pulverizing them to a dust that I could bind up with a couple of tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a mashed garlic clove, a splash of grappa, orange zest and salt and pepper. If you have a friend with a powerful arm, I can't recommend this enough. The flavors blend together as you let it sit, and it's so much more complex and delicious than you could have imagined. We were torturing Elena, who's allergic to raw nuts, with our oohing and ahhing. The citrus risotto, also a Zuni recipe involving sections of grapefruit and lime, was also surprising and tasty, the tartness cutting the usual heft of risotto in my stomach. It eased the pain when it turned out the scallops were pretty low-grade.But I think the star of the show was the meyer lemon ice cream we served with anise-almond biscotti and early strawberries. Happy birthday to me!

My friend Lina asked me recently if I'd gotten tired of my blog. I protested that I hadn't, but I think I had, just a bit. But I recently spent a long weekend in San Francisco and got reinspired. I didn't have any culinary epiphanies, despite the city's reputation. In fact, I got seriously annoyed that my favorite bakery, Tartine, is no longer a place to have a quiet breakfast with a paper on a weekday morning. I think it was having an intense, packed weekend of opportunities to share good food with people I love, who I hadn't seen in so long. One of those friends even ended up taking me on an all-afternoon eating tour of the East Bay.\"Zizou\" (as she prefers to remain anonymous) did preliminary research, and as you can see, provided a full write-up as well. So I'm not going to repeat everything she said, just highlight my most lasting memories.1) We went to eleven places!2) We only ate at eight. The remaining three, we picked up food to eat later. 3) Zizou packed a cooler for stop #3, the meat counter at Café Rouge. She always carries a cooler, \"just in case.\"4) I had ice cream that rivaled Il Laboratorio del Gelato and I do not say that lightly. The Catalan flavor at Ici, started by the pastry chef from Chez Panisse, was so good, I didn't want it to end. It had a curious flavor that I didn't recognize immediately, a mixture of anise, lemon, and something else that made it special and absolutely inimitable. I ordered it in a cup, to which Zizou said, \"What! You want the cone. She'll take the cone,\" turning to the laughing ice cream scooper. She was right. The hand-rolled cone had a nugget of chocolate at the bottom.5) Vik's Chaat is as good as I'd hoped all that time I lived in San Francisco and never went there. I especially loved the chapati that came with the hyderabadi fish special--simple, flavorful, chewy, everything a flatbread should be.6) Tao Yuen in Oakland's Chinatown had crispy, not at all greasy, tofu skin rolls that I would never have believed could come out of a take-out dim sum place. I think they were 50 cents or something equally obscene.7) We found at the Cheeseboard a bigger, pizza-only place next door to the cheese shop, with an elderly musical trio performing and young, happy Californians spilling out of the restaurant and just sitting on the grassy median in the middle of the busy two-way street. Pizza as excellent as ever. I love San Francisco when it just does its own thing and doesn't worry whether its pizza crust lives up to some NY/New Haven ideal.8) Taco trucks are the best, always.I did eat dinner afterwards. I told Anne I had to eat vegetables, and she, former Midwestern carnivore, suggested we go to Greens, where I had a very simple and refreshing salad of greens, celery root, cheese, and butter beans. I was embarrassed that the waiter might think I was the kind of woman who only orders salad, but he praised my choice, saying, \"Beautiful! That's my favorite salad!\" I was in such a good mood, I only giggled quietly and was thankful for all that the Bay Area had bestowed upon me that day.

Remember when I was forced by Mexican airport security to leave my molcajete behind in Oaxaca? It's now at home with me in Brooklyn!My friend Katherine, who lives in Oaxaca and was coincidentally on the same plane as me that day, heard the whole story and decided to check if the airline had kept it when she flew back home. The airline official weirdly accused of her lying about being my friend and being on that flight, as if she had the nefarious desire to steal a Mexican mortar and pestle. But he did give it to her and this week, she emailed me to tell me she was coming to NY and did I want my molcajete! I never imagined I would ever see this little pig again. It must be a sign. I'm not sure of what, but something good, don't you think?

Tuesdays, I generally work from home, which meant that instead of obsessively reading every scrap of information coming out of the primaries in Ohio and Texas (and Rhode Island and Vermont), I tried to calm my nerves by making a very slow-cooked chickpea, celery, and porcini soup with pecorino cheese, from Paula Wolfert's \"The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen: Recipes for the Passionate Cook.\" I must be the kind of person Paula Wolfert thinks is \"passionate,\" even all by my lonesome, because I love this book.It was a very slow soup, even when I halved the following ingredients:1 cups dried chickpeas¼ t. baking sodasalt½ oz. dried porcinipinch of sugar3 imported bay leaves½ cup extra virgin olive oil1 medium onion, grated in a food processor2 garlic cloves2 cups thinly sliced celery ribs1/8 t. Italian or Greek oreganofreshly ground pepperpinch of hot pepper flakescurls of pecorino or manchego cheeseIt had to be started the night before, with the dried chickpeas soaking in water with a little bit of baking soda, and the dried porcini mushrooms soaking in its own water with a pinch of sugar in the fridge. I followed the directions very precisely.The next morning, I grated a small onion in my food processor and placed it with the chickpeas, 2 bay leaves, 3 T. of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and water to cover the chickpeas by an inch in my small two-quart dutch oven. Paula Wolfert says you're supposed to use a clay pot like the Italian peasants, though you can buy a sand pot that works just as well in Chinatown. I figured a French-made Staub was good enough.This part was freaky--I put it in a cold oven, cranked the heat to 450 degrees, and then let it sit for 30 minutes. Then I turned it down to 250 degrees and let it cook for three hours. Yes, three hours.When the three hours had almost expired, I heated a garlic clove in a pan of hot olive oil for a little bit, then tossed in the celery and oregano for about 2 minutes. I added the drained, chopped porcini mushrooms with the soaking liquid, then the chickpeas and its cooking liquid, and a little more water. I also added a cup of homemade chicken stock, even if the recipe didn't call for it. It bubbled away on medium heat for 20 more minutes. How easy is that?And then it was done. Just a good amount of salt, generous amounts of freshly ground pepper, a pinch of hot pepper flakes, and curls of pecorino cheese.The soup was wonderful. It was warming and satisfying, so much more than you would imagine chickpeas, celery, and mushrooms to be. The chickpeas had an honest texture you never get in canned beans, the mushroom flavor was silky smooth, and the cheese added an intense salty sharpness. I loved it. I love even more that like so many Paula Wolfert recipes, it comes from peasants who can't be bothered by complicated steps, resulting in directions so simple I could more or less recite them to you by heart.So there was one bright spot that Tuesday.

Have you ever followed a recipe that didn't make any sense?I like to think that even if I am not quite a great cook, I do increasingly have a good sense of what it takes to make something bind together, to be fluffy, to rise. In short, to taste good. So I was perplexed when I saw this ridiculously simple recipe from Patricia Wells's, \"Bistro Cooking\":Tourte Aux Blettes (Savory Swiss Chard Tart) (paraphrased)Pastry:1 cup flour¼ t. salt¼ cup extra-virgin olive oilFilling:1 lb. swiss chard leavesSalt and freshly ground pepper3 large eggs1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.2. Combine flour and salt; add 1/4 cup water and then the oil, mixing until thoroughly blended. After kneading briefly, the dough will be very moist like cookie dough. Press dough into loose-bottomed metal tart tin.3. Wash and dry the leafy portion of the chard and coarsely chop the leaves. Wilt the leaves in a skillet, seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. Heat until most of the water has evaporated.4. Combine the eggs and grated cheese; add the chard and pour mixture into the pan.5. Bake for about 40 minutes, until crust and filling are golden.Perplexed, yet intrigued. I thought all pastry crusts had to made with butter and rapidly, to keep the butter cold and the pastry flaky. As I pressed the crumbly olive oil-colored dough into my springform pan (no tart pan), I thought, thank God I'm only making this for myself. Then the three eggs seemed so meager, just barely swimming around the cooked chard. How could it be so easy to make a tart?It turns out I know nothing about the physics of cooking, because the recipe worked just fine. In fact, it was quite good and as easy as it appears, and the kind of recipe you can follow after coming home after work with only a vague desire to cook that bunch of swiss chard in your fridge, though you do have to be prepared to eat your sliver of a tourte at 9:15 pm. (And that is easy enough if you have only recently returned from Spain, where they do not think of eating before 9 pm.) I didn't have a glass of crisp white wine as recommended by Patricia Wells, but I did have a glass of refreshing Pernod. God, I love the taste of licorice.Despite being in my pajamas, I felt almost like one of those French girls that get described as \"effortlessly chic.\"

I tried again, this time with napa cabbage instead of daikon radish. I went the easy route, cutting up the cabbage after brining it for almost 6 hours, instead of the more traditional, more beautiful way of keeping the cabbage whole, with all its nooks and crannies filled and rubbed with spicy paste. But it's still not quite what I was looking for. Last time, it was too much ginger. This time, too much salt. Sigh.

I attempted to make kimchi last year, but did not have a reliable recipe. I used daikon and regular white cabbage. As it turned out, it wasn't bad, but not great, either.One aspect in which I lack confidence is the addition of seafood products to it. I used ground, dried shrimp, from a mercado here in Mexico.Th photo of *your* kimchi looks great.

You know, I think that kimchi is like good pie crust--it just takes a sense of feel that only comes with a lot of practice. I was researching for the cookbook, and it turns out the shrimp is fermented, so I don't think dried shrimp alone would do it. Even Vietnamese fish sauce would probably be better.

Raj tried to warn me. \"A lot of the sauces all taste the same. Some of the dishes taste better the next day!\" After almost a year of trying to get to Tangra Masala for Indian-Chinese food (the Indian take on Chinese food, the way chop suey is the American take on Chinese food), Raj and I finally made it to Sunnyside, Queens last Wednesday. The friends we had invited to come along had bailed at the last minute, pleading that Queens was too much, even Raj's friends who live in Queens. I think Raj was worried that I would be disappointed, after all of the hullabaloo. He said, with great earnestness, that Tangra Masala reminded him of better food eaten elsewhere.But how could I be disappointed, when I was presented with this? True, as much as the chili paneer sizzled, it didn't make me swoon. The vegetable tangra masala turned out to be vegetable fritters in gravy, the \"lollypop chicken\" to be fried chicken drumsticks in an adorable shape, but with a batter that was a bit too bready. Everything had that yummy, salty, satisfying flavor of take-out Chinese, but with nothing that would make me take the G train to the 7 train for on a weekly basis. Maybe every couple of months or so.Still, I was so happy to be eating something I had never eaten before, within city limits even. And such video!

There is a part of me that not-so-secretly loves Martha Stewart. I get a thrill when I'm having friends over for brunch, and I see the sunlight streaming into my kitchen onto the white tablecloth with the flowers in the middle, the matching cups and saucers, and my beloved juice glasses. But in the end, this little glee is nothing compared to my deep, adamant, heartfelt conviction that none of it really matters. I may not believe in God, but I believe in breaking bread. I don't think people should be afraid to have people over because they don't have space or time or matching plates. Or even because they think they can't cook. There can be as much fun and happiness over a pot of chili as over a three-course meal starting with foie gras. Given how some of my friends feel about foie gras, probably more.So as part of my new evangelism, I made a New Year's resolution to start hosting a monthly soup night. Just soup. I would happily accept drinks or dessert contributions, and not worry about whether they \"matched\" what I had made. With the money I would have spent on an occasional three-course dinner, I could have more people over more often, and even buy a couple of extra bowls. And since it was a New Year's resolution, I kicked it off with Korean dumpling soup for Lunar New Year.Some people ate in shallow soup bowls, some ate in giant salad bowls, and some with teaspoons, but nobody cared. I was so happy. The dumplings could have used more salt and soy sauce, but hey, that's why you put salt on the table, right? I'm so excited about March and April and May...

That's not quite accurate, as they're still saying hello, over and over, to pancetta and bacon and sausages braised with plums. They've just recently decided that considering the environmental impact of meat, they will stop eating big, giant chunks of meat. But being who they are, they are saying goodbye with a bang. They said goodbye to beef in December with 20 lbs. of spareribs. And they said goodbye to pork this weekend with an almost 9-lb piece of pork butt. When I told Lina I was coming to visit her this weekend in Providence, she immediately responded, \"What do you want to do? Do you want to smoke a pork butt?\" I love Lina. I told her I wanted to leave around 3 pm on Sunday and she said, \"No problem, we'll just get a small, 6-lb. butt and smoke it starting Sunday morning, have a late lunch, and put you on the bus.\" But then we got to the store, and Ookie couldn't resist buying a 8.75-lb. pork butt: \"It's on sale!\" He brushed the logistical problems off, saying, \"We'll just smoke it overnight!\"He seemed so excited, I didn't make my usual protestations as a houseguest who doesn't want to make too much trouble. This is a guy who lives in a house with no walls, as they're still renovating it, but owns a 100-lb. gorgeous smoker/grill. Lina and I went off to Boston Saturday night to see our friend Leslie, and as I hesitated over my second drink, wondering if I would be sober enough to rub the butt when we got home, Lina assured me, \"You're worried about the pork? The butt is rubbed!\" And true enough, when we got home, the butt was thoroughly rubbed with paprika, cayenne, cumin, and garlic powder; there was a sauce pan of homemade barbecue sauce on the stove; and a bowl of vinegar-based \"North Carolina\"-style sauce for basting on the counter. I hope one day, like Lina, to marry a man I can trust to rub the butt while I'm out having drinks with my girlfriends. The next morning, Lina told me that Ookie had gotten up at 5 a.m. to add more coal to the grill. I was so moved. By the time we woke up around 10:30, the fire had gone out, but we just reheated the pork while we roasted some brussel sprouts, made corn muffins (to make it seem more like breakfast), and tossed a green salad. The pork butt was beautiful. It had a serious crust, excitingly spicy, with tender, fatty pink meat inside. I don't think I've ever had a butt quite like that, not from Daisy Mae's, not in Nashville. It was the most beautiful butt I had ever seen. I couldn't believe how well-behaved their dog was, just lying there next to the table. If I were a dog, smelling those smells, I would have been going crazy. The brussel sprouts were creamy and warm on the inside, the salad was simple and sharp, the corn muffins a little too sweet, but fun to eat. I felt so proud to call Lina and Ookie my friends, and thankful I was not saying goodbye to pork.P.S. This is Ookie's account of what went into the rub and the barbecue sauce:\"i didn't exactly follow a recipe. the rub was roughly 1-2 tablespoons each ofpaprikacayenne pepperonion powderblack pepperand 1-2 teaspoons each ofground fennel seedcoriandercuminsaltmustard powder (we didn't have any this time)garlic powderthe barbecue sauce was2 cups of ketchup1/2 cup of molasses1/4 cup of mustard3 tablespoons of worcester sauce1-2 tablespoons of onion powder (or a diced onion)the rest was some combination of the spices used in the rub. previously, we traded some cayenne pepper for a couple tablespoons of tabasco.\"Whatever you're doing, it works!

My last night in Madrid, I ended up tapas-hopping with a fellow chowhound from the New York region. He had seen my blog and was very complimentary. I was particularly flattered when a week or so later, he suggested that I submit my blog to the James Beard Foundation awards, in the category of new media. He even offered to pay the $100 application fee. I turned him down, partly because the previous winners were real food journalists, but mostly because I don't really want to be a food writer. I don't think food is really that important. I write about food, in a world where every schmuck has a blog, because right now, I don't know how else to talk about the things I care about. I don't know how else to show and not tell that I love my mother, that I miss my friends who've moved away, that I value things made with care and by hand, that I love traditions that are proud but alive with change. It's like the most over-used MFK Fisher quote, \"It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and intertwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it...and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied...and it is all one.\" Such a poor example of her writing. It's so much better to read the rest of \"Gastronomical Me,\" and see what a filter and prism food is for the things that really matter to her. And it's so much better for me to stop this paragraph now and tell you what I ate in Koreatown last Friday.I asked my friend to meet at Gam Mee Ok on 32nd Street because I've been craving Korean food like a pregnant woman since I left Seoul. Even if I don't eat a Korean meal everyday, I dip into the kimchi in my fridge almost everyday, the way I used to snack on olives or bits of cheese. I'm sitting here now with a glass of wine and a bowl of my homemade radish kimchi. Everything looked fine. There was their famous kimchi, fiery red-orange, with cabbage all mixed in with the giant chunks of radish. There was the clay jar of sliced scallions, the little pot of salt to add to the sullongtang, or beef stew, the specialty of the house.But the soup tasted flat. The rice in it clumped unappetizingly together. The broth had no body, and no amount of sharp scallions or salt or pepper was going to save it. The noodles were mushy. I ate nearly all of it anyway, beggars can't be choosers, but I was so disappointed. Even the kimchi was bad, sour and not in a good way. Gam Mee Ok had always been one of my favorites, the best place to go if your Korean friends have kept you out till 4 a.m. in a seedy karaoke room. Clearly, those memories of fabulous hot beef soup are very, very old.It may be that the place has gone downhill, or it may be that I am too fresh from memories of my mother's superlative cooking. But it's definitely another spur to make Korean food happen for myself.

great blogging! I can't help myself from not commenting on your Gam Mee Ok review. This is my favorite Ktown joint because of that awesome soup. I guess it's possible there you were there on a bad night, but I can say that I go there often enough over the last couple of years (especially this time of year) to always leave VERY satisfied. Note: I like to ask for a little extra kimchi sauce to add in my soup. Simply Delicious!

With all due respect to Martin Luther King, Jr., the best thing about this long weekend was that I finally had time to sit down and make some kimchi. I can't tell you how it turned out, as I need to wait a few days for it to ripen, but I'm not very hopeful. Right now, it tastes sort of raw and angry, not too spicy, but perhaps a bit too much ginger. Maybe its flavors will mellow and blend as time goes by. But it was my fault, I didn't follow any one recipe, sort of picking and choosing among two different recipes and then ignoring instructions when I felt like it.I started with a big daikon radish, about 3.5 lbs., that I peeled and cut into large chunks, feeling gratitude towards my friend Diane who gave me a giant cleaver for my 30th birthday. Then I tossed it all with two tablespoons of salt and let it sit for 20 minutes, draining it at the end.In the meantime, I minced 1 teaspoon each of garlic and ginger and 6 stalks of green onions. I measured out the Korean fish sauce that's used specifically for kimchi making and 6 big tablespoons of ground Korean red pepper. I ignored the instructions to add shrimp because I didn't have any, and I didn't know what kind to buy. It was fun, if a little scary, to rub all the ground red pepper into the radish cubes. Then everything else got tossed in, I packed it all into a big Tupperware I'd bought just for this purpose and set it on the windowsill. According to my cookbook, I would have to let it sit for 24 hours in room temperature to begin the fermentation process. So after 24 hours, what can I tell you? It's started, but I don't know yet how it'll taste 2 or 5 days from now. To a certain extent, kimchi will just keep changing and there's a certain joy in eating new kimchi and a different joy in eating riper kimchi. But there are kimchis where there is no joy at all. In a way, this kind of cooking is particularly good for the anxious soul--you have to learn to let go and just see what happens, and then be willing to try again.Korean food isn't hard to make. Fermentation, or pickling, just happens if you put the right things together. The hard part is figuring out which combinations make for best balance of flavors. My little Korean lunch, a spicy soft tofu stew, was the same way, not bad but not great. I miss my mother more than ever.

You know, it still tastes kind of raw and too gingery. But I'm enjoying it by thinking it as a salad more than as a pickle. I also bought some salted shrimp, so I'm going to do another go-around before Lunar New Year.

I had all this stuff I planned to write about, even video footage of bulgogi bubbling away on a copper grill at Sariwon, but nothing made me want to write until I tasted the pasilla chile-honey sauce on the seared pork I made last night. Rick Bayless calls it \"Borrego (o Puerco) al Pasilla Enmielado.\" The Spanish syllables just roll off your tongue as smooth as the sauce, no? Be sure to roll the double \"r\" in \"borrego.\"I'd been easing my way back into cooking. One of the first things I did when I got back was to sign up for a new shift at the Park Slope Food Coop so I could get back into the store--I am now \"food prep,\" which I am told secretly means \"cheese taster.\" I made a trip to Koreatown to stock up on Korean groceries, including a daikon radish the size of my calf that I plan to turn into kimchi. But I started with cooking just one-plate meals, feeling sort of overwhelmed by how busy life is when you actually have to work. Soon, though, I felt sort of itchy but also scared. I needed other people to eat what I cooked, but I needed them to be people I could treat as guinea pigs without fearing the loss of their friendship. My original supper club of Brooklyn friends was perfect, appreciative yet forgiving. They raved about the tomatillo-avocado guacamole, which was really excellent, with a subtle but lingering kick from the roasted serrano chiles. They didn't say anything about the jicama sticks with chile powder, lime juice and salt, but they ate almost all of them. Magda said the Mexican white rice was cooked perfectly, and truly it was, baked according to Bayless's precise directions. The black beans were not so exciting, despite the epazote I went all the way to Sunset Park to find, but it wasn't a total waste of trip since I got to practice speaking Spanish. I'll have to keep trying and find out. The homemade tortillas were similarly, at best, an inspiration to keep trying, they were so sad and small. But the chocolate pound cake was a hit with the birthday girl, whose husband had tipped me off to her favorite flavor.The star of the table, though, was the seared pork and sweet potatoes in pasilla-honey sauce. It was worth every little thing I had to do to get in on the table: 1) Scrub my cast iron griddle with steel wool and reseason it after my sublettor left it rusty.2) Take the R train to Sunset Park on a Sunday morning to find flexible, fresh pasilla chiles.3) Slice open the chiles to remove the seeds and stems. 4) Lay them flat and toast them on the griddle one at a time, pressing on each side for a few seconds.5) Rehydrate them in warm water for 30 minutes.6) Put them through the food processor with roasted garlic, a bit of cumin, freshly ground pepper, and Mexican oregano.7) Sear chunks of pork in batches.8) Add the chile sauce, fry, and then simmer with beef broth for 30 minutes.9) Add the sweet potatoes and simmer for another 30 minutes.10) Add just enough honey for an \"edge\" of sweetness (Bayless's very precise wording) and salt to round it out.Seriously, it was worth it. (For the full recipe, buy his book, \"Mexican Kitchen,\" as the man deserves every cent of his royalties.) The pasilla chiles had a bitter flavor that tasted almost like ash when I first ground it up into a paste. It had me considering a last-minute pizza delivery order. But it magically took on an amazingly smoky, rich flavor as it cooked and absorbed the flavors of the meat and the broth. Even before I added the honey, it tasted insane--I had been crazy to consider pizza. When I added the honey, my head exploded. It was like Emily Dickinson's definition of poetry, except it was pork.Decorated with slices of white onion and cilantro, it looked quite pretty, too. Along the way, this blog became a travel food log, with little amateur assessments of empanadas on the streets of Oaxaca, tripe stew in Barcelona's La Boqueria market, and the Kimchi Field Museum in Seoul, but I'm so happy to be reminded that what I love best, what really makes me glad I've come home, is cooking for people I love.

Fried rice cake, all crispy on the outside, all chewy on the inside, dipped in a sauce of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, and a dash of red pepper flakes. (My sister prefers to dip hers in honey.)2008 has already arrived in Korea, and in a few hours, we'll be eating rice cake and dumpling soup, and a few hours later, my mother's fabulous New Year's feast. Happy New Year, everyone!

What about naengmyon?

\"What about naengmyon? Such a wonderful commingling of parts -- chewy gray noodles! Cold savory broth! Sweet grainy pear! Salty pickled radish! Vinegar, mustard! Pretty boiled egg!\"This is how my sister feels about mul naengmyon, the Korean dish of chewy buckwheat noodles in a very clear, very fine cold beef broth. She feels pretty strongly about bibim naengmyon, too, which are the same noodles also served cold, but in a sweet, spicy red pepper sauce, rather than the beef broth. I've never shared Mona's passion for naengmyon. There's nothing like a cool bowl of naengmyon on a hot summer day, but there is also so much mediocre naengmyon out there, I had forgotten how good it could it be. But yesterday, having lunch at Hanwoori, I had a naengmyon epiphany. It is one of \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia\".It was easy to forget because unlike some of the other contenders, naengmyon is a difficult food. Nine times out of ten, a bowl of pho or ramen will be perfectly tasty, if not sublime. Naengmyon, on the other hand, will be utterly forgettable nine times out of ten. The tenth time, it will be sublime.The biggest challenge with mul naengmyon is the broth. If the idea of a cold meat broth turns you off, there's a reason. It has to be carefully clarified, skimmed of all fat, rich in flavor and yet still clear and light, without the heavy gelatinous mouth-feel of most meaty stocks. The broth and the noodles are the main players, so they must not be overwhelmed with garnishes, but a few thin slices of pickled cucumber and radish, sweet Asian pear, cold sliced beef, and half a \"pretty boiled egg\" add just the right amount of contrast in texture, crunch, and flavor. Even if a perfect bowl comes out of the kitchen, you the eater have to be careful with the last-minute condiments of a spicy mustard and vinegar. The perfect proportion will make the broth sing; too much of either will muddy the broth and no amount of adding the other will ever restore the balance. Bibim naengmyon is not much easier. There's no cold beef broth to deal with, but the sweet, spicy sauce is surprisingly hard to get right. I've had so many bowls of bibim naengmyon that were too spicy, too sweet, or too much of both, as if the cook hoped to simply overwhelm my tastebuds to hide his lack of skill. At Hanwoori, only a small amount to just coat the noodles was sufficient to make the noodles perfect. It was just spicy, sweet, and tart enough to tease you into wanting more.Naengmyon is a culinary lodestar. It reminds me that the best food is made with balance, restraint, and care. The best food can't be eaten everyday or wherever you want--there is no good naengmyon in Manhattan. Most of the time, I will still choose what is more easily satisfying--like ramen during a layover at the Tokyo airport--because warm satisfaction is good for the soul. But it's equally good for the soul to occasionally eat and know there are foods like Hanwoori naengmyon out there.

Sometimes, I wonder if I am just another victim of the American trend for slow food, organic food, localism, and food obsession in general. And then I have a day like last Wednesday, when my mother hustled me out of the house at 10:40 a.m. so we would be sure to arrive at 버드나무집, Budnamujip to have a bowl of short rib soup before they all sold out by 11:10. I'm a victim of heredity. Budnamujip is a grand old dame of a restaurant. It's famous for its galbi, or barbecued short ribs, both marinated and unmarinated, with the unmarinated ones being even more expensive because the quality of the meat is that much higher. (You generally have to reserve orders of the unmarinated galbi before you get there.) One order of unmarinated meat costs about 68,000 won, about $70, and many people order more than one order per person, plus stew or cold noodles after the grilling is done. Filled with smoke, fronted with a glass butchering shop, and waitresses in ugly uniforms running around, it's the Korean equivalent of a glorious, old-school steakhouse.But we weren't there to eat grilled short ribs. Its lunchtime 갈비탕, galbi-tang, or short rib soup, for 12,000 won a bowl, has its own following. As my mother puts it, for some people, eating this soup once a week is their joy in life. We actually ran into one of those people and his wife, family friends who come every Sunday and holiday, when he can close his doctor's office. Today was Election Day, so they came with plans to eat and then to vote.We were the first car to pull into the parking lot at 10:50, and the restaurant wasn't open yet, so we went for a walk around the block. By the time we got back 5 minutes later, there were already 10-15 people waiting in line. When the restaurant finally opened its inner doors to the downstairs dining room, the crowd moved expertly inside and quickly spread out, claiming their tables, one, two, three.Once everyone was seated, a waiter came by and handed out little laminated tickets with numbers on them. Four orders of galbi-tang at our table, so four tickets. There are 100 tickets. If you don't get one of them, tough luck, no galbi-tang for you!Once the restaurant knew who was getting a bowl of galbi-tang, no other questions were asked. Every table got the same side dishes, cubed radish kimchi, garlic scape kimchi, white water radish kimchi, and a spicy lettuce salad. Then everyone just sat there patiently for 45 minutes, secure in their possession of one of the precious galbi-tang tickets.They arrived. Huge, steaming bowls of chopped up short ribs in a broth with chopped scallions and glistening drops of fat on the surface. The ribs crowded the stainless steel bowl that was almost as big as my head. As they say in Korean, it was time to \"rip the meat off with our teeth.\"This is the kind of experience I would heartily recommend to any chowhound, but with a major caveat. You must, you must be okay with ripping meat off the bone with your teeth. You must be okay with tendon and meat and fat all crowded together on the same bit of rib, the way it grows on a cow. It is socially acceptable to eat around the parts you don't like, but there is no way to eat this meat without picking the bone up with your hands and gnawing on it. For about 30 minutes, there was no conversation, just the sound of us chewing and discarding our bones in the bowls left on the table for just this purpose. When there was no meat left, there was the beautiful broth to concentrate on. Like liquid gold, so rich, so smooth. I drowned the rice in my soup like a little kid, loving the way the rice grains soaked up broth, too. Whenever the richness got almost too overwhelming, there was the excellent kimchi to cut through the fat on your tongue.Our family friends, Mr. and Mrs. Kim, asked if there were restaurants in New York where people lined up to eat even before the restaurant opened. \"Oh yes,\" I said, thinking of Prune. \"But not for food like this!\"(Merry Christmas! I'm off to Guam for a few days with my family. If I eat anything noteworthy on Guam, I'll let you know.)

Be forewarned, what follows are less delicate aspects of Korean cuisine.In Mexico, people would often express surprise when I sat down to eat barbecued goat or a spicy stew of innards. I would shrug and merely say, \"But I'm not really American, I grew up in Korea,\" and immediately, the questioners would nod understandingly. I wish I could say my willingness to eat all kinds of random things comes from great bravery and open-mindedness, but it's because I grew up never really knowing what I was eating. I love tripe. I love it cooked in tomato sauce at Babbo, I love it in meaty Korean soups, I love it in a warm Spanish stew. But growing up, I thought it was lamb. The word in Korean for tripe is 양 or yang, which happens to be the same word for lamb. Somewhere in my little kid head, I thought the curly fur of the lamb somehow got transferred to its meat, resulting in the curly, rough surface of the tripe. I had no such excuse for not knowing what 족발, jokbal is. After all, it literally means \"pig foot.\" But I somehow never put \"pig\" and \"foot\" together, probably because I was so distracted by how much I loved the contrast between the simple boiled pork meat, the extremely chewy fat, and the salty, shrimpy sauce in which it's traditionally dipped. It is really, really chewy, as Koreans just love chewy things.Don't knock it till you try it.순대, soondae, I do take credit for simply being brave even if no one ever told me it was blood sausage, because only an exceptional kid, or perhaps a supremely uncurious one, would eat something so dark and strange. I have a vague memory of some kid telling me that the casing was intestine, but I thought she was just trying to scare me. The filling is mainly rice, and blood of course, though many places will also add chopped up Korean glass noodles. Actually, the noodles scared me more; I thought they might be worms. I figured out it must be blood sausage only a few years ago, when I learned about the existence of blood sausage in other cultures. (That's liver on the left--one thing I've never liked.)I am proud of my Korean heritage for many reasons, but particularly thankful that when organ meats became cool, I was ready.

1) Fried food is delicious. 2) Fried food is at its most delicious when it has just come out of the fryer.These are two difficult truths, when one is eating fried food at home instead of a restaurant. It means the smell of hot oil and whatever has been fried can't dissipate before the dinner guests arrive. It means that the cook will not be a gracious host when the dinner guests do arrive, because she will still be frying and frantic. The best way to deal with this problem is to only fry for those you love and who love you. These people will not care that you are still in an apron splattered with batter, they will not care that they will also smell like fried potatoes or chicken or codfish potato balls. Best of all, they will be willing to just stand around the stove and eat the hot little goodies with their fingers.I know this is the best way because the best fried chicken I've had at home was last week with my mom, when we fried chicken wings on our portable stove and ate them right in the kitchen.My father was out to dinner with his friends, and I wanted to learn how to make the dish I have loved my entire life. Our camp stove has never seen a campsite, but it is very useful at home when you want to avoid grease splatter all over your real stove. My mom laid out a bunch of newspapers on the kitchen table and placed her wok and the camp stove on top. She quickly made a crisp, raw salad for me, but we didn't bother to set the table or make anything else. Instead, we focused on the chicken. She showed me every step and we sat together in the kitchen, alternating frying, eating, and laughing. I don't know if this is a particularly Korean way to fry chicken, as it's different from the \"Korean fried chicken\" I had with my cousin. My mom couldn't remember how or why she had started frying it this way, only that we all loved it. I think the key is that the chicken is seasoned with garlic, green onion, salt and pepper, before the potato starch batter is applied. Or it might be that my mom has always used wing meat and eating such small pieces makes it as addictive as popcorn. Maybe it's just something I love because it's from my childhood, as it's quite simple and sometimes a bit greasy if we wait too long to eat. But when I bite into it fresh from the fryer, and my mouth is burning from the heat and the juices squirting from the meat, I can't stop because it tastes so good.I'm sorry the amounts and directions are so approximate; that's the way my mom cooks.Ingredients:2 lbs. chicken wings 2-3 T. chopped garlic2-3 T. chopped green onion1.5 T saltpepper to tastea little less than 1 T. sesame seed oil1.5 cups of potato or sweet potato starchcorn oil1. Prepare the chicken by removing excess fat and making small cuts in the chicken meat to help it cook faster.2. Add garlic, green onion, salt, pepper, and sesame seed oil to the chicken. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour.3. Prepare batter by adding water to potato starch. The batter should be slightly thick, like pancake batter. Add more starch or water as necessary.4. Add the chicken to the batter and mix well. The batter will not completely cover the chicken and obscure its meat, though it will when cooked.5. Heat oil for frying. The oil should be sufficient for the chicken to float in it. (My mom doesn't bother with a thermometer, but it is important to wait until the oil is hot enough and not to use an oil like olive oil that will start to smoke before it gets hot enough. When I try this back in NY, I will definitely reread the oil section in Harold McGee's \"On Food and Cooking\" and make sure my oil is at the right temperature.)6. Once the oil is ready, add the chicken to the pan. Don't crowd the pan and fry the chicken in batches, taking all the chicken out before putting more in as that will cause greater fluctuations in the temperature of the oil. After 10-15 minutes, the chicken should be done. It won't be completely golden brown, more brown in spots, as the potato starch makes a mainly white batter.7. Eat while hot!

Thanks for this recipe! I vaguely remember jotting down notes about potato starch as I watched your mom fry us chicken years ago (back when you didn't realize just how amazing her cooking was ;P). I don't remember anything about marinating in garlic! She must have left that family secret out when I was snooping around in her kitchen.

My sister and I invented a game a few years ago in which one person gives the other two foods (or ingredients or flavors), and that person then has to say which one she would give up for the rest of her life if she had to choose. Chocolate or vanilla? Salt or sugar? Basil or mint? There are no other rules, but we both get mad when someone says something like, \"Bacon or pumpkin?\" Only people who don't care what they eat make this kind of error. Sure, there's no winner, but it's a lot of fun to play while you're waiting for the bus, and if you're playing with someone like my friend Leslie, you can torture her by asking, \"Noodles or rice?\"It's shocking how hard this question is for a girl who grew up in Rome, but even putting aside the category of Italian pasta, the mere existence of a dish like Korean handmade knife-cut noodles should make the answer clear. And 칼국수, kalguksu, doesn't even belong in the \"Top Five Noodles Dishes of Asia\" pantheon! That is how deep that field is.This is another dish I didn't appreciate until I ended up in the impoverished Korean-food land of New York City. (This is one area in which Los Angeles beats New York's ass.) My family's favorite place to eat these noodles in Seoul is at 산동칼국수, Sandong Sone Kalguksu, which translates into Sandong Handmade Knife-Cut Noodles, located close to the Yangjae subway station. On its business card, it lists right under its name the following three words: \"Giant Dumplings--Korean Boiled Pork--Cold Noodles,\" but as the name declares, the knife-cut noodles are the best. On each table, you can find an urn of kimchi, from which you serve yourself throughout the meal. This kimchi has a strong, sharp flavor, but it's still a little raw with almost crunchy cabbage leaves, and therefore not that sour. You might think you only need to fill the little dish provided for this purpose, but my family ends up emptying almost the entire urn.The noodle soup is also clean and simple. The broth has the clear, light flavor of anchovy-broth, with some body that likely comes from dashi. The noodles have that irregularity so dear to the hearts of all those who love homemade noodles. They have that important bite, not the Italian al dente standard, but an exemplary chewiness that is so prized by Koreans in a range of foods, there's a word for it, 쫄깃, cholgeet. You say it twice, cholgeet-cholgeet, if it's really deliciously chewy. Piled on top of the noodles are a good number of clams, a little gritty but who's complaining at 5,000 won a bowl? And then there are strips of dried seaweed, carrot, and zucchini, which add a little flavor and a lot of color, which is an important principle in Korean cooking. It's not a zingy food. It's not the kind of thing that will make fireworks go off in your brain, and I can imagine some non-Koreans might even think it a little bland. But that's what the kimchi is for, and there are days when nothing is as satisfying as a restorative soup of handmade, knife-cut noodles. The answer for me is always the same, \"Noodles forever!\"

Are you and Ookie arguing about which of your families' recipes are the best? So funny, I grew up not even realizing other people did things differently. Did you know North Koreans put long beans and potatoes in their kimchi jjigae? And people in the far South put two kinds of kimchi and no tofu?

You know how when you're young, you don't think of your parents as real people? For a long time, I felt that way about Korean food. It wasn't food in the way Malaysian nasi lemak is food or Oaxacan mole is food, something to be fascinated by. It was like air, something I didn't notice until it was gone, when I realized I was truly living alone and no one was going to make Korean food for me.Even worse, I realized I didn't even know that much about Korean food. I would start to answer questions on Chowhound and then stop because I didn't even know the right name for that whole-radish kimchi I like so much, the one that's shaped like an elongated pear. (It's 총각김치, chonggak kimchi!) I can't identify half of my favorite 나물, namul, or vegetable 반찬, banchan--I just think of them all as \"mountain vegetables.\" Though I should be able to identify at least one; my mom was picking it off the ground in Fort Greene Park when she came to visit. This is why I ended up peering at plastic kimchi last week at the Kimchi Field Museum on the second basement level of the COEX Mall. My mom and I had a hell of time finding it; the mall must be designed to make you lose direction and just shop until you get out. By the time we got there, her bad knee was acting up and so we sat down next to a rack of magazines and books and kimchi, found a very authoritative one written in Japanese, and started to flip through it together. My mom didn't need to understand the text to explain everything to me with happy familiarity. It was like she was flipping through a family album, except instead of saying, \"This is your crazy Second Uncle,\" she was saying, \"This is chonggak kimchi, a really delicious one, your aunt loves it. She always says, \"Please make it for me until I die!\" The museum turned out to be small and fairly low-budget, with clearly some efforts towards interactivity, but with almost no effort to hire a fluent English speaker to do their translations. I learned more from my mother sitting with a Japanese-language kimchi cookbook in the front room. But if you don't have a Korean mother, and especially if you enjoy looking at plastic food (hello, Sharon!), it's not a bad way to spend an hour. If nothing else, you will learn that there are hundreds of kinds of kimchi. That's why it's not quite accurate to describe kimchi simply as Korea's national pickle--it just can't be described in the singular. They can be made of napa cabbage or regular cabbage, cucumbers, green onions, eggplant, big radishes, small radishes, etc., etc. Even my mom saw types she had never tried, as specialties vary from region to region. My new kimchi cookbook divides its 105 recipes into \"Refreshing Northern Kimchi, \"Simple and Tasty Seoul Kimchi,\" and \"Intensely Flavored Southern Kimchi.\" There's some that are fiery red and others that are so mild, you're supposed to drink the clear, sour juice with the cabbage. Sadly, the kimchi museum has no samples, though the plastic kimchis do glisten in their glass cases. (Apparently, you can sample and even make kimchi on certain days--oops.) There's an odd sort of closet where you can open doors and smell the key ingredients in kimchi, like ginger and garlic, but the intense national pride seems to have stopped at putting a dish of fish sauce or dried shrimp in one of the closets. (This is always a revelation I make to vegetarians with mixed emotions--nearly all kimchi includes some sort of seafood-derived ingredient.)The exhibits also explain how kimchi is made, how it was traditionally buried in clay jars in the ground during the winter months, which would control the temperature and keep it from fermenting too quickly. Thus my ancestors ate vegetables through the winter and avoided scurvy. There's also a funny but poorly translated dig at U.S. soldiers stationed in Korea during the war for stupidly thinking that Koreans were eating food straight out of the ground. Now, nearly all Koreans have special kimchi refrigerators that are colder than regular refrigerators for year-round kimchi preservation. We have one that's almost twice the size of the washing machine, and my mom says it's a small one.Sadly, though, younger families rarely make their own kimchi. Sometimes, they'll buy their kimchi in grocery stores, but as the change is recent, most still get to eat their mothers' and mothers-in-law's kimchi. The question, of course, is what will their children eat? I loved Laura Ingalls Wilder when I was young, and I yearned to live in a world where people canned and pickled and preserved things. I didn't realize it was happening in my own home.But I doubt Koreans will ever stop eating kimchi, no matter how trendy hamburgers and pizza get. My mom and I had a dinner today of rice, two kinds of kimchi, and kimchi stew. And they can always put it on their hamburgers and pizza! Koreans feel no fear in adding their favorite food to all their new favorite foods, as the wall of \"kimchi foods\" attests. In any case, the Korean government seems to have funded a significant amount of research on the health benefits of kimchi, just in case you don't like the taste of food, which you can read all about at the museum. It is an excellent source of vitamin C, though could it really help you lose weight? Apparently, people are already selling chile-laced nasal spray as a weight-loss aide.)It's a pity that the museum isn't more exciting. Perhaps I was focused too much on the poor English translations, but given how central kimchi is to Korean life, the most likely audience would be foreigners, not Koreans. With my newfound enthusiasm and pride in Korean food, I can imagine a museum with truly rich exhibits on the science and the culture. I mean, pickles can be seriously exciting. And then their cross-cultural display could include more than weirdly chilling laboratory jars of sauerkraut and Filipino pickles.But I can't completely rag on the existing Kimchi Field Museum. After all, you can take pictures with a mannequin ready to feed you kimchi from her chopsticks!

Korean fried chicken with my cousin

I don't know anyone like my cousin Young. She's a writer, a former award-winning journalist who'll urge me to read James Salter and Henry Miller, almost in the same breath as she's pressing upon me a mix CD consisting mainly of Charlotte Church. She's a good Korean girl, a daughter who respects and honors her parents in a way that makes Mulan seem selfish, and yet she also holds her liquor better than anyone I have ever met. She once did an oil painting of a bag of Funions--without irony. The girl loves Hot Pockets. The most amazing thing is that she doesn't surprise herself at all, nor is she trying to surprise anyone else. Young is simply who she is.It's hard to say what I enjoyed more the other night, her company or the delicate, crispy skin on the fried chicken we were eating. It may sound as if I am not respecting my cousin as much as I claim, but Korean fried chicken is spectacular. I could explain how it is different from the Southern-style fried chicken Americans know, except the New York Times already did it last winter. It caused a minor sensation, at least in my food-obsessed world. Chowhounds from all over the world were asking desperately, \"Where, oh, where can I find Korean fried chicken?\" Although in New York, you have to go specifically to Koreatown in midtown Manhattan, or to Queens, it is possibly in Seoul to simply decide, as we did, that you want fried chicken and wander until you find it.This particular place was called TO:UR Fried Chicken, a classic Korean-English abbreviation of \"Top Our Fried Chicken,\" close to the Shinsegae Department Store in Myungdong, a very young neighborhood of energetic shopping and drinking. (As a general tip, any place with the sign \"Hof,\" a bastardization of the German word \"hofbrau,\" will serve beer, soju, and fried chicken.) As hofs go, it was spiffy, with a bright red and black décor that was reasonably clean and attractive. As the night went on, it got more and more crowded with a good mixed crowd, businessmen, middle-aged women, and us, all happily eating fried chicken and drinking beer.The chicken was just as it should be, moist, ungreasy, and delicious. Koreans fry the whole chicken and then cut it up into pieces, serving it unadorned with just a dish of salt and pepper for dipping or coating it in a sticky, sweet, slightly spicy sauce. For 14,000 won, or about $15, we got half an order of each, as well as the usual accompaniments of shredded cabbage-cole slaw and cubes of pickled radish. We each got a big stein of beer, simple and refreshing. The more we drank, the hungrier we got, so we ordered another half order of plain fried chicken and shared another large mug of beer. I am not ashamed to admit we ate one and a half chickens in total. It was a lovely dinner. We talked, we laughed, we drank, and we ate. Even though I've always loved and admired Young for all the ways in which she differs from me, it was nice to learn that we do share a key core value, a passion for Korean fried chicken.

As promised.But the better 호떡, hodduk, makers were in Kangnam, who used some newfangled metal mold, so that the outside was perfectly crisp without being greasy, the inside chewy and sweet.(For those of you who have never tried this, it's a ball of dough filled with brown sugar and sometimes nuts. The sugar melts when the dough is flattened and fried and you end up with one of the best street food snacks in the world.)

My friend Diane has a brother who is even more obsessed with food than I am. A couple of years ago, we were talking about the essays he was writing for business school applications, including one on the biggest dilemma he had ever faced. He said he was having trouble because in all honesty, the biggest dilemma he had ever faced was on a Singapore Airlines first-class flight to Hong Kong, when he was served a beautiful, truly gourmet meal, and he had to decide whether he would eat it, or forego it to save room for the astonishing food that would be waiting for him as soon as he landed.During that same conversation, we began talking about \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia.\" This was a running list Michael kept in his head. He told me that Numbers 1 through 3 were clear to him, but he had been going back and forth trying to settle in his own mind what dishes occupied 4 and 5. If I remember correctly, one through three were pho, ramen, and soba, and four was some Chinese noodle dish, maybe chow fun. In any case, nothing in the Top Five was Korean; in fact, he said to me in horror, \"Can you believe some people say 잡채, chapchae?\" (Michael is Korean.) I admit I am also horrified that some people would consider that slippery, simpering glass noodle dish to belong in the pantheon of \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia,\" but a recent meal at 한우리, Hanwoori, has made me decide that among my personal top five, I would have to include 국수전걸, guksujungol, or Korean noodle hot pot.(I can hear my sister protesting, \"What about 냉면, naengmyun?\", which is her second-favorite Korean food in the world after braised short ribs, but that is another blog post.)Hanwoori is one of those restaurants that's been around forever. Several stories high, it serves traditional Korean food that's famous for its clean, uncluttered flavors. Our family has always been particularly fond of the kimchi, the shabu shabu (Japanese hot pot), and noodle hot pot. It's not cheap, but it's so good, especially when my parents are paying for it.If you have never had hot pot, Korean, Japanese, or Chinese, you should run out and try it. It's good party food, where people who don't know each other have to get comfortable fast, since they're circling a big pot of broth in which, depending on where you are, thinly sliced beef, strong Asian greens, meaty mushrooms, and assorted fish and fishballs cook lightly and quickly. I wonder why it's not more popular among the ethnic-hipster-foodie set--it's just as DIY as Korean barbecue without being as smelly. And the legends are fun--all about hordes of invading Mongols having to cook their food quickly on the march. The Korean noodle hot pot at Hanwoori isn't quite DIY, but the principle is the same. A big shiny pot of broth is placed on the burner set into the table. It's an anchovy-broth, and Hanwoori's epitomizes all that anchovy broth can be, clear and clean, not meaty and yet full in flavor. (If you think anchovy-broth sounds gross, it's similar to Japanese dashi broth, which you'll find in every bowl of miso soup.) Once the broth starts to boil, the waitress slides into the broth a platter of sliced vegetables--napa cabbage, mushrooms, green onions, and firm greens that hold up well in boiling broth; very thinly sliced beef; and a big pile of toothsome noodles. The broth is then flavored at the table with plenty of minced garlic (this is what makes it Korean!), Korean red pepper flakes, and salt. After 10 minutes or so, the pot is ready. The noodles have released some of their starches, the meat and vegetables have added another dimension to the broth, and so now the broth is thicker, almost more like stew than soup. The noodles are soft but not mushy, the beef still has the kind of chewy texture I love, and the greens clean your palate. It's a wonderful one-bowl meal.This kind of food doesn't need much accompaniment. Rather than a spread of 반찬, banchan, Hanwoori sticks to a few dishes, meant to provide some light, pickled contrast to the bowl of hot noodles in front of you. There's spicy cabbage kimchi, of course, some sweet and spicy dried squid, some non-spicy cabbage kimchi, and then individual bowls of white kimchi, again napa cabbage that hasn't been spiked with red peppers and instead is served in its own light, slightly sour juice.If I were to really raise Korean noodle hot pot to Michael as a serious contender for one of \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia,\" I think he would shoot me down. To be completely honest, it doesn't have the complexity of pho or the almost mysterious flavor of soba. It's simple food, where each component announces itself and nothing more, but this is why it's so satisfying.

It gives me a warm feeling to think about how so many cultures love to eat foods wrapped in dough. Pierogies, dumplings, wontons, empanadas--the list goes on and on. In Korea, our national dough-wrapped food is 만두, or mandoo. The most traditional version involves a thick doughy skin, more like a pierogi than a wonton, with a filling of mainly crumbled tofu, lots of green onions, perhaps some bean sprouts and/or kimchi, and a bit of meat. We like to eat them bobbing in soup, sometimes with sliced ovals of 떡, dduk, or rice cake. They are as comforting as all foods that are doughy and warm.One of my favorite places to eat mandoo in Seoul is called, simply enough, 만두집, Mandoo Jip, or Mandoo House, a tiny little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Apkujongdong. Apkujongdong is probably Seoul's most chichi neighborhood, full of cafes serving 10,000 won (over $10) coffees, bars serving even more expensive drinks, and hip restaurants for ladies who lunch. It's wedged into a little shed-like building that is itself wedged into an alley right next to the new Uniqlo, which occupies the space where McDonald's used to be, right across from the glossy Galleria Department Store. It would look like a little bewildered thing, surprised by what's sprung up around it, except that it has spruced itself up a bit lately so that everything is shiny and new.For 7,000 won, you get cabbage kimchi, a refreshingly spicy and slightly raw julienned radish, and a big steaming bowl of fat mandoo. It's all very bare-bones--there's nothing in the beef-broth soup than a sprinkling of Korean red pepper powder that gives it a heartening bite. Such a fat little bundle that has been boiled in beef broth is likely to be scalding hot, and so you are supposed to take one mandoo out of the soup, place it in the little side dish provided for you, and cut it with your spoon into pieces, adding a bit of scallion-spiked soy sauce with each bite. The dough here achieves that perfect, difficult balance, thick but not starchy, satisfying rather than stupefying. The chopped green onions in the filling are not just a side note, they take up a lot of room, adding a clean, green sharpness to the crumbled tofu. The filling is seasoned so well, you only need a dab of soy sauce to make it complete. This is the kind of Korean food I miss the most when I am in New York, a small restaurant making one thing so well, it becomes a minor masterpiece.

My favorite food in the entire world is 김밥, kimbab. Kimbab is rice, meat, and vegetables wrapped up in seaweed, and then sliced to form neat, round, colorful cross-sections. The meat is traditionally beef marinated in the ubiquitous Korean bulgogi marinade, salty and sweet, and when combined with ribbons of egg, pickled daikon radish, sautéed spinach, and julienned carrots, it's a very happy looking dish. Now, it's become trendy to replace the beef with canned tuna, to add processed American cheese, which makes me ill, and other modern ingredients. It's Korean picnic food, the kind of food that kids love, which is why you'll never see it on the menu of a big Korean restaurant. I love it intensely. Unfortunately, I only get to eat it a couple of times of year, in the few compressed weeks that I'm at home with my parents in Korea. It's simple food, with no sophisticated searing or deglazing. But it's the kind of food that in Korean is literally called a \"handful.\" The rice has to be good, each grain distinguishable and yet sticky, and carefully seasoned with salt, a little vinegar, and sesame seeds. The unsalted seaweed is easy enough to buy. But the carrots have to be sliced and slivered and sautéed in oil. The spinach needs to be blanched, squeezed of excess water, and dressed with sesame seeds and sesame oil. The pickled radish, even though it comes packaged, still needs to be cut into neat long strips. The eggs have to be beaten, salted, and cooked into thin pancakes that are carefully sliced, also into neat long strips. If you are my mom, you will also have to julienne and sautée burdock root, which adds a wonderful slightly sweet, chewy element. And this is all pre-assembly. To assemble, you need a clean bamboo roll, on which you place a sheet of seaweed, spread some rice, and then lay out the rest of the fillings. It's not difficult work, but it takes a little practice knowing how much rice and various fillings you can comfortably stuff into a neat seaweed roll, and my rolls always come out sort of square. If you're going to go to all this trouble, you might as well make ten or twelve rolls, which means you can spend all morning making kimbab. In other words, I rarely make kimbab for myself. So when I come home, one of the first questions my mother asks me is, \"How many times do you want to eat kimbab?\" And she always makes sure it is on the menu at least two times while I am at home, little caring that it's kiddie food to my dad.Growing up, I ate kimbab all the time. It was a frequent lunch that I took to school, that my mother carefully packed for me. My sister and I left for school at 7:30 a.m., which meant she got up at 6 to make my favorite food, after prepping the night before. I didn't even know what this meant until I was in law school, five years after I had left home for college, when I decided to make kimbab myself for a party. It wasn't right, the rice wasn't right, the rolls weren't round. My back ached from standing, chopping, rolling for so long. I had no idea. It really is the most delicious food in the world.

There are a few things from my past that I am deeply embarrassed about. One is that as a teenager, long, long ago, when I didn't know much about anything, I was a big fan of New Kids on the Block. The other is that also when I was a teenager, long, long ago, when I didn't know much about anything, I spent most of my time eating out at TGI Friday's. At least with my bad taste in music, there wasn't much lost other than my dignity. But with my bad taste in food, while growing up in Seoul, Korea, I lost a thousand and one opportunities to eat a meal as delicious as the one I had last night.Last night, my cousin Young and I went to 사월에보리밥 , or Sawhuleh Boleebap, which translates into something like \"Barley Rice in April.\" The fact that it has a name that sounds sissy in English is a hiccup of cultural translation; it doesn't say anything about the food, which is as simple and assertive as the best Korean food has to offer.Koreans love pork. We love it so much some people have convinced themselves it prevents hypertension and eliminates toxins. It's true that 보쌈, bossam, one of the best manifestations of Korean pork, has a surprisingly clean flavor. It's simply boiled, sliced pork, with nothing on it or under it or in it, not even salt. I think it also tastes purer than it deserves to because of the way we eat it. Like many Asian cuisines, Korean food values a contrasting balance of flavors and textures. If you're eating a tender hunk of pork with glistening lumps of fat, you're not supposed to douse it in gravy and eat it with potatoes. You're supposed to place it in a crisp piece of napa cabbage or spry shiso leaf or even just a very fresh piece of red-leaf lettuce with a good piece of spicy bossam kimchi. Some people might even add a small piece of hot green pepper or raw garlic, or raw oysters dressed in spicy sauce, or just a bit of soy sauce to add some acidic saltiness. In any case, the raw, bright, fresh flavors in your mouth make that fatty pork taste almost as virtuous as salad. And it may even make your skin glossy!While we ate our pile of pork, we also cleansed our systems with bowls of barley rice, into which we mixed various sautéed vegetables and red pepper sauce, a variation on the bibimbap many Americans know. I loved the nutty flavor of the barley, especially combined with the slightly bitter greens, the bean sprouts, and the chewy root vegetables. And since Koreans rarely eat rice without soup or stew, there was also a very good bowl of hot 된장찌개, daenjang jjigae, a stew made from Korean fermented soybeans, filled with potatoes, squash, and cubes of firm tofu. Daenjang is a good example of a Korean food with the fifth flavor of umami, beyond salty, sour, sweet, and bitter, the unmistakable sense that a food tastes full. We washed it all down with a comically large jug of 동동주, dongdongju, a creamy, sweet liquor made out of rice. My cousin, like the good Korean she is, had most of it.I have so much lost time to make up for! I gained 10 pounds in Spain. I may just have to gain another ten here.

I'm home. I'm lucky I have two places to call home: Brooklyn, New York, U.S.A., and Seoul, Korea. Brooklyn has its obvious charms, particularly the absolute joy of living alone without one's parents, but as I get older, being at home with my parents in Seoul has its own incomparable sense of comfort and ease. There's the twin bed I slept in from the age of 9 through high school graduation, the little yard I used to run around with our dog, and most of all, the ugly, ornate, wood table on which I ate so many of my meals growing up. Before I left New York, my mom called to see what I wanted to eat for my first meal when I arrived home. I knew if I gave her even the slightest encouragement, there would be an almost-obscene amount of food waiting for me. So I said to her over and over, I really can't eat that much just getting off the plane, just a bowl of my favorite Korean soup will do.It's hard for me to describe what 배추국, or baechuguk, tastes like. How would your average American describe the taste of mac and cheese, of meatloaf? (Meatloaf, incidentally, remains one of the most bewildering food items to me.) It's a fermented soybean soup, made from daenjang, which is a more aggressive, Korean version of the Japanese miso, with a beef broth-base, in which sliced Napa cabbage is simmered until it's tender and delicious. That's really it. You can throw in some minced garlic and green onions to add a bit more bite, but you don't need much else. With a bowl of rice and a few small plates of banchan, maybe some spicy, chewy anchovies or black beans cooked in soy sauce and sugar, it is the perfect meal for someone who has been traveling for almost 24 hours. I didn't take a picture because I was too busy basking in the warmth of my mother's love. But here are some pictures of a spicy 나물, namul, of greens dressed with garlic and sesame seeds, with fresh homemade 김치, kimchi, in the background. And then there is my sister's favorite food of all time, Korean braised short ribs with chestnuts, or 갈비찜. I ate all this for lunch the next day. I am lucky that my mother is who she is, and that I am her daughter.

You know that there is something not quite healthy about your life when you find yourself thinking, \"I just cannot eat another bite of foie gras.\" Or when you eat 14 delicious razor clams by yourself and still don't really feel happy. I had some additional fabulous pintxos in San Sebastián before I left, including a pistachio croqueta with a buttery-smooth interior and an excellent crunchy exterior at Bar Garbola and an unbelievable special foie dish at Hidalgo 56, as well as their award-winning \"volcan de morcilla\" with crumbled blood sausage, a just warmed but still runny egg yolk and a smooth sauce made of apples. (Todo Pintxos is an amazing site, no? You can find an English version by clicking on the top right-hand corner.) But my very last day, instead of going to the famed Aloña Berri, I went to a classmate's apartment where she and her roommates served spaghetti with jarred tomato sauce. It tasted great, too.So I think all this means it's time for me to go home, which is appropriate as I am going home today. In less than 12 hours, I will be in New York. I'm not really going back to real-life yet, as I will be in Seoul, Korea for most of December visiting my parents, and I hope to rectify the dearth of posts about Korean food on this blog while I'm there, but I doubt I'll be blogging with the fervor I've been for the past 6 months. This blog didn't start as a travel-food blog and so will continue life as it started even when I get back from Korea, but I can't imagine I'll be nearly so prolific. So dear family, friends, friends' mothers, and a few random people who don't know me but have kindly read my blog, thank you for helping me feel like I have someone to talk to while traveling alone for so long.

Like many people, I can only keep one foreign language in my head at once. At one point in my life, I knew quite a bit of French. I never did speak it gracefully or even well, and I never really could hear it properly with all those mushy syllables, but I understood it well enough to pass out of Yale's undergraduate foreign language requirement. Now it has been completely crowded out by Spanish. (Korean, thankfully, is in a separate part of my brain.) This became particularly apparent when the nice young French family next to me at Zurriola Marítimo noticed I was taking pictures of my food and started to talk to me, asking if I spoke French. Although it literally took me a whole minute to remember how to say \"trés bon,\" the \"un peu\" French I do have enabled me to understand the husband's very French assessment of food in Spain: \"La cuisine française est la meilleure de Europe!\" (French cuisine is the best in Europe!) So modest of him not to proclaim, \"de tout le monde,\" n'est-ce pas?I also did not love the food at Zurriola Marítimo, although it was much better than it should be, given its spectacular view of the surf at Playa de Zurriola. Most restaurants with astonishing views tend to have terrible food, and it's a testament to San Sebastian's gastronomic standards that the food was good and reasonably priced, if not great. But I doubt the French homme thought what I did while eating my roasted oxtails: \"It would be so much better in a hot Korean soup!\"The first course I ordered, a vichysoisse of leeks with a poached egg and poached bacalao was tasty, if not quite hot enough. (Is it because I'm Korean that I want my soup to be piping hot?) The soup was very smooth and clean-tasting, despite its rich creaminess, and the salt cod was as soft as butter, almost melting in my mouth. They need to be a little careful with the sea salt on the poached egg, though; I almost choked on a small pile of salty granules.The second course was not as good, though there was nothing really wrong with it. The oxtails had been browned until they glistened, almost caramelized, and the meat still fell easily from the bone. They sat on a surprisingly light bed of soft, long-cooked potatoes and carrots, perhaps celery as well, and there were interesting tasty blobs of orange sauce that I couldn't identify. The fried strips of green pepper were wonderful, so much sweeter than any green pepper I've ever had in the U.S. So perhaps it was me, not the oxtails. I couldn't help but yearn for oxtails just simmered straight in a very hot beef broth, perhaps a handful of glass noodles, scads of chopped scallions, and a big pinch of sea salt...Korean oxtail soup! I also sat there pitying cultures that didn't enjoy spicy, picante food, thinking how just a little bit of a spicy condiment, like Korean red pepper paste, would have enlivened the stew. So who am I to think the French are snobby about food?Especially since the family was very nice. The maman directed her little boy to give me a bisou, or a kiss on the cheek, before they left. Qué cariñoso!

I just made the same complaint about my soup today! I had soup for lunch and complained to Ookie that in Western restaurants the soup is never warm enough and it seems tepid to me (thus, too cold). Surely, Koreans aren't the only ones to prefer their soups to be boiling hot but THAT is what I crave when I want a hot soup.

Yeah, we Koreans like to sweat over their soup! Besides, then you have more time to eat it before it gets lukewarm. We really know best, don't we?

I remember the first time I saw a crumb-catcher. You know, one of those thin, metal implements waiters use in fine restaurants to sweep away the crumbs at the end of the entrees and before the desserts and coffee are served. I was so wowed that someone would think of that detail and even invent an instrument for that purpose and that purpose alone. It made me feel special, because I was a person who shouldn't have crumbs on her table as she ate her dessert. In a way, I'm much more cynical and jaded now. I only consider one or two meals as having been absolutely perfect, from the perfectly cooked food to the perfect service, where everything was like magic. I've been around the crumb-catcher block. But I am proud to say that I am a woman who can still enjoy an imperfect meal and with gusto. After my gluttonous meal almost killed me on Monday, I set Tuesday aside for the three-course menu del día at the Restaurante Kursaal, housed in the modern, glassy building of the same name on Playa de Zurriola. The restaurant is owned and managed by Martín Berasategui, one of the giants of Spanish nueva cocina, though it's clearly not his crown jewel. But for 18 Euros or so, we mere peons get to choose from a broad menu of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I was excited when my first course arrived, the \"arroz cremoso con mejillones\" or risotto with mussels. Sadly, it was inedible. The rice was cooked to just the right consistency, maintaining integrity in each grain while being creamy, but, oh and such a big but, there was too much salt. And I like salt. A lot. I was pretty sad, actually. I don't like to get disappointed by legends.And then my second course arrived, \"txangurro a la donostia,\" or spider crab in the style of San Sebastian. There was the requisite foam, which I actually quite enjoyed because it was interesting to taste the unique flavor of parsley in a different form. But more impressively, the txangurro! It had been shredded and then cooked in a tomato sauce that was both interesting and comforting, a difficult balance to be sure. I loved it. Honestly, just to have someone pick out the meat for you is worth a small fortune. According to Mark's Kurlansky, \"A Basque History of the World,\" the Basques are the only ones to eat this tiny crab with its sweet but challenging meat, and I thank them for having discovered how delicious it is.The dessert was another surprise, a cross between a bread-pudding and a tres leches cake, super soft and sweet in the middle, the sweetness saved only by the very distinct and sure flavor of burned sugar. It was full-on burned sugar, too, not the caramely top of crème brulee or crema catalana. I was impressed how the two flavors worked together, not just balancing each other out but almost aggressively pushing against each other. Yummy. The lemon ice cream was wonderful too, so creamy it was more like crème fraiche than lemon.All in all, I was quite happy. It wasn't a perfect meal, but neither am I.(A tip: if you want to have every culinary choice available to you in San Sebastian, do not visit in November. It seems like half the restaurants and tapas bars here have gone on vacation and in the European-style, for three weeks to a whole month. I am anxiously awaiting the reopening of Aloña Berri tomorrow, but I've had to tell myself, \"próxima vez\" to La Cuchara de San Telmo, El Fuego Negro, and other celebrated dining establishments.)

Death by the tasting menu

I've never had a tasting menu before. I've always understood it to mean a menu designed by the chef to show off his skills, providing a range of flavors in one meal. I never knew it meant death by gluttony, albeit a slow and pleasurable one.I've finally woken up to the fact that I only have a few days left in Spain and even fewer left in San Sebastian. I've spent less money than I expected, and so it is time to spend my surplus! But the cheapo cynic in me still isn't interested in spending 100+ Euros at Arzak, or even 55 Euros at Kokotxo. Another student at Lacunza, a retiree with enough money to spend at more expensive places, said one of his favorite meals was the 36-Euro menú de degustación at Casa Urbano. And so off I went.On a Monday afternoon, Casa Urbano was quiet, just a few pairs dining in the calm, cream-colored restaurant. There was abstract art involving wood branches and cream-colored squares on the walls, nothing very interesting, but nothing very offensive either, and the waiters were very kind. Even if it isn't a Michelin-starred restaurant, it declared itself still to be some place special, with white tablecloths, strong napkins, and even buckets of ice for white wine at each table. After all the inner strength I've mustered to enter bustling and noisy tapas bars solo, it was a breeze to sit down in that quiet restaurant by myself. I didn't feel like everyone was having so much more fun than me. The middle-aged couple in front of me barely said a word to each other throughout their entire meal.The menu was more intricate than I'd understood from reading it outside--you got to try all three appetizers listed, with the option of switching one out for the daily special; your choice of an entrée or two half-portions of two entrees; and then your choice of a dessert or two half-portions of two desserts, plus wine, bread, and bottled water. Of course I maximized my options, which meant I had seven plates set in front of me. So be warned, the following is very long.But I'll start with the wine, which was a choice between house white, house red, and txakoli, the very drinkable, slightly fizzy young Basque white wine. When I chose the txakoli, I was presented with the entire bottle, so it sat dangerously in front of me throughout the meal. First came the pastel de esparragos y langostinos, a little soft mousse-like cake of pureed asparagus and shrimp, with a delicate little shrimp on top. It sat in a little sauce that was so good, I sopped it all up with my bread, little understanding what I had ahead of me. I loved that it was nouveau but still soft and comforting, though my first bite indicated that there was one big problem with the restaurant--prepped food isn't properly being allowed to come to room temperature.Then came the ensalada temporada de chipiron, a warm baby squid salad. I loved the crispy grilled legs and the olive oil generously dressing the squid in its own ink. But again, sadly, the potatoes were cold, though the olive on top was fantastic.I swapped the third appetizer for the daily special, pimiento relleno con queso y anchoa, and was glad I did because it was my favorite of the three. The roasted red pepper encased a perfect cylinder of a firm, white cheese, but what made it special was something that I couldn't quite place, that nagged and nagged me until I realized they had somehow caramelized an anchovy! It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. I'm not clever enough to figure out what the white sauce underneath was, some sort of emulsion, but it was also good enough for me to eat the rest of my rather large roll. I didn't know it at the time, but this was the beginning of the end.Ha! The \"Gilda\" de bonito fresco con refrito al vinagre de sidra, or a tapa of fresh tuna with delicious fried bits of garlic, little green peppers, and dried red peppers, in olive oil and Basque cider vinaigrette was not a \"tapa\" as described on the English menu. The \"Gilda\" refers to a famous San Sebastian pintxo of olives, pickled peppers and an anchovy, all skewered together and created in homage to the Rita Hayworth movie, \"Gilda.\" It's supposed to be as surprisingly sexy. It was delicious, and the tuna was fantastic also, just seared so that the inside stayed a warm red. It sat in a literal bath of olive oil, but it didn't overwhelm the simple, fresh flavor of the fish.By the time my second entrée arrived, I was starting to feel ill. But I couldn't stop; it was like I was in a trance. Besides, it was magret de pato al agridulce de frambuesa, or duck, one of my favorite meats in the world, in a raspberry sauce. I normally hate the words \"raspberry sauce,\" but the sauce here was delicate and tart, as well as sweet, and my aching stomach didn't stop me from eating all of the butternut squash puree, too, which had a strong, tart apple flavor. I did leave one chunk of potato.When the waiter came to take my dessert order, some part of me knew I had to stop, but the rest of me didn't want to listen. At this point, I couldn't plead ignorance of what this restaurant considered a \"half-portion,\" but I still ordered two desserts. The pantxineta crujiente \"Gorrotxategi\" was a flaky, crispy almond tart layered with a lovely rich cream. As if that weren't enough, it was served with a scoop of nutty ice cream that I think was also almond-flavored.Given how truly ill I was feeling at this point, I thought I should have some fruit: fruta asada de temporada con su subayon, or roasted seasonal fruit of pineapple, peach, and strawberries in subayon. Again, the fruit was a little too cold, but the \"subayon\" turned out to be a frothy, almost foamy (Spanish foam again!) tart sauce that must have had some milk or cream in it, because caramelizing the top had created a little skin. I wanted to die and I was drunk. The waiter was surprised when I ordered my espresso before the second dessert arrived, saying, \"But you're still missing one dessert!\" But I needed it immediately, some injection of caffeine and energy that would allow me to carry my bloated body back home and into my bed.The really scary thing is that four hours later, I thought, hmm, I should buy some bread to eat for dinner with the duck pate in the fridge.(If you're wondering if you should subject yourself to this particular slow death the next time you're in San Sebastian, I thought the coldness of the food really was a problem, with the insides of all the seared meats and even the roasted fruits being just too cold. I don't want to sound like a restaurant critic, but a fine restaurant should not let that happen. That said, it was a lot of excruciating fun at a very good price, and if you don't want to die eating seven courses, the a la carte menu is quite reasonably priced as well.)

I confess, I am one of those Americans who like to complain about their country while traveling. The bread is better here, the family is more important here, oh life is more beautiful here in _________. I know that I tend to exaggerate, and I get mad if other people bash America, but one thing is definitely true about life here in Spain--drinks are so much cheaper here! And more importantly, the culture of pintxos bars in San Sebsatian is lovelier than anything I have experienced before. I had feared before I arrived that pintxos might not really be my thing. I thought they might be too precious, too expensive, and more arty than tasty. San Sebastian, after all, boasts more Michelin-starred restaurants than anywhere else in the world, other than the center of Paris, but none of them were on my to-do list. The rest of the Basque country likes to say that San Sebastian cuisine is very French, and they don't mean it as a compliment.But even if they are right, pintxos in San Sebastian are the most democratic form of haute cuisine I've ever seen. There's nothing precious about them. More likely, you'll end up with sauce on your face and olive oil on your fingers trying to eat one in the requisite two bites. In Bar Goizargi this past Saturday, everyone, young and old, was eating the brocheta de gambas, or grilled shrimp skewered with bits of bacon and served with a vinagrette sauce of red and green peppers, onions, and carrots. They're award-winning and even included in the sixth edition of \"Los Mejores Pintxos de Donostia,\" but at 2 Euros, they cost the same as the Sunday issue of El Pais, a major national newspaper. Sure, there are places that are more haute than others. Sure, a couple of pintxos don't make a meal and can add up quickly. But I had two pintxos at the award-winning Goizargi, the shrimp and a tiny bowl of succulent squid in ink sauce, plus a glass of rosé for 5 Euros. Even at the obscene U.S. dollar-Euro exchange rate, that's only $7.50 at most. I can't get a freakin' glass of wine in Manhattan for less than $8. And I couldn't tell you if the crowd is young and hip or old and rich, since it was crammed with a group of students, older couples, and families with young kids. Okay, it definitely wasn't an angry young pro-ETA bar, but the food hadn't drawn a certain self-selecting crowd, the way it often feels in NY. There was no statement being made by the people eating there, that they support organic local food or that they are hip enough to eat meat by the pound on a picnic table in Williamsburg. They only wanted to stand with their friends with a drink in one hand and an empty toothpick in the other on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.I can't even wish that someone would open a true pintxos or tapas bar in New York. It wouldn't be enough for there to be one such bar, as there would always be a line out the door and the easy joy of it that I love would just disappear. So I have three days left here. Ready, set, go!

Very well said re: the self-selecting element of food cultures in New York; certainly the same is true of San Francisco, too. It's funny how different forms of identity politics seep into something as basic as eating. More importantly, you now have me viscerally craving pintxos...

Everyone who knows me knows I love Sahadi's with a passion. Sahadi's is my favorite place in New York, and even though I've said this so many times, I'll say it again. I feel about Sahadi's the way Holly Golightly feels about Tiffany's. Whenever I'm blue, I go to Sahadi's because nothing bad could ever happen at Sahadi's.But I must confess that the other day, I walked into a gourmet food store in San Sebastian that made me feel a little bit like, well, like I'd had a brief but meaningful affair with a beautiful Spaniard. If Sahadi's is my faithful lover waiting for me back home, Don Serapio is my Iberian fling (though sadly, the closest I'll get to an Iberian fling, sigh).The first thing that drew me was the faint but sure scent of the Italian moscatel grapes sitting on the sidewalk. Pale green fading to gold, they tasted like sweetness and flowers. I grabbed a big bunch and went inside, only to find myself feeling weak in the knees. I looked at the house-made jams, with tantalizing flavors like peras rioja, pears poached in Rioja wine, and ciruela con menta, plum with mint. I ate a tiny cube of 17 Euro/kg cheddar and almost bought a hunk immediately. I gazed at various unknown Spanish cheese with cute little goat and cow faces on the labels, at bright red strips of chorizo and panceta, in shiny foil packets. I bought a tiny little bottle of olive oil because I was seduced by the simple, luxurious packaging. Of course, there were giant legs of jamon iberico and fascinating sausages. I don't know why Don Serapio affected me so much, more than the other little Spanish stores I've been in so far. It may have been that the store has done a fantastic job of labeling everything, so that I understood just enough to know what I was looking at and yet had never tasted. In other words, the store is very attractive, tantalizingly so. I bought a few things to eat at my shared apartment but I knew that I could never try enough in the 5 days or so I have left in San Sebastian. I would never give up Sahadi's and the happiness I know I can find there. For one thing, Sahadi's is amazingly affordable, and Don Serapio is not, not to mention one can't eat foie gras every week. But I did ask myself for the first time, \"What if I just didn't go home?\"

What a wonderful world we live in, that I can see Rufus Wainwright in concert singing Gershwin while wearing the knee socks and breeches of a Basque folk costume in San Sebastian. And how appropriately strange and alluring to eat pintxos before the concert in a city that values tradition but also loves surprises.I walked into Bar Bergara with all the panache of an experienced solo tapas eater. I smoothly ordered a \"copa de txakoli,\" knowing I still wasn't pronouncing it quite right but that I was getting closer. Then I looked at the jewel-like bites laid out in large platters, completely covering the counter. The counter, being plastered with pintxos, cleverly had a little shelf under the counter on which you could place your little plate of pintxos. That's where I quickly took a stealth photo, and how lucky I am that it came out fairly focused because these were the best, most intensely flavored and most mind-blowing pintxos I have had so far.The one on the left is revuelto, or scrambled eggs with roasted red peppers, with a little cross-hatch of roasted green pepper strips. An awesome combination of flavors and textures, the smoothness of the eggs, the sweetness of the peppers, the appropriate bright saltiness of the entire ensemble.The one right behind is half a deviled egg on top of an anchovy on which is piled, believe it or not, shredded boiled egg white, topped with a dollop of aioli and a curled shrimp. I would never, never have thought of serving egg white like that, but it wasn't just a showy trick, it was excellent. Again, so perfectly salty!The third one is diced tomatoes and browned garlic tossed in fantastic olive oil, and then topped with golden fried onion bits and more green pepper. Like eating a bite of late summer.The best one, I couldn't even take a picture of it. Sorry, I already stick out enough, I can't bring myself to wave my camera around. It was \"foie gras con uva de oporto,\" which I think translates as foie gras drizzled with grape-port wine sauce. So rich, so smooth, just sweet and tangy enough to make vow immediately to return.To be honest, I'd enjoyed my pintxos and tapas up to this point, but I hadn't really seen them as something worthy of extreme hype, just something lovely about Spanish culture. I get it now.

My sister asked me the other day, \"Have you had a bad meal yet?\" Shockingly, I haven't. That doesn't mean every meal has been transcendent, but I haven't been served anything that I really just couldn't eat. I have, however, had some very ill-chosen meals, through my cultural blindness to the unspoken assumptions in the Spanish menu.It's ironic because my food vocabulary in Spanish is much fuller than any other area. I can't seem to keep in my head the word for grass, but I can say razor clam, mussel, baby squid, regular squid, dogfish, hake, and octopus. I've even picked up a few food and wine words in Catalan and Basque. But knowing the words alone never makes you fluent. Knowing that \"patatas\" are potatoes, and even knowing that \"rioja\" is a kind of red wine, didn't enable me to know that my appetizer of \"patatas de rioja\" was going to be a very rich and heavy stew of potatoes, sausage, chorizo, and beef. It was delicious, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I hadn't also ordered \"entrecote con garnis.\" \"Entrecote\" is steak, \"garnis\" I assumed meant some sort of vegetables would come alongside. Good Lord, the \"garnis\" turned out to be French fries. The phrase \"meat and potatoes\" took on a whole new meaning for me that day.You know you're having a serious fruit and vegetable deficiency when your apple tart tastes incredibly fresh and nutritious to you. It's too bad, because the Café Iruña in Bilbao was a warm and bustling restaurant, if somewhat brisk, with an ornate mudejar interior, and all the food was very good.The worst thing is I did it all over again the next day! I was in Gernika/Guernica, I wandered into the Jatextea Julien (\"jatextea\" meaning restaurant in Basque) and ordered alubias, a very typically Baque dish of beans that also turned out to be stewed with assorted meats, which I hadn't known when I had also ordered roasted pork with French fries for my second course. (Note the enormous bowl out of which I was to serve myself, as well as the entire bottle of house red wine.) Thank God the roast pork came with a green salad, nothing more than some fresh romaine lettuce with raw white onions, but it was like manna to me.I always make fun of the American trend of listing every ingredient and its origin on a menu but I'm starting to see there are some advantages.

I've decided to stop searching out restaurants. That is, I've decided that at least while traveling, I will not go around and around in circles looking for something specific cited in some guide written by someone I don't even know. I'm just going to walk into whatever feels right.Yesterday, I arrived in San Sebastian around four in the afternoon. The sky was gray but the city still gleamed. The bus station, really just a small parking lot, opened directly onto a path by the city's ría, a shallow ocean inlet. By following the ría north, I quickly came to the sea, the beaches that line San Sebastian's northern edge and make it astonishingly beautiful. I'm sharing an apartment with a single Spanish mother in the Gros district, literally blocks from Playa de la Zurriola. It's too cold now to go in the water--not that it stops the surfers--but it's still so emotional to be living by the ocean. I was so inspired, I went for a long run from the end of Playa Zurriola, around the northern crest of the Casco Viejo, and then along Playa de la Concha and Playa de Ondarreta. I wish I could live by the sea always. It makes me glad at least to live in New York and not, say, Cleveland, Ohio, though people always laugh when I say NY has beaches.Being the end of a holiday weekend and a Sunday, many restaurants were closed. I wandered around, trying to figure out if any of the open bars were serving anything more substantial than pintxos. I'd had pintxos and a plate of fried calamari for lunch in Bilbao and I was starving for something a little hefty. Finally, I found a little slip of a bar that advertised \"platos combinados\" and a nice owner who exclaimed, \"Claro!\" when I asked if the kitchen was open.So this is what I ate. It's not very impressive, really, but it was filling and satisfying. I hadn't known that a hamburguesa wouldn't come with a bun, so the American hegemony isn't as powerful as I'd thought, but there was plenty of good crusty bread. Even the iceberg lettuce and greenish tomatoes tasted good, being fresh. The fries were freshly fried, the meat had good flavor. The best part, though, was when the owner caught me taking a photo of the food. I'd tried to wait until he went back into the kitchen, but he suddenly reappeared with the ketchup and mustard, noticed me, and asked, \"Are you putting the photo on the internet?\"What a world we live in. Apparently, I am not the first American to be caught taking pictures of her food in his little Bar Diz.

So you can see some of Café-Bar Bilbao's creations:I went back for an early lunch, my last meal in Bilbao. The one on the left turned out to be a ball of cream cheese with something slight and meaty in the middle, covered in slivered almonds, and then topped with the aforementioned raspberry jelly. Not so exciting, and the cream cheese made me only long for a proper bagel. But the one on the left was tasty, I think bacalao mixed in olive oil with a slice of sautéed zucchini and a blob of sauce that was more tart than spicy.And then I ate an entire plate of fried calamari. The first few were so good, so succulent, so far from anything served by the kind of American restaurant that serves fried calamari. But by the end, sigh, I realized why fried calamari is usually shared.

Bilbao has been hard for me.The city itself is beautiful. It has a bad rap, affectionately called \"el botxo\" or \"the hole\" by locals, and was known mainly as an ugly industrial city for years, until it got the Gehry-designed shiny Guggenheim 10 years ago, which, incidentally, is more beautiful than I ever imagined. But it must be \"ugly industrial\" European-style, because if this city were in the U.S., it would be advertised as a picturesque tourist destination. It's not in the style of Salamanca or Santiago de Compostela, which can brag about their 500-year-old medieval buildings. Bilbao's colorful houses and buildings along its Ria, or inlet from the sea, are only from the 19th century; perhaps that's why it's not considered one of Spain's beautiful cities. But it has the Guggenheim; it has the Mercado de Ribera, the biggest covered market in Europe; it has fantastic public transit; it has the world's oldest transporter bridge (very cool, trust me). Also, the river apparently used to stink, but I went for a morning run my first day and it smelled just fine!Bilbao has been hard because here, it is undeniable how social Spaniards are. One of the things I love most about Spain is the way people go out, young, old, infant, all together, every night. A typical tapas bar is a place to gather with friends, maybe even your grandparents, and not a place to cruise strangers. Bilbao is chilly these days, but it doesn't stop the crowds from standing outside the Cafe-Bar Bilbao or Sasibil or Berton with drinks and pintxos, Basque tapas, in their hands. Food and friends go together so well here they have gastronomic societies called \"txokos.\" (Anyone want to start a Txoko Brooklyn with me?) People have a drink and a pintxo and then move on to the next bar. The classic drink in Euskara Herreria, or Basque country, is txakoli, a light, fizzy white wine with low enough alcohol content that you can move from bar to bar all night without getting smashed. Spanish kids must get smashed sometime, but it must be after I go to sleep because I haven't seen a trashed Spaniard yet, even though every person I see seems to have a drink in her hand.As lovely as this is, though, it is not an easy society to fit into as a solo traveler. I'm reminded of what my friend Bianca said to me when I was getting ready to move to New York from San Francisco. \"NY is not a good place to find someone, but it's a great place to be single--at least you know you're not the only one.\" Spain, and a pintxo-focused city like Bilbao, is the exact opposite. I am the only person alone in the entire city! So what was I supposed to do in this pintxo-paradise? I tried one strategy, going when it's not prime-tapas hour and I knew I could quietly snag a corner bar stool. In Salamanca, I had forced myself into a café-bar and been rewarded with strong black olives and luscious chunks of jamon, its chewy texture giving it a flavor I liked even more than the thinly sliced jamon I'd always known. Here in Bilbao, I started with pintxos for breakfast at Abando y Barra, one block from the Guggenheim. I think that's a little fried quail egg. It was so adorable, it was calling my name like a puppy in a pet shop window. I wouldn't have thought a room-temperature egg would taste good, but it did. The little sandwich was mainly a tangy tuna sandwich, a little fishy for breakfast, but fortifying for the hours I spent in Richard Serra's \"The Matter of Time.\"That night, around 7:00, I walked to Bar Berton, just down the street from the Pension Mardones, and ate this pretty trio. The croquetas just melted in my mouth. Good, but afterwards, I wished I'd ordered the \"solomillo con foie,\" one of the few that you had to order off the menu. Here, there was even space at the end of a long table and I sat down and scribbled in my journal, closing the world away from me.I felt like I was training for a marathon. The next night, I had to push myself further. I walked by Café-Bar Bilbao twice before I could work up the courage to go in. It was 8:30 pm and it was buzzing, people spilling out onto the Plaza Nueva, people ordering and carrying away 2, 3, 4 glasses at once for their friends waiting outside. But once I was inside, the array of colors and textures on the counter gave me strength. I wanted so much to try one! I ordered a glass of txakoli and three pintxos. Sadly, I was too embarrassed to take out my camera. One can only overcome one insecurity at a time, no? I'm not even sure what I ate, I gulped everything down so fast. I only know that it was very, very, very good. Café Bar Bilbao is known for pushing pintxo boundaries beyond tradition. It must be so, because I think one of my pintxos had raspberry jelly on it. Could I really tapas-hop on my own? Would I go home slightly hungry or stop at one more place? It's funny, once you do something scary once, it really isn't so hard the next time. It wasn't nearly so painful to walk into Sasibil alone, even if the bartender there didn't have the kind crinkly-eyed smile of the one at Café-Bar Bilbao. I'm thankful this time I was able to take a photo and have a memento of the 5 minutes I spent there. The one on the right was some sort of chopped jamon with maybe a parmesan crisp on top, and good, but the ones on the left, of bacalao, were stupendous. I think they were rehydrated salt cod, not cooked and so almost raw. The one in the foreground had a little fried quail egg and sitting on top of that, a round slice of octopus. So deliciously chewy! And the one behind had some serious chili oil happening, one of the few spicy things I've eaten in Spain.I'm in San Sebastian now--here's hoping for less harrowing pintxos-eating here.

I'm sure that I've told you this story but I have to tell it again seeing the Lays photo. One of my friends once hosted a group of us at his family's vacation house in Malaga where they asked that we respect their Muslim dietary rules when buying groceries and bringing food into the house. Although it was difficult in a country like Spain, we were very good about enjoying our pork products outside of the house. Then, one of our more American friends felt the craving for chips so he bought an exciting bag of \"Jam On!\" Doritos and didn't realize until he passed them around to us that it was Ham Doritos.

If you are ever in Santiago de Compostela, you have to take a tour of the cubiertas or roof of the famous cathedral. The tour guide will literally lead you to the top of the cathedral and you will walk out onto the sloped steps of the roof, where pilgrims for almost 1000 years would walk at the end of their pilgrimage to burn their clothes and start their life anew. If you are a sentimental fool like me, the first sight of the sky, the red terracotta roofs of the city, and the clock tower so close to you will bring tears to your eyes and you will gasp with joy, \"It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful!\"A good place to eat after this inolvidable experience is Bierzo Enxebre where I had an inolvidable meal. The interior is warm Galician farmhouse, wood beams and stone walls where people have inexplicably stuck pennies into the crevices, making bright copper spots throughout the dining room. The food is served in traditional Galician dishware, an off-white with abstract splotches of blue and brown. The young lunchtime waiter has a gentle face and Botticelli curls, and he will smile and approve your choices, that is, he approved mine.I couldn't resist yet another plate of pimientos de Padrón, smaller and even more delicious than the ones Becca and I had in Sevilla. The plate seemed so big but the peppers disappeared so fast. This plate actually did hold a couple of surprises, a couple pleasantly spicy ones.I'd walked in all set to eat the famous pulpo a la gallega, but when I saw with the mother and daughter next to me were eating, I had to ask what it was. They were costelas de porco adobadas (costillas de cerdo adobadas in Spanish or pork ribs rubbed in spices in English) on a bed of French fries. They were insane. They were all crunch, like eating pork rib popcorn. I got a half ración and the platter came overflowing with ribs, but I still ate them all. I couldn't help it, the way you can't help eating a tub of popcorn.The wine was just the albariño of the house, but as good as every other albariño I've had here. Albariño is the typical white of this region and it's light and young, not as fizzy as a Portuguese vinho verde but it goes down just as easy.The waiter's approval really hit a peak when I ordered dessert on top of the enormous meal I'd just eaten. \"Please, crema de lemon con castañas.\" Castañas are chestnuts and they are all over the market. The lemon custard tasted like lemon and nothing else, just cream and tart and happiness with the sweet, nutty texture of roasted chestnuts. It was \"muy bueno,\" just like the waiter had said. When I thought no one was watching, I scraped away at the bottom of my cup.I felt like a beached whale, a very happy beached whale. I thanked the God I don't believe in for my good luck and walked off towards the Museo de Peregrinaciones, the Museum of Pilgrimages.

I bought the bread and cheese at the Mercado de Abastos in Santiago de Compostela. The bread is \"pan de maiz,\" or cornbread, though nothing like the cornbread we know in America, and the cheese is \"tetilla\" cheese, a mild, tangy, Galician cheese. The pan de maiz is crumbly like soda bread and the cornmeal is definitely mixed in with flour, but it has that characteristic, hearty flavor of \"honest bread,\" as M.F.K. Fisher would say. I ate it for days, even on the 12-hour bus to Bilbao; neither bread nor cheese went bad just sitting in my hotel room.Even more than the cheese and bread, and the green-skinned freixoa fruit I tried, I liked the way the women at the market smiled at me when I bought it. Maybe I am getting starved for company, but people in Santiago de Compostela are so nice! People started asking me again where I was from and telling me that I spoke Spanish well and smiling such warm, genuine smiles at me. It was almost like I was in Mexico again. I wonder if it means anything that so many Galicians emigrated to Latin America.

(Just arrived in Bilbao, so I'm only one city behind now!)For all my bravado in Salamanca, I arrived in Santiago de Compostela a little sad and pensive. I'd had too much time on the bus to think and I dreaded what I might think about for the next couple of weeks. But from the moment I first started walking around the city, I felt happy. At the risk of sounding hokey, I felt at peace. Santiago is famous for being the destination of pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago for over 1000 years, and even though I didn't walk for three months to get here, it feels right to be in a city where I'm just another solitary traveler looking for something.And the food! I dare Bilbao and San Sebastian to beat the food memories I've made here.Galicia is another corner of Spain that isn't quite Spanish. They speak galego (or \"gallego\" in Castilian), which looks like Portuguese and sounds like mushy Spanish. So \"plaza\" becomes \"praza,\" \"iglesia\" becomes \"egrexia,\" and \"jardin\" becomes \"xardin.\" It also has a strong Celtic heritage, which means you hear Riverdance music everywhere and junk souvenirs with Celtic symbols on them. Their traditions are peasant traditions of square-shaped men and women fishing and working hard on the land to grow the biggest cabbages I've ever seen, judging from what I saw at the Mercado de Abastos. Thus, their food is peasant food, my favorite kind.My first taste of Santiago was a café con leche and a piece of tarta de Santiago, their famous cake made of almonds, at Hostal Girasol's café, across the street from my own lovely little pensión, the Casa Felisa. Eating anything so deliciously nutty makes me think of my sister and even though I missed her more than ever, I was happy to be eating something that reminded me of her. And then I moved on to lunch. Casa Manolo is tucked into a corner of Praza de Cervantes and is clearly in more guidebooks than Lonely Planet, as there were plenty of pilgrims in walking sandals and Gore-tex clothing eating there. But just because a place is popular with pilgrims is no reason to sneer at it.For 8 euros, I was given my choice of an appetizer, an entrée, dessert, and bread. Wine was extra, but a \"copa\" for a 1,80 euros turned out to be a carafe with a good two glasses worth of the light, bright local white, albariño, that was a true pleasure to drink. I'd been curious about white asparagus ever since I saw it in jars at gourmet shops in Madrid, but the white asparagus I had with olive oil, mayonnaise, and boiled eggs was nothing particularly exciting. The bread, though, was the best bread I'd had in Spain. It was my favorite kind of bread, a good brown, floury crust with a slightly tangy, tender crumb, not as tough of a levain but as flavorful. It didn't need any butter or olive oil, it held up so well on its own.I had a typical Galician dish for my entrée, merluza or hake cooked with paprika and olive oil. The boiled peas and carrots were very peasant in being tasteless, but I was so impressed by how good a white, firm fish could be. It was simple, very clean, and so so good. Even the boiled potatoes were good.I wrote in my journal as I ate, \"I am so happy! I am so happy!\"

We ate at Casa Manolo in October, 2002. The food, IMO, was undistinguished, but (as in the famed Catskill hotel exchange), there was plenty of it.We loved Santiago also. We stayed at the Hostal Alfonso, Rua Pombo, between the Alameda and the Casco Viejo.

I think I loved Casa Manolo more for the kindness of the waiter than anything else. Spanish people normally don't know what to do with solo travelers, but in the city of pilgrims, everyone was very nice.

After all my talk about how I was going to bravely sally forth and travel alone through Spain, I am only truly alone after three and a half weeks of travel. I'd been lucky to have Anne for Madrid and Barcelona, Becca for Andalucia, and I noticed their absence sharply when I stepped off the 8-hour bus from Sevilla into the city of Salamanca. I arrived at the Pension Lisboa, a small cheap hotel selected by Lonely Planet, and I immediately wondered why it had been picked out of the myriad, small, cheap hotels in the city. The best I can say about it is that it was clean, which is an important attribute to be sure, but it didn't totally balance out the hideous polyester floral bedspread. I felt like I had come to a guesthouse for genteel women fallen on hard times to come, live out their days and die. I wasn't really unhappy, though. I spent the first afternoon just sitting in the sun on the steps of the Colegio de Anaya of the Universidad de Salamanca, looking at the cathedral across the plaza but not really in any hurry to go inside. I wandered around the commercial district, buying a hat and gloves to protect me from the cold of Castilla y León, a brutal shock after sunny Sevilla. I walked through \"the most beautiful Plaza Mayor in Spain.\" I poked through the old building of the famous university and tried to find the good luck frog on the façade. I wandered through a pretty garden, unmarked on my map, and ate two kinds of buñuelos, little donuts filled with whipped cream or chocolate or buttercream, what have you.And I survived my first dinner alone in Spain. I even enjoyed it.I wandered around for awhile looking for a place where I wouldn't feel too inconspicuous. I'd had lunch in Barcelona alone, but even super-social Spaniards eat lunch alone once in awhile, and I never felt like an oddity. But dinner was more challenging. I didn't want to go into a bustling tapas bar filled with people laughing and jostling each other while holding drinks in their hands. I didn't want to go into a desolate tapas bar with only old men who know each other from 50 years ago. I picked a sit-down restaurant, Rúa Mayor near the Plaza Mayor, because there was already one elderly woman tourist eating there alone. Thinking about the intrepid women who traveled alone in times when that was really weird gave me courage, that and the thought that I could soon have a glass of wine.I started with the pimientos rellenos, the red peppers stuffed with potato, a bit of cod, and tiny shrimp, baked in an earthenware dish with a tomato sauce and cream. It had been run order the broiler, and the top was very attractive, brown and crispy. The potatoes were so smooth, they tasted almost cheesy, and the tomato sauce was sweet and rich. It came out very hot and I could feel myself getting happier and happier.My entrée was simpler, churrasco de la ternera a la parilla, or a piece of grilled beef rib. It came crispy French fries and a mushroom sauce. It had a fair amount of gristle, but it was exactly what I wanted, something satisfying and simple. Since I had no one to talk to, I talked to myself by writing in my journal and jotting notes about my meal. In a way, that satisfied me more than anything, to be writing again. I knew that I could have asked Becca or Anne for some time to write, but I had had to gorge myself on their company, like a bear preparing to hibernate. And I hopefully now had sufficient fat stored up to survive the rest of my solo trip.By that point, the wine and food had made me woozy. I'd stuffed myself, since I'd only eaten Gummi bears and Maria biscuits all day. I was glad that the Pension Lisboa was so close. As I stumbled home and fell into my bed, I didn't even notice the ugly bedspread.

After spending two days walking around the hills and pueblos blancos, or white villages, around Ronda, we returned to Sevilla for one night. It was like coming home. We went to one more flamenco show, an intense, beautiful performance at Casa de la Memoria Al-Andalus with a guitarist whose hands flashed as he played. We had pimientos de Padrón one more time at Modesto. Becca bought another shirt at Zara. And we went back to the Alameda de Hercules park.The Alameda park in Sevilla was one of our favorite places in the city, which was odd because it wasn't much of a park and more a long, skinny length of brown dirt and scrubby trees. It runs a long ways between the barrio of Macarena, where we initially stayed, and ends near the commercial, shopping district in the center of the city. They were clearly doing some remodeling, and one night, these giant metal statues showed up on the beds of even bigger trucks, but the construction didn't stop people from congregating there almost every night, Monday through Friday. The bars and restaurants that line the Alameda draw a crowd that's a bit hipster, a bit grungy, the type that will happily sit around a guitar for hours, but also lots of children, as the Spanish are big on keeping their kids up at all hours. Becca and I couldn't understand it--they didn't look grouchy or tired, which I always thought was the reason for putting your kids to bed at 9. In the U.S., everyone says that when you have a child, it changes your life, and I'm sure it does, but I get the feeling that it wouldn't change your life so much here. We saw extended families at outdoor bars late at night, from babies to grandparents all time. If I ever have a child, I will definitely be the kind of mother who takes her baby to the bar.Almanara, our favorite restaurant on Alameda, would be just the kind of place a mother could take her children. During the day, it's a sleek narrow column of a restaurant with some outdoor tables serving fruit drinks and smoothies, including the most intoxicatingly delicious lemonade with yuerbabuena. (Note to self: plant yuerbabuena in container garden next summer.) At night, they serve food from a mainly vegetarian menu, but it's good! Really, I'm not kidding, and the menu even had words like \"seitan\" and \"tempeh.\" The best thing we had was their gussied-up, more veggie-filled versions of the tortilla española, with eggplant in my case and courgettes, or baby squash, in Becca's. There was plenty of cheese and plenty of salt, and the layers of potato and egg and eggplant almost melted together, they were so smooth.We did have an odd seaweed pasta in a balsamic sauce, literally strips of seaweed taking the place of old-fashioned pasta. I'm sure it's a low-carb dieter's dream. It didn't taste bad exactly, but it didn't really taste good. Ambitious and imaginative, though, so I would give a B for effort.And to prove that it is not a restaurant devoted to self-deprivation, Almanara serves an insanely delicious chocolate dessert. I'm not quite sure what it is--who knows, it might have soy or something, but it's almost as firm as a frozen custard without quite being an ice cream. It actually tastes like chocolate, unlike many chocolate desserts, and they serve it with those simple Maria biscuits I like so much. That was our last meal in Sevilla. The next day, Becca got on a plane back to New York and I got on a bus to Salamanca. (And 5 days later, here I am in Santiago de Compostela, getting ready to go on to Bilbao tomorrow.)

Moroccan food and architecture in Granada

I have to admit, it was a bit of relief to arrive in Granada and eat Moroccan food. Maybe it was Jaime's stories about the less-than-innocent origins of the Spanish love of pork, but I was ready to eat something other than jamón, and Granada turned out to be one of the best places to do so. All over Spain, I'd seen signs of Muslim immigration, but in Granada, the Moroccan presence was strongest, from the Moroccan crafts sold to tourists to the teterias or tea shops all over the Albayzin, the old and now new Muslim quarter. And of course, Granada is the home of the Alhambra.We had a good lunch at a random little shop, more of a café than a restaurant with low tables on which they served good hummus and kefta, translated for Spaniards as albondigas, and which we know as those Middle Eastern meatballs. And then we found dinner at Restaurante Arrayanes.It was obviously a popular restaurant and it filled up quickly after we walked in. The owner treated the restaurant like his baby and came to every table, asking if we needed anything, if we were enjoying ourselves. As a true Muslim restaurant, it didn't serve alcohol, but it did serve a delicious lemonade made with mint.The food was good, if not the best Moroccan meal I've ever had, but one thing did truly stand out--the \"Macedonian\" dessert. It was the dessert of the day, not on the menu, and so I'm not quite sure if it's literally called a \"Macedonian.\" It was a soft molded dessert, not quite a custard but not quite a cake. It was sweet without being cloying and so comforting, you could feed it to a baby. We argued for a bit about what was in it--Becca thought saffron and coconut, I argued that it was carrot. I was gleeful when it turned out I was right. It had reminded me very much of an Indian carrot pudding I had years ago in San Francisco.And so we were fortified for our hike up and around the Alhambra the next morning, but the need to cleanse myself of ham didn't last long. The next night, we were back to plates of jam, cheese and olives, washed down with a touristy pitcher of sangria. Ah!

I'm so glad you're enjoying Spain, Grace! As usual, I love your posts, but as usual, pedantry is the only thing that actually manages to move me to leave a comment:\"Macedonia\" is just the term they use for fruit salad in Spain, France, and Italy, including the horrible canned stuff produced by Del Monte et al. There's even a wikipedia entry for it, apparently:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(food)But what you're eating looks like some variation on carrot halwa (the Arabic term they also use in India), decorated with some kiwi and mandarin slices. I don't know much about Moroccan food, but have seen Sephardic/North African recipes for something similar in both my Claudia Rodin and another Jewish cookbook. Macedonia sounds to me like a shrugging translation based on the garnish.Looking at the picture makes me hungry for a sweet, notwithstanding my Halloween gorging!

Ah, Anna, as always, you are fount of random knowledge! Thanks for the clarification and the word \"halwa.\" I kept saying to Becca it reminded me of \"halvah,\" and she looked at me like, no, it is not a sesame candy.

Córdoba was an easy trip from Sevilla, a short train ride that deposited us quickly near the winding, narrow alleyways of the historic center, where the tourist-to-local ratio feels like it's 10 to 1. But when we went just a few blocks beyond the Mezquita, the justly famous mosque, we found quiet streets lined with white buildings and colorful flowerpots hanging on the walls. Our favorite restaurant turned out to be just outside the old city walls. We had already had an afternoon snack at El Olivo, two glasses of manzanilla, the slightly salty yet appealing sherry so popular in Andalucia, and a plate of fried calamari, but we went back for dinner because of Jaime, the tour guide at Casa de Sefarad a museum devoted to the history of Sephardic Jews in Spain.Jaime will probably be one of my favorite memories of Spain, rivaling the sight of Becca whizzing around the Mezquita in a wheelchair to rest her lame foot. The museum is located close to the one synagogue that wasn't destroyed in Córdoba, and although it's very small, really just 5 or 6 rooms, Jaime has so much to say, you can't help but leave feeling a bit heady. He's a classic nerd, so intensely interested in his subject that he draws everyone in, like a black hole. But he's not at all the shy, retiring kind of nerd. He's more like the arrogant professor who's well-aware that he knows a lot, and although that would be annoying in a friend, it's quite ideal in a tour guide.We learned from Jaime how the Spanish love of jamon and all pork products comes, in part, from the Spanish desire to distinguish themselves from Jews or, in the case of the convertidos, to prove that they were no longer Jews after their expulsion in 1492. He also told us how at the same time, many of Spain's most beloved dishes have Jewish origins. He talked about Maimonides, about families buying documents to hide their Jewish origins, and about how expelled Sephardic families sought to preserve their memories of their lives in Spain. Whenever he asked if there were any questions, he was met by a stunned, yet gratified silence.In the end, though, Becca had a question. After all the other tourists had left and we were chatting with him about menorahs in the gift shop, she asked for a restaurant recommendation, a place that was good but \"informal.\" \"iInformal!\" he exclaimed. \"Quel horreur!\" (He literally said that in French.)After we stopped laughing, he did recommend \"El Olivo,\" and thus cemented his place in my memories as a most knowledgeable person. The plaza, which had been sunny and pleasant earlier, was now golden with the light reflecting off the stone of the city walls. It was mid-October and we were sitting outside in weather that felt like the best of New York's summer nights.Becca loved her pisto, which turned out to be a Spanish version of ratatouille served with two fried eggs. There were plenty of tomatoes to make it sweet and lovable.And I, I adored my chuletitas de cordero, or grilled baby lamp chops liberally salted with coarse sea salt. They were possibly in the top 5 favorite things I've eaten in Spain, so simple and so good. I could have eaten 10 more. (It also felt right to eat lamb after feeding murcillo or blood sausage to Becca earlier that day.)When it was time to order dessert, I insisted we order two. I thought Becca's choice of pears poached in red wine was boring and got tarta de queso, or Spanish cheesecake, instead. They were both good but the pears put Becca over the edge. I had to admit I'd never had poached pears so smoothly delicious, like eating pear mousse. I accused Becca, \"I thought you didn't like soft desserts!\" to which she retorted, \"I do when they're this good.\"And then the kind old waiter brought us, on the house, glasses of ice-cold sweet lemony liqueur.As Becca put it, \"If I were Spanish, I would never leave Spain.\"

Sevilla seems like the kind of place where people would eat fried fish. The Rio Guadalquivir runs through the town, with most of the old city on the eastern bank, but with the old fishing neighborhood of Triana on the western bank. The city has developed smooth bike lanes that run along much of the river, as well as a lovely new bicycle-based public transportation system, Sevici, where you can pick up a bike from one station and drop it off at another station clear across town for about 1 Euro every half hour. The bikes are insanely heavy, maybe to keep you from being tempted to steal it, but they have sturdy bike baskets, good night lights, and everything else you would need to cruise around town. Brand-new bike system + brand-new river-view bike lanes = sheer joy.So back to the fried fish. It's such a stereotype that people in Sevilla don't work very much and just enjoy life sitting in the thousand little plazas that dot the city, but cruising around town and sitting in those same plazas ourselves, it did seem sort of true. And that kind of carefree, easygoing attitude just seems to go with an affinity for fried fish, especially since fried fish goes so well with a sunny plaza and a cold beer. Of course, my view is probably colored by the fact that Sevilla actually is famous for pescaito frito, or a platter of assorted fried fish. One night, Becca and I biked from our apartment on the western edge of the old city to the Jardines Murillo, the northeastern edge. We made our way to Modesto, a casual seafood-focused restaurant so big and popular, it took up two separate plazas and two separate indoor spaces facing each other. We got a platter of pimentos de padron to share, while she ordered the famed pescaito frito and I got the cazón frito en adobo.The pimientos de padrón were on my to-do list because of an essay by Calvin Trillin in his book, \"Feeding a Yen.\" (Others say, \"I did Madrid,\" or \"I did Granada,\" but I say, \"I did pimientos de padrón.\") According to Calvin Trillin, they come from Galicia, the state on the northwestern tip of Spain. They are local only to Galicia and are extremely hard to find outside of Galicia, as their season is also very short. In fact, I don't even know for sure that our pimientos de padrón were the real thing. But I do know for sure that they were very good.They turned out to be thin-skinned little green peppers, fried and then liberally salted with sea salt. It was like eating potato chips but better. They were the only green peppers I have ever really loved. Every once in awhile, and you have no idea when, you may encounter a spicy one, but they're otherwise mild and easily lovable. Becca loved them so much, we came back our last day in Sevilla and ordered one platter and then another. They went excellently with Cruzcampo, the light and tasty local beer.The fried cazón turned out to be chunks of tender dogfish tossed or marinated in some sort of spice that made it pleasantly salty and almost tart. We enjoyed this very much, too.The famed pescaito, however, was not so universally loved. It was another dish that I ate most of, even though Becca had ordered it. There was quite an assortment of fish, from fried anchovies to small red, curled-up fish (had they died that way?), even a bit of fried fish roe. I popped the fried anchovies like they were popcorn and was thankful for my good appetite.When we came back almost a week later and ate our two plates of pimientos, we also shared a plate of coquinas, these skinny little clams barely bigger than the tip of your thumb. They'd been cooked in lots of olive oil and salt, and I loved them, too. I hope New York gets a public bike system soon. Mayor Bloomberg, do you hear me? We already have the river, if not the attitude. Would it be too much to also hope for a place that sells pimentos de padron, fried fish, and coquinas, and maybe an extra plaza or two?

Arriving in Sevilla

***CONTENT
(Now I am really behind--I'm in chilly Salamanca, having left sunny Andalucía behind, but just starting to blog about Sevilla.)Arriving in Sevilla was a joy. My flight left Barcelona before dawn, but when I arrived in Sevilla at 9:30 a.m., it was sunny and just starting to get warm. The apartment Becca and I rented was in the barrio of Macarena, a formerly working class neighborhood on the western edge of the old city that is being colonized by hipsters, complete with hipster dads pushing strollers through the nearby park, Alameda de Hercules. I had found it online at Embrujo de Sevilla, and it went beyond all expectations, with its soaring ceilings, sparkling clean, bright IKEA furniture, a dishwasher and washing machine, AND a roof terrace. It was nicer than my own apartment. In many ways, Sevilla reminded me of Mexico, and Becca agreed, it was the most Latin American of the Spanish cities she's been to. The buildings were low and brightly painted, and you knew there were sunny courtyards in nearly every one. Even the machismo was the same; after two weeks of walking unnoticed, I started getting catcalls and kissy noises again. People spoke even more quickly than they had in Madrid, and they swallowed the ends of their words like Caribbeans, but they smiled more easily than their compatriots in Madrid and I felt happy again that I could speak Spanish, más o menos. And being outside Spain's biggest cities, I began to see and enjoy the little mistranslations I saw everywhere. Growing up in Korea, we'd always gotten a big kick out of the way Korean words were translated into English, and it was strangely gratifying to see the Spanish were as bad as the Koreans. The best, or the worst, was definitely at Taberna del Alabardero, a restaurant in Sevilla, where at the end of our meal, we were presented with an evaluation form, including a place to rate the \"saw-off\" we got. But the meal itself was one of the loveliest Becca and I had in Andalucía. It looked like a favorite of moneyed Sevillians, judging by the way the other guests were dressed, but the happy waitress was warm without formality, as the restaurant itself is. When you walk in, you see a classic Sevillian space, a light and airy courtyard brightened even more by its yellow paint. The dining rooms are off the courtyard and have beautiful Moorish tiles to look at while you eat. The food was also classically Spanish, simple, a bit too salty, and very flavorful. I loved my appetizer of \"maccarones con salsa de tinta y calamares,\" the pasta and squid so perfectly toothsome. Becca also loved her \"crema de puerro con salteado de verduras y langostinos,\" a creamy leek soup with deeply caramelized vegetables and shrimp. Our favorite, though, was the \"merluza en salsa verde,\" or hake in a herby green sauce, served with a poached egg. The fish was obviously fresh, the sauce very bright and it managed to be delicious in and of itself, without needing to resort to heavy flavors.Becca didn't like her \"chuleta de cerdo con col y melocoton,\" or pork with caramelized cabbage and a peach sauce but I loved it. We realized Becca doesn't really like the texture of most Spanish meat, but I liked the way it was both flavorful and chewy without being dry, and I loved the peach sauce which was more tart than sweet.We couldn't miss dessert--the whole three-course meal only cost 12,90 Euros! I also learned that Becca doesn't like soft desserts, other than whipped cream, as she wasn't too fond of the \"flan de naranja con magdalena tibia y salsa de menta,\" or orange flan with madeleines and mint sauce, or the chocolate mousse cake that was the special of the day. It was a happy realization for me, since I got to eat almost all of both desserts.But as always, the best meals aren't only about the food. Our young waitress, more blonde than you would ever expect a Spaniard to be, was so happy and kind. She spoke fairly good English and only laughed when we started to confuse her by speaking English and Spanish simultaneously. When she saw me looking at the little bottles of olive oil on the table, she brought me 4 more to take home, which went immediately clinking into my bag. (I ended up leaving 3 in the apartment for future tenants, but took one in case I saw a good tomato on the road.) There was no question, we rated the \"saw-off\" as excellent.

I finally got a Spaniard to ask me where I was from, while eating breakfast solo at El Quim in La Boqueria, my last full day in Barcelona.In Mexico, I got asked 5 times a day where I was from, from the cabdriver to the waitress to the guy working in the cemetery who insisted that I see where Benito Juarez's daughter was buried and then shyly showed me photos of him riding a bull attached to his keychain. Almost always, the question was asked with curiosity, warmth and kindness. But in Spain, in the 3 weeks I have been here, I have been asked that question once.El Quim belongs a Spanish food genre that doesn't exist in the U.S., not quite a restaurant, more of a counter, but not like a diner, as it may very well serve wine, beer, and sparkling Spanish cava, not to mention razor clams, calamari, and jamon iberico. El Quim, even within this marvelous class, is near the very top. It's a wonder just to watch the owner and his assistants move with sureness and speed in the little space that serves as their kitchen behind the counter. El Quim is one of the young upstarts that have started to challenge the legend of Pinotxo at La Boqueria, and I say, \"The more the merrier!\" Although El Quim does list a menu on a board behind the counter, it's not actually comprehensible. There are clearly things displayed in the glass case on the counter that are not on the board, and I did what I have learned to do brazenly, gawk at what others are eating. I even made a full circuit around the U-shaped bar, dismissing the tortilla espanola as old hat, dismissing eggs as too typically American for breakfast. Finally, on my second turn around the stall, I noticed a man at one end eating a round, flat earthenware dish of a red, chunky stew. \"Cual es?\" I asked. I don't know why I bothered, as I didn't understand the response, \"Callos,\" but it looked very much like tripe, one of my favorite things to eat. THAT would not be a typically American breakfast for sure. So I sat down next to him and ordered the same.My God, it was so good! The tripe was wonderful, so tender and yet still springy. There were chunks of sausage and plenty of tomato sauce that I sopped up with pieces of good crusty bread. The nice guy behind the counter had filled my plate almost to overflowing, but I couldn't stop eating. It may go down in memory as one of the best breakfasts I have ever had, if not one of the best meals. As I ate in gusto, I could tell the man next to me was glancing at me from time to time. I recognized the question emanating from him: who was this Asian woman who spoke Spanish with an American accent, who thought nothing of eating tripe for breakfast? In Mexico, he would have asked the question immediately, but it stalled for awhile. But in the end, he had to ask.I had done it, me and my stomach. I had finally made someone in Spain ask, \"De donde eres?\"

Hola from India! I'm enjoying reading about your Spanish culinary adventures, even while I gorge myself on all things masala. Definitely a difference in the two countries, but don't discount the impact of being alone- I think that wherever I am, I wind up having far more authentic conversations when I'm alone, versus being with another traveler.Te extrano, amiga!

I had been a little apprehensive about what the cooking class might be like at Cook and Taste in Barcelona. It was listed in my Lonely Planet, and a poster on Chowhound had recommended it, but I had been afraid that it was a school targeted to tourists wanting to swill sangria and that it would inevitably avoid \"scary\" ingredients. When I saw the menu, I wasn't really reassured: tortilla espanola (the eponymous potato omelet), paella (the eponymous rice dish), sopa de tomates (suspiciously like the eponymous gazpacho), and crema catalana (suspiciously like flan). I wanted to learn how to make food that was essentially Spanish, but also to learn more about Spanish food than I could in New York.But as I've learned so often on my travels, my pessimism was greatly misplaced. Bego, our teacher, was instantly likable, a somewhat serious woman with a quiet but sharp sense of humor. She had been an engineer for years and had started the cooking school as a major career change, but she kept her kitchen clean and her knives sharp like any professionally trained chef. And there was cuttlefish in the paella, bought fresh from La Boqueria that morning.The class wasn't big, three middle-aged women traveling through Italy and Spain together from Los Angeles, me and Anne, one young guy who was clearly a foodie from Australia, and then one motorcycle instructor from England, who it turned out never cooked but had been sent there as part of a tour package. We cooked through the recipes together, two volunteers at a time joining Bego, but all of us watching on, which was a nice change from the team-approach at other cooking schools I've been to. What I loved best was definitely the sopa, the cold soup that she served in little glasses, with a pungent garnish of garlic aioli, hazelnuts, and a hard grated cheese. The tomatoes were almost raw, having only been blanched in boiling water to remove their skins, but sweet and red. It was as beautiful as it was good.Tortilla espanola, I have never particularly cared for, since potatoes are not my favorite vegetable. Bego revealed that the question of whether onion should be added to the potatoes cooked in oil was a controversial question in Spain, one that could even divide families. When I asked Isaac, Mao-Mei's husband about it, he said, \"Huh, that's funny. I never eat tortilla without onion,\" proving her point. But this tortilla, so expertly flipped by Anne, did have a lovely golden crust, and although I still will order almost anything else at a tapas bar, I can see how it's the kind of everyday food that I love, simple, cheap, filling, and tasty.The other controversy in Spanish cooking is apparently whether lemon should be squeezed on paella or not. Bego warned us, if we're invited to a Spanish home and served paella without lemon, not to ask for it. Anne and I had avoided paella up to that point, since it's the kind of thing that tends to get advertised by garish backlit photographs at tourist restaurants, and we both loved what the lemon juice added to the prawns and the cuttlefish, the tomatoes, and almost al dente rice. I loved how the grains felt in my mouth, as if each grain had its own integrity.Crema catalana, in the end, turned out to be a Catalan version of crème brulee, complete with blowtorching of the sugar on top. I liked it, as I like almost all custards, but I think you can imagine what it was like without much more description.I had to admit, what was typical was still real and still good. I left New York to be humbled, to stop being so sure of what I like and what I don't. It's happening.

Even before I had ever tasted them, I knew I would love razor clams. I loved the way they looked at Maceiras in Madrid, at the table next to us, I loved the way they looked in the markets with their long, slim shells and the clam body sticking out at the end like a tongue. I just didn't know how much I would love them until I finally tried them at Alta Taberna Paco Meralgo in Barcelona.Paco Meralgo is a spruced-up tapas bar in the L'Eixample neighborhood with no tables, but blond wood counters running all around and through the restaurant and plenty of bar stools. It's quick and it's busy, bustling with good food and happy people. Anne and I were overwhelmed by the Catalan menu, and frankly, by the Castilian menu as well, but our waiter kindly made a few recommendations to fill out our dinner beyond razor clams. We loved the three kinds of setas or wild mushrooms, liberally drizzled with olive oil, especially an inky-black one that looked as crinkled as seaweed. Based on the signs we read in La Boqueria, we think they were \"trompetas de la mort.\" We enjoyed more croquetas and the crunchy, thin tortillitas de camarones, studded with tiny bits of shrimp. But the first bite I had of my razor clam was like heaven. It tasted salty like the sea, with so much chewy flavor and none of the bitter graininess that you sometimes find in clams. It was seriously succulent. It was possibly one of the top ten most delicious things I've ever eaten.I liked it so much that I licked my razor clamshell from one end to the other, to get all the juice. When Anne saw what I was doing, she offered me her second razor clam, saying that I was enjoying it so much more than she was. Normally, I would be polite and refuse but I couldn't. I ate three, she ate one.I really love Anne, I really do.

I'm surprised that this is your first encounter with razor clams. I love them too. When you come back we can feast on them at casa mono -- my treat. Why are yours so big, though? The ones I've tried have always been pretty small...

(I'm now in Ronda with Becca, having spent the last week traveling through Andalucia, so I'm playing major catch-up. Lo siento!)I liked Barcelona so much more than Madrid. Largely, it's because in Catalonia, Anne and I stayed for a chunk of time with our friend Mao-Mei and her husband Isaac in Vilafranca, a small town outside of Barcelona in the heart of cava, or sparkling wine, country. And partly, it's because I had massive culture shock coming to Spain from Mexico. After Mexico, I expected salespeople to greet me like I was a long-lost cousin, waiters to smile with approval at what I ordered, and everyone to be complimentary about my Spanish. It turns out that's just a Latin American thing. In Madrid, until we met up with a friend of a friend who lives in Madrid, Anne and I lived in a little tourist bubble, moving silently among the madrilenos. But being who I am, one of the big reasons I loved Barcelona was the food. Despite our morning adventures, breakfast was not Madrid's strong suit, whereas in Barcelona, I had some of the most memorable breakfasts of my life at La Boqueria, Barcelona's famed market.Our first morning in Barcelona, Anne and I went straight to Pinotxo, the most famous bar/food stand in La Boqueria, which is immediately visible the moment you walk in the Ramblas gate. Juan, the owner, has been greeting locals and tourists for many years. There's no menu, so I tried to hold off ordering for as long as possible, to see what everyone else was eating. We got a big plate of chickpeas in a strong, olive sauce; some ham croquetas that melted away, and two little glasses of café con leche. But we were still hungry. \"Could I have one of those donuts over there?\" I asked.\"No, they're not available,\" the counterman said. \"They've been reserved.\"Reserved! We inquired about their name, xuxo, pronounced \"chu-cho,\" Anne and I looked at each other. The solution was obvious. \"Please, could we reserve donuts for tomorrow?\"\"Two?\"\"Yes, two!\"\"Okay, I'll remember!\"The next day, there they were, waiting for us on top of the espresso maker. (TIP: if you get there early enough, around 9:15, there will be some unreserved donuts left, but you'll have to move fast.) Anne and I hadn't even really known what they were when we reserved them, knowing only that they were beautifully brown and dusted with a good quantity of granulated sugar. So imagine our surprise when we bit into them and found a lovely, light cream inside. The outer layers were as flaky and crisp as a good croissant. It was like someone had taken the idea of a Boston cream donut and made it 1000 times better. Later, when we talked to Bego, our cooking teacher about them, she nodded knowingly and said, \"Yes, Pinotxo is the place to eat xuxos. You'll see them elsewhere, but they're not the same.\"Would it be wrong to name a child, \"Xuxo\"? Perhaps a dog would be better.

My mother loves to look at what other people are eating. We all think the grass is greener on the other side but my mom takes it to a whole new level. When our dog was still alive, she would take him for walks and brazenly look in the windows of restaurants in our Sucho-dong neighborhood in Seoul. Sometimes, she would even hold him up to the window so he, too, could see what people were eating. Who knows what the diners thought, seeing a middle-aged woman and a Yorkshire terrier watching them eat, but she didn't care.Weird tics diminish with each generation, so when I was in Madrid, eating with Anne at Maceiras at Calle Huertas, 66, I didn't have the courage to stare full-on at the three boys eating at the table next to us. But I wanted to. Maceiras is a Galician tapas bar, Galicia being the region in the northwest corner of Spain, renowned for its seafood, and these boys were taking full advantage. Being on Huertas, a street known for its bars, Maceiras had an English menu (and a French one, and a German one), but Anne and I still had trouble picking our food. Our neighbors, on the other hand, had obviously hearty appetites and they ate wave after wave of food: a big bowl of razor clams, 2 plates of steak and French fries, and so many other things I couldn't quite identify and so could only gaze upon with wonder.Our meal itself was very good, but I think we could have benefited from their sure-footed expertise. It turns out an empanada in Galicia is neither a flaky turnover or a maiz tortilla filled with mole amarillo, but a bready, almost casserole-like dish in which some filling of fish or meat can be found in the middle. Hearty and I'm sure satisfying for a hungry Galician peasant, but not revelatory. Similarly, Anne and I felt just okay about the croquetas. There was nothing wrong with them, they weren't greasy, but I think they must be like French fries here for Spaniards, standard and beloved and so they are on every menu.The pulpo, or octopus, however, was excellent, meaty and succulent.The mushrooms sautéed with jamon were also very good, though probably not as nutritious as we told ourselves they were, being one of the few vegetable dishes we ate in Madrid.The restaurant was bustling, with plenty of tourists looking for good cheap food, but plenty of locals, too. It was busy but warm, and I loved its rough-hewn tables and even the amateur, unstylized bird on their bright green sign. I also loved how the wine was served in small white bowls; I just love drinking things in bowls. Must be my Asian blood.Perhaps if I were as brazen as my mother, I could have asked those boys what they were eating or even asked for a taste, but sadly, I am not.

It's funny what you realize about your country only once you leave it. Americans, and I include myself, really like to see a list of available items and their prices. It's important to know how much your coffee costs and that it comes in small, medium, and large. Perhaps it's because we're a very diverse country, and you can never really know what you'll find, or perhaps it's because we know we can be gouged. In Spain, however, things are different. In Madrid, in particular, with its old-school, bocadillo bars and little corner cafes, it was hard to find anything announcing what you could get. So imagine poor Anne and me arriving early in the morning into Madrid, changing trains twice to get from the airport to the hotel by subway, and then looking for breakfast, bleary-eyed. I can barely remember that the café was called Chocolate, and that there was a long bar with middle-aged men eating pastries and drinking coffee and a few café tables. There was a menu on the table, but it seemed to list only fruity, expensive juices, nothing about the coffee everyone was clearly drinking, nor the churros everyone was eating. No one else seemed perturbed; clearly, they all knew what was available. I tried to ask in my Mexican-accented Spanish what was available, and the most we could understand was that there were churros and tostada, or toast. Okay then, some churros and tostada! We were also offered brightly wrapped candies or chocolate, and we had no idea what they were or what they cost or perhaps they were free, who knows?But we did get better at navigating breakfast. We managed to locate places in small alleys, which is no small feat as the old part of Madrid is 90% small alleys, and we lost the fear that we would be charged something exorbitant and unexpected because we never were. Anne found a strong endorsement for Chocolateria San Gines near Puerta del Sol, and by then, we had learned enough to know that churros were skinny and sugarless and that something called purros or parros were a fatter version, similar to the crullers Chinese people like to eat for breakfast with their congee. It was a good thing Anne had done this research because here, also, there was no menu. That didn't detour us, though, and we boldly ordered one of both, cost be damned, and happily dipped them into the thickest hot chocolate I have ever had in my life. It almost sat in my spoon like pudding. I almost didn't miss my morning coffee, the chocolate was so intense. So this is why the churros weren't dusted with sugar! And our breakfast, as always, cost less than expected.Our triumph was complete when we ate croissants at Antigua Pasteleria on Calle Pozo, a tiny little one-block street near Puerta del Sol. We had walked by one morning too early, as it didn't open till 9:30 a.m., but we had seen through the screen doors the happy fat bakers at work. When they saw us peering in, they smiled, \"Buenos dias,\" and we promised each other we could come back the next day.The croissants were unlike any croissants I'd ever had. In my former, snootier life, I might not have ordered them, as I used to be very orthodox about my croissants. They were glazed with an orange-scented marmalade and they pulled apart like sweet challah, but even eggier. There was nothing flaky about them, nothing that shattered, nothing that meant my old criteria for an excellent croissant, but I really enjoyed mine. The bakery didn't sell coffee, so Anne and I wandered towards Puerta del Sol until we found a standard Au Bon Pain-type eatery, which being in Spain, made all its coffee using espresso machines. We found a quiet corner upstairs, with a big window looking out towards Puerta del Sol and ate our croissants and drank our cafes con leche. I don't know how Anne felt, but I felt proud, like I had come a long way.

Anne is one of the best people you could ever travel with. I know that I can be judgmental, opinionated, and incredibly annoying, especially when it comes to food, but Anne was gracious and kind the entire time we were traveling together in Madrid and Barcelona. Even when I took her to an over-the-top fancy and expensive restaurant in Madrid, where we awkwardly sat surrounded by ladies who lunch and businessmen in suits, she only laughed. In the end, I think we had more fun than anyone else in that restaurant.I had picked Zaranda because the Maribel Guides said they offered a fantastic 20-28 Euro prix-fixe lunch. Sadly, it was no longer true and we sat there for at least five minutes, wondering if we should just scurry away, poor American mice that we are. I felt so disoriented, and although the very energetic waiter spoke English, his translation of the menu was so rushed. He kept asking us what we wanted, and when Anne finally chose a baby squid appetizer, I said to her, \"I didn't know you liked squid!\", to which she replied, \"I didn't know what it was, I just had to make him stop!\" Also sadly, Zaranda seemed to be a restaurant where most people don't eat all their food. To me, that's the only explanation for why the waitstaff kept whisking things away before we were done. So although Anne loved the little sesame cracker in the hors d'oeuvres tray, I never got to have any.It's not that the food wasn't good. The amuse-bouche, a monkfish liver, was sharply salty and delicious, meeting that craving that potato chips meet in a much more downmarket way. And it seemed right that at least at some point in Spain, I should eat something with foam on it.The chipirone, or the young squid, was also very good, perfectly tender and succulent.Anne's young female chicken seemed very bland to me, but I enjoyed my solomillo, or beef filet, with a potato stuffed with menudillos. The waiter translated \"menudillos\" as kidneys, my dictionary says giblets, and I'm inclined to go with the waiter as I've never heard of a cow with giblets. It's hard with fancy restaurants that like to use words in fanciful ways. I sat there just staring at the menu, feeling like I had learned nothing in four months in Mexico. In any case, it was tender and tasty, though I'm the kind of girl that likes my beef to have some chew to it. I was more excited to be eating menudillos, which had a strong but not unpleasant taste.The best part, though, was when it came to dessert. When we ordered the toffee molten cake, we were told that it would take some extra time and were fed complimentary little cups of a light, white custard with passionfruit jelly on top. This was delicious and I loved it.The toffee cake wasn't bad either, and we finished that, too. But then, as we began to relax and think about how this whole disorienting experience might soon be over, the waiter came over with a platter of little cookies, the petit-fours, saying as he presented them, \"Normally, I bring these over with the coffee, and I didn't know what to do since you didn't order any coffee, but I thought I'd bring them anyway.\" He meant well, but I guffawed when Anne whispered, \"He didn't know what to do with people as cheap as us, but here are the cookies anyway!\"I almost died laughing when Anne followed up with, \"I bet we're the only people in this restaurant who would even consider staying at the Hostal Lopez.\" She thought it even funnier that after our meal, we finished the day by touring the stadium Santiago Bernabeu, the home of the Real Madrid futbol team, where she took a particularly memorable photo of me clutching my heart in front of a larger-than-life photo of Zinedine Zidane. I don't mean to be criticizing Zaranda, which I'm sure provides a delectable experience for those who are fortunate enough to enjoy it without a thought for their pocketbooks. I'm just happy that Anne and I will have memories of Zaranda that go way, way beyond the food.

By the time we got to Segovia, our fourth full day in Spain, Anne and I were full of culture, and not in a happy way. Our first day, we arrived in Madrid at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. NY-time), felt a rush of energy from the thrill of being in Spain, and marched out at 9:30 a.m. to see the Palacio Real, the Royal Palace. We kept this up somehow for a couple of days, seeing museums and palaces and cathedrals, and by the third evening, when we had gotten home from a day-trip to Toledo, I said to Anne wanly from my bed, \"If you don't mind, I think I'll sit in a café while you look at the Alcázar in Segovia tomorrow.\"But as we sat on the bus to Segovia, my spirits lifted as I read about Segovia's specialty--roast suckling pig, or cochinillo. Segovia itself was beautiful, sunny and inviting, in a way that Toledo with its dark, cramped alleys just hadn't been. I was moved by the 2000-year-old Roman aqueducts, and even enjoyed the Moorish Alcázar, with its Sleeping Beauty turrets and large picture windows, revealing views of rivers, minor castles, and enormous sky. And when it was time to eat lunch, I realized just how much I liked Segovia.We chose Narizotas, more for its sunny patio than anything else, and ordered the \"menu del dia turistico,\" which includes a soup of judiones, or white beans, cochinillo, ice cream for dessert, and the glass of wine that is so obligatory, it's almost always included in the prix-fixe lunches. We also added a plate of jamón ibérico, our first taste of Spain's famed ham.The jamón was as delicious as it looked, and we congratulated ourselves for eating vegetables, the ripe tomatoes and herby green sauce, sharp with mustard, that came with the jamón. It's good that Anne is a doctor, as she was able to reassure me that despite the serious lack of vegetables in my life here, I would not get scurvy in 7 weeks. The soup of judiones beans was simple, lots of tomatoes and chunks of meat. Good, but not exciting, and to be quite honest, I had a little bit of trouble eating meat that still seemed to have some hair stuck to it. But the cochinillo was everything I had dreamed it would be. Cochinillo is always made from a 21-day-old piglet that has eaten nothing but its mother's milk. I don't know any more because I didn't have time to do sufficient research on Spanish food before leaving, but luckily, I didn't need to know more to eat with gusto. The skin didn't merely crackle, it shattered, and the meat was incredibly tender, melting in its own fat.We sat in the sun, drinking wine and sparkling water, eating roast pig and watching Segovia locals and tourists walk by. It's what you imagine life in Spain to be like, no?

Before I left for Spain, I had a friend say to me, \"You know, my friend So-and-So didn't really like the food in Spain.\" To which I replied, \"But she doesn't eat pork!\" And my friend had to agree that So-and-So would probably not be the best judge of food in Spain.Spain is famous for its jamón, or ham, giant hind legs of the pig, complete with hoof, that you see hanging everywhere. The hoof, I've learned, is attached to the leg for an important reason, but I'll get to that later. The first time I saw them displayed, I got very excited and started taking pictures, but the sight of them is almost passé to me now. Eating them, of course, will never be passé.Anne and I arrived in Barcelona on Monday afternoon and stayed in Barcelona proper for two nights before heading to Vilafranca del Penedés, a town of about 35,000 people an hour outside of Barcelona, where our friend Mao-Mei lives with her Catalan husband, Isaac. (I'm going to have to go back and write more about Madrid.) Barcelona immediately felt very different from Madrid--warmer, both in terms of temperature and attitude, and very open, with its Paris-like wide boulevards as beautiful and as striking as the medieval warren of streets of the the Barri Gotic. The Moderniste architecture by Gaudi and others adds an immediately whimsical feel to the city, but Anne and I may also like Barcelona so much because after all the churches and castles of Madrid, we took a bike tour and a cooking class in Barcelona. The cooking class included a market tour of La Boqueria, the oldest market in Barcelona and the most famous. Located right off the Ramblas, the main thoroughfare as touristy as Times Square but more attractive, La Boqueria draws a lot of tourists as well. But it's also a real, functioning market. I saw one butcher showing off pictures of her granddaughter to a regular, and as Bego, our teacher pointed out, you could see the changes in Spanish society by the new stands focused on Asian or Latin American ingredients. I even saw a Korean stand called \"Macitta,\" which means \"delicious\" in Korean, though they seemed mainly to sell a lot of prepared food and instant ramen.For an American who glories in gory food, La Boqueria was heaven. There were chickens with their heads still on, heads of lambs complete with eyeballs, and skinned rabbits laid-out with their little butts facing up, like darling little sunbathers. And the seafood! My God, when I think of the fish stands of your average American supermarket and how you can't find a freakin' whole fish. I saw big octopi with their tentacles spreading like blooming flowers, shiny little herrings, entire stands devoted to bacalao or salt cod, and funny fish heads that I almost wanted to talk to.But the highlight of the market tour, to be sure, was when Bego explained how to pick a good ham. First, you get what you pay for. Second, the \"pata negra\" or the black hoof belongs to the best pigs, the black ones who feed on acorns and wander free-range in the Extremedura. This is what is called jamón iberico, and as it's the priciest, you need to make sure that you are truly getting jam from a black pig. Show me the hoof! One seller we saw had a flat-screen TV showing his pigs, presumably, frolicking in the meadow.Once the ham has been sliced through, you can look for things like a thick, white rather than yellow layer of fat around the ham. There should also be small white specks in the red part of the ham itself, as that indicates that it has been well-cured.Once you have such a fine ham, Bego advised that it had to be served correctly, always at room temperature. If vacuum-packed, the ham should be opened for at least half an hour before serving.When I asked how long a ham would last, Bego smiled and said, \"It goes very fast.\" But if you ration yourself, your ham can last as long as three months. You can leave it hanging out at room temperature, using the outer layer of fat to cover the cut area. I instantly had a beautiful image of a ham hanging from the ceiling in my Brooklyn kitchen, but can you imagine me trying to squeeze a giant leg of ham into my backpack? Dreams, sueños, dreams.

As shocking as it seems, but I didn't plan out my entire food itinerary before I got here. I only had reservations at one restaurant in Madrid, I had no list of \"must-dos.\" What I wanted to feel was the culture of food here, for ordinary people everyday, to be in a world where anchovies were normal. Poor Anne, she patiently followed me as I walked up and down the aisles of the grocery store at the basement of the department store chain, El Corte Ingles, not looking at me like I was a crazy person while I peered at flan sold in pudding packs, tins of shellfish, and jars of marmalade. She even took a photo of me caressing an entire ham.So in my first 6 days in Spain, in Madrid, I've inevitably had meals that were so-so, not bad, just very ordinary, except it wouldn't have been very ordinary in New York. I had a cheap bocadillo, or sandwich, the other day, a plain almost tough roll with some fried boquerones, or white anchovies, inside, no mayo, no sauce, no nothing. It was the equivalent of a decent slice of pizza on any random corner in N, but in NY, Whole Foods sells boquerones for some insane price per pound.And then there are places like Txirimiri, a pintxos/tapas bar in La Latina with food so good that when I dropped half my tapa on the floor, I considered applying the five-second rule and eating it.Anne and I arrived there by accident. We were aiming for one of the more famous places in La Latina, along Calle Cava Baja or Cava Alta, but it was pouring and we jumped in. Instantly, I was overwhelmed. The bar was lined with people chatting, drinking, eating, there were pintxos, or Basque-style tapas on bread on the counter, and then a blackboard listing more. I'd read all the guide books on how tapas worked, but I felt so frozen, so totally lost. Anne says I hid it well, but I was terrified. Luckily, I didn't have to fight for the bartender's attention and I managed to order a glass of wine and two raciones, or larger portions of tapas, of the blackboard.This was called a bacalao tempura, and it came on a bed of caramelized onions and peppers, so sweet and rich, and a perfect balance to the golden cod. I had told Anne earlier how much I loved the word \"bacalao,\" and when I told her it was salt cod, she had been wary, but not after tasting this. The crisp crust, the meltingly tender fish inside--it brought fried fish to a whole new level. This was called \"habitas baby,\" and we deduced after it arrived that the \"habitas\" must refer to the beans. More caramelized onions, which was good as I can never get enough. It was like an intense, salty shot of flavor, topped with jamon and foie. By now, I was relaxed. The wine was working its magic, especially since it was so cheap, and we just started pointing and eating. I started to fall in love with Madrid. Three nights later, we came back for our last dinner in Madrid and ate another round of the bacalao and things I didn't need to identify to enjoy. Txirimiri is special and obviously popular, as packed as it is with hip young things, but in its own way, felt as ordinary as the corner bar selling bocadillos de boquerones fritos. I've long gotten over my embarrassment taking pictures of my food, but I felt a pang of sadness, knowing that to eat cheap, delicious food and drink a $2 glass of wine in a comfortable bar was nothing notable for the Spaniards around us. But not so sad that I lost my appetite.

Coming home was a horror. I'd been looking forward to going back to NY for days, maybe even weeks, but it was awful. As I tried to board my plane from Oaxaca to Houston, security forced me to leave my molcajete behind because it was in my carry-on and it was too late to put in in the luggage I had already checked. But I managed to be Zen and get on board, reminding myself how crowded my kitchen is with gadgets, except that two hours later, I arrived at an American airport where everyone was decidedly not Zen. The girl in front of me in line at immigration made a constant stream of loud, unpleasant noises about how she was going to miss her flight. The sense of self-importance was frighteningly, recognizably American. When I went to the cash register to buy my NY Times, the clerk looked at me like I had just given her yet another reason to hate her life. I sat down in my seat on a crowded plane for the Houston-NY leg, and the elderly woman next to me barely mustered a response to my hello, my English translation for the \"buenos dias\" I've gotten so used to saying to anybody and everybody. (To be fair, she was quite nice to me later, but I'd gotten so used to the Mexican way of assuming everyone is nice, instead of waiting to see.)It got worse. For our \"dinner/snack,\" Continental served \"pizza\" and a \"salad.\" I am not putting those words in quotes to be cute. There was something seriously demented about the \"food.\" The pizza, which was supposed to be steak and cheese, also declared that it was \"Made with Ranch Dressing.\" And they're bragging about this? It made the bready slice of Papa Johns pizza I had gotten before the flight seem like the finest Neopolitan pizza in retrospect. I considered eating the salad, trying to garner at least some nutritional benefit, but as I looked at plastic container filled with pieces of iceberg lettuce and a few sad shreds of carrot at the bottom, I realized I would lose more than I gained by putting the creamy dressing on it. I was better off eating the little Kit-Kat bar for the calcium in the chocolate.The worst thing about it is that everyone else ate their snack, all of it. They were hungry, I'm sure, and maybe they didn't even notice how bad it was. I almost felt like rising up, like a labor organizer, \"Demand your rights to decent food! We don't have to put up with this!\"But I didn't. Welcome home.

Best MarketThe most unbelievable one in Oaxaca City proper is Mercado Abastos, which is literally labyrinthine. Mercado 20 de noviembre and Mercado Juarez south of the zocalo are definitely worth visiting, as they are always bustling with a huge array of stuff, from leather sandals to mole pastes to nieves to piñatas. Ocotlan and Tlacolula are two exciting pueblo markets, held on Friday and Sunday, respectively, that sprawl with plenty of live animals, turkeys, rabbits, goats. Rick Bayless raves about the tamales and empanadas at Mercado de la Merced, about 8 blocks east of the zocalo, but I've never been because I had my own neighborhood market: Mercado Sanchez Pascuas. It's situated between Tinoco y Palacios and Porfirio Diaz just north of Quetzalcoatl. It can seem really dead in the afternoons, but if you go in the mornings, especially on Saturday or Sunday, it's bustling with people doing their daily marketing. This is not a country that shops once a week for groceries. In addition to the stands selling meat, fruit, cheese, and bread, there are vendors who just set up tarps outside the western entrance, selling whatever they brought in that day from their village, like roses, chiles de agua, and giant fava beans. There are two tamale sellers, the one in the middle of the meat section and another with a little table by the empanada/memela ladies near the western entrance. The one in the middle has the better tamal de mole, wrapped in banana leaf with mole negro and chicken, but the one on at the entrance has a great tamal de salsa verde, very fresh and bright.The Mercado Organico at El Pochote on Fridays and Saturdays is also terrific, but I don't think of it as a true market, as there's very little fresh produce. There is, however, some of the best street food in Oaxaca, and safe for sensitive gringo stomachs. You can also buy good Real Minera brand mezcal, from a sweet man who will pour a very generous taster of anything you want to try. The Anejo and the Reserva, I think are particularly good, and the cremas, which are sweet versions flavored with everything from passionfruit to coffee, are good alternatives for people who don't really want to be drinking mezcal. I almost always bought breads (especially the long, flat pizza-flatbreads) and Korean take-out food from Alegria de Angelis, and frequently bought the maracuya-coffee jam, the organic coffee, and pottery. The one man who consistently sells fresh produce has very beautiful lettuce and other greens, right inside the door, though it goes fast, and there are always people with unusual, striking native flowers outside the doors the same days. Don't bother showing up before 9:30 or even 10, though--you're in Mexico.Mercado Hidalgo on Emilio Carranza, a block north of Belisario Dominguez, in Colonia Reforma has beautiful produce, but it's a little out of the way for most tourists.Best SupermarketWhen you need toilet paper, dish detergent, peanut butter, and unsweetened, plain yogurt: Gigante. The one in Colonia Reforma is the spiffiest, but the one a couple of blocks west of the Basilica de la Soledad on Independencia is probably closer for most tourists. If I just need a few things, I like going to Pitico, which is a small grocery chain scattered throughout the city, bigger than a bodega but smaller than Gigante, which is sort like Kmart. I've bought good chorizo there, decent produce, as well as things like paper towels, but I've only seen Alpura brand, unsweetened yogurt at Gigante. Even though nearly all yogurt is sweetened (and watch out if it says \"no sugar,\" as it could be sweetened with Splenda), all the granola I've tried in Oaxaca, just bought at grocery stores, has been surprisingly unsweet and very good.Best BreadThe vendor furthest north, or furthest to the right as you're facing the Tinoco y Palacios entrance at Mercado Sanchez has good bread, chewy and flavorful, my favorites being the flat rolls with sesame seeds on top and the large cinnamon-raisin breads with brioche-like topknots, but only in the mornings. Pan & Co., on Constitucion at the corner of Garcia Vigil, has very good bread, including one of the best ciabattas I've ever had, but it's \"European artisanal style,\" not Mexican. I am very fond of Fidel Integral on 20 de noviembre, south of Hidalgo, which makes whole-wheat breads that don't taste like cardboard.Best CoffeeMexico produces some of the best coffee in the world, but the highest-quality tends to get exported to the U.S. and Europe, as Mexico doesn't have the coffee culture of Italy, France, or even Starbucks-America. If you are a coffee-lover, your ordinary cup in Oaxaca will probably taste a little feeble, though if you get a chance, the traditional café de olla, flavored with piloncillo or unrefined sugar and cinnamon, can be good and strong. A lot of the little fondas in the markets will just use instant Nescafe. It is possible, though, to find places in Oaxaca that serve Mexico's best, called Pluma Hidalgo. These two are my favorites: 1) El Pochote Mercado Organico, the woman with the stand farthest north, selling also whole-bean and ground coffee called \"Maravilla de Araguz\"2) Nuevo Mundo on M. Bravo between Porfirio Diaz and Alcala. I've heard Coffee Beans on Garcia Vigil, next to Café Brujula, also serves Pluma Hidalgo, and Café Antigua on Reforma north of Constitucion is also popular. Best Street FoodSo good you feel like you're going to faint, and so hot they made my nose run: empanadas de mole amarillo and tacos de chile relleno next to Iglesia Carmen de Arriba on Garcia Vigil. But almost everything at Mercado Organico is also fantastic, especially the tostadas, the mole enchiladas, and the mole tlayuda, made with what the vendors say is a Zapotecan-style of mole. I love the tamales at Mercado Sanchez, especially the ones sold from the center of the room with the meat vendors. And I will always feel a special fondness for Sra Angelita's esquites and elotes on the western side of El Llano (Parque Juarez), as that was where I had my first street food.Best nieves, aguas, and paletasIf the woman selling yogurt and fruit tarts at Mercado Organico is selling strawberry-flavored nieve, get it! Otherwise, they are good but not like you're going to die. In general, I've never had bad nieve, from Chonita in Mercado Juarez to El Niagara near the Basilica de Soledad to the beaches in Puerto Escondido.The best paletas are at Popeye's. You'll see the orange carts all over town and there's a proper outlet on the southside of El Llano. I tried a paleta at Michoacan once, and there was something sort of metallic-tasting, though it may not be fair to judge it based on one paleta. My favorite flavors are cajeta, nuez, sandia, fresa, y chocolate.And of course, Aguas de Casilda.Best ChocolateEveryone I respect agrees that Chocolate Mayordomo has the best chocolate, even if it is the most commercial and widely marketed. I always took visitors to the one on Mina, between 20 de noviembre and Miguel Cabrera, south of Mercado 20 de noviembre, because it's bright and spacious with samplers in easy reach. It smells really good, too.I didn't taste much prepared mole while I was there, but I am planning to take some home from Chocolates de Guelaguetza and Chocolates de Soledad, based on Patty's and Soledad's recommendations. It's easy to end up with mole that's too sweet so be sure to taste a sample before buying, it's normal.Desserts in Oaxacan restaurants, especially for the set-lunch, can be disappointing, but I had addictively delicious chocolate desserts at La Biznaga and Casa Oaxaca, and I am the kind of person who sneers at molten chocolate cake.Best Wireless CaféAll of these have good, strong signals with plenty of seats. Where I went depended on what I wanted to eat. I would probably give a slight edge to Café los Cuiles for having the broadest menu, as well as alcohol. I like having a beer while I write, don't you?1) Café Los Cuiles on Abasolo between Alcala and 5 de mayo, across from the handicrafts plaza. Nothing to write home about, but dependable, decent food and excellent Oaxacan hot chocolate.2) Café Brujula on Garcia Vigil just north of Allende. The nicest, smiliest staff ever and my favorite drink in Oaxaca, pepe y limonada con agua mineral, cucumber-lime juice with carbonated water.3) Nuevo Mundo on M. Bravo between Porfirio Diaz and Alcala. Uncomfortable chairs, sort of metal-café style, but very laid-back, nice staff, and excellent coffee.Best Cooking ClassSra Soledad Ramirez, who teaches at the Instituto Cultural Oaxaca and will teach private classes upon request, is a Oaxacan grandmother to all who know her.Seasons of My Heart, with Susana Trilling in Etla, is a completely different experience. Not quite like being in a Oaxacan abuela's home, but also a lot of fun. Susana is not a Oaxacan grandmother, but knowledgeable nonetheless, and just tasting the hand-harvested salt from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and tasting the excellent El Rey Zapoteco mezcal is exhilarating.

Best All-Around RestaurantLa Biznaga is perfection. Casa Oaxaca has wonderful food, but La Biznaga is even better and in a classy, yet casual setting. It's nueva cocina, traditional Mexican food with smart, interesting modern touches, but without ever losing respect for the traditional. Don't be deterred by the \"nice restaurant\" prices--the portions are big, and no one will care, including you, if you just order an appetizer for dinner. You'll be particularly happy if you order the Trilogia Mixteca, an unbelievable appetizer sampler that includes quesillo wrapped in a hoja santa leaf, a memelita with beans and queso fresco, a fried little cone stuffed with jamaica in refreshingly picante guacamole, and even a little blob of simple yet delicious beans. But if you are hungry for more, other dishes I've loved are the mushroom soup, the chicken stuffed with peppers and squash blossoms in a chile poblano sauce and the chicken stuffed with plaintains in a guava mole sauce. I almost never order chocolate dessert, but their chocolate mousse I would happily eat over and over.And if La Biznaga is closed, I would go to Zandunga for istmeno food. A plate of garnachas and a beer is good eating! But if you want more, we also tried and liked the estofada, chicken stewed with fruits and vegetables, all sort of mixed together. Don't be turned off by the fact that it looks like a pile of turd, it's good.Best Comida CorridaI went several times to La Olla on Reforma between Abasolo and Constitucion for their comida corrida and was disappointed only once. It's a pleasant, brightly lit restaurant, and everything comes prepared and plated with finesse, but it's only 70 pesos for a 4-course meal, plus an agua of fruit. Nothing will blow your mind, but almost everything is tasty and comforting, starting with the excellent tortilla chips, bread and salsa. My favorites off the menu are the pasilla chile stuffed with cheese and beans and the tlayuda azteca, a big thick, almost tough but very Oaxacan tortilla which you can ask to have spread with half red mole and half black mole, and then the chicken, avocado, and tomatoes.I tried various set lunch deals at other places, but nowhere else was particularly noteworthy, other than El Escapulario on Garcia Vigil north of Carranza. It's more of a hole-in-the-wall, and not something to make space in your schedule for, but if you're here for awhile and want to get a good meal for 35 pesos, El Escapulario is a good place to go.Best SeafoodIf you go to Puerto Escondido, definitely the old man selling shellfish out of his bucket on Playa Carrizalillo. But if you want to eat someplace a little more regulated, Marco Polo on El Llano was one of the few places I went more than once. A long-time American resident in Oaxaca told me that Sushi Itto in the zocalo isn't bad, but when I said I would go try it, she hastened to add that I shouldn't bother, it's only acceptable for people who are truly stuck in Oaxaca.Best Place for Bar SnacksLa Biche Pobre closes before dinner time, but if you need an excuse to drink in the afternoon--I don't--their fried pork is an excellent excuse. There are other snacks that are tasty, but the fried pork is sublime.I, sadly, did not get to try very many cantinas, places where they bring you free food with your booze. El Paseo's food was so-so. I wish I had tried La Farola, advertised as the oldest cantina in Oaxaca, complete with swinging doors, but I never got around to it. La Farola is reputed to serve El Rey Zapoteco, my favorite brand of mezcal.Best Place to Eat on a Cold and Rainy NightI thought Patty's pozole was the best, though it might have been the heady thrill of trying it for the first time, but if you're not staying with her and her family, you can find warming pozole at La Gran Torta, open from 7 pm to 2 am, on Porfirio Diaz between Morelos and Independencia (closed on Tuesdays). They serve three kinds, Jalisco (white), Guerrero (green), and Michoacan (red). The Guerrero comes with chicharrones and avocado, as well as your choice of meat, but the Michoacan is more warming and spicy.

I spent some time in Puerto Escondido this past December, and time in Oaxaca several years ago. In Puerto we ate at a large garage-type cantina and had squash blossom juice that was wonderful. I've recently posted a picture of the squash blossoms on my photoblog - you should check it out. I will also be posting some pictures of the bay that we stayed on in Peurto (my in-laws home).My husband loves Mexican food, so I will make sure he spends time checking out your site.www.visualpeace.blogspot.com

Just came back from a month in Oaxaca. The food was EXCELLENT. Loved La Biznaga, La Olla, Casa Oaxaca and even the little place near Parque Juárez--Wl Fogoncito. Their \"arrachera\" was tender. I tried the new El Naranjo and was thrilled. I had been to it with the previous owner Ilyana and found the new owner to be knowledgeable and willing to try new things. I loved the estufada and in particular what he did with the two-toned soup. You could order the the salsa made from one of the soups to be poured over chicken. Couldn't argue with the location either.

AppleSister; I knew that when I was looking for specific restaurant recommendations in Oaxaca, I could go to your blog and get info with confidence. I'd seen a rather florid review of La Biznaga elsewhere and it gave me doubts. It was difficult to get good Google results on Zandunga.So, from what I'm reading here, you'd rate La Biznaga número uno, and Zandunga número dos?What IS, exactly, \"Istmeño cuisine\"? I can't help but think of iguanas.Saludos, Mike (AKA \"Anonimo\" on CH and on TT)

You know, I just figured out you're \"Anonimo\" yesterday :) I really liked La Biznaga. At least when I was there in 2007, the prices were slightly higher than eating at a more typical place but I felt like they were justified. Everything was made with care and thought; the hoja santa wrapped around quesillo was incredible. I only ate at Zandunga once but really enjoyed it, especially the botana platter. I don't really know what istmeno food is either, but the platter had little tostadas with toppings I'd never seen anywhere else.

I never intended this blog to be a diary--I already have a diary and it is not online--but it seems appropriate, at the end of my four months in Oaxaca, to answer some personal questions I know people are going to ask.Will you miss Oaxaca?To be honest, I didn't love Oaxaca. I think the places we most love are the places where we have happy memories. Oaxaca will always be the place where I went to think, to be alone, and thus to be lonely. Being lonely when you're traveling has a different flavor than being lonely at home. You feel strong and brave, like someone who is doing something no one else has ever done before. The mere act of eating, of reading, of walking through the streets feels full. Everything is bright. You can almost look at your loneliness in your hand and marvel at it. This is why you left, to be alone. But it's still not a happy, giddy feeling. I'm grateful to Oaxaca for being a wonderful place to be alone, with people so warm and generous I never felt like a solitary freak. I'm overwhelmed by all I've learned about Mexican and Oaxacan food, more than I ever would have learned during a two-week vacation. But I miss New York more than I ever thought I would, and I would kill for some sushi.What are you going to do now?I'm going to Spain! I'm flying back to NY next Wednesday for about a week, to witness the nuptials of a good friend, and then I fly to Spain for 7 weeks. I'll travel with friends for the first 3.5 weeks, through Madrid, Barcelona, and a couple towns in Andalucia. Then I'm on my own. I'll probably wend my way up the western end of Spain, through Salamanca and Santiago de Compostela, ending up in the Basque Country and San Sebastian, a small, coastal city with as outsize a reputation for great food as Oaxaca. And then what?And then I go back to the U.S. to spend Thanksgiving with friends, and then I'll spend the month of December in Korea with my parents. I'll be back in Brooklyn right after New Year's 2008.But seriously, what are you going to do when you get back?Ha ha ha ha! Ask me in January, por favor. Rather than look forward, I'm going to post a very subjective \"Best of Oaxaca\" guide over the next couple of days.

Zandunga, or, How Rebecca Saved Me from Loneliness and Boredom

In one week, I am leaving Oaxaca. It's just as well, as I am running out of things to blog about. I've been lonely and bored, and the fact that I am getting tired of Mexican food has seriously affected my number one way of combating loneliness and boredom. Thankfully, my friend Rebecca is in town for a last-minute visit, and her enthusiastic and happy food-loving personality has reignited my enthusiasm for Mexican food. And of course, I am just thrilled to have her here. One of the things I have realized most during my four months here is how much I love my friends and how lucky I am to have them.With Rebecca's open mind and stomach, I've even been able to try things that I wouldn't have been able to eat on my own, like the appetizer sampler plate for two at Zandunga, a restaurant on Garcia Vigil near the corner of Carranza that specializes in food from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca state. Even I could not have handled that bountiful platter of food alone.Anthropologists are fascinated by the Isthmus because of its matriarchal society; folklorists are interested in the colorful huipiles or traditional clothes worn by these powerful women (often worn by Frida Kahlo) and its festive atmosphere and music. But for me, not surprisingly, the most powerful attraction is from its delicious and unique food. One day, I would love to go on a tour with Susana Trilling , eat more of the food I tried at Zandunga, and dance with the zandungas themselves, women \"who radiate beauty, enthusiasm and pride.\"We had actually only come to Zandunga because La Biznaga was closed for the week for renovations, and I was apprehensive, worried that I was going to waste one of Rebecca's meals in Oaxaca on something not-so-good. But soon after we sat down, we knew everything was going to be just fine. They immediately brought out a small plate of perfectly fried tortilla chips, a little bowl of dark, intense salsa, and another small plate of meltingly tender, crumbled ground beef. It doesn't sound like much, but when we had eaten all the chips, I started just spooning the ground beef up with my salsa-laden spoon. (Rebecca is a very good friend--I have no shame around her.)We quickly decided on the appetizer sampler, which included the following: 1) 3 garnachas, small fried tortillas with a mound of tender meat, fresh cheese, and a tomato sauce, served with pickled cabbage, our favorite. So good we carefully split the third one in half, neither of us able to pretend we didn't want it;2) 1 tamal de cambray, made of a masa that seemed sweeter, almost as sweet as American cornbread, and stuffed with a picadillo of shredded meat with cinnamon and raisins;3) 2 molotes de platano, little torpedos of mashed plantains with a dark, fried crust;4) 2 empanadas, darling little fried turnovers stuffed with meat and served with a garnish of cabbage, crema and salsa;5) 1 generous bowl of ensalada de pica de gallo, which was the tomato-onion-cilantro mixture we're used to seeing as pica de gallo, but with dried shrimp that made it deliciously fishy; and6) 1 generous bowl of carne horneada, which were big hunks of beef that seemed to have been cooked very very slowly in a red, spicy rub.It was accompanied with a stack of totopos, the tortillas made with corn unique to the Isthmus, flat and crunchy like a cracker.The garnachas, the tamal de cambray, the carne horneada and the ensalada de pica de gallo were superb. Everything else was very good. Rebecca was happy, I was no longer bored nor lonely. It's universally known, there's little in life that can make you as content as sharing a plate of riquissimos antojitos, appetizers, antipasti, whatever you want to call it, with an old friend.

Itanoni, Flower of Corn

***CONTENT
Yesterday, as I ate the most delicious tortillas of my life at Itanoni, a casual restaurant that seriously celebrates corn, I thought about Mexican Independence Day, which begins tonight at 11 pm with \"El grito de independencia\" or the shout for independence in the zocalo. As the cheese and poblano peppers, with their slight yet sure spiciness, oozed out of my rolled-up taco, as I scooped up the last bit of chicharrones, or fried pork rinds, in red salsa with my bare fingers, I pondered all the ways in which Mexico is so different from the U.S. When I bit into my tetela, the pre-Hispanic triangular corn turnover filled, in this case, with an intense black bean puree, enhanced by crema, queso, and the anise-scented hoja santa, I sighed and longed for some culinary delight that would link me and my country to a history spanning more than 250 years.Mexicans domesticated corn 9000 years ago. They've probably been eating tortillas for almost as long. Although the Spanish brought smallpox, death, and destruction to the indigenous peoples, Mexicans are still eating the tortillas the conquistadors were given when they arrived 500 years ago. I imagine most Mexicans take this for granted. Itanoni doesn't. Its full name is \"Itanoni, Flor del Maiz,\" meaning \"Flower of Corn.\" It declares with pride that all its antojitos are made out of maiz criollo, meaning that the variety is indigenous and native to Mexico. (Criollo also means a Mexican of Spanish descent. Confusing and yet revealing, no?) Each plastic table, under its plastic tablecloth, displays a sweet story about the ant that revealed to the god Quetzalcoatl the secret of maiz, thus ending a famine. Although Itanoni has a heightened sense of purpose, it tries to look like yet another little storefront selling memelas, tacos, and other small treats based on masa or corn dough, with its tin roof and casual, cheap resort furniture. You only begin to notice how self-consciously it seeks to be traditional when you see the menus, artfully designed with wholesome corrugated cardboard and brown paper, the aguas served in old-fashioned, thick glass bottles, and the sturdy construction of the wood-burning, outdoor stoves. Whatever Itanoni is doing, it works. My tacos, my tetela, were the best anything made out of masa I have ever eaten anywhere. They reminded me that like a sandwich, a taco can be elevated by tasty fillings, but it can never be sublime without a great base. They had subtle layers, as flat as they were, almost like roti but without a hint of grease. They were unsalted and unsweet, tasting purely and cleanly of corn. The outer layers were toasty, while the inner layers remained soft and pliable. Is there anything that smells more innocent and more comforting than something toasted? Octavio Paz says that Mexico believes in a continuity between its indigenous past and its post-Revolution, independent state, broken only by a couple hundred years of New Spain. Unlike the U.S., whose Founding Fathers plotted for independence without a thought for the Native Americans, the Mexican struggle for independence began with a Catholic priest calling to action angry indigenous groups, mestizos, and criollos, Mexican-born Spaniards who didn't have the power and status accorded to Spanish-born Spaniards. However false and however strange, as Paz implies it is, to see modern Mexico as a restoration of what existed before New Spain, it's what Itanoni celebrates, a sense of gastronomic and cultural heritage stretching back thousands of years. I envy it, if only because the food is so delicious. What would we similarly celebrate in the U.S.? Corn-on-the-cob? Roast turkey, when they're bred to be so big-breasted the poor things end up with sad, sexless, artificially inseminated lives? (Apparently, Mexican Independence Day is now being celebrated in California. Really, illegal immigration is just Mexico's revenge for having lost California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas to the U.S. only 150 years ago.) Calvin Trillin is probably right, the best thing that ever happened to America food-wise was the Immigration Act of 1965. When I get home, I am going to comfort myself with a big platter of sushi.

You can find good nieve almost anywhere in Oaxaca, a random street corner in Colonia Reforma even. This melon had a lovely creaminess to it that didn't keep it from being light and fresh with the flavor of real melons.But possibly the most beautiful place to eat nieve is at the ice cream \"jardin\" at the base of the Basilica de Nuestra Senora de la Soledad. The ornate façade of the cathedral faces west an open plaza ringed by walls. Just beyond that plaza to the east are five or six nieve vendors set up with wrought-iron chairs and café tables, as well as bright striped metal parasols. A few steps above and to the north is an even larger plaza with giant steps leading down from the street. This plaza is reputed to be a popular place for dance groups to rehearse, though the only thing I've ever seen is a pick-up soccer game but that itself was good entertainment. Sitting on the giant steps and facing south, you can see palm trees and then past them, the mountains to the south of the city. It's not the most majestic view, definitely not the most breathtaking, but sitting there, looking out at the mountains, the church, and even the slightly dingy plastic tarps and parasols of the nieve sellers, it's easy to feel a sense of peace.If you have a little cup or cone of nieve, of course, you can feel glee as well as peace. I've only tried one, El Niagara, but have been told they're all more or less the same. My little cup was filled with durazno, or peach, on the bottom and then cajeta, or goat's milk dulce de leche, on top. They're more like sorbet than the super-fatty, super-creamy ice cream I love most, and yet I never feel like I'm missing something. The durazno had little chunks of peach! Nothing ever tastes false here.

There is Korean food in Oaxaca, and it is very good. But the Korean woman who makes the food and her Italian husband are perhaps even more remarkable than the fact of the food's existence.Gya is married to Sandro, short for Alessandro, who is Italian. They have two children, a daughter named Aruna and a son named Govinda. Since these names are neither Korean nor Italian, and knowing what I do of their story, I imagine that both names are Sanskrit.The family lives high on a hilltop in San Agustin Etla, about 30 minutes outside of Oaxaca City. Of the pueblos I have seen, Etla is the prettiest. The various towns that comprise Etla are all nestled in little dips among green hills, among skies that seem to draw close enough for you to touch. You can walk 50 feet in any direction and find a beautiful view, a buenavista. Gya and Sandro have named their home, \"Alegria de Angelis,\" or \"The Happiness of Angels.\" Here they grow organic vegetables in plots they themselves built, and run a small restaurant by appointment that serves Italian, Korean, and a few other Asian dishes, like momos, the Nepalese dumplings. They grow sweet basil, Napa cabbage, the vegetables essential to their food. They also sell their food at the organic market in Oaxaca at El Pochote and in a newly opened take-out store in San Felipe. Their children swim in the pond with the carp and the turtles. Gya used to be a dancer, specializing in classical Indian dance. As she says, she was \"loca\" for dance, completely crazy, and one day, she found herself in France trying to decide whether to buy a ticket for Spain to study flamenco or for India to study classical Indian dance. She finally decided to flip a coin, and the coin told her to go to India. But as she sat on the plane, she realized that it was not chance, but fate that was taking her to India. \"Flamenco is a dance of love, but Indian dance is spiritual, and I knew then that I needed to learn a spiritual dance.\"Sometime later, Sandro was traveling through Mexico, with plans to go on to India. A friend of his asked him to go to a particular store in India and buy a dance costume for her. When he got to the store, Gya opened the door. Sandro immediately knew that they would be married, and told her so. Gya told him he was crazy.So Sandro went into the Himalayas to meditate on whether he had had a true revelation. In the mountains, he met an old man who took him into his home. The old man opened a large wardrobe and took out everything, and in the end, there were two ancient rings. The old man said he would give them to him if Sandro gave him everything he had in return, all the clothes he was wearing and all the money he had on him, save what he needed to get back. When Sandro went back to Gya with the two rings, they were married.I've seen the photos of their wedding in India, Gya with her face beautiful, smooth and calm, color smeared on her forehead, and Sandro, looking handsome and inimitably Italian, even with the topknot of hair he wore and the smear of color on his forehead. (As much as I love the improbableness of their story, I must note how lovely they both were and are. If a troll were to tell me we would be married, no matter how enlightened he was or I was, I imagine it would be difficult to say yes. Whereas if someone who looked like Sandro showed up, with all the power of the Himalayas behind him...well.)Sandro and Gya initially wanted to live in India, but found that they, as foreigners, would be restricted in their ability to own land or start a business. So they came to Mexico, traveling from city to city until they stopped at Oaxaca, where it felt right. They have now been in Oaxaca one year. They plan to stay for five years, and then see what happens.The whole thing seems too ethereal to be true, like you're dreaming by a pond in the mountains of Oaxaca, but they are very down-to-earth-people. Best of all, their firm attachment to the pleasures of this earth is manifest in the food that they serve and the joy with which they serve it.I almost wanted to cry as I spooned my bibimbop into my mouth, as I bit down on the sharp, spicy, almost raw kimchi. It's strange how much Mexico seems to reveal to me, almost everyday, how much I miss my mother. There was a slightly foreign note to the spiciness, not dissonant, but not quite familiar, and then Gya explained that she has to combine Mexican hot peppers with the bit of Korean hot pepper she's able to buy in Mexico City.Yet the food was authentic, in the best sense of the word, with love and respect for its traditions. Each component of the bibimbop had been grown, washed, and sautéed just until its flavor became brightest it could be. The fried egg gleamed. Gya had never cooked until they moved here. She had been a dancer, and in Italy, had eaten Sandro's mother's cooking. But, as she said, she remembered the taste, it was in her memories. And so they recreate the taste of the Korean and Italian food they know and love, here in Mexico.

When dining out alone, there are several things you can do to feel a little less conspicuous. None of these techniques actually hide that you are eating alone, but done with sufficient brio, they can at least help you forget that you're eating alone.Lots of people like to take a book to read, but I often find it hard to keep a book open on the table while holding a fork and knife at the same time. If I'm going to have to let go of my utensils, I'd rather take my journal. I fancy that maybe I look like a serious restaurant reviewer, or a travel writer, or best of all, a writer, period. Ever since I read \"A Moveable Feast,\" the only Hemingway book I truly like, the romance of sitting at a café table with a glass of wine, a notebook, and a pen has sustained me for many a solo meal. But eating lunch at El Escapulario last week, I realized the absolute best way to distract yourself from your solitude is to go to a foreign country and practice your foreign-language skills by eavesdropping on conversations next to you. I'd passed El Escapulario maybe a hundred times since I got to Oaxaca. It's on the second floor of a building on Garcia Vigil, just across from the Iglesia de Carmen Arriba, with a little cut-out of a window on the corner that makes it look almost magical. No matter that escapulario doesn't mean \"escape\" but \"scapulary,\" or a religious garment. Lina had recommended it, too, but I never seemed to find myself in that part of town during comida time. I wasn't impressed walking up the stairs, which were dingy and dark. The first thing I saw at the top of the stairs was a kitchen and a storeroom, and I didn't really want to look at either too closely. I am definitely of the \"see no evil\" school of restaurant hygiene. But then I saw the room with the window I had admired for so long. The room was painted white, with art on the walls, and the tablecloths were bright, colorful, and clean. The best table, the one right by the magical table was taken by a gringo and his Mexican friend, so I positioned myself the best I could to catch some of that window view.The waitress took my order with such a sincere smile, the menu del dia with sopa de conde, barbacoa de cordero, an agua de guayaba, and a free beer! I opened up my journal and started scribbling my thoughts on the restaurant, the day, but I soon realized there was so much more to occupy me, right there in the restaurant.The gringo at the window was truly a gringo of gringos. Even sitting down, he towered over the Mexican man eating with him, and being blond, buff, and dressed in a tank top and army green pants, he couldn't be anything but American. His Spanish was exactly like mine, exceedingly earnest with a capacity for quite a wide range of verb tenses, though far from fluid. Because he was trying so hard, he spoke a little louder than he might normally, and I could hear him perfectly from my table. He said two words for every word his lunch-mate said, probably because, like me, he had been thinking so long about all what else he could say in Spanish, he had whole conversations planned out in his head. I found out that his name is Sky, \"Like cielo,\" he said, that this was his first vacation in years, and that he had worked really hard for the past couple of years. He asked his friend if he liked the weather, if he liked the beach, that he had heard some Mexicans don't like, \"Hmmm, como se dice 'sand'?\", and so they don't like the beach. I understood every word the Mexican man said, but I can't remember a thing because he said so little. Knowing that my Spanish sounded as good and as bad as Sky's made me depressed. Thankfully, I could drown my sorrows in the excellent food at El Escapulario. The sopa de conde was a pureed black bean soup, with chunks of queso fresco simmered in it and garnished with strips of fried tortillas. It was really really really good. I've now cooked black beans 4 or 5 times in Oaxaca, and it never ceases to amaze me how much flavor there can be in a handful of black beans. The waitress brought me a little cup of spicy avocado salsa, and though I don't know if it was intended for the soup, it made it taste even better. Barbacoa normally describes goat or other meat wrapped and roasted in banana leaves until the meat is deeply tender. This barbacoa was a lamb chop, and it really did fall off its little bone, almost dissolving into the sauce of guajillo chile and avocado leaf. I suspected that the sauce had been cooked with hoja de aguacate, and I felt so proud when the waitress confirmed my suspicions. The little pile of rice accompanying the barbacoa was perfect, each kernel surprisingly plump. There was even a little postre, or dessert, a syrupy canned pear, its slices arranged in a sweet fan on the plate. I hate canned fruit, but it wasn't too sweet and I enjoyed it. By then, Sky and his friend were also done with lunch. I lingered to listen to the last scraps of conversation, sipping at my little baby bottle of beer. It wasn't that their conversation was so fascinating, really. It's just that when you're learning a language, anything you can understand becomes instantly riveting, just because you're so happy you understand. Even though I still have trouble with casual conversations, I can generally understand anything that is announced, and I'll watch, rapt, commercials for shampoo and baby formula. What a fantastic meal. I'd had a delicious three-course meal, with drinks, for 35 pesos plus tip, about $3.50, and been entertained while eating it.

One of the things I love most about my friend Mimi is that she does not believe in hiding one's light under a bushel. Hanging around her, it has started to rub off on me, and I can say, without hesitation, that I made a fantastic black bean soup the other night, and that I also made tacos of chicken and Mexican greens in a tomatillo-serrano sauce were both complex and soothingly delicious.Of course, I have to admit that neither was very hard to make. Both recipes came from Rick Bayless's \"Mexican Kitchen,\" and involved little more than patience and a good blender, though the availability of authentic ingredients like avocado leaves and Oaxacan chorizo was no small matter.The black bean soup involved so little work, it's almost embarrassing. I put Mimi to work picking out the ugly beans, while I roughly chopped a small white onion and peeled the casing off of three fat, round links of Oaxacan chorizo. I also toasted 4 avocado leaves very briefly on the burner, watching with fascination as dark spots spread almost instantly and completely across the leaf. Everything got simmered together for about two hours, until the beans were tender, and then salted to taste. I blended the soup in batches, and we ate it garnished with fried tortilla strips and crumbled queso fresco. There was no stock! And yet so much flavor came from the chorizo, the beans, and the unique anise-like scent of the avocado leaves. It was slightly spicy, in a deep, dark way, and utterly warming.The chicken in tomatillo sauce had a completely different flavor, all brightness and verve. I began by roasting tomatillos and 2 serrano chiles on a metal comal, directly on the stove, until they had big, dark, soft spots. In the meantime, I sautéed half a white chopped onion until deep golden, adding some chopped garlic to cook for a minute more, and then blended the onions and garlic with the roasted tomatillos and chiles. This puree got fried in oil for 10 minutes, getting darker and richer. When it was done cooking, I stirred in 3 tablespoons of chopped cilantro.In the meantime, I was simmering three chicken legs in plain water. I had been nervous about buying unrefrigerated chicken in the markets, and had wandered around for 2 hours looking for a rotisserie chicken, but in the end, I felt so lucky I had had a chance to cook those marigold-yellow chickens in the market. I didn't put in an onion or a carrot, peppercorns or thyme, too lazy to try to make a real broth, and I even pulled off the skin in a fit of fat-consciousness, but nothing I could do could make the chicken taste bad. To think I just boiled the darn things! And yet they were meaty with flavor. Now that I think about it, chicken in the U.S. so rarely tastes like meat, it just tastes like filler or a flavor vehicle. When I think of all those people who only eat chicken, and even then only white meat, I have to blame them for creating a market for flavorless gum.While the chicken finished poaching, I added thin strips of amaranth leaves, or quintoniles, in the tomatillo-serrano sauce, until they were only slightly bitter. I almost felt like they took on a bright tartness of their own. When I added the cooked, shredded chicken, the richness of the meat rounded out the tartness of the greens and sauce. All it needed was a little crumbled queso fresco. We also had a salad of jicama, mango, and avocado, with some red leaf lettuce to bulk it up. Mimi and I ate most of it, as Alex didn't even notice we had a salad until he was full of soup and chicken. (Thanks to them both for the glamorous close-ups; I was too frazzled to take photos.)

I'm tired of Mexican food. It became unavoidably obvious during Mimi and Alex's visit, as I tried to show off Oaxaca's culinary highlights. Until they had come, I'd been punctuating my big Mexican comidas with a simple pasta for dinner or even just a slice of wheat toast spread with peanut butter. But as we ate beautifully light tamales, the best fried pork in the world, steaming bowls of pozole, mole negro of course, an unbelievable dish of chicken stuffed with plantains in a guava-chile mole sauce, another unbelievable Biznaga creation of chicken in a chile poblano sauce, even simply cooked fish and octopus, one after the other, something in me rebelled. I knew I had reached some desperate point when my body steered me towards 100% Natural, a self-described \"healthy\" restaurant on the south side of El Llano. My friend Lisa had told me about this place months ago, and how much she loved it, but since Lisa is allergic to my top ten favorite things to eat, I didn't rush off to try the food there. But suddenly, I felt almost pregnant, like my body had cravings I couldn't control. I had to eat something that wasn't, well, special. As we walked there, I kept apologizing to Mimi and Alex in advance. I had the awesome responsibility of making sure they ate well in Oaxaca, and what was I doing? As we waited for our menus, the informational cards on the table describing 100% Natural's philosophy and advice for healthy living seemed to confirm my worst fears. \"They tell you to eat lightly for breakfast, lightly for lunch, and then lightly for dinner! When are you supposed to eat?\" I giggled as I read out loud the advice for how to get ready for bed, which included the suggestion that if you do not have the energy for intimate relations with your partner, you should say goodnight through loving words and kind caresses. Maybe you'd want more sex if you weren't so weak from fasting! But it wasn't really funny. There was a real chance the food would be seriously undersalted, especially since I didn't see any salt on the table.There were two menus, one full of fruity and veggie drinks to which you could add a shot of wheatgrass or yeast or whatever else health-food people like to drink. I didn't look at it too closely, though I was very happy with my big goblet full of agua de jamaica, which is hibiscus flower, combined with watermelon juice.The other menu listed many, many food items, and believe it or not, there were several dishes that appealed to me. I thought about getting Mexican-flavored health food, whole-grain tortillas made into enchiladadas or chilaquiles, but I couldn't deny that my heart was drawn to a dish that containing tofu, bean sprouts, broccoli, and sesame pasta. I couldn't stop thinking about the tofu, even as I wondered what kind of tofu could possibly be available in Mexico, even as I knew I was violating every rule of ordering in foreign countries. Tourists who eat sushi in Mexico deserve to eat bad sushi.The anticipation and the fear were abated a bit by the bread basket that arrived soon after we put in our orders. There was, not surprisingly, no butter, but there were three little ramekins filled with a green salsa, a tangy white cream sauce, and pickled vegetables. The bread, also, was excellent. It was moist and tender, wheaty and flavorful, with a real crust to contrast to its soft crumb.And then the food arrived. Mimi was happy with her shrimp, Alex with his turkey sandwich, and I, I was thrilled with my tofu-sesame spaghetti. It did need a little salt, and luckily, it turned out the big shaker on the table full of something that smelled nutty was actually sesame salt. The tofu, however, had been marinated generously, and the broccoli and other vegetables were cooked not too long, not too short, just right. The pasta, gracias a Dios, was almost al dente. I turned to Mimi and Alex and bestowed the best compliment I could: \"I think I would eat here again.\"

We ate at 100% Natural two nights ago, and were very pleasantly surprised.Sopa Cristalina of onions, setas and rice noodles and fresh spinach; then a grilled vegetable plate with a fresh basil vinaigrette for me; vegetarian tacos for my wife. She could only eat one, she was so full. I ate the other two for lunch yesterday and they were quite good.We also would go there again.

I take back everything I said about the bread being bad in Oaxaca.Two Saturdays ago, I'd mainly perused modern bakeries, selling traditional breads in part, but very different from the bakers in markets with their goods on trays or in deep woven baskets. My experiences with the breads in the markets had been mixed--good pan de yema in hot chocolate making class, but sort of stale and dry at other times, and then other moments that were so lacking I can't even remember what I ate.But last week, I wandered up to Mercado Sanchez Pascuas to buy some fruit and decided it was time to take the plunge. There were several bread vendors there, on the white counters near the west end of the market. I chose the man furthest north, a few meters down from the vegetable seller. I would eat the bread with the pink sugar on top. And then for good measure, I asked for another plain, dark and wheatier looking roll. 4.5 pesos, total.Well, let's just say I'm not going to be wasting any more of my hard-saved money on \"European artisanal bread\" at Pan & Co. Mexican bread is good enough for me! The crust on both was hard but not tough, and the bread inside chewy yet soft and flavorful. The roll with the pink sugar on top had a sweet glaze all over the top that made my plastic bag sticky immediately, but it was a pleasant combination with the plain texture of the roll inside and more soothing for an early morning meal than something like a cinnamon roll or a muffin, which are both sweet and heavy with butter. The roll also had a big hollow inside, the tell-tale sign that yeast had been given time to do its thing. The other roll, with its sprinkling of sesame seeds, was even better. It perhaps could have used a tad more salt, but it had no need to be embarrassed that it was otherwise unadorned. It didn't rise to the level of a great French baguette, but then, very few breads do, even in New York. This flat little roll had more flavor than most of the bread in the U.S., and probably most of the bread in New York, too. Two days later, I went back and got another flat, plain roll with sesame seeds and then something that looked like a brioche with its little topknot. This time, sadly, the roll was a tad stale, but with a strong enough flavor to stand up well to slices of avocado with salt and a bit of pepper, a simple and filling breakfast I learned from Erin. The brioche, though, blew my mind. There was whole wheat flour in it, but not enough to keep the crumb tender, and then surprising ribbons of cinnamon and dots of raisins. This vendor is clearly something special. When Mimi and I went back to get a bag of bread, hoping to soothe Alex's stomach with something relatively bland, we bought a few rolls from the woman next to him and then a big brioche roll and a little flat roll with sugary sesame seeds and crushed nuts on top. The big bag of bread from the other baker was fine, but this guy's stuff just shined.I'm so glad. I hated not liking a whole category of Mexican food.

Actually, I usually mash the avocado with the salt and pepper and some lime or lemon juice, then spread it on toasted bread, and if I'm feeling extra virtuous sprinkle some flax seeds on top. You are really indirectly responsible for the development of this as my default breakfast, however. It wasn't until that year we lived and cooked together in Bernal Heights that I really became a true Californian and embraced the avocado, largely because you were always doing something delicious with them.

I was really excited to try these. I just loved the idea of \"Oriental tacos.\" I didn't expect flying carpets or Buddha figures, but I'd read a little bit about \"tacos arabes\" in Puebla on Chowhound, and I'd imagined a beautiful collision between shwarmas and tacos to create something completely, fabulously new.So after three months of thinking about them, I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed when I finally got to La Antequera in Colonia Reforma, on Calzada Porfirio Diaz a few blocks north of Belisario Dominguez. The menu listed quesadillas, tortas, and two types of tacos, \"arabes\" and \"orientales.\" \"What's the difference?\" I asked.\"Arabes are larger, orientales are smaller.\"A truly unexciting answer. Still, I ordered one of each and a side of \"cebollas,\" imagining unctuous, rich, sautéed onions.When they arrived, they just sat there like limp rags. The \"arabe\" taco had, instead of a corn tortilla, a slightly thicker bread around it. It wasn't quite like pita, a little chewy, a little floury. The bread had good flavor, and the meat inside it was salty and flavorful also, but there was nothing else going on. It came with a side of tart red salsa, and I sprinkled it on liberally, but there was nothing else to help it gain some dimension. The onions turned out to be quite pale, not at all caramelized as I'd hoped, and watery to boot. The \"orientale\" was a smaller version, with a tortilla wrapped around. Just like the waiter said.I think the experience could have been different in a group. I can imagine a happy table of friends sitting around a plate filled with meat, another plate stacked high with hot pita-like breads, drinking beer and making tacos one after the other. But my two sad little tacos and even sadder bowl of chopped onions wasn't that.If you are meat-lover, you are more likely to fall head over heels in love with the \"carne frita\" or fried meat of pork at El Biche Pobre.

TACOS ARABES IS A ONE OF A KIND TACO LIKE NO OTHER IN THE WORLD . I UNDER STAND THAT MANY WILL SAY THAT THERE ARE BETTER BU SIMPLY THE FLAVOR OF THE MEAT ... AND #1 THE HOT SAUCE SHOULD TASTE LIKE NO OTHER . THAT AND CEMITAS WOULD BE THE FIRST ENTREES ID ORDER WHEN I ARRIVE IN PUEBLA FROM CALIFORNIA. AMERICANS ONLY THINK OF CUANTITY WHEN ITS QUALITY WHAT PUEBLA KNOWS.

Ok if you want taco arabes that are different then head to El Beduino of xalapa. it is about 2 hours from puebla going east to veracruz. they use differnt method of cooking and ingredients. Everything is made by hand right down to the \"pan Arabe\" they also have falafel like no other, they even make their own Tahini...try it is is out of this world. They are located on Callejon diamante.

2009-02-06 14:02:00
All the tacos arabes I tried outside Puebla were not excellent. Maybe some were good but the majority were rubbish. You need to try them in Puebla. They are not \"complicated\" tacos, they don't have that much inside (like the plazeros or al pastor) but the deliciousness is in the meet and the sauce.

2009-04-04 22:18:00
I agree most tacos arabe are really bad outside puebla....but El Beduino in Xalapa is absolutely the best I have ever had. I have been to puebla many many times and there is only one place that the tacos arabes are what they should be and more. El beduino en callejon diamante in xalapa is absolutely the best i have ever had...try the falafel also.

This is for my sister, who can happily spend a day looking in bakery windows and display cases, maybe tasting a mouthful or two, but really just happy to see rows and rows of sweet things.Mexican sweets and breads are a mystery to me. There are so many varieties, each with their own name, and I have yet to find a source that will give me all the information I crave. In the markets, a stall may specialize only in pan de yema, an eggy bread with a light anise flavor, or in a chewy, flat roll with a hard crust and pink sugar sprinkled on top. Then there are sweet sellers, with little stacks of honeyed, sticky cookies and cones filled with white cream. By the doors of Mercado Juarez and on corners around Oaxaca, there are several women selling alegrias, \"joy\" bars made of amaranth and piloncillo, the brown sugar sold in little cone-shaped cakes, and similar bars made with peanuts or pumpkin seeds, as well as round flats of pecans embedded in a crumbly brown sugar. I've seen several street vendors sitting around with cases filled with bright gelatins and little flans, clearly specializing in anything that can quiver. Then there are those women with the huge glass jars of stewed fruits in syrup. I haven't even begun to describe the more modern bakeries and their enormous range of offerings. And apparently, if I go to Puebla or San Cristobal de las Casas, I will find sweets that can't be found here in Oaxaca, trays of caramels and candies and things I cannot even dream of. The only thing I have really grasped so far are \"nieves\" and \"paletas,\" the sorbet-like ice creams and popsicles that taste proudly and intensely of fruit. To be honest, I've been reluctant to really try and taste, as I will generally pick eggs over pancakes, a slice of pizza over a cookie, a piece of levain bread over a tart. And if I do have something sweet, I want it to be small and perfect, like a piece of very dark chocolate or a scoop of ice cream from Il Laboratorio del Gelato. I hadn't gone out of my way to try more than the few desserts that had come my way, as there was so much mole to be eaten and I feared wasting time eating things that were sugary and sub-par. But considering that I've been going around saying I don't like Mexican desserts and breads, without trying more of them, I realized was being quite unfair. I've been missing my sister so much, I wanted to do what she would do, if she were in Oaxaca.So I decided to spend Saturday afternoon perusing 3 different bakeries in a 2-block radius around the zocalo. I found two more bakeries in this area on my way home, but decided to save them for another day, as my hands were full of bread. I had also started frequenting the enormous bakery, Pan Bamby, on Porfirio Diaz at the corner of Independencia, and so I'm adding that to this post, too. I only bought one pastry or bread at each bakery, so I can't really speak with authority, but at least I am starting to get a sense of what is out there.Pan Bamby is the largest bakery I've seen in Oaxaca. In the evenings, it's full of people piling their trays high with bread, buying 10 or 20 rolls, loaves, and pastries. It sells what is expected, the same stuff I see at the giant supermarkets and the smaller weekend markets, but in greater varieties and quantities. So they sell bolillos, the torpedo-shaped white crusty rolls, for a peso a piece; conchas with their swirl of crumble on top, numerous kinds of flaky pastries filled with chocolate or jam or just dusted with sugar.Their bolillo was terrible, even though it was fresh and warm and the crust crackled promisingly. It just didn't have any flavor. But then I had a sweet, soft croissant-shaped roll, with a very tender crumb and such an appealing, lovable flavor, like Hawaiian bread or Portuguese sweet bread. I also had a very good bandilla, a long, rectangular pastry of flaky layers, topped with sugar, a perfect light cena with tea. My neighbor had left me a bag of their garlicky breadsticks when she went back to Iowa, and they were strangely addictive, as well as scarily durable. Fidel Integral, which specializes in whole-wheat breads, is on the same street further south, except that at that point, Porfirio Diaz has become 20 de Noviembre. Located between Hidalgo and Trujano, just north of Mercado Juarez, Fidel isn't as large but I could get a sense of what breads must be available by seeing what Fidel chose to make in whole wheat form. Fidel also sells bolillos and conchas and bandillas. They also make a fantastic whole wheat roll, just a simple dinner roll that has great flavor, so great that it's oddly addictive for something so plain. I also tried something a hard, crumbly sweet bread, shaped like a long, oblong stick, because it looked so much like these \"butter sticks\" in Korean bakeries I used to love. It tasted just as I had imagined it would, sweet but with a real wheaty flavor, and very good with a cup of coffee in the afternoon.Walking south from Fidel, if you turn a left at the next corner, you will find yourself in front of Tartamiel. It definitely has the cutest logo, a smiling yellow bee with the tip of its tongue sticking amiably out of its mouth. It calls itself a \"pasteleria frances,\" and it did seem to be aiming for a different tone. The English language is poor in only having one word, \"bakery,\" to describe a place that sells baked goods, when Spanish and French both distinguish between places that sell breads, panaderias or boulangeries, and places that sell cakes, pastelerias or patisseries. There was no way I could buy a cake to taste, but I did buy a little \"tartaleta de queso,\" and it was really quite good. The crust wasn't so noteworthy, though it was sturdy and correct, but the cheese part I liked a lot. It was firm, like NY-style cheesecake, and it clearly wasn't relying just on sugar to make itself appealing. The last bakery, at least for this post, is Vasconia on Independencia, between 5 de Mayo and Reforma. This place is a little different, selling slices of creamy cake in a window swarming with bees, as well as empanadas with various savory fillings, bread rolls filled with chorizo and cheese, and your usual conchas and donas or donuts. I bought a little empanada filled with champinones, which weirdly is the Mexican way of describing basic button mushrooms, calling them by their French name to signify their high-class ways. \"Hongos\" describe the gorgeous wild mushrooms you can find in the Sierra Norte during the rainy season. I got excited when I took it out of its bag when I got home, because the top almost caved in as I pressed it, it was so delicately flaky, but overall, I liked it the least of everything I ate today. It felt right and looked right, but the flavor was a little off, probably because Mexican butter just isn't great, and this was probably made with margarine anyway. I think it must be easier to get away without high-quality butter if the pastry is sweet rather than savory. The mushroom filling was pretty good, though, mixed with tomato sauce.So it was a very good day! But I miss my sister more than ever.

Is the word you're looking for 'boulangerie'? Not that I speak French, but I do speak Baked Goods.

Oui, merci! God, Spanish is crowding out every other language in my head. Last night, I couldn't remember the word \"prosecco\" for the longest time.

Did you like \"La Luna\", which I think is also on Independencia? It has a huge selection, although I've tried very little of it.We got our second loaf from Pan y Co yesterday. While it's good, it's not THAT good and I question whether the price of over $30 pesos is worthwhile for a loaf of Pain de Canpagne. The taste was good but the internal structure was uninteresting.The Olive Foccacia looked spectacularly laden with olives. Can they be good olives, or just lots of olives? Roquefort and Pear Foccacia was interesting, but we didn't buy any.I'm of the opinion that bread should taste of grain and proper fermentation and baking. Leave the cheeses and vegetables to the side to be enjoyed with the bread; not in it.

I don't think I ever tried La Luna. At a certain point, I just gave up. Pan y Co was definitely for me a little expat luxury, something I wouldn't have bought as a tourist, but something I needed. It's like a friend of mine said, \"Don't eat the sushi in the zocalo. We have to, because we live here, but you can survive four months without it.\"

One of the things I love most about Mexico is how good food can just happen to you, right when you least expect it.Last Wednesday, I got in a car at 7:30 in the morning to go with two Puente staff members to a town far, far away in the mountains, one of the communities they work with. They were going to check in on how the amaranth was growing, give advice to the farmers, and then lead a cooking with amaranth workshop. It was gorgeous country, but for the first time in my life, I felt carsick with every U-shaped curve. So when we stopped in Ayutla, a larger town on the way to Tejas, they asked if I wanted some breakfast. I stumbled out of the car, thinking, \"Okay, something hot to drink might be good,\" but that there was no way I could actually eat anything.And then we sat down at a fonda that declared, with multiple exclamation points, that they had \"caldo de pancita.\" It smelled so good, suddenly my nausea went away and my appetite returned. I tried to figure out what \"pancita\" is, and in the end, I decided it must be some kind of beef belly, as it was lovely and smooth, soft and chewy at the same time. Garnished with some raw chopped onions, spicy chopped \"chiles de canario\" that were bright yellow with black seeds, and a spoonful or two of salsa, the soup made me instantly feel better. (But I don't have photos because I felt too ill getting out of the car to think of documenting anything.)On the way back, they asked again, \"Should we stop to eat or just go home as quickly as possible?\" Again, I wasn't really hungry, but then one of them said, \"Mmmm, tacos de tripa, que sabrosos,\" and the question was answered. I started with two, one of tripe and one of \"suadero,\" which isn't in my dictionary,\" and then couldn't resist and ordered two more, another suadero and one of \"maciza,\" which I think is some sort of thigh meat of beef. I don't know if it was the cool mountain air, but they were so good! This time, I had my camera, but I kept forgetting to take a picture in my eagerness to eat. I finally managed to remember to take a photo of my very last taco.It's funny, Pola the agronomist asked me if I was vegetarian, because nearly all the volunteers are vegetarian. Ha ha ha ha! Given the type of American who comes to Oaxaca, Oaxacans must think all Americans are liberal, Bush-hating vegetarians. And even I am two out of three.

Mimi and Alex have arrived in Oaxaca, and they are like putty in my hands. I understand that kind of mind-meltdown, the joy of being on a vacation where someone else makes all the decisions for you, and I am happy to be that person. So off we went to \"Marco Polo\" on Sunday afternoon for a big, big lunch.We started with a \"cocktele de jaiba,\" shredded crabmeat in a icecream sundae glass, and tostadas de cazon, or shark. Both weren't particularly memorable, but we all loved the chopped salsa of raw onions and hot fresh peppers. When we had arrived, the waiter had whisked it away, so I was glad I had asked for it back. Shark turned out to be a shredded meat, firmer than most fish, almost with the texture of Korean dried squid, but with not much else going on. Not bad, just not as exciting as you think shark is going to be. And the crab cocktail was a little too sweet, even after I squeezed lime after lime into it. But everything else was delicious. We had something called \"vitaminas al vapor,\" which turned out to be a seafood soup stuffed with all kinds of squid, octopus, fish, and shrimp, as well as bits of soft egg and a flavor to the tomato broth that we couldn't quite identify. The broth was sweetish, but in the way fresh seafood can be sweet, not annoying. It actually did taste kind of nutritive, so maybe \"vitaminas\" is a reference to that?We had red snapper \"al horno,\" and then an order of pulpo, or octopus, cooked in butter and garlic. It was simple, meaty, and wonderful.And finally, the bananas baked in the oven I had been wanting to eat for so long. This is one order, believe it or not, of one platano macho, or plantain, split in three parts, and then served with a little trio of rompope or Mexican eggnog, condensed milk called \"leche Nestle,\" and crema, which is more like crème fraiche than heavy whipped cream. The bananas had that tart flavor that I love about bananas and plantains here, that made the rich, creamy, roasted taste more striking by contrast. We ate so much even Alex wasn't really hungry for dinner.

This tostada is on my top 10 list of things I love to eat in Oaxaca, and pretty high up, too.I've raved before the Mercado Organico at El Pochote before, but I will rave again. On the far wall from the entrance, next to the lovely Korean woman selling baked goods, there is a husband-and-wife pair that sells tostadas with a wide range of topping choices. A tostada is a crunchy taco, but not those U-shaped boats we all ate growing up, made by Taco Bello or Dos Pasos or whatever they called themselves. It's flat, a little ripply usually, and not as hard-crunchy as a tortilla chip, thinner and crisper.There are an array of topping choices, sparkling with different colors. Each tostada starts with a thin base of black bean puree, and then, you have to start making some decisions. There are nopales, cactus paddles, one that is spicier than the other, but both deliciously tart and fresh. There are sauteed mushrooms, and one type has small kernels of corn, too. There's spicy chicken tinga, shredded white chicken breast, and then two kinds of requeson, a fresh ricotta-like cheese. One has green specks, herby, and the other is spicier and redder, but not actually hot. Just fragrantly spicy. You can thin avocado sauce drizzled over everything, as well as salsa. No matter what combination you get, one topping or 3, it's 15 pesos. You feel almost righteously healthy eating so many vegetables, but you're not making any sacrifices.Probably my favorite is half spicy nopales, half mushrooms with bits of corn, topped with the spicy requeson, and then drizzled with both salsa and guacamole. It's so simple and yet illustrates so perfectly what I love most about Mexican food, the way fresh, bright flavors and textures contrast and complement each other. (To think, melted cheese over everything represents Mexican food to most Americans!) The slightly tart nopales, the savory mushrooms, the spicy salsa, the creamy requeson, the crunchy tostada. It's hard not to get it all over your face, but it's worth every messy bite.I think the wife recognizes me now, she smiled so broadly at me this weekend. It's my Saturday morning ritual!(This is my 100th post. Can you believe it?)

Hey, Grace, just wanted to let you know how much I've been enjoying reading your blog! Your adventurous, independent-minded spirit comes through loud and clear.In response to:\"(To think, melted cheese over everything represents Mexican food to most Americans!)\"the partial answer is that melted cheese over everything, and simple meat and starches (including wheat tortillas), *is* authentic Norteno food. Take a drive through Baja or Sonora sometime, and you'll begin to regret that cattle were ever introduced to the Americas, with all the queso fundido and machaca that they entail. The older generation of Mexicans in the US, as I'm sure you know, came from the North. One of the best Oaxacan restaurants in LA is around the corner from my office, and yet most of my many Chicano colleagues all turn up their noses at it as \"weird.\" Since I love Oaxacan (and Yucatecan-- yum!) food, as well, let's hope that with the more recent wave of immigration from the South these expectations of what Mexican food \"should\" be will change...
AppleSister
2007-08-28 11:30:00
Yep, I agree. The superfine corn tortillas that you find in Oaxaca are common in Southern Mexico whereas Northern Mexico has the flour tortillas. But I'm surprised that other Mexicans consider Oaxaqueno food as weird considering that even within the country, the state is recognized for its culinary distinction.
AppleSister
2007-08-28 11:36:00
15 pesos is about $1.35. Mmm!That's interesting, about norteno food being melted cheese. It reminds me of this book I read on the history of Indian food and how what the first immigrants brought to England and the U.S. affected what even immigrants from other regions cooked in restaurants. Anna, at least you have Oaxacan restaurants in LA! It was my first taste of mole negro 4 years ago at Guelaguetza that led me to come here...

2007-08-29 10:43:00
I wonder if it's a Mexican-American thing. Erin also said that her Mexican-American friends all prefer flour tortillas to corn, whereas I've only had one flour tortilla in my life that I really loved. I hate how they generally get all gummy in your teeth.

Mercado Hidalgo is considered a little \"fresa,\" which literally means \"strawberry\" but is also Mexican slang meaning \"snobby.\" It's located in upper-class Colonia Reforma, on Emilio Carranza on the block north of Palmeras, and its produce does sparkle. I saw stuff that I hadn't seen in other markets in Oaxaca, like huitlacoche and fresh figs. I almost flipped when I saw the figs, as it doesn't quite feel like summer unless I eat some fresh figs. They also had beautiful bunches of quelites, a type of Mexican green, leafy vegetable, which inspired me to actually try one of the recipes from my new Mexican cookbook, \"Alquimias y Atmosferas de Sabor,\" by Carmen Ramirez Degollado, the chef and owner of the beloved \"El Bajio\" in Mexico City. I've been trying to read more Spanish, since I remember more from reading than hearing, but the only thing that really holds my interest enough to get through more than a few pages are cookbooks and food magazines. Unfortunately, reading them doesn't challenge me as much as reading literature or news articles would because I know enough about how recipes are constructed to figure out most of what I read through context. For example, as I read a recipe calling for \"chayotes tiernos,\" I guessed that \"tierno\" meant fresh or tender, didn't bother looking it up in the dictionary, and then was shocked when my Spanish teacher described her ex-boyfriend as acting very gentlemanly and very \"tierno\" on their first date. It turns a man can be as tender as a vegetable.Rick Bayless translates \"quelites\" as \"lamb's quarters,\" and recommends substituting it in his recipes with chard or collard greens in the U.S., some green with strong flavors. But I'm not sure that he's describing the same thing I bought, as my \"quelites\" were more like spinach, just better. They had a similar sweet flavor, and reminded me a lot of Korean spinach with its leggy stems, but without the furry aftertaste of a lot of American spinach. Also, I know that the word \"quelites\" is used to describe a whole category of Mexican greens, including even amaranth leaves which are also called \"quintonil,\" and amaranth leaves are distinctly stronger and more bitter, more like chard.But I digress. The recipe was very simple, a rice with greens dish, calling for the rice to be fried with pureed raw onion and garlic. Then broth was to be added with the bunch of raw quelites, two parts broth to one part rice. Like most Mexican recipes, it assumed a lot of knowledge on the part of the reader, and I wondered, \"Stalks and all? Should I pulverize the leaves and make it a green rice? Should I throw the leaves in whole?\" Finally, I decided to just destem them, chop them roughly and throw them in with the broth leftover from cooking my pork shoulder.Well, I put in way too much broth, forgetting the leaves would emit a fair amount of water themselves, and I ended up with a rice with greens porridge. I mistakenly thought I could avoid burning the rice this time by adding more broth earlier on. I also think there's a reason chicken broth is normally used to cook rice, not pork broth, because although the flavor was richer than it would have been with water, it wasn't rich in quite the right way. But the quelites didn't turn turd green, I got to try cooking with them, and I still enjoyed my rice mush very much. Thank God I had my shameless solitude.

So my maniacal devotion to Rick Bayless continues, and I am going through his Oaxaca list of recommended restaurants like a pilgrim on the trail to a sainted relic. Monday was my day to eat fish, to give my body just a bit of a rest from the picadillo I ate on Sunday and the big pot of quinoa, chorizo, potato, and carrot I made on Saturday. So off I went to Marco Polo.The restaurant has several locations, but it's generally accepted that the best one is on Pino Suarez, the east side of El Llano or Parque Juarez, as it's known on all the maps and to no one else. Given how far inland Oaxaca is, seafood is very popular, and the restaurant was crowded at four in the afternoon.My first regret, as I looked at the menu, was that I was alone. So much I wanted to try, and yet how much could one woman eat? Shark (cazon) quesadillas, shark tostadas, shark all kinds of things, not to mention a whole section for cebiches and pulpos. I took a deep breath, told myself I could come back, and calmly ordered one dish: a filete de pescado al horno, or a filet of red snapper baked in their outdoor, wood-burning oven.Honestly, when it finally arrived and I had already eaten half the bread basket, it didn't look like much. But then I took my first bite and smiled. The fish had real flavor, its own flavor and more. I could taste the fire in which it had been cooked, the slight bite with the ground chiles sprinkled on it, and when I smeared a bit of chipotle mayonnaise on it, the fish just took off into outer space. It wasn't at all undercooked, and of course, it wasn't overcooked, just the perfect texture to give you something to chew, even as it melted away.The little mound of rice it came with was very good, too, and I was sorry there was so little of it. Instead of tortillas, there was a dry bolillo, or torpedo-shaped hard roll, that did nothing to change my mind about Mexican bread, and then some flat tostadas, crispy and perfect for dipping into the darkly spicy salsa.Sadly, because I had scraped every last bit of fish off its foil, I was too full to try the platanos baked in their oven, drizzled with a little crema. I am going to strong-arm my friends Mimi and Alex, who arrive this Saturday, into going with me again.

The Mercado Sanchez Pascuas, just a little north of Quetzalcoatl with its bright green entrances on both Porfirio Diaz and Tinoco y Palacios, is probably my favorite everyday market in Oaxaca. It's not as overwhelming as the Mercado Abastos, or as colorful as Mercado Juarez, and it doesn't have the steamy meat market-slash-taco stands of Mercado 20 de noviembre, but it feels like a neighborhood market, and increasingly, like my neighborhood market. It's smaller than the ones closer to the zocalo described in the all the guidebooks, and on a weekday afternoon, you might even think it was half-empty. But every Saturday and Sunday morning, it's bustling with people buying fresh blandas, flowers, tamales, all kinds of produce, various jugos, and even some barro verde, the pottery with the dark green glaze. Unlike the surly people at Mercado Juarez, the people at Mercado Sanchez don't mind if you handle and pick your fruit yourself. Because it's smaller, you can also see more clearly where people are clustering to buy their chicken or pork and gauge which carnicerias have the freshest meat. It's also easier to notice who has criollo tomatoes, those heirloom tomatoes that have so much more flavor, or even criollo avocados with their enormous pits and a high, clean taste, if somewhat less rich and creamy in flavor. (You can find some fantastic photos from Planeta.com.)This past Sunday, after a fortifying breakfast of chocolatle atole and empanadas, I enlisted my Spanish teacher and friend Lety to help in sussing out the best places to get the ingredients for the picadillo pork tacos I planned to make that afternoon. She pointed in one direction to indicate her favorite carniceria, but from across the market, I misjudged where she was pointing and had already started talking to a woman in a very smelly stand when she came over and whispered, \"I meant that one.\" I murmured my apologies, pretending I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, and we quietly scurried all the way to the other end of the meat section. I didn't know if I could literally translate English phrases for pork cuts into Spanish, if pork shoulder is \"espalda\" or \"pierna\" or something completely different, so to our new butcher, I just asked for the cut of meat that had a lot of \"grasa\" or fat. \"Ah, espaldita!\" he said. He proudly showed off the layer of fat glistening on the piece of pork, and Lety nodded with approval. Later, when I asked her if I should trim some of the fat off before we cooked it, she said, \"But that will remove the flavor!\" God, I love Mexico.After seeing the \"picadillo\" recipe in Rick Bayless's cookbook last weekend, I had spent all week just thinking about it, when and where I should buy the meat, whether I should cook it on Saturday or Sunday. I had read the recipe over and over, charmed by the thought of taking shredded, cooked pork shoulder, and then browning it, scraping it up as it stuck to the pot, with chopped onion, a handful of raisins, a handful of chopped almonds, a little cinnamon, an even smaller pinch of freshly ground cloves, and a roasted tomato-pasilla oaxaquena sauce. But I'd never even tried it, so I was thankful to have Lety there to say, \"Oh, it looks a little dry,\" or \"Add a little sugar.\" The picadillo was as easy as promised, even though it took about 2 and half hours to make, to simmer the pork shoulder with all its fat, to grind the cloves in a little molcajete, to chop and toast the almonds, to make the sweet smoky salsa, and then to cook it all together. But it was very laid-back cooking, though there was a moment when I realized trying to understand Spanish and chop almonds at the same time is the kind of multi-tasking that is yet beyond me. But otherwise, we chatted easily as she told me about the terrible people at her workplace and I told her about the horrible blind date I went on before I left New York. Lety even showed me how to make horchata:1) Carefully clean and wash about 1 cup of rice. Let it soak in water about 2 inches above the rice with some broken canela, the equivalent probably of 2 American cinnamon sticks. Let it sit for about 2 hours, until the rice gets soft enough that you can pinch a kernel in half.2) Blend everything in the blender as smooth as possible. 3) Strain into a pitcher, reserving any rice-cinnamon paste for \"atole de arroz.\" (I only had a strainer, but I imagine a cheesecloth would be better.)4) Add water and sugar to taste. Make sure to stir it up immediately before pouring it into a glass, as some sediment will sink to the bottom.Incredibly clean and pure. I can totally see myself doing this in Brooklyn on a hot summer day. Other recipes I've seen say that you should add ground almonds, and I imagine that would be wonderful, too, as well as some pureed bright red, tiny cactus fruits with their prickly armor of skin.I chopped up some jicama, radishes, avocado, and pickled jalapeno for garnish and heated up some of this week's pot of black beans while Lety warmed and wrapped the tortillas in a towel. With the bright pink pitcher of horchata and a little leftover mezcal, we had a very colorful feast.And the picadillo I liked as much as last Sunday's supper of greens, onions, and cheese tacos. It wasn't at all spicy--which Lety assured me was normal--but it had such a range of flavors, from smoky to rich to slightly sweet and nutty. It was complex and yet easily appealing, almost as warming as Lety's company. Definitely one to add to the taco buffet dinner I intend to host when I get back to New York.

Don't let people tell you that \"estofada\" is one of the seven moles of Oaxaca. It isn't, as delicious as it is, not according to people I trust. According to Susana Trilling, moles always involve cooking the meat separately from the sauce, while an estofada translates literally as a stew, the meat cooked in it. Soledad Ramirez agrees that estofada is not a mole. I thought by getting a mole sampler at Los Pacos, I would finally try all seven, but they only had six and it included estofada.Counterclockwise from the bottom darkest one, we were told they were negro, amarillo, verde, chichilo, estofada and rojo. The people at Los Pacos were nice, and even gave Erin a bib to eat with, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant because the high prices weren't justified by the food, which could be had in equal quality elsewhere. Also, I'm now thoroughly confused because I can't figure out the difference between rojo and coloradito. Los Pacos's rojo tasted just like coloradito to me. Googling recipes online doesn't help, as there's no consensus, but again, according to Susana Trilling, only coloradito and negro include chocolate. So what the hell are the people selling at Chocolate Mayordomo as prepared rojo mole paste? It may be that I haven't had both, just one, I just don't know which one.At least I know I had chichilo for sure, as I ordered it expressly at Casa del Tio Guero, or \"Uncle Whitey's House.\" It was the day my camera died for the first time, so there's no photographic record. In addition to burning chiles, a tortilla is burnt, making chichilo even smokier than mole negro. It's generally served with green beans and vegetables, as well as meat. It had a fruitier, tarter flavor, while being bitter at the same time, and frankly, I didn't like it, but Susana Trilling says it's very good, and I imagine it's the kind of thing where I need to try a better version.Sadly, manchamantel, or tablecloth stainer, remains elusive.

Delicious pork fat at El Biche Pobre

As I ate lunch on Wednesday, I thanked God that I had run 2.5 miles uphill towards Monte Alban earlier that day. My judgment may have been clouded by drink, as I started drinking my Bohemia beer and eating tortilla chips like a madwoman before my food came, but I have never tasted such delicious pork fat in my life as I did at El Biche Pobre.I had spent nearly all morning in the kitchen at Puente, trying to make amaranth-corn tortillas from scratch. I had boiled dried corn kernels with limestone the day before and let it sit overnight, and then rinsed carefully and rubbed away at each husk, almost individually, as per these instructions (which turned out to be wrong since the corn kernels need to be cooked 15 minutes or more). Rather than take a handful of corn and amaranth to the molino, I'd lugged my molcajete to work on the bus and decided to grind away by hand. One of the staff laughed and said I was \"una mujer de campesinos,\" or a peasant woman. The temperature in the office is cool, even in the kitchen, but I started to get so hot as I mashed away at that corn, and when I tried to grind the amaranth, I had to deal with the sticky paste that stuck to the mortar, the pestle, me, and everything else it came in contact with.For all that work, since I hadn't made very much masa or dough, I got 6 measly little tortillas. (They had good flavor, but they were too inflexible to be tortillas, memelitas maybe.) I ate one of them, and other than a banana, nothing else from breakfast to 3 p.m., when I left work. I felt like a crazed, hungry animal.I'd never heard of \"El Biche Pobre\" until that day, but I caught a mention of it in a TripAdvisor thread and when I Googled it, it turned out to be one of Rick Bayless's favorites. As I am becoming increasingly maniacal in my devotion to him, that was enough to get me lurching towards Calzada de la Republica 600, at the corner of Hidalgo, just two blocks east of El Llano park.\"El Biche Pobre\" calls itself a \"comedor familiar,\" which I assume means \"down-home food.\" They're particularly famous for their botanas, or bar snacks, and instead of getting a proper meal of soup, rice, meat, and tortillas, I opted for the botana plate for one, one of all of the above. Of course, since I was eating bar snacks, I had to have a beer.Immediately, I knew I was somewhere special. The chips that came in the plastic basket were perfect, crispy, completely dry and without grease, with so much flavor they didn't need salt, maybe just a dab or two one or the other of their salsas, green and red, and their guacamole. I was also given a little bowl of pickled dried peppers, onions, and garlic. I sucked the garlic out of their little papery jackets, licking my fingers and not caring what I looked like. That was probably the beer. I'd had pickled garlic before, but not like this, where they had been softened by cooking and then marinated in a vinegary sauce, like an escabeche. The dried peppers were also fantastic, smoky and intense but not so hot that I couldn't taste anything else.When my plate came, I honestly felt the slightest bit of disappointment. I'd read that their botana plate for one was huge, and this, while ample, wasn't actually incredible. And then they brought out the second plate.On the first plate, clockwise from the top: a fried taquito with guacamole; a piece of cold pork with avocado, tomato and pickled jalapeno; a quesadilla with cheese and epazote; a chile relleno; some pieces of pork milanesa; a bocadillo de papas or potato croquette; and the piece-de-resistance in the middle, \"carne frita\" or fried meat.On the second plate, clockwise from the tamal: a tamal of frijoles sitting on top of another piece of cold meat; a memela with lard and crumbled cheese; a tostada with potatoes; and another tostada with beans, cheese, tomato and avocado.I will only touch upon what truly moved me.When I put a small piece of the \"carne frita\" in my mouth, I almost shouted, \"What is this?\" When I asked the waiter, all he could say was \"meat of the pork,\" \"meat of the pork,\" so I still don't really know what made it so delicious. I am not normally a huge pork fat eater. I love fat for the way it conveys flavors, not so much in and of itself, but this made me realize that just plain old fat could be wonderful. It wasn't like carnitas that melt in your mouth, or the porchetta-like roast I made last winter that practically collapsed in its own fat. It held itself together, with a good chewy texture, a lovely crispy exterior, and a melting layer of fat in the middle. Such a tiny piece to pack such a punch.The chile relleno was my second favorite. Instead of using a fresh chile, they had taken a dried pasilla chile and filled it with more pork, shredded this time. It had a slightly sweet flavor, but almost the flavor of sweet hot peppers rather than a more straightforward, insipid sweetness. The memela was very simple, just a crunchy, almost tough, corny little oblong, brushed with nothing more than \"asiento\" or lard and garnished with a little crumbled cheese. Its simplicity was its charm, like eating a perfect baguette with butter from French cows.I loved the pork milanesa, more than any other I've had here, because the breading was greaseless and well-salted. Is \"milanesa\" really mean that it's from Milan? And is \"milanesa\" preparation related at all to Japanese fried pork cutlet, donkatsu? Sometimes, I'm embarrassed to say all my lefty politics goes out the window when I think about the food benefits of globalization.Everything else was very good, except the bocadillo de papa which was just boring.I staggered out of the restaurant almost dazed. I had to get home as quickly as possible so I could lie down, but having woken up at 6:30 in the morning to go running with my neighbor and her friend, my legs hurt. But I still stopped for a cantaloupe paleta at Popeyes.

Playing with amaranth

***CONTENT
You, dear friends and family, know that the word \"macrobiotic\" makes me itch. It is only slightly higher than the bottom-rung words \"raw food\" and slightly below \"vegan\" in my hierarchy of words that describe things I want to eat. I love quinoa, I love those Heritage Flakes made by Nature's Path made of \"ancient grains,\" even as I'm tittering at my cereal box, but amaranth is, in the U.S., the province of people who need gluten-free foods, and although I would never sneer at other's misfortune, I've never felt a need to share in their misfortune. So I'd never tasted amaranth beyond what was put into the aforementioned Heritage Flakes until last Monday. And now I'm eating amaranth until it comes out of my ears.¿Por que? It's my volunteer job to cook it, play with it, and of course, taste it. It's the best volunteer, nonpaid job I've ever had, even more evidence that the gods are smiling on me. Amaranth, or amaranto en espanol, is one of those forgotten plants that seem to promise everything. It has incredibly high amounts of protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients, much more than corn, and these nutrients manifest themselves in a form more easily digestible and absorbable than in other foods. When combined with corn or other grains, it even forms a complete protein. It's native to Mexico and Latin America, but amaranth was significant in religious rituals for indigenous peoples here, and so was stamped out by the Spanish. Puente's work in community health in rural Oaxaca therefore has a simple, straightforward message: eat more amaranth. They're working with farmers to grow it, especially since it commands four times the price of corn, and they work with women in the communities to develop new recipes incorporating amaranth into their diet. Malnutrition in Oaxaca is more the result of a lack of variety in the diet rather than a straightforward lack of food; in fact, obesity and diabetes are leading causes of death here. Although the organization has already developed a fair number of recipes using amaranth flour, amaranth leaves, and puffed amaranth, which is usually sold in Oaxaca in honey-amaranth bars called \"alegrias,\" meaning \"joys,\" but they haven't done much experimenting yet with the seed or grain itself. So everyday, I think about what typical foods in the pueblos could incorporate some amaranth grain without being too strange, without requiring foreign or expensive ingredients. That means most American hippie-gluten-averse-health-nut recipes are out, and even a fair number of ingredients that I think of as Mexican but aren't really available to poor rural Oaxacans, like cheese or tomatillos or chicken. In any case, since this is my first time actually trying to create recipes, it's a relief not to have the whole world at my disposal. They don't expect me to perfect recipes, just to see what works and perhaps more important, what absolutely doesn't work, before they encourage the women in their communities to experiment themselves. So I started by just cooking amaranth straight, trying to understand what basic properties it had, what basic flavor it had, and thinking about how it would complement the flavors in existing rural Mexican food. The moment I tasted my first mouthful, I learned something very elemental: wash it first. It was so embarrassing to eat gritty, gummy amaranth, even standing alone in the kitchen. I did eventually find a better way to cook it: either to boil it, covered, in twice as much water as amaranth for 15 minutes, or to boil it uncovered in a lot of broth, like rice or pasta soup, for 25 minutes. This way, the grains stayed distinct, even if they still stuck together, and they retained a pleasantly nutty flavor. At this point, though, I don't know how well the flavor and texture are going to go across with the communities. As the program director put it, while tasting the chicken soup with amaranth, you'd have to be okay with having millions of tiny little grains in your mouth. (My friend Sharon, who has a fear of small, round things, would absolutely die.)One of the best things about this job is that I'm forced to get over my fear of cooking really basic Mexican food. I thought amaranth, even when gummy, would taste pretty good mixed up with nopales, or cactus, and diced tomato, lime juice, and cilantro, like the salad I'd been served when I visited a community with the executive director a month ago. So I went out and bought cactus paddles, already de-spined and cleaned, at the Gigante grocery store in the neighborhood. Most Mexican recipes for nopales don't even bother telling you how to cook it, they just say, \"Cook the nopales and then...\" So I had to Google some English-language recipes. Although Rick Bayless says they're best when grilled, I thought I should cook it in the way they would most likely be cooked in the pueblos and boiled them with some water and salt for 15 minutes, until tender. I rinsed them carefully to minimize their slimy tendency and was surprised to find they had a tart, bright flavor of their own, separate from the lime juice and cilantro I was ready to add. Nopales are usually sort of slimy anyway, and the gumminess of the amaranth wasn't too weird in combination. This was successful enough that a couple of Puente staff had it for lunch with salsa and tostadas. But most exciting of all, I'm being forced to make tortillas from scratch! Tortillas, tamales, and atole all come from the same base, dried corn kernels that are boiled with limestone to remove the tough outer husks and then ground very finely and combined with water to make a dough for tortillas or tamales, or added to boiling water and sometimes chocolate to make a filling hot drink, like champurrado. Puente would love to know if a handful can just be thrown into the pot to make masa. My first attempt was okay, tasty the way a whole-wheat, crunchy piece of bread can be tasty, just not tortilla-like at all. I had another pot sitting overnight, so we'll see what happens today with a different ratio of corn to amaranth.

Raj! Thank you, my tortillas yesterday were better than the day before, but I don't think it was the different amount of amaranth, I think I'm just getting better at making tortillas :)

Beginning my explorations in Colonia Reforma: Ecatepec

The walk from home to Puente takes over 30 minutes each way, and not all of it is pretty, but I'd rather walk than take the bus because it's the only exercise I get, and because I can take mental notes on places to eat. The office is located in Colonia Reforma, an upper-class, semi-suburban neighborhood, a litte north and east of the historic center. This means that in addition to your usual tortas, tacos, and other street food antojitos, of which there are still plenty, there is also a spiffier Gigante grocery store and the original branch of Pan & Co., a bakery that makes the only bread I've really enjoyed, as its schtick is European-style artisanal bread. Seriously, their ciabatta is amazing, and even better with a bit of passion fruit-coffee jam from the organic market. Colonia Reforma is not a tourist neighborhood, so I have no guidebook to review, just my eyes and my nose. It's intoxicating.I left work yesterday with a mission to get to the tacos arabe place on Calzada Porfirio Diaz, strongly recommended to me by a sister of a friend, as I thought pita bread would be a nice change from tortillas, but on my way, I saw that Ecatepec, a restaurant I had assumed was too expensive for me, had a 40-peso \"comida corrida\" or set meal for lunch. Located on the corner of Belisario Dominguez and Colegio Militar, it has a proud, whitewashed look, very spick-and-span and middle-class. It also declares that it is both a restaurant and a \"galeria,\" and true enough, there were some folksy mixed-media paintings on the wall of indigenous subjects.I chose the sopa de lentejas, or lentil soup, and the rice as my \"sopa seca.\" Mexican menus generally won't describe what's actually in a soup or on a plate, unlike the American trend of telling you not only about the provenance of the vegetables, herbs, and meat that went into the dish, but also how the salt was harvested and the how freshly the pepper was ground. So when I got it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it had been cooked in a fish broth, with small chunks of a grayish-white fish. It had the particular briny flavor of all fish broths without being fishy, which I'd never tasted with lentils before, and I liked it a lot. Mexican rice is generally considered a \"dry soup\" because the rice is basically boiled in broth until the liquid evaporates, rather than steamed. It's very smart as the stoves won't turn down low to simmer. Also good, and simple with bits of carrot and corn kernels. I love American corn, but sometimes, I like Mexican corn even more, the way it doesn't assault you with its sugary sweetness. For my \"guisado,\" which literally means stew but also \"main dish,\" I had a hard time choosing between the chicken in cacahuate sauce, or peanut sauce, and the \"coliflor relleno de queso,\" because I was so curious about what cauliflower stuffed with cheese would look like. Well, it turned out to look just like a knish, except it didn't sit like a brick in my stomach. It was actually really good, the simple smoothness of the steamed cauliflower with the sharp saltiness of the queso fresco, with the whole thing was just coated in a light, fried batter. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the coliflor came with sliced avocado, sliced tomato, and a delicious salad of nopales, or cactus, in a chunky, tomato salsa. I didn't know until I cooked nopales myself for the first time last week, but nopales when just cooked have a tart, tangy flavor of their own, separate from any salsa or lime juice you might add. The salsa was a good way to mask how slimy nopales can get. I like nopales, even when they are oozing their okra-like slime, but it's a little disconcerting when you can see the thread of slime stretching between your fork and the plate.But best of all, ironically enough after my quest for tacos in pita bread, were the tortillas. They were large, about the size of a dinner plate, and revealed multiple, thin layers when you tore one in half, almost like Malaysian roti. Like perfectly cooked East Asian white rice, their blandness was their banner of pride, because then you could taste how perfectly cooked and almost nutty it was.Dessert was extra, and I was stuffed, so I walked on towards the Oaxaca Lending Library to return my books, but by the time I got there, I'd digested enough to want a pecan popsicle at Paleteria Popeye. Seriously, why don't we have popsicles with real flavors in the U.S.? This popsicle had even the slight bitterness of real nuts. I've had probably 10 popsicles in the past 2 months, compared to maybe one in the previous 10 years, and will probably have 10 more before I leave. God, I'm so lucky.

Tlamanalli in Teotitlan del Valle

***CONTENT
So I went to Teotitlan del Valle to look visit some rug workshops and eat at the famed Zapotecan restaurant, Tlamanalli, but ended up instead just eating at Tlamanalli with three guys who went to business school in London together, and who are now taking a roadtrip through Mexico, a la \"Y tu mama tambien,\" but without the drugs and the hot older woman. Life is so funny when you're traveling alone.This whole past week was a bit of an adjustment. I've started volunteering at Puente a la Salud Comunitaria, an organization that promotes amaranth as a way of fighting malnutrition in rural Oaxaca. Although it's been good to have some structure in my life, I'm now at the phase of my adventures where every friend from ICO is gone, Erin and Elena are gone, and I now have to face what it really means to travel alone. The upside is that life is really cheap when you have no friends. The downside is that you have no friends. Luckily, the one thing I am good at doing alone is eating. I feel so awkward at a bar by myself, and a club would be my worst nightmare, but give me some utensils and something to eat, and my hunger will squash any feelings of embarrassment. I had asked my neighbor if she wanted to go to Tlamanalli with me today, but she already had plans to visit a mezcal factory. I thought about waiting to make the trip until Mimi and Alex get here, but then I thought, what if it's so good, I want to go again?Teotitlan del Valle is one of the small towns surrounding Oaxaca, and its cottage industry is its handwoven rugs. They're quite expensive, as Oaxacan handicrafts go, but at the prices they charge, they still only get paid $1/hour for their labor. Some of them are garish, more than a few inexplicably incorporate Matisse's blue woman collage cut-out, but most are beautiful, with expensive colors that come from natural sources, like the cochineal bug, which produces a deep, rich red. I've been tempted to buy a rug or two, but I recently decided that if I buy a rug at all this year, it will be in Morocco.So what really drew me to Teotitlan del Valle was Tlamanalli, a restaurant that makes a mole negro that Rick Bayless describes as \"what dreams are made of.\" It's a foodie pilgrimage site, raved about in the NY Times, Saveur, Chowhound, with even a Culinary Institute of America podcast of Abigail Mendoza, the owner and chef demonstrating how to make mole negro. The fact that you have to get out of Oaxaca only makes it more magical to the kind of people who like to drive around the French countryside eating at restaurants with Michelin stars.But when I got there around 2, prime comida-time, the restaurant was empty, save for a table of three guys in their 30s. They were speaking excellent English, but with a peculiar range of accents, from slightly European to slightly British to slightly American. When they realized I was there alone, they pulled up a chair and invited me to join them. They turned out to be Luis and Alberto, two Mexicans from the Yucatan who had studied with Jeff, the American, in London last year, and who were now on vacation together. Jeff, despite his absurdly American name, had the most un-American accent of them all, and it turned out he had grown up all over the world, including high school in Madrid, and was now living in Finland working for Nokia. He looked like a Scandinavian Boy Scout, too, a clean-cut blond with pale-blue eyes, while Luis looked like a kindly investment banker losing a bit of hair at the top of his head but not his sense of humor. Alberto, the dark, good-looking one, looked like the kind of guy that goes to business school but doesn't think he belongs there, with a piece of jade on a red cord around his neck and talk of his surfing gear that he was taking to Puerto Escondido. They had the easy camaraderie of old friends--Jeff and Luis even had a story about having once bribed their way out of a Russian jail--and a \"kitty\" out of which they paid all their expenses. They had one whole day in Oaxaca before heading out to the coast, and they had driven out to Teotitlan del Valle to eat at Tlamanalli because they heard it was really good. They thought it was funny, but not strange, that I had come out there by myself to eat, that I had come out to Oaxaca by myself to eat, though Alberto did remark that I was too skinny to be such a big eater. It was the kind of encounter that only happens when you're traveling: easy, of-the-moment, with no expectations. There was only the mildest undercurrent of flirtation, and more out of politeness than design, like the way gay men will sometimes flirt with straight women. (I think they were straight.) They were good conversationalists, and they knew about the kinds of things I was interested in, like San Sebastian, Spain, and pig-farming and the onset of industrialized poultry production in Mexico. Usually the words \"business school\" trigger all kinds of prejudice in me, but they were the kind of people I might meet in New York, unlike the hippie retirees I keep meeting, and I felt almost a homesick attraction to them. Of course, in New York, I would never end up eating with three strange guys in a random town in upstate New York and then get in their car when they offered me a ride back to the city. Only in Oaxaca.So how was the food, you ask? Wonderful. It's a homey place, with not-so-homey prices, but everything is done with great pride and care, as in the highest of high-end restaurants. I started with a complimentary shot of mezcal that was fiery but clean. It was good the restaurant was dark, as I was wearing a sundress and I could feel my Asian flush creeping up my neck and face. I skipped the soup to save room for dessert, and went straight to the chicken in mole negro, which was thinner than any mole I've had before, just barely coating the chicken. Just slightly sweet, very black, but not bitter, which now that I know how to make it, just amazes me that you can burn the hell out of the seeds and then balance it so that you only retain the smoky complexity and not the bitterness. Again, it was a piece of breast with actual flavor. In the U.S., my only hope in cooking white breast meat is to keep it tender and moist, as it's the only way to make it palatable. Here, it can even be on the verge of dryness and yet still be flavorful, something you actually want to eat. Sadly, they didn't have the flan of elote, so I settled on a café de olla and a nieve of zapote negro, a fruit that Luis said looked like a green apple but with a black interior. Luis said he grew up hating it, that it gets made into a pudding in the Yucatan, but Alberto insisted that the ice cream tasted different than the zapote negro they'd eaten growing up. Jeff and I, with no childhood associations to burden us, decided it tasted like rich, sticky fig, made it into an icy sorbet. It wasn't cheap, among the more expensive meals I've had in Oaxaca, but definitely one of the most amusing. I know that I would get tired if life were only a string of encounters like this lunch, with nothing more permanent to give me ballast (sorry, what a horror of a mixed metaphor), but it's nice to be reminded that surprises like this only happen when you're eating alone.

My sister wanted to know where I was living, and I don't have much to report food-wise, as all I've been eating is amaranth (more on that to come).I've moved to a smaller apartment, further into the building on Calle M. Bravo and away from the street, and it's changed my life. My friends who were living in other apartments in the same building didn't understand at first why I complained about the noise. \"Our place is noisy too,\" they would say, until they spent an hour or so in mine. The landlady refused to lower the rent, even though my new place is half the size of my old place, but I didn't care. I thought briefly about getting worked up, about being righteously angry or strategically firm, but even just thinking about it took more energy than I wanted to expend. In any case, I do like the new apartment so much more. It's not just the noise, it's the space. There must be good feng-shui. It's always been a beautiful building. Like many old-fashioned buildings in Oaxaca, the apartments are built around a central courtyard. The outside is a feeble sort of peach color, but the inside is a deep brick-red with very clean, fresh white columns and ceilings. Inside the courtyard, you can find a slim yet tall lime tree, an empty fountain, a dark pink bougainvillea just directly across from the front gate, and a riot of potted plants. I find my landlady so frustrating, it's hard to reconcile her with all the plants gracing her courtyard, but nearly every courtyard I've seen is overflowing with plants so perhaps a love of greenery is a general Oaxacan characteristic, and not a sign of individual character.Onti, the man who owns the sporting goods store facing the street, lives with his family in one group of rooms on the eastern side of the courtyard. There a bit of a tin roof over his portion, which makes me so happy every time it rains, and it rains everyday. The rest is divided into 6 apartments, three in front and three even further back, quieter but not directly on the courtyard. Since Calle M. Bravo slopes steeply westward, the three in front on the western side of the courtyard are on a raised platform. These apartments were obviously designed to be short-term tourist apartments, as none are big enough for families and all are decorated to accord with Western ideas about home décor, but they're lovely, if spare, with Mexican tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens and solid, dark wood furniture. My apartment is just two rooms, a kitchen with a mini-fridge, a little table, and a small couch. You walk up three little steps to the bedroom, which has a built-in desk and a closet and then just enough room for a full-size bed with a little space to walk around it. It's very small, just big enough for me, but it makes me feel more secure than the other one. If I were a dog, I'd be the kind that likes to hide under the bed. All the souvenirs I've bought as gifts and for myself fill the apartment and make it homey, while they just rattled around in the cavernous rooms of the other apartment. I like having a little table instead of a counter and barstools. I don't mind having less counter space, I don't even get mad when I see ants walking on the little counter space I have. I just kill them calmly and drink my tea. The woman living here before was complaining how she had requested 3 separate rooms, but she's clearly from California. If it were in Manhattan, it would be advertised as a one-bedroom (with closets!) and the rent would be $1600.And now that I'm not so pissy and edgy from the street noise, I can actually appreciate how charming the courtyard is. Every morning, I go outside with my breakfast and drink my coffee sitting in the big green chair by my door. The mornings are so beautiful here, with enough sun to warm you without a jacket, but with just enough breeze to make you almost, just almost wish you had one.

Fighting malaise at El Tule

Last Sunday, eating an empanada de mole amarillo in El Tule, I realized that as long as I have an appetite, I will always be able to cheer myself up. There are those times when even I lose my appetite, like when No-No dumped me and I stopped eating for a week. But general malaise, pshaw!, I can easily get rid of just by going someplace I've never been in search for something good to eat.Sunday morning, my last friends from ICO, who were also my neighbors, left Oaxaca. It had been a difficult, emotional time for them, and even watching them leave as a bystander was so exhausting, I considered forgetting my plans to go to El Tule and just getting in bed with \"Black Lamb and Gray Falcon,\" the book that will not end. I felt a little sad about being alone in Oaxaca and a little sorry for myself. But after I'd mopped the tiny footprint of my apartment, I was hungry, and I thought I should seize the opportunity to go try one of the famous empanadas de mole amarillo of El Tule, only available on Sundays.El Tule is otherwise famous for its giant cypress tree, over 2000 or 4000 years old depending on who you talk to. I don't know how tourism from the tree can be so lucrative when the entrance fee is 3 pesos, but the town seemed to be profiting well from the tree, as the buildings in the center were fresh and brightly painted, almost like Disneyworld, right down to the white-maroon-and-blue church.I walked right by the entrance booth and around the church, looking for the empanada place recommended to me by my homestay mother, Patty, as \"muy limpia.\" I don't know if it was the right place, but it was clean and airy, and I could imagine my middle-class homestay family eating there. It was little more than a straw-roofed shack with plastic tables and chairs, with an arcade attached to it playing loud American rock music, but it a pleasant place to sit on a sunny Sunday afternoon. There was a surly girl working the comal and an older woman swatting flies away from the chicharrones and a sweet-faced man watching a soccer game on TV. I sat down with a bottle of grapefruit soda, in a really good-looking bottle, and waited.It was my fourth taste of mole amarillo, and if not the best, it was very very good. Instead of cilantro, it had the herby scent of hoja santa, the heart-shaped leaf. The mole sauce was thicker than at Iglesia de Carmen Arriba, but spicy, the kind of spiciness that doesn't hit you right away but grows in the back of your throat. The tortilla vehicle was perfect, hot and toasty. I was so happy, I ate another empanada, of flor de calabeza and quesillo. I didn't like it as much, but it didn't matter.I walked through the Mercado de Antojitos, or \"Market of Appetizers,\" across the street but was too full to eat anything else, but next week, I am eating barbacoa, or barbecued goat, for sure. Why don't we have markets of appetizers in the U.S.? I'm sure it would do a great deal for depression.

Impressive, no?The chile-turkey is sitting on top of a refrigerator case of sodas at Tacos Alvaro on Porfirio Diaz at the corner of Quetzalcoatl. They serve quite good tacos, from 2 pm until late at night, which I would describe in greater detail, except I can't quite remember whether I ate \"buche\" or \"trompa,\" which my dictionary both translate as \"mouth\" or \"maw,\" but I'm sure the waiter said one of them was some sort of innards, \"como tripa.\" Erin and I had the \"al pastor\" and \"carnitas\" each, and one was very good and the other very strange, so strange to be inedible even to us, but I can't remember which was which either.We were tired after being in the sun and rain all day for Guelaguetza, and on our way to our all-night bus ride to Puerto Escondido, please forgive me.

The al pastor was the very good taco, the carnitas was the oddly inedible one, to our palates. It was definitely a different cut of meat than the carnitas I'm used to- the meat was so full of cartilage it was crunchy. And I'm pretty sure you had the trompa, not the buche.I just ate a chicken mole tamal from the Civic Center farmer's market for lunch, and while it wasn't bad, it made me yearn to be back in Oaxaca eating the real deal with you!

I had never tried mole coloradito until I got to Oaxaca, but there have been times when I have wondered if it's possible that I like it even more than mole negro. After my cooking lesson with Sra. Soledad, that question was answered forever: a good mole negro is king. But mole coloradito continues to run a close second in my affections, and I was thrilled when they honored my request for it at my second cooking class at Seasons of My Heart. I loved the group at my second class: a contingent of students from a culinary school in Nebraska, two Episcopalian priests married to each other from Texas, their son from Brooklyn who has been working his way through \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" while finishing his dissertation on French literature, two girls from UC Davis who \"came to Oaxaca to eat,\" and a woman from Cincinnati who didn't get mad that I got a little bossy about the mole coloradito. Instead of a market tour in Etla, we started with a cheese-making demonstration by Sylvia in the morning, a woman who grew up in Puebla but met and married a man from Etla and joined the family business of cheese-making. Reyes Etla is famous for its cheese, and even though it is only 30-45 minutes away from Oaxaca, vendors in Oaxacan markets will brag and sometimes even lie that their cheese is from Etla when it's not. Susana Trilling says you can tell what's not from Etla because it's sold in plastic rings, not in the woven straw corsets, nor in the wooden rings that are made from the wood of the tree under which Buddha found enlightenment. (It's amazing, she says things like this in such a matter-of-fact, wry way.)Even though Sylvia is from Puebla, she prefers Oaxacan cheese. All three Oaxacan cheeses come from different steps in one, long process. You start with a piece of dried cow stomach for the coagulant, treated with lime and salt and dried on the roof to keep it away from the dogs (though that doesn't quite make sense to me since people here seem to keep their dogs on their roofs). The cow stomach put in the whey and allowed to release its enzymes for 2-3 days. Then the whey is mixed with cow's milk. When the curds start to separate from the whey, they look at first like silken tofu. Sylvia just stirred the massive bucket with her hand, waiting for it to get crumblier. When it was ready, maybe 15 minutes later, she passed it through a cheesecloth and squeezed out the whey. Without salt, the curds form the beginning of requeson, the Oaxacan version of ricotta, as rich and as delicious with honey as ricotta can be. With salt, the fermentation stops, and it becomes queso fresco, the crumblable cheese that can be found in so many Oaxacan dishes. When boiling water is poured on fermenting cheese curds, it becomes a smooth, tacky mass, the beginning of quesillo, the string cheese that is found in the remaining dishes of Oaxaca.We were each given a small ball to pull and stretch. Mine broke almost immediately, so I ate it. The others were able to pull them sufficiently and them wrap them into tidy little turbaned bundles. It's harder than it looks, to wrap it up just so. And then we rinsed our hands in the warm whey, which instantly made me want to bathe in it. It's probably better for your skin than your fanciest $100 moisturizer.While Susana explained what we would be making, we ate our almuerzo, a brunch to fortify us as we cooked, of \"salsa de queso\" or hunks of queso fresco simmered in a spicy salsa, accompanied by black beans and tortillas. The queso almost took on the texture of cooked tofu, the firm kind this time, with a textured skin and a chewy interior that was cheesy without being gooey. The menu of our main meal, the whole point of the class, was truly Oaxacan this time, with regional specialties I had never tried before.The \"tetelas de juxtlahuaca\" were little turnovers made of masa that looked exactly like hamantaschen, the Jewish cookie made traditionally for Purim, except they were savory rather than sweet and filled with a red bean puree. From the Mixteca Baja region of the mountains near the coast, they were cooked completely on the comal, the circular, slightly concave clay pan that is used to cook tortillas and anything else made of masa, as well as toast chilies and roast tomatoes. They had the wonderful, chewy, toasty exterior of all masa cooked on a comal. Served with a drizzle of Mexican crema, which is like crème fraiche, and then served with a spicy tomato-chile bravo salsa, it was the perfect botana to eat with our beers. Like all good appetizers, it stimulated our appetites for more.The soup was a pureed soup of garbanzo beans, from mountainous areas like Ixtlan in the Sierra Norte, and simmered with mint, it reminded me so much of Middle Eastern soups, though there wasn't any cumin. Not so much an exciting soup as a comforting one.The salad was a happy mélange of green cactus fruit, guavas, red onion, oranges, avocados, pomegranate seeds, and toasted pumpkin seeds, as well as queso fresco, the kind of salad I would throw together without much thought, fruity and tart with lots of crunch. It was fairly complicated, as salads go, if not particularly revelatory, but still a good example of how every good salad should be fruity and tart with lots of crunch.The accompaniment for the mole coloradito was a rice with \"hongos del bosque,\" mushrooms with no real English-language equivalent, so the school calls them \"little brown mushrooms.\" Prosaic, but accurate. The little wrinkly, dried buggers were delicious, and cooked to the point that they were still chewy, a good counterbalance to the tender rice. And the mole, oh the mole. It's one of the hardest things in the world to describe what mole tastes like. But that day, I heard a description that made wonderful sense: if you can taste any one ingredient, you haven't done it right. Like mole negro, the coloradito required substantial toasting of chiles on their comal outside, though this time, just two types, guajillo and ancho, and no full-on burning of chile seeds, which instantly made it more feasible for a Brooklyn dinner. We also toasted the garlic cloves, the whole peppercorns and cloves, a stick of cinnamon, and the white onions. Everything else got cooked separately on the stove inside: the tomatoes and oregano in one pan, and the fried bread, raisins, sesame seeds, and almonds in another pan. Instead of taking it to the village miller, we used the kitchen's amazing two-horsepower blender to puree each component separately, and then pushed everything again through a food mill. That blender was both awesome and frightening, like the first time I used a power tool at a Habitat for Humanity construction site. The pureed chili went in first, a thick, gorgeous mixture that started to get shiny as it started cooking in the cazuela. Susana taught us to look for the \"ojo,\" the eye that would appear as the sauce bubbled up and then broke on the surface. Then the onion-spice mixture, and when that was ready, the tomato mixture, and when that was ready, the plaintain-bread-raisin mush, and then finally the sesame-almond mixture. Like a good Thai curry, you could taste it grow and evolve with each added ingredient, but the best part was possibly near the end, after almost an hour, when we added a great deal of stock, which not only thinned it to the right consistency, it filled it with even more depth and flavor. Finally, we added the chocolate, and salt and sugar to taste.In the traditional way, the chicken had been simmered separately to create the stock and was added to the mole when plating. I got a piece of white meat that I just couldn't understand--it was chewy, but not dry, with real flavor. When I got home, Rick Bayless provided some illumination: Mexican chicken, which is generally free-range without self-consciousness, can handle long-cooking, unlike our \"leaner, less-developed American birds.\" Ha! I love how he makes it sound like American chickens are just puny, flabby things that haven't put in sufficient time at the gym. Now I know why I've enjoyed the white meat I've had here so much.Dessert in Mexico always feels like an afterthought, and I had actually quite hated the boozy mango dessert we had last time, but for once I loved the dessert, a Mexican chocolate boudin. It probably helped that it was made by the teacher leading the culinary school contingent, and even though she told us it would have been better if the bread had been allowed to soak longer in the crema de café mezcal and get softer, I loved the almost tough, chewy texture of the outer edge, contrasted with the smooth, silky interior and the chunks of strawberries embedded inside. (Koreans just love chewy, jjolgit jjolgit textures.)It's almost too much, you know. To make mole negro with Sra. Soledad, to make mole coloradito at Seasons of My Heart. I'll never be able to complain about my life again.

This is a very typical story about traveling in Mexico:Erin and I had decided to take a short two-day hiking trip into the Sierra Norte. Oaxaca state is rich enough to have both pristine surfer beaches and mountains with some of the greatest biodiversity in the world. My Spanish teacher, Lety, used to work with the World Wildlife Federation in the Sierra Norte, and heartily recommended that we go visit Ixtlán de Juarez, a town of about 8,000 people, that communally owns the forest around it and provides guided tours through their tourism office, Ecoturixtlan. When I visited their office in Oaxaca, a tiny one-room office with a woman who probably got a visitor every other day, I was assured that I could easily take a colectivo taxi to Ixtlán any time of day. Colectivo taxis are red and white sedans that shuttle people between the city of Oaxaca and various pueblos outside Oaxaca, for as little as 8 pesos, or about $0.75. The drivers want to fill up before they leave--three in the back, and two in the front next to the driver, but since they're not spacious cars, the person in the middle in the front can end up sitting with the gearshift between their legs. Since Ixtlan was in the mountains and about an hour away, I expected to pay about 50 pesos each. Erin and I got up fairly early and made our way to the sitio, the site from which the Ixtlan colectivos would leave. There was an immense line of 20 or so people, but I wasn't too perturbed, since I'd never had to wait more than 10 minutes or so for a colectivo to leave.After waiting 40 minutes and seeing one car come by, I finally decided I had to do something. No one else seemed perturbed, but I turned to the old woman next to me and asked, \"Is it normal to wait so long?\"\"Oh yes, I've waited one, two hours before.\"\"Ohmigod,\" I thought. \"Is there any other way to get there?\"\"Yes, you can take a special taxi over there, but they charge 50 pesos each.\"This isn't an exact translation, as what she really said was that there was something \"especial aqua.\" \"Aqua\" is a Mexican form of \"aqui\" or \"here,\" but since it's a Mexican word, it means it has a very broad meaning. \"Here\" doesn't mean \"right here,\" this little spot right in front of us. \"Here\" can mean \"right here\" or \"close to here\" or \"sort of here.\" For natives, \"here\" has a vast circumference.Maybe 50 pesos was too much for her, but it wasn't for me, and I wandered over in the direction she had gestured, leaving Erin sitting on a stump calmly reading the Moon Handbook for Oaxaca. But I found nothing that made sense. There were some colectivos with \"Ixtepeji\" on the side, indicating a town between Ixtlán and Oaxaca, but nothing else. I asked the woman selling snacks, \"Is there another way to get to Ixtlán?\" And she told me about a bus that would arrive in an hour, but nothing else.I went back to the old woman and asked again, \"You mean over there? Do you mean the cabs going to Ixtepeji?\"\"Yes, they're special, they charge 50 pesos.\"I went back to the two cab drivers who had been standing around for awhile. \"How much to go to Ixtlan?\"\"250 pesos.\"\"For the car?\"\"For the car.\"Well, at this point, Erin and I were definitely willing to split that to get to Ixtlán. But I thought I might as well ask, \"Does anyone want to go with us?\", and three women popped up, including the woman who had told me I could hire the Ixtepeji car!How is it that the non-Spanish-speaking foreigner organized the \"especial\" car to Ixtlán?!?!?! And why didn't one of the cab drivers, who were literally 20 feet away, come by and offer to take five people for 250 pesos? More than anything, Mexico makes me realize how much I as an American assume that if there is money to be spent, it should be easy to spend it. Mexico is a wonderful country in which to de-New York-ify. You can't control anything, and if you just relax, everything will work out in the end. And to think, I've been huffing and puffing for so much of my life, waiting on a subway platform for a train that broke down.The ride was absolutely beautiful. The road was smooth and well-paved but it turned and turned, in lovely serpentine curves. And when we arrived, we saw a proud little town, so clean and so lovingly maintained. It may be desperately poor, but it didn't look it, with its fresh paint and its sparkling basketball court right next to the central square.The Ecoturixltan office seemed to have our lost our reservation for a cabaña, but no matter, they had one available. At 11 a.m., they said it was too late to start for a long day-hike, but after much repeated, slowly-spoken Spanish on the part of the patient receptionist, we agreed to pay for a full-day hike with a guide the next day and to spend the first day walking around the town and the cabañas in the woods.Yet again, we saw Mexican marketing at work, which is to say it was nonexistent. The receptionist tried to draw us a map, but like most locals in small towns, she had no idea how many turns there were in the roads in her town. We were looking for a \"mirador,\" a look-out point that most people drive to, but the only existing signs were irregularly placed, and not necessarily at every fork in the road. Erin has traveled in Latin America before, and she's just a wonderfully patient person anyway, so neither of us really cared that we were stumbling through cornfields and walking through someone's backyard. We never did find the mirador.But when we got back, we had the sharp, clean hunger of those who've walked in the mountains, and we sat down with easy anticipation for our lunch in the \"Cafeteria\" next to the Ecoturixtlan office. There were two choices, enchiladas or chicken, and we both ordered the chicken.My God, it was so good! It was served in a spicy, brightly flavored, tomato-colored sauce made of guajillo chiles and hoja de aguacate, or avocado leaves, which impart a taste that reminds me of fennel and mint at the same time. You would never have expected it, something so tangy and delicious at a tiny restaurant in the mountains serving two dishes a day, and that only made it even more delicious.The other food revelation of the day was tasting our first \"mango pina.\" The lady at the market told us to peel a bit of the skin at one end and then just suck the juice out. When we arrived at our cabaña in the mountains, we tried to peel it and cut it into chunks, but soon realized it was too stringy to do anything other than squeeze and hope for the best. It really did have the fragrance of a ripe pineapple, somehow grafted onto a mango. She was also selling insane, giant orange mushrooms, and one of my greatest regrets in Mexico is that I didn't buy any.When we fell asleep that night, we sank into the most comfortable king-size bed of our lives. If you are ever in the cabañas in Ixtlán, be sure to ask for Cuarto #4, as you will end up sleeping in the Presidential Suite, the room in which President Vicente Fox stayed, as we were told the following morning. But Mexico wasn't done surprising us. When we woke up the next morning, we had no idea if anyone was going to come and get us. We were 4 kilometers, a little less than 3 miles, outside of town, and we hadn't gotten any real directions about how and where to meet our guide. Around 9:30 a.m., a young man showed up and told us that there weren't any guides available for a hiking trip, but did we want to go on an automobile tour?No we did not. I, thankfully, did not go all-NY on him, but I did say, in an insistent voice, \"But we paid for a guide to take us on a 7-hour hike. That's what we were told yesterday.\"I should have known better just to trust. When we got back to town, we found Eduardo, our guide, and Julian, a Swiss agronomist traveling through Mexico who spoke excellent Spanish. (It's not fair how easily Europeans learn languages.) And we went on our 7-hour hike, through three different kinds of forests, including \"el bosque de nubes\" or the cloud forest, with its ghostly lichens and mists. Sadly, we didn't see any jaguars, but we did see some amazing, perfectly round, perfectly red mushrooms, both poisonous and edible. We also saw the prettiest little meadow on our way back to town, which made me want to twirl and burst into song: \"The hills are alive....with the sound of music!\"We knew as we got closer back to town that we might not be able to catch another colectivo back to Oaxaca. It was past 6:30 pm, but we found the sitio easily enough and got on line. We waited and waited, ate a banana or two, tried to stay out of the afternoon rain, and waited and waited. The people at the Ecoturixtlan office told us a bus would leave at 8:30 p.m. from the gas station, you know, just straight from the central square. After 8:15, the entire line of 8 remaining people got up. \"Where are you going?\", I asked a smiley guy who had tried to find a truck to take all of us back earlier. \"We're going to the bus!\" When we got to the gas station, though, we found a van that had been stopped by the military checkpoint that was also going to Oaxaca, and we decided to hop on board. Everyone in the van was tired and annoyed, and one woman repeatedly kept shouting, \"I'm a lawyer! I'm a teacher! What is the problem?\" Erin and I, however, tried to stay inconspicuous and friendly, as we got thoroughly searched as well. By that point, we knew how to relax. As the young photographer from Mexico City shrugged, \"Asi Mexico,\" \"That's Mexico.\" There was a moment when we thought Erin's backpack with its Camelbak-style plastic waterbag would get confiscated; it was so completely alien to the soldier rifling through her bag. Erin asked me later, \"Do you think that soldier was flirting with us?\" And I answered, \"I don't know, but given how close his gun was to us, I thought it was best to smile a lot.\"We got home in the end, even after finding another military checkpoint right outside the city. The entire van rose up in chorus, \"But we were already searched back there!\" I felt like we'd seen everything there is to see about Mexican transportation--resigned patience, good fortune, and military checkpoints. And we got to eat great chicken and fantastic fruit, and sleep in Vicente Fox's bed! How lucky we were, ique suerte!

\"Bueno.\"\"Bueno, hi, I have reservations but we went to your old location and we are running late. Where is your restaurant located?\"\"Mumble-mumble Louis Vuitton store.\"\"Uh, what is the name of the street? At the corner of what?\"It wasn't a very auspicious beginning to our dinner at the imposingly named Aguila y Sol, meaning Eagle and Sun. Neither Erin nor I are big on white tablecloth restaurants--A) we don't have the money, and B) we're too busy slurping saucy foods in places with plastic tablecloths. But Erin suggested we check out one of the nueva cocina mexicana restaurants in Mexico City that are all the rage, and Aguila y Sol had gotten rave reviews. It also turned out she was plotting to treat me to dinner.Nueva cocina mexicana refers to the trend of young chefs in Mexico City taking Mexican dishes and playing with them, perhaps adding a non-Mexican ingredient or two, but ultimately celebrating the existing complexity of Mexican food traditions, or at least it seemed that way at Aguila y Sol. It reminded me a bit of trendy dim sum in Hong Kong, where the chefs keep the cuisine dynamic and alive, but without creating a gross fusion mess.For those of you who know Seoul, Polanco reminded me exactly of Apkujongdong. Unlike Rodeo Drive or Fifth Avenue, Polanco isn't filled with gawking tourists, just very wealthy Mexico City residents who have the option of shopping at Louis Vuitton one moment, and then going upstairs to eat at Aguila y Sol the next. Everything was new and glassy. The dining room at Aguila y Sol felt a little chilly, with slate-blue velvet high-backed chairs and cube-shaped vases that looked they were going to tip over. Erin reflexively tried to right it as soon as we sat down. The vase glowed with a mysterious, lime-green light, and when it was removed, the mystery was solved--each table was lit from underneath. It wasn't a hip young place, despite the cutting-edge reputation of nueva cocina, and I felt out of place in my sundress and espradrilles. Everyone else seemed to be hosting American business partners. I eavesdropped on the American catty-corner from me and felt sorry for the waiter, as the American clearly just wanted an Omaha steak.But then the food started to come, and it stopped feeling quite so removed from the Mexico I knew. The busboy grinned at us, conspiring with us in staging photos of the food, and the margaritas started to relax me. Rimmed in pink sugar with a carnation just sitting on top, they were presented with thought but with more happy festivity than the cool modern design of New York.Similarly, our cebiche came in a bright red pail with a jaunty chile stuck in it, perfectly crispy and non-greasy potato chips, and a little anthill of red salt. Tender, delicious, slightly picante. Our other appetizer would have tasted just like high-end broccoli-cheese casserole, but for the mind-altering salsa de chile pasilla. They were little buttery turnovers made of huauzontle, a long stalky green vegetable with broccoli-like florets. It made Erin nostalgic for the food of her Midwestern youth. It made me realize how much chile pasilla could improve broccoli-cheese casserole.And we ate too much of the bread basket, but how could we resist trying each of the six different rolls? One was filled with mole negro, another the softest, most comforting white bread with pink sugar on top, another spicy, another cheesy. The entrees were, surprisingly, the most impressive, though sadly we were too full to give them due respect. We had a filet of huachinango or red snapper in the spicy Veracruz-style, with peppers, onions, and slivered almonds. Perfectly cooked, every grain of rice in place in its pyramid.But the best was the \"pollito en leche\" rubbed and served in an achiote sauce. It was a small little bird, probably squab, that may have been marinated in milk, giving it an almost creamy tenderness. Achiote paste, according to Rick Bayless, is \"spicy-complex without chile,\" and \"not spicy-hot,\" being made only of achiote seeds, allspice, black pepper, oregano, cider vinegar, garlic and salt. I can't compare it to anything, because it was unlike anything I'd had before. It was a crime that we could eat so little.The tortillas, though, almost outshone the entrees. They came multi-colored and multi-flavored, with the perfect balance between toothsome chewiness and toasty crust. The tortilla basket included the only flour tortilla I have ever truly loved.Erin was leaning against dessert, but I persisted. The special was a mousse of cajeta, the goat's milk dulce de leche, and the waiter assured us it was \"pequeno.\" Ha! It came in a freakin' glass mug nestled in a spray-painted gold cornhusk. I loved how over the top the plating was, and even more how light and fluffy, and yet rich the mousse tasted.It really was too much. And then, good God, we had our petit-fours plate. By then, I was drunk on both the food and the tequila. I think I just mindlessly popped whatever they were, corn cookies and tamarind jellies, in my mouth. We took some gleeful photos with the busboy, who forced the very correct waiter to join in, and then we rode away into the night, feeling like beached whales that had somehow gotten into a taxi in Mexico City.

Sometimes, it feels like there's nothing left to discover in New York. I know it's not true, but given the number of people who care and the number of people nosing around, the odds are nothing really wonderful can stay a secret for very long. So it was a quiet relief to spend my last day in Mexico City just wandering around, relying on some tips, but mainly just eating what I found. Despite or perhaps because of memories of \"Introduction to Art History\" with Vincent Scully, I'd decided I didn't need to go with Erin to Teotihuacan to see the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Erin had the camera, but even that was a relief, too, just to eat. I decided to go back to Coyoacan, the artsy neighborhood and former home of Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Leon Trotsky, and Octavio Paz (the photos are from our trip there 3 days earlier). Acting on a chowhound tip, I started at the Pasteleria Esperanza right outside the General Anaya metro stop, planning to walk and eat my way west to the Miguel de Aquevedo stop on the other side of Coyoacan.I ate a sugary dona, or donut, that wasn't as light as I'd hoped, but it kind of grew on me. It was a Monday morning, around 9:30, but nothing was open and the streets were quiet with people walking their dogs. Coyoacan is what makes Mexico City seem so much like LA to me--a city that is completely oblivious to pedestrian needs (I almost had a car run over my toes at a busy intersection with no pedestrian traffic lights) but with quiet, well-off neighborhoods filled with sidewalk cafes and pink and orange bougainvillea flowing over the walls.I found a branch of the popular coffee shop, Cafe El Jarocho, and sat on a bench with my café de olla reading Carlos Fuentes's \"The Death of Artemio Cruz\" while watching people drive up, just like in LA, for their morning coffee. Coffee isn't a religion in Mexico, certainly not in Oaxaca, but El Jarocho has good, cheap, strong espressos and cappuchinos.I wandered on to Plaza Hidalgo with its adjoining smaller plaza and the fountain I love so much, two dogs playing in a spray of water. I saw a man and his grandson buying roast chickens on the northwest corner of the plaza, at a big grocery store called \"America,\" from a nice young man with a goatee. The sign in the window advertised empanadas de atun, empanadas de bacalao. I don't know why, but whenever I see the word \"bacalao\" for salt cod, I have to eat it. This empanada turned out to be a flaky turnover filled with salt cod and onions. Yum.Then I wended my way back to the Mercado to eat cebiche de jaipa or crab at El Jardin del Pulpo, \"The Garden of the Octopus,\" in a sundae glass with saltines and fresh wedges of lime. Nothing particularly memorable to report, but I love that name, the Garden of the Octopus.I had eaten so much, it was clearly time to walk some more. I took the subway back to the center of town to the Mercado Artesanias and bought more souvenirs that I'll struggle to carry home. As I walked back to our hotel near the Zocalo, through the part of town dedicated to selling bathroom fixtures, I saw a little plaza with some crowded food stalls. All weekend, I'd been seeing street food that I hadn't seen in Oaxaca, antojitos typical of Verucruz or Michoacan or the Yucatan. I walked back and forth dragging my tin mirrors behind me, and finally decided to eat a huarache, because the man already standing there looked so happy with his. Besides, they were advertised as \"Rico Rico Rico Rico.\" I have to take precise note of where it was, on Ayuntamiento near the corner of Aranda, a block from the major street of Lopez, next to the bank on the south side of the street, because the huarache was so good! I'd had huaraches before in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and knew them as long, flat tortilla-like things with taco-like fillings, but this oblong huarache was different, crispier, chewier, with a texture of masa ground more coarsely. The huarache got good and toasty because the cook repeatedly brushed both sides with oil. I ordered one with bisteck, a thin slice of beef he cooked separately on the grill, then added to the huarache already bubbling with red salsa. Topped with crumbled queso fresco, it was heaven. My fingertips burned as I tried to eat the unwieldy thing without getting it all over my face, but it was worth it.And we still had dinner ahead of us at Aguila y Sol.

My religion is mole negro, and Soledad is my guru

I've been telling everyone that if you want to be Zen, there's no need to go to an ashram in India, you can just come to Mexico. You can't plan anything, but everything works out in the end. And to make the metaphor complete, I have found my guru.Even though I told everyone before I left that I was going to Oaxaca to learn to make mole negro, I didn't really believe I would. I knew that it was an intensive, all-day process, and it seemed like the kind of thing you could only really learn in a Oaxacan home, from a Oaxacan grandmother. How was I, an American tourist who speaks broken Spanish, going to find that woman? It was too much like something Paula Wolfert would do for me to imagine that I could do the same.But Mexico continues to surprise me at every turn, not only in what is possible, but also what is possible in me. I met Senora Soledad Ramirez Martinez easily enough, at the cooking class at ICO, and immediately fell in love with her. But with my pessimism, I didn't even plot to learn with her. I just innocently asked in class, as the workshop drew to a close, \"Where could I learn to make mole negro?\", and the answer came so readily, \"You can come to my home and I'll teach you.\"Sra Soledad is like that in every way. She's no-nonsense, very straightforward, and very firm in her opinions: the best chocolate in Oaxaca (Chocolate Mayordomo), whether the vendors advertising \"metate-ground\" chocolate are lying (they are), whether Mexican families make their own salsa (claro!). Coupled with an incredible generosity of heart, she overwhelms you, and she's not even five feet tall. My paternal grandmother died before I was born, my maternal grandmother when I was 15, but I didn't know how much I was missing a grandmother in my life until I met her.Soledad lives near the archeological site of Monte Alban, in a steep little town with an awe-inspiring view of the city. Her home sits on three terraces, the garage and the rainwater reservoir on the first, the outdoor wood-burning kitchen on the second, and the main living area with its indoor kitchen and patio on the third. She and her husband, Carlos, have four children, and I think two of them live with her, along with their youngest grandchild, five-year-old Carlita.As Soledad spread out the twenty or so ingredients that make up mole negro, Erin and I sipped hot chocolate and gazed in wonder. The key chile, the hard-to-find chilhuatle or chilhuacle with its inflated, smooth look, is expensive, 400 pesos or $40 per kilo. Then there are the mulatos, which are dark, wrinkled and round; the pasillas mexicanas which are dark, wrinkled and long, and the chipotles mecos, which are tan, wrinkled, and somewhat triangular.The sweetness comes very slightly from sugar, and mainly from the plaintain, the raisins, and the tomatoes, as well as the Oaxacan chocolate. A subtle, nutty flavor is added by sesame seeds, pecans, and almonds, as well as the eggy and fragrant pan de yema. As if all these flavors were not enough, mole negro requires just a few cloves and fresh peppercorns, a small stick of Mexican canela or cinnamon, and just a spoonful or two of Mexican oregano and thyme, as well as the tartness of tomatillos and the heady dimension of white onion and garlic. Everything gets mellowed and smoothed by chicken broth--sorry, vegetarians. Her recipe is enough to feed 30, as the laborious process of mole negro is honored by and reserved for fiestas, weddings, and other important occasions. Obviously a blend of Spanish-Moorish ingredients and New World flavors, the word mole, appropriately, comes both from the Nahuatl word \"molli\" for sauce, and the Spanish verb \"mollinar,\" to grind or blend. We began by deseeding and deveining the chiles, and then toasting them on her comal in her outdoor, wood-fired kitchen until they were dark but not burned, and stiff. While they soaked in water, the next very important and very strange step was to burn the reserved chile seeds on the comal until absolutely black. This is the part I can't imagine doing in my Brooklyn kitchen, as I can't roast a chicken without setting off the smoke detector. Hopefully, my neighbors won't report me when I set up an illegal Weber grill on my makeshift deck. The seeds were then rinsed in water. The pecans and sesame seeds were toasted last.In the meantime, the tomatoes and tomatillos were simmering in water on the indoor gas stove for about 20 minutes. We fried the plaintain and the slices of pan de yema, and then the onions, raisins and pecans. We added cinnamon, in a big loose stick, and thyme and oregano. The chicken got simmered separately, creating a light broth for later use. It was time to go to the neighborhood mollino or miller. It was like Mexican Sesame Street--let's go visit Mr. Miller! All four of us walked down the hill, Erin, Soledad, Carlita, and me carrying the big bucket, and watched as the miller washed out the corn he had ground in the morning so he could push our mole through.The hard part was over. All we had to do now was put it in an earthenware cazuela and cook it on a wood fire with a little oil for an hour, stirring constantly. It was amazing to watch it change in color from a chocolate brown to a dark, shiny black. (According to Susana Trilling, if your mole negro isn't quite black, people will talk.) As we stirred and the fire smoked, the rain started to come down, and the steep slope of their street became a brown river. We tasted at 30 minutes, then 50, then 60. We added Mexican chocolate, the key thing being to use chocolate without milk, just a few spoonfuls of sugar, and then the chicken stock. Soledad asked us what we thought, should we add more sugar? And I was amazed to taste a mole so balanced, more sugar would have made it gawdy and cheap. I felt like a witch stirring a magical brew, because it was. I've written mainly about the ingredients and the steps because at this point, I don't know how to express in words what else happened that day. If you could see me, I would wave my hands and clutch my heart as I told you how Soledad and her family welcomed us into their home. We paid 350 pesos each, or about $35 for the all-day class, but there's no price that can match what we found. Carlita, like the confident, well-loved child she is, chattered to us, pretended she was a bull, and served us rice soup in little plastic bowls from her toy kitchen. Carlos, her grandfather, showed us their photo albums with photos of their second wedding when they renewed their vows and their daughter Patty's quinceanera or Sweet 15 party. Soledad told us how her father had found a big heavy slab of stone and carried it home to be her mother's metate. They told us more stories while we ate full-flavored chicken in the best mole negro I've ever had with perfect rice. It's not just that they were hospitable, but that their hospitality was almost without thought, it came so naturally. The heavy rains came early that day, and Carlos wasn't able to find fresh blandas, a type of tortilla, to sop up our sauce, but although Soledad apologized more than once for having only tostadas, there was none of the nervous anxiety that comes with having guests. They made Erin and me feel like family friends, like we had become part of their lives and their memories. We could have sat at their table forever. If you are ever in Oaxaca, or have friends who want to learn to cook in Oaxaca, please contact me, as I have her phone number and she would be happy to teach anyone who is a friend of \"Ae-rin\" or \"Graciela.\" I left Christianity because I hated proselytizing, but with Soledad as my guru, her religion is one I would gladly spread.

Hi Grace,I've just discovered your blog which is so heartwarming and fun to read. I'm currently in Oaxaca for a holiday and am about to start a few days lessons with Susana Trilling. I read your posting about learning to make mole negro with Soledad and was wondering if you could give me her details? I can understand a reasonable amount of Spanish although I can't express myself very well, but I'd still love to have a lesson with her. The language of food tends to be universal!I'd really appreciate any help and information that you could provide.Many thanks and keep writing!Jennifer

Hello grace!I discovered your post what researching how to make mole negro. I am sooooo intrigued.I am planning a big dinner party and want a complex dish for my new posting. But my main concern is that I have never had mole negro. I am doing research. Can you tell me what it tasted like (in comparison to, let's say, mole poblano or any other mole). I would appreciate it!Thanks!

I did it--I cooked pasta in my kitchen in Oaxaca that wasn't terrible. Bacon (that had the consistency of ham), plum tomatoes, mushrooms, and the parmiggiano-reggiano Erin smuggled from San Francisco. I think it was the parmesan that did it. It was my third try. Don't ever try replacing sweet basil with any other kind of basil in an Italian tomato sauce. You'll regret it.

Two weeks ago, when Erin and I were staying in a hotel in Mexico City, I watched vivid footage of buses burning in Oaxaca, as anti-government protests turned dangerous leading up to the planned \"official\" Guelaguetza 2007. I watched a group of five or six policemen pushing a man down to the ground and then begin kicking him, oblivious or careless of the news cameras trained on them. Finally, two policemen in different uniforms came in, grabbed the man, hugging him to their bodies, and hustled him away, possibly to beat him in private.July 23rd marked the first day of Guelaguetza, Oaxaca's indigenous folk dance festival and its biggest tourist attraction. Also called \"Lunes del Cerro,\" translatable as \"Mondays on the Hill,\" the official performance celebrating Oaxaca's distinct regions and cultures takes place annually on two Mondays in July, at the Cerro del Fortin on the western edge of the historic center, with a beautiful view of the city and the valley beyond. Normally, these two Mondays frame a week of fun, as street food proliferates all over town, crafts vendors set up even more stalls throughout the zocalo, and tourists from all over Mexico and the world pour into the city. To gild the lily, the annual mezcal festival is held at the same time. If you threw a stone, you would hit a marimba band or a dance troupe, on stages around the Ex-Convent of Santo Domingo or just in the streets. To me, it feels like there's always a fiesta or saint's day celebration going on in Oaxaca, complete with deafening fireworks, but Guelaguetza just multiples the everyday feel by ten.Last year, when APPO took over the center of the city in protest of the state governor, the official Guelaguetza was cancelled, for the first time in its history. This year, even as the governor spent millions in promoting and marketing \"Guelaguetza 2007,\" Ticketmaster promised a full refund if the shows didn't happen. APPO called for a boycott of the official one, hosted its own on July 16th, and graffiti sprouted around the city, quite well-designed stenciled images with exhortations like, \"The art of the pueblos for the pueblos!\" In the end, all scheduled performances went on, even in the pouring afternoon rain, and at least during \"Lunes del Cerro,\" the protests remained peaceful.There's no question there have been gross human rights abuses here. But I have no expertise with which to analyze the pros and cons of the boycott, the protests, the demands of APPO. (Erin and I bought tickets to the official one before I realized how fraught the mere act of attendance could be and watched for an hour before we got rained out.) Yet I want to report on what I do know, what amazed and moved me at the two smaller, local Guelaguetzas I saw at Reyes Etla and Tocuela. And that I ate a jicama popsicle.Guelaguetza is not just for tourists. More than any other folk dance I've ever seen, it is truly a celebration for the communities here. The town of Reyes Etla was deserted on July 23rd because the entire town had gone up to their cerro to watch the four-hour show. I was possibly the only tourist at the performance in Tocuela, probably the only non-Mexican, and definitely the only Asian person. I felt like I was at a community talent show or a high school concert, with all the personal warmth the audience felt for the performers. I had been invited to see the show at Tocuela on July 30th by Senora Soledad, my cooking teacher, as her son was the director of the show, so I sat in the VIP section right next to the stage with her family. Everyone around me wanted to know who I was and where I was from and how long I was in Oaxaca (and of course, whether I was married), and this really beautiful baby was fascinated by my digital camera. Each dance celebrates a specific region, with the performers wearing gorgeous traditional clothing. There's a specific repertoire that makes up the Guelaguetza, and everyone ends with the \"Danza de la Pluma\" and the pineapple girls, but having seen three Guelaguetzas, I can attest that each director puts his personal touches on each show. Soledad's son clearly loved playing with the bullfight motif, charged with male-female conflict, as his girls charged the boys waving red handkerchiefs so vigorously, the stage became a Laurel-and-Hardy show of boys tumbling and girls chasing.But to truly celebrate the region, the performers will throw samples of the regional specialties to the audience, which might be light little things like straw woven fans and dried gourds for drinking mezcal, or dangerous projectiles like mangos and pineapples. Many of these girls do not throw like girls. I only got hit once, in the face with a tortilla, though I did duck a mango or two. Luckily, the region known for its turkeys merely dances with a turkey, rather than throwing one out to the audience. So at the end of every number, there were arms waving frantically in the air and children running up on stage to wheedle more closely. At Tocuela, the people around me got deeply invested in making sure that I got many \"recuerdos\" or souvenirs, and kept yelling to their daughter/cousin/niece, \"Maria Cruz! Maria Cruz! Over here! Over here!\" I came home with two little clay bottles of mezcal, two mangos, a little basket, two tlayudas, one totopo (crispy tortilla from the Isthmus), one passionfruit, three rolls of pan de yema, a piece of sugarcane, a hollowed stick of wood for drinking mezcal with a cord to wear it around my neck, a weird little bar of fruity, brown sugar dessert, and an inedible dessert that seemed to be made from a wedge of sugar cane soaked in a toxic liqueur.Oaxaca is the most indigenous state in Mexico, with over 30% speaking an indigenous language. People are generally considered indigenous if they speak an indigenous language, like Zapotec or Mixtec, rather than by the color of their skin. Oaxaca is not necessarily representative of Mexico in this regard, but the intense pride I saw in their indigenous heritage at Guelaguetza was overwhelming. I know that indigenous populations are among the poorest in Mexico, and that Guelaguetza may be only a shallow form of recognition, but coming from a country where we don't even pay lip service to our indigenous cultures, I was so moved by the sense of connection to a deep and rich history. I'm a big believer in the importance of national principles and ideals, even if they're only aspirational, because how much worse is it not even to aspire to them?And I finally ate a jicama popsicle! They were selling them at Reyes Etla, big thick slices on a popsicle stick, with so many different containers of colorful powders and spices. I had trouble understanding the vendor, who was very curious where I was from, so I ended up just asking for \"lo mejor,\" and got something that was spicy and tart and sweet, as if it had been dusted in those chili powder and Kool-Aid. I also ate molotes, little fried torpedos of masa filled with potatos and chorizo, at the performance in Tocuela, but I think they made me sick. God probably wanted to strike me down for the arrogant way I've been bragging about how I never get sick from street food. (For an agnostic, I'm kind of obsessed with God, no?) I'll spare you the gory details, but I finally had to open my bottle of Pepto Bismol. It was too bad, as they were so perfectly fried. But for once, the food was not the point. (Special thanks to Erin for the National Geographic-worthy photos from Etla!)

I am not a fan of Mexican bread. It's often too dry or too sweet or not sweet enough. I've had nothing approaching the heft of a hearty, levain-type bread, what MFK Fisher likes to call \"honest bread,\" or the delicate crackle of a perfect croissant, or even the homey, soothing quality of super-soft Korean white bread. Most Mexican breads improve greatly upon being dipped in hot chocolate, which is almost always served with any sweetish bread, or \"pan dulce.\" Still, one can only drink so much hot chocolate, and I miss the excellent toast I normally have for breakfast every morning in NY, along with my favorite butter from Sahadi's. (When I found little diner packets of Lurpak butter, which isn't even my favorite, at El Cafecito in Puerto Escondido, I emptied the entire basket into my purse.) Still, I wanted to see the Pasteleria Ideal in Mexico City. Another old-school place in the Centro Historico, it opened in 1927, but with more gilt-edged elegance than the Churreria \"El Moro.\" You enter into a large room with majestically high ceilings. You could be in a faded ballroom, except there are trays and trays of donuts, muffins, pastries, and rolls lined up in arrays before you. On Sunday morning, there were wheeled racks of breads being rolled around, nearly blocking the grand staircase, but the sign unequivocally declared that the second floor was the exhibition room for cakes.Nearly every cake was at least 3 tiers tall--wedding cakes, baby cakes, First Communion cakes. Shrek was clearly, peculiarly popular, as were other cartoon characters. Nearly every cake also had icicles of hardened frosting dripping from each tier. One cake was almost twice as tall as Erin. Mona and Leslie, who make hand-made cookies and truffles that look like they came from a machine, must be rubbing off on me, because all I could think was how sloppy they looked. Erin took some fantastic pictures and I'm glad I went, but I can't even remember what kind of bread I ate. All the chowhounds who are in awe of Ideal should get on a plane to Korea and go to the basement food wonderland of any upscale department store.But Mexican ice cream, or nieve, that I truly love and respect as something I have never had before and will likely never have outside Mexico. The Roxy Neveria in Condesa is a legend, too, with the look of an American soda shop, with its striped awning and white-lettered list of flavors, except American shops generally don't have the Virgin Mary hanging behind the counter. It was clearly beloved by the Mexican families who double-parked to jump in for a cone or a cup. It was so beloved by me, that after eating my first cone of \"nuez de macadamia,\" I went back and had a second cone of \"rompope.\" The macadamia was wonderful, so nutty and rich but also pure, like fresh milk. The rompope, which I ordered because I didn't know the flavor, a Mexican eggnog spiked with rum, I didn't like as much, but it was surely not regrettable.I hesitated for a bit before my second cone, but I felt it was the only fair way to treat my body, as I had just had a very bland meal at a health food store/restaurant across the corner. It was the kind of health food that used to plague America--so tasteless, even a vigorous shake of the salt on the table couldn't save it. When I ordered my second cone, the boy at the counter urged me to go back to my table and sit down, as he would bring it to me directly. People can be so sweet when they realize how much you love to eat.

El Bajio

***CONTENT
Ferran Adria says El Bajio is the best restaurant of traditional Mexican food in the world. And now, I have a higher opinion of Ferran Adria than I did before.El Bajio is as far from the carrot-foam of El Bulli as I can imagine. It's the kind of food I love most, traditional food prepared with love, care, and great pride. It's the kind of food I seek most when I eat out, because I hope that the more I eat and learn from people who cook in this way, the more I will be able to make and serve this kind of food in my own home.But I came very close to missing it completely. Erin and I were in Xochilmilco far south of the city, and we knew we could only get to El Bajio by taxi. Despite appearances, I'm quite cheap about food, and I doubted that any restaurant would be worth a $20 cab ride. But lucky for me, Erin quietly insisted.Owned by chef Carmen \"Titita\" Ramirez, the restaurant now has three branches, including one in super-posh Polanco, which chowhounds have described as glassy and very-Polanco, at least in decor. But the original, the one we went to in Azcapotzalco, is decorated in warm, rich colors, with high-quality Mexican folk art. The restaurant is acclaimed by such foodie luminaries as Rick Bayless and Diane Kennedy, in addition to Ferran Adria, but it wasn't filled with tourists, just happy Mexican families enjoying a big Sunday meal. The presence of multiple flat-screen TVs didn't even bother me, it seemed somehow appropriate, or perhaps I was just happy I could watch the Argentina-Brazil final of the Copa America while we ate. We ordered a hodge-podge, one platano empanada stuffed with beans; one quesdilla with huitlacoche, that prized corn fungus; a quarter of a kilo of carnitas in the Michoacan style; a clean and simple salad of jicama, nopales, tomatoes, and chayote; and a bowl of mole de Xico which we practically slurped up.A quarter-kilo is a lot of meat--I forgot that one kilo is 2.2 pounds, and not the other way around--but we still ate almost all of it, fat, gristle, and all. It was almost too much to slather the pork with the mole, somewhat richer than Oaxacan mole negro but otherwise equally complex, but it was a meal of happy excess, and the pork was an excellent vehicle. When faced with the prospect of dessert, Erin chose a refreshing nieve sorbet, while I, glutton that I am, chose the requeson with honey. Requeson is a ricotta-like fresh, rich wonder cheese, and when I added it to Erin's nieve order, our waiter Raul definitely wasn't expecting it, and so he gave an almost imperceptible but definite nod of approval and respect. The entire restaurant seemed to be curious and pleased at the amount of food we ate and documented with Erin's digital camera. As we left, Pablo, the manager, came forward with a smile to ask how we had heard about the restaurant. We chatted about how we had read that it was Rick Bayless's favorite Mexican restaurant in the world, and then he gave us laminated brochures for \"recuerdos\" or souvenirs. When I asked if they had the cookbook for sale, Alquimias y Atmosferas del Sabor, he said I could find it at Sanborn's, a Mexican department store, and then proudly showed me the restaurant's own dog-eared copy. (I then spent the next day going to 4 different Sanborns looking for the damn book.)Despite all the fuss I made about the $20 cab ride, I considered going back the next day, while Erin went to Teotihuacan. Who needs ancient Aztec pyramids when you can eat a fabulous Mexican breakfast at El Bajio? In the end, I decided to save my stomach for the dinner Erin and I had planned at Aguila y Sol, but the next time I'm in Mexico City, the first thing I'm going to do is jump in a taxi to El Bajio.

I happened to stumble into this comment by searching for El Bajío on the internet and read it with great pleasure and pride.Being a Mexico City born expatriate, not having lived in my home town and after discovering El Bajío only a few years ago, I will always find the time to make the \"pilgrimage\" to Azcapotzalco to treat myself to the delight of this magnificently genuine eatery.As a matter of fact, I will be flying to México tomorrow morning and am already savouring this impending meal.I admit to never having visited El Bulli (despite having sought reservations for two years), but I have enjoyed marvelous meals around the world and El Bajío is amongst them; both in quality and warmth. It just \"hits the spot\" for me.Being somewhat of a purist, I am likely to give the super-posh Polanco location a miss and head out for the original location, which is just shy of a $20 cab ride from where I will be starting my journey.Fair, excellent and truthful review AppleSister. I thank you for this tidbit in cyberspace.

Our first visit to El Bajío was for lunch, at the original location. We were very happy with our meal. (We also got to meet Carmen Ramírez Degollado, the owner-chef.)The next visit was for breakfast, at the Parque Delta location, and it, too, was excellent. I wasn't terribly endeared with the ultra-moderno design, especially the wide screen t.v's on the walls, but it was easy to ignore their distractions.Next Sunday, we're returning with friends to the Parque Delta locale. We'll see how the comida compares with the original, somewhat out-of-the-way place.

People are so kind. I've met so many warm Mexicans since I got here--Soledad my cooking teacher at ICO, Hector the architect professor at the Museo de Anthropologia who invited me to tour the city with the Pratt professors he was showing around, Eduardo our guide in the mountains of the Sierra Norte in Ixtlan de Juarez--but one of my favorite memories will always involve the waitress at the Churreria \"El Moro\" who wanted to make sure that we knew what kind of hot chocolate we were ordering.\"El Moro\" at Eje Central Lázaro Cardenas 4 in the Centro Historico is open 24 hours, so that you can satisfy your churros and chocolate craving any time of day. Open since 1935, it has a sense of worn, well-loved history, from the faded old-school menus to the stained glass window and old Mexican tiles to the baby-blue diner uniforms the waitresses wear. The menu consists of churros, slim tubes of fried dough dusted in sugar, and hot chocolate or coffee, nothing more, nothing less.Erin and I are never perturbed by not knowing what something is, and we blithely ordered one \"espanol y 4 churros\" and one \"frances y 4 churros.\" Five minutes later, the waitress came back, anxious. \"Do you know the espanol is very sweet?\" \"Uh, no. How sweet are the others?\" \"Especial is a little bitter, espanol is very sweet, frances is sweeter and mexicano is normal sweet.\"\"Especial is a little bitter?\"\"Yes.\"\"I'll have the 'especial,' please.\"She smiled, glad that we understood.Later, we realized \"espanol\" must be the Spanish style of very thick, almost sludgy hot chocolate, which can be very good, but I was happy with my \"especial\" which was made of strong, delicious bittersweet chocolate, especially since I've been craving dark chocolate since I got here. Bracing and fortifying, it almost made me forget that I hadn't had my morning coffee yet.The churros, sadly, weren't on par with the hot chocolate, since they were too greasy. But I did love seeing them piled up in giant coils in the window, next to an equally giant pan of sugar. And at least we had been guided towards impressive chocolate!

The riches of the Yucatan at Coox Hanal in Mexico City

Oaxaca is a culinary wonderland, but other than an Italian place or two, it has too much hometown pride to move beyond Oaxacan specialities and favorites. So Mexico City was my chance to eat food from Veracruz or the Yucatan or Puebla. And Erin being a big Yucatecan food fan, off we marched to find Coox Hanal, at Isabel la Catolica 83, in Centro Historico. We walked by it almost twice, since it's on the 3rd floor, above a billiards hall. But once you're at the door, you know you're there because Coox and Hanal are there to greet you.All the words on the menu were so foreign to me! Sablutes, sopa de lima? My heart beat with anticipation. We ordered 3 plates of antojitos and sopa de lima, despite our chicken soup breakfast, and I had a Montejo, a light Yucatecan lager, nothing more or less than a middle-of-the-road lager.But I was happy to have my beer, as the food turned out to be greasy bar food, and I mean that as a compliment. The panchutos, tortillas stuffed with beans and then fried and topped with pork and cabbage, were better at Seasons of My Heart, but I still ate more than my fair share. The sablutes turned out to be fried tortillas, a little thicker than usual, with pavo or turkey, and they cut their grease with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and avocado. I thought the tacos of cochinita pibil were smooth with fat, though Erin with her experience of cooking cochinita pibil herself thought they were a tad too dry. (Erin, care to comment on what goes into pibil?) All of it was accompanied tartly and brilliantly by the pickled red onions that seem to be to the Yucatan as kimchi is to Korea.But the most impresionate, para mi, was the sopa de lima. I wish I had the kind of sensitive palate to sniff the soup and say in a tone of authority and only polite doubt, \"Ah! Is it cardamom?\", but I don't. The recipes I've found online vary greatly, some requiring just a bit of dried oregano to add some mystery--which I find hard to believe would recreate what I had, despite the particular strengths of Mexican oregano--while others call for a battery of spices. Clearly, something unusual is going on with the \"limas agrias\" or bitter limes. The soup also had the look of coconut milk, if not the taste, and with its complex tartness, it reminded me of the careful balance of great Thai soups. You could also find shredded chicken and some dark green bits that were bitter when I bit down. Could they have been bits of lime rind? Like a fine wine, the flavors kept shifting in my mouth, from smooth to tart, bitter to warm.It's good for me, with my lack of religion, to have some sense of mystery in my life.

Re: the pibil, I thought the flavor at Coox Hanal was much better than the version I'd tried at home, but the meat was definitely more dry. When I made cochinita pibil, I followed a recipe in All About Braising which calls for packaged red achiote paste, toasted and ground cumin seeds, raw garlic, and salt to be pounded into a paste. You smear the paste on an enormous pork roast (boston butt is probably the best cut to use), wrap the whole thing in banana leaves, let it marinate in the fridge for 24 hours, then slow cook it in the oven for 6 to 8 hours. It was damn good, but after reading your Rick Bayless cookbook I realized that it would be fairly easy to make my own achiote paste, as long as I can find somewhat fresh annatto seeds. I will definitely try that next time, because I think that's why the flavors at Coox Hanal had way more depth.

Mexico City at night, like so many colonial Latin American cities, is particularly beautiful at night. The grey stone of the buildings and monuments gleams golden around you, and when mariachi bands in tight spangled uniforms walk around asking if you want a serenade, it actually feels like magic. It's not a quiet, romantic magic at the Plaza Garibaldi, where every taxi seems to be unloading yet another mariachi band with even more elaborate costumes. It's the kind of magic that's buoyed by the loud cantinas around the plaza, the men hawking stacks of sombreros twice as tall as themselves, the laughing Mexican and non-Mexican tourists carrying Giant Gulp cups of booze. I saw a teenage girl being bullied by her mother and aunt into standing in the middle of a serenading band, with a sombrero plunked on her head; I saw a woman holding a bouquet of roses and a mylar balloon with tears in her eyes as her personal mariachi band sang to her under her husband's instructions. We found the same kind of magical, uncomplicated happiness at Xochimilco two days later, as we floated down the river in a painted barge. Mexico City used to be next to these enormous lakes, now drained. Because there wasn't enough land to grow food, the Xochimilca people planted arificial islands rooted by trees in the lakes, creating a system of canals. Xochimilco means \"garden of flowers\" in the Aztec language, and is the only part of the city that remains to remind us of the canals that existed before the Spanish came. It was a sunny day as bright as our boat. Erin and I ended up rolling around in our enormous boat alone, except for 60-year-old Miguel \"de los manos,\" our punter who suggested that we take photos with him so that he could strenuously pinch us. But nearly every other boat we saw was filled with Mexican families celebrating, dancing or feasting or chasing each other around. We said hello to everyone, everyone said hello to us. Smaller boats drifted by offering cold beers, grilled corn, whole meals with rice and beans, plastic toys, and of course, mariachi and marimba music. For 70 pesos, a boat full of mariachi musicians pulled up to our boat, attached theirs to ours somehow, and then launched into full song. They barely knew the words or tune to \"Como fue,\" but it was one of those days where nothing could go wrong.How happy I was, to be drinking beer on a barge in Xochimilco. How lucky I was, to eat posole and spicy, warm birria, or goat stew, next to the Plaza Garibaldi.

It's our last day in Puerto Escondido. Erin has already left for the airport, and Elena and I are spending the 5 hours before our bus in the most profitable way--doing nothing on the rooftop terrace of our hotel. Elena is in a hammock reading, or maybe even napping, and I'm sitting with my laptop facing the bluest ocean imaginable. It's almost too mean to say out loud to my friends, who are going back to lawyer jobs in San Francisco, but I've been on a vacation from my vacation.In this blissed-out town, I haven't been doing my usual nosing around for superb food, and perhaps for my Zen acceptance of life, I've been rewarded with some of the most memorable food adventures I've had so far.Playa Carrizalillo is the best kind of surprise. It's a bit further west than Playa Zicatela, with its wide expanse of glassy waves that look like the purest and cleanest of blue-green Japanese ceramics as they break. Carrizalillo is not as obvious, if only because you have to descend a long flight of stairs to get there. The steps are solidly constructed and pretty, with flowers and suitably tropical plants at every angled turn, but the best part is only a few turns from the top, when you immediately see before you the perfect, deep blue, baby bay. Little thatched palapas and restaurants line the beach, selling beer and shrimp cocktails. The restaurants aren't particularly noteworthy, though I'm impressed they don't mark up the beer more, and there are fewer vendors who come by, probably because of the steep steps. There is, however, a leathery, old man selling mystery mollusks that were tender, almost buttery, and salty from the bucket he just caught them in. He called the bivalves \"callos de margarita,\" which after some Google research, Erin and I have decided they are some type of scallop. The conches he called \"caracoles,\" which I thought meant \"snails\" in Spanish. The callos had a pebbly, almost spiny outer surface, and a deep purple ring around the pearly interior. He husked them right on the rocks, rinsed them in the murky seawater in his bucket, sliced them thinly and expertly, and served them back in their shells, with a fresh squeeze of lime and some hot sauce available, though it turned out for us to be superfluous. It was better to eat add just a bit of lime and taste the sweetness of the meat.In classic Mexican fashion, he didn't assume that Erin and I, who were standing over him almost panting with eagerness, wanted to buy a mollusk or two. We were finally moved to explicit action when another woman started negotiating a price for all the mollusks he had left. The fact that I might never taste a \"callo de margarita\" again is okay. It seems so fortuitous, so blessed, that we got to taste them at all.We even had more nieve de coco, this one purer and cleaner, the more innocent version compared to the more sophisticated salty-sweet coconut ice cream we'd had on Playa Marinero. I am glad I don't have to judge which was better.We had thought nothing could top Playa Carrizalillo, but two days later, we went to Mazunte. About an hour east of Puerto Escondido, Mazunte is a small town that seems to take the overflow from the hippies and nudists in Zipolite. The whole town consists of four or five streets in a loose grid, only two or three of them paved. It's not much of a surfer town, and it feels even more laid-back than Puerto Escondido, which I hadn't known was possible.We stayed all day on a little semicircle of a beach that had no umbrellas, no lounge chairs, only a lovingly ramshackle beach hut selling sandwiches, juices and tropical cocktails. We had brought a light picnic lunch with us, based on the tostadas de corozo I had gotten obsessed with after our lagoon guide, Lalo, told us about them. They were flatter and darker, a little thicker, and not ripply like your usual tostada of corn. When I tasted them, I knew immediately they were worth the long, hot walk to the market in town and dealing with the surly woman who sold them to me. They were just sweet enough, rich with the milk of coconuts, but completely dry and non-greasy. Topped with ripe avocados, fresh lime juice, and criollo tomatoes, crinkly like heirlooms, they whet our appetites for more.It was so easy to walk just a few feet backwards to Babel, the little drink hut, run by a group of young, attractive South Americans, who were so at ease with their good fortune. The entire area was little more than 15 by 15 feet, with a few chairs, two hammocks, and an astonishing view of the ocean. Their mix tape was clearly a beloved one, as we heard the same Bob Marley song twice. We put our feet up and drank big, soda fountain glasses of \"cucu melon,\" 1 for 35 pesos, 2 for 50, which were made of freshly squeezed honeydew, a bit of mezcal, crema de coco, sugar, and crushed ice. So simple and so good. I kept thinking about it for the rest of the day, absentmindedly murmuring, \"Wouldn't that be a good drink for a summer dinner party?\" I know it would console me back in Brooklyn, when I finally have to go back home.

Mexico City, in some ways, reminds me of other big cities I know, New York, Seoul, Los Angeles, and yet is unlike them in so many other ways. At 20 million people, it makes New York feel airy. Walking through the Centro Historico was like Times Square times 10, except with graceful old buildings, relatively few tourists, and no flashing lights. You could, however, still buy pornographic DVDs right on the street, next to hair barrettes and tracksuits. And it has the energy of New York, the feeling that anything could happen, and people outside Mexico City talk about \"D.F.\" or the \"Distrito Federal\" the way people outside New York talk about NY: \"It's another world.\" The inhabitants of Mexico City can't imagine living anywhere else, while Mexicans elsewhere can't understand how anyone can live there.But the biggest difference between Mexico City and New York City, at least to this tourist who was in Mexico City for 4 days, is that New York is a city of people ignoring each other, while everyone in Mexico City is trying to get your attention. People are constantly trying to sell you something, with more vigor than your most vigorous Senegalese seller of fake Rolexes in Chinatown. After living in relative obscurity for a month and a half in Oaxaca City, I was shocked to find how Erin and I were subjected to constant catcalls and whistles, including one man, who said in English with much careful deliberation, and in an accent eerily remniscent of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \"Wow-oo, you are so bee-you-ti-fool!\" I have to admit, I was proud of myself the next day for understanding the declaration shouted at me in Spanish from a man who had been driving his van at our walking pace in Condesa: \"I was just looking at your beautiful legs!\" He had such a genial smile, I shouted back, \"iGracias!\" Sadly, the only men who ever compliment me are men in the street and tollbooth operators, but I'll take my compliments where I can get them. I am also now aware exactly how short my red dress is.Our first morning in Mexico City was also otherwise overwhelming. I had arrived at 7 am on Friday morning, after an overnight bus ride from Oaxaca, and found Erin almost bouncing off the hotel bed in her excitement to try some of the restaurants she had highlighted on her map. An hour later, we were wandering around La Merced, one of the largest markets in Mexico and possibly the world. And the Cathedral in the Zocalo is the largest cathedral in the world, right next to Templo Mayor, an archeological site some electricians found right smack in the middle of the city. And of course, there are Diego Rivera murals all over the city, all bigger than life, and most spectacularly in the Palacio Nacional.You can't throw a stone without hitting something with Frida Kahlo or Diego Rivera on it in Mexico City. Either they are truly are as emblematic of Mexico as foreigners think they are, or Mexico City has responded to tourist demand with a complete, almost-innocent enthusiasm. I don't find the work of either artist particularly moving, but in Diego Rivera's large murals, the triteness I sometimes see in his work gets absorbed into a larger earnestness that appeals to me and my fatigue with NY-cool. And I did love the kitchen in Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul, with its large, glossy pottery and bright colors inexplicably balancing each other. Her home made Leon Trotsky's poor little fortification, just blocks from hers, feel even more austere and Soviet.Thankfully, for all the marching we did around Mexico City that first day, we had had a substantial breakfast of caldo de gallo, or soup made from rooster stock, near La Merced. Being Korean, I think nothing of eating rice and soup for breakfast, but I was impressed by the way Erin tucked into hers. All Mexican soups are essentially the same: simple, happily dependent on the rawness of the last-minute garnishes, and restorative. Of course, nothing is restorative like caffeine, and I sucked down every drop my first <a href=http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/cafedeolla.htm \">\"café de olla. \"Olla\" means clay pot, and a \"café de olla\" is made and served traditionally in a little clay pot and sweetened with cinnamon and piloncillo, a Mexican unrefined brown sugar. Strong and sweet, it gave me the strength to enjoy everything Mexico City could throw at me.

I believe God or the fates have impressed upon me the great responsibility of declaring and describing with exactitude how riquíssima are the empanadas and tacos in one corner of Oaxaca City.Lina had told me about this little stand of empanadas and tacos near the church on Garcia Vigil. \"You'll know it because of all the cars double-parked around it every morning.\" But it took me over a month to finally get there. The fateful day was Thursday, July 12th, the day after my cooking class at Seasons of My Heart. After my enormous day of eating, I had gone to my Spanish teacher's apartment to watch the Mexico-Argentina Copa America game with her. I was already so full, but Lety had prepared all this food, and when I woke up the next day, I felt the food equivalent to a hangover. I didn't even want to get out of bed, but I realized I had to call my mother before I got on the bus to Mexico City that night, and I dragged myself out with the intention of going to an Internet place with Skype and having a light breakfast of fruit at a wireless café. But my usual Skype place was closed, and I had to trudge my way to the other one on Garcia Vigil. As expected, the connection was painfully slow, and I barely managed to communicate to my mother that I was alive and well. I left frustrated and tired, but then, there it was, the famous food stand outside of Iglesia Carmen de Arriba. I wasn't expecting much. I knew the empanadas de amarillo were famous here, but I had tried mole amarillo at Patty's and not liked it much. But when I took a bite into this empanada, what we would probably call a quesadilla, I swear the heavens opened and angels sang. It was so toasty, just off the comal, and hot enough to satisfy the most scaredy-cat street food eater, but so good I had to ignore the burning of my tongue. The amarillo sauce was enlightening, the perfect example of the maxim my friend Mimi and I firmly believe, \"If you don't like a food, you just haven't tried a good version.\" Spicy, saucy, assertive, thinner than the sauce Patty had made, and a perfect complement to the shredded chicken. Mexicans know how to cook chicken breast. Every once in awhile, I'd find a bite of bright cilantro. Oh God, it was so good.I took a bunch of pictures of the church around it, so that any of you, should you find yourself in Oaxaca, will be able to find it. I particularly love this picture of their grill, with the fat sausages roasting underneath the comal.Like every other empanada and taco stand I've seen, they make their tortilla base right there. There's a big mass of masa, with a giant press for making the giant tortillas. The tortillas, either for empanadas or tacos, are first cooked separately on the grill. When they have the telltale dark spots showing that they are crispy and ready, they're filled with amarillo and chicken, or squash blossoms and string cheese and folded over to become empanadas, or they're rolled up with various meaty fillings and salsa.I hadn't even been hungry, but the empanada just whet my appetite for more. I considered my options and finally chose a taco wrapped around a chile relleno and had my second revelation. And to think I didn't like chiles rellenos! The chile relleno was small and skinny and packed with ground meat, and so juicy and flavorful I was sad when there was no taco left, but there was no one to blame but myself. So once again, the stand is tucked next to the gates of Iglesia de Carmen Arriba that are facing the street of Garcia Vigil, near the corner of Carranza, south of Quetzalcoatl. There are other street vendors nearby, selling fruit or some such, but only one stand selling empanadas and tacos, unless of course, it's Lunes del Cerro, but that's another blog post.

I have almost a month's worth of posts to catch up on, including all the food I ate in Mexico City and the mole negro cooking class that literally brought tears to my eyes, but I have to gloat a bit about where I am, here and now.Erin, Elena, and I are in Puerto Escondido. It's a surfer's paradise, which means there are many bare-chested men walking around. Sadly, surfers are not our type, but there are many other natural wonders to observe and enjoy, including, of course, very fresh mariscos or seafood and other culinary delights. And even if the food wasn't that great, even I could be happy just swinging in a hammock on the roof terrace of our hotel\", drinking Dos Equis and reading Rebecca West's amazing \"Black Lamb and Grey Falcon.\" But on this first day of our stay here, the food has been happily surprising.Life here feels even sweeter because we survived a 9-hour overnight bus ride from Oaxaca City to get here. Erin had to knock herself out with sleeping pills, and Elena got some serious cricks in her neck, but as soon as saw the beach, the memory of the bus ride just melted away.While you sit in your lounge chair under a straw palapa, you can get almost anything you want from the peddlers walking up and down the sand. You can buy a blessing or a wish from a giant clay pig (at least, I think that's what he said), you can get your name engraved on a grain of rice (isn't it weird what tourist-things travel all over the world?), and you can eat a delicious ceviche-like shrimp cocktail with a freshly tart, picante flavor, served in plastic dixie cup with fresh wedges of lime.Or you can get nieve de coco, or coconut ice cream, from a sweet man who is so proud of his product that even after we had asked for two cones, he insisted we taste it first. This nieve, with a sorbet-like texture, would not have been out of place at the foodiest of foodie NY restaurants, with its rich, pure, and salty-sweet flavor. I have another great photo of Erin with her ice cream cone, but it's a tad too bodacious for this blog. And at least so far, even your run-of-the-mill, random lunch place knows how to cook a fish with respect. At Vitamina, on the Adoquin, the pedestrian street lined with your usual flip-flops, crafts, and caftans, I had a lovely whole huachinango, or red snapper, that tasted as rich and fatty as bluefish or mackerel. It had been prepared \"al Diablo,\" in a creamy, just slightly spicy sauce. With some hot tortillas and a neverending pitcher of watermelon agua, how could I be anything but muy satisfecha? How could I be anything but satisfecha on a beach in Mexico?

I'm glad we were able to do such extensive documentation of some of these finds, like the nieve de coco, because they were so good I otherwise might start thinking I hallucinated them into existence.

After our market tour, we drove through fields of corn on winding, unpaved roads to end up at Rancho Aurora, immediately visible with its red domed roof on top of a hill. While Susana explained the recipes and their components, we sampled some of the ingredients, like the sea salt from the Tehuantepec that I loved (and I don't buy into all that fancy salt stuff) and the house-made chocolate. Because our group was so big, we divided into groups of 2 or 3 to work on each part of our five-course meal. We started with panuchos, which are a Yucatacan antojito or snack of tortillas stuffed with beans, then fried, then topped with spicy chicken and shredded cabbage. It's quite an operation to prepare all the components, and before tasting it, I had already written it off as something I probably wouldn't bother to make at home. But after one bite, I knew I would have to try even if I burned all ten fingers trying. The panucho was decadent as it sounds, especially with the drizzle of mayonnaise Susana urged on us. (Mexicans love mayonnaise. Japanese love mayonnaise. Isn't it funny the countries mayonnaise has conquered?) It's the kind of thing you can only cook for your best friends, since they have to be willing to eat in rounds as the panuchos come fresh out of the fryer, and you couldn't really prepare anything else at the same time, but who wouldn't want to come to a an all-fried dinner?What really put me over the edge was the salsa de chile verde that was served with them. The recipe calls for 3 chiles bravos, these tiny, very hot little chiles that Susana grows in her garden, which you have to prick with a needle before roasting so they wont' explode. (You can substitute 20 chiles serranos or 4 chiles jalapenos, that's how hot the little suckers are.) My lips were tingling with happiness.But there were four more courses to come. We had a tomato-based tortilla soup, hearty and satisfying. Susana suggested it could be eaten with a poached egg on top for breakfast--I think the words \"poached egg\" are some of the most beautiful in the English language. Each bowl was served with an entire chipotle chile in adobo; I was the only one who ate the chile itself. (I hope I don't sound like I have delusions of grandeur; I just have a stomach that tends to say, \"Yes!\" to everything.)We then had one of those salads that are really just a vehicle for fatty saltiness, inspired by the botanas or bar snacks popular in Oaxaca. On top of a basic salad of greens, tomatoes, radishes, avocados, and green onions were placed crumbled chicharrones (so much better than American pork rinds), the Oaxacan string cheese quesillo, and a really wonderful dressing made of jalapeno jelly, the aforementioned fruit vinegar that sits in a dark closet for months, and Dijon mustard. Our entrée was a Veracruzano-style red snapper wrapped in hoja santa, this fragrant leaf bigger than my hand, that has a fennel-like yet unique flavor, and then wrapped again in banana leaves and baked in the oven, served with a sauce of tomatillos. The banana leaves came straight from Susana's garden, those that hadn't already been shredded by the wind. The fish was plated with the arroz ázafran con piña, a saffron rice cooked with roasted red pepper and coconut milk, then tossed with bits of caramelized pineapple and served with fried platanos, which my group had been in charge of. I kept invoking Julia Child and her advice never to denigrate your own food, as I bit my lip to avoid saying we had undersalted the rice, but luckily for my sanity, the fish group had oversalted their sauce. And at least I could feel secure that the pineapples were really, truly caramelized.By that point, I thought I was going to explode. Perhaps luckily for me, I didn't really like the dessert, a mango charlotte spiked with a crema de mezcal made of maracuya or passion fruit, probably because the people making it had gotten a little punchy with the booze. El Rey Zapoteco makes organic mezcal that Susana promotes in her store, and for good reason. Mezcal is the tequila of Oaxaca. Like tequila, it's made from the maguey plant, which is a big desert plant with spikes radiating out, and again like tequila, there is a huge range of quality and ability to burn in your chest. Your average, run-of-the-mill blanco or young mezcal either makes you gasp in horror or pound your chest and shout, \"Yeah, that puts hair on your chest!\", depending on your taste in alcohol. Then there are the aged ones that are more palatable to me, and the cremas, which normally just mask the taste with a sweet, fruity flavor--the girly mezcales. The El Rey Zapoteco passionfruit mezcal that we tasted in class, however, managed to be sweet and still have that kick that declared itself proudly to be mezcal. I bought a small bottle of the maracuya crema de mezcal to take home, and oh shame, I bought a molcajete with a pig face too! It has beady red eyes and a red smile on a black snout, and I couldn't resist for 150 pesos. I'm going to have to buy another bottle of mezcal to bribe the Continental Airlines ticket agent when my bags come in seriously overweight. Such a fitting, greedy end to a day overflowing with food and pleasure.

{So much to catch up on! I was in Mexico City and then hiking in the Sierra Norte with my friend Erin for a week, and i've gotten behind.]\"The vanilla extract we use is made in Veracruz, from a flower that blooms every four years for only two hours. Because there usually aren't enough bees, it needs to be pollinated by hand. It takes 9 months to grow the vanilla beans, then 5 months to cure them in the sun. They can tell whether the beans are ready or not by the heat of the beans, when they hold them in their hands.\"\"This is the only salt we use here, hand-harvested from the sea by women in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec.\"\"You can make fruit vinegar by putting rinds of fresh pineapple on a plate outside to catch the first morning dew, but before the sun's rays hit them. Then you add piloncillo, unrefined sugar, in a clay pot, stick it in a closet, and let it ferment. It'll become tepate, or pineapple beer, first, but if you let it keep fermenting, it'll become vinegar. You'll see a thick sludge on top, which they call \"madre,\" and you can cut it up to start the fermenting process all over again.\"\"If you don't eat pork, try grasshoppers.\"Susana Trilling is serious about food. I tend to be skeptical of cooking schools for amateurs--I never feel like I learn any real skills, and they feel suspiciously like corporate team-building exercises. But as I sat in the big, bright Mexican-tiled kitchen, festooned with the Mexican paper cut-outs I love so much, and graced with enormous and obviously well-loved Le Creuset pots in a riot of colors, I scribbled so fast and yet could barely keep up with the wealth of information falling from Susana's lips. I felt so lucky to be there, and especially to have friends like Angela and Lina, who gifted me with the class at Seasons of My Heart as my 30th birthday gift.Susana also had that hard-ass voice of authority I respect, like when she emphasized the great importance of adding enough salt to the arroz azafran con pina, or saffron rice with caramelized pineapple. I could tell, that like most chefs, she was a serious control-freak, and yet she managed to run her school and teach novices with grace and patience. Given that I won't let certain friends chop vegetables for me, I felt I could learn a lot from her.We had started the day at the Wednesday market in Etla, tasting and smelling everywhere we went. The tour was designed for people new to Oaxaca, but even though I had already been poking around markets for a month, it was a relief to have a guide who patiently answered my questions in English. One thing I've noticed about Mexico is that people here are generally so nice, but they can't conceive of what outsiders don't know. When I ask for directions, they often just say, \"Oh, it's over there!\" And I'm left to say, \"To the left? To the right?\" So when I ask in a market, \"What is this?\", I usually get an answer like, \"equilemefo-mush-mush.\"Our guide pointed out herbs for eating like chepil, hierba de conejo; herbs for cleansing like rosemary, which isn't really used in cooking in Oaxaca; and different kinds of cheese including requeson, a soft and rich cheese remniscent of the best ricotta.She also explained, to my great enlightenment, that that cheesy looking white stuff was actually a sweet dessert made of corn and milk called nicuatole. It really tasted like a sweet cheese, which I liked but probably wouldn't eat in great quantities.I saw jicama popsicles, ready to be dipped in the flavors of your choice! We ate so much. We tried different flavors of nieve, every type of tamal the woman had, and something that looked like spinach when it's cooked. I bought some spicy pickled vegetables to assuage my kimchi cravings.Most interesting to me, we had chocolate atole. There was a mini-debate on Chowhound recently about whether chocolate atole is the same thing is champurrado. I can now add my two cents and say definitively that they are not the same. Champurrado is atole of corn mixed with hot chocolate, for a thick, nutty, almost sludgy (though I don't meant that pejoratively) flavor. Chocolate atole involves an atole that's made of rice and white chocolate, which isn't our non-cacao bean white chocolate, but something that's made by fermenting chocolate underground. It's then poured into a bowl with chocolate spuma that's made by whipping hot chocolate into a frothy frenzy.We were then supposed to eat enfrijoladas or entomatadas at one of the fondas, since we wouldn't be eating our comida until much later, but we had already eaten so much, I was the only person to eat a full plate of food. If I believed in God, I would thank Him for the metabolism that keeps me from blowing up like a balloon.

I would be having an unholy conniption, but I feel weirdly blessed. It had gone blank once in Oaxaca, in the middle of my lunch of chichilo, one more mole on my list, but it had miraculously come back from the dead and I had hoped, in the way people who know nothing about technology hope, that my camera had somehow fixed itself. So when it went blank at the Museo de Anthropología in Mexico City, I wasn't surprised. More importantly, I wasn't devastated because I was there with my friend and old roommate Erin, who had flown in from San Francisco to spend two weeks with me in Mexico. Erin is the kind of woman, who in the first hours of catching up, informed me that she had recently made the conchinita pibil, a giant piece of pork slow-cooked in banana leaves in the Yucatecan style, and that it was the most delicious thing she had ever made. This news item ranked right up there with news about her work life and her love life. In addition to having a generous, pork-loving heart, Erin has a digital camera with an enormous memory chip, and she happily agreed to contribute to the photographic record of our meals in Distrito Federal. After all, she had shown up in Mexico City with a map on which she had marked in pink highlighter where to find the best ice cream, churros (Mexican fritters), and other culinary gems.And as if my luck could not get better, I managed to email my friend Elena, who is also flying in from San Francisco in a week, get her work address, order a new camera on Amazon, and have it shipped to her by overnight mail so that she can bring it with her to Oaxaca, all within an hour at an internet cafe on Saturday afternoon.So Dear Readers, all ten of you, do not fear! Even better photos will soon appear on this blog. (And I'll be posting soon about the amazing panuchos I ate and more at my cooking lesson at Seasons of My Heart.)

I have a new cookbook! Before I left, I checked this book out of the <a href=\"\"http://www.brooklynpubliclibrary.org\"\">Brooklyn Public Library as part of pre-trip research. I also had \"My Mexico\" by Diane Kennedy, the doyenne of Mexican cookbooks, and \"Seasons of My Heart\" by Susana Trilling on my nightstand, but Rick Bayless was the only one who described the different kinds of chiles in such evocative detail and with such clarity that I actually felt confident I could go out and find the right chiles for the right recipes. I'm too cynical to expect my heroes to ever truly be as they appear, but when I read his books, I feel all mushy and sure that he is a good and wonderful person. It helps that I share his philosophy on food, its blessings, and the value of authenticity as a principle that values traditions but recognizes food as dynamic rather than something to be preserved as artifact. (This is the book's dedication to his daughter: \"With loving hope that the world you grow up into is blessed with generous gardens, comfortable kitchens and welcoming tables.\") And his missionary zeal in promoting lard! So when I saw \"Mexican Kitchen\" on sale just days before moving to my new apartment at Amate Books, the beautiful and carefully edited English-language bookstore here in Oaxaca, I couldn't resist.Sadly, I haven't cooked as much as I'd hoped, at least not yet. The amount of kitchen equipment that came with my apartment is shockingly limited--I'm lucky to have a can opener. And the same challenges I've always had living and cooking alone are even more present here. Produce and other basics, like tortillas, go bad very quickly. My homestay family buys 30 fresh tortillas every day; I know how alien I look buying five. The smallest amount of sugar I was able to find was a 1 kg plastic sack at a dry-goods stall, and until I found a woman selling eggs individually at the organic market, I despaired of buying fewer than two dozen at a time. I did buy some soy sauce and sesame seed oil in a moment of intense longing for Korean food, thinking I would make that most basic of Korean foods, bulgogi, with the thin cut of beef they have here called \"tasajo,\" but I haven't gotten around to it yet. I had thought that cooking at home would be a good way to eat the foods I miss, but I've become a spoiled brat about ingredients, and even my tried-and-true, cook-anywhere recipe for pasta with tuna, garlic, tomatoes, and olive oil just tastes bad since my taste buds got accustomed to high-quality Italian or Spanish tuna. The one stick of butter I bought was so depressing, I haven't touched it since. But the more I read Bayless, I'm inspired to take advantage of the ingredients I do have access to. Every time he laments the inavailability of Oaxacan queso fresco in the U.S., or says something like, \"In Oaxaca, I do..., but in the U.S., I substitute...\", I feel like shouting, \"Rick, I'm in your spiritual home!\" How I can waste this opportunity, when Oaxacan cheese; piloncillo, the unrefined sugar sold in brown cones; and fresh hierba santa are staring me in the face every time I go the market? Every dollar I save is 0.75 Euros I can spend in Spain in October and November (and goddamnit, the dollar keeps falling in value), but I may just have to suck it up and buy a molcajete and comal. I did make a salsa the other day, a simmered tomato sauce that Bayless says is Yucatecan in style, and even though it took a fair amount of time to parboil the tomatoes, skin them, mash them in my neighbor's molcajete, and then simmer them with white onions and a halved serrano pepper, it had the fresh, delicious flavor of food that is also absurdly simple. Of course, if I buy a molcajete, I know I will want to take it home, and I'll probably end up having to pay overweight baggage charges to Continental Airlines. Sigh. Well, such are my priorities.

As much as I've enjoyed the perfect culinary moments I've already had in Oaxaca, I've also loved those moments that aren't quite perfect. Perhaps I am learning to be zen, but after living in New York, it's a relief to be at a place where not everything needs to be the best of its kind.I read about Casa Elipidia in a little booklet on Oaxaca, self-published by two frequent American visitors. Several blocks south of the zocalo, the restaurant is in the dirtier, hotter part of town. You could walk right by it and miss it, since the only indication the restaurant exists beyond the metal door is a small 8 x 11 sign that says \"Restaurant\" and little more. (I also love that, so antithetical to the NY philosophy of marketing yourself to the hilt.) But once you enter, you find yourself in an oasis, a quiet courtyard overflowing with plants. There's only one menu available, the comida corrida, and I didn't even know what they were serving when I sat down.The owner and cook is a cross-eyed woman with a quiet smile. The food was fine, nothing to write home about, or blog about, except I was touched by the careful way everything was presented. The botana, or snack, of a fried dumpling with quesillo and a slice of squash was perfectly fried, crispy without being greasy. The tender brisket wasn't really to my taste, but it sat in the middle of a plate with spears of green beans and chayote artfully placed around it. The dessert, my favorite part, was a little jellied apricot in sweet syrup, in a glass bowl just big enough to hold it. It was the kind of plating I would do at my best, sincere if not rising to the level of art. (My sister, whenever she looks at my plating, sighs, laughs, and says, \"You and I are so different.\") It was homey. It was good enough.

Everything is spot-on--the dark red and gold walls, the columns encircling the courtyard with the tree in the center, the retractable roof, the lights and candles in their unusual but organic vessels. The waiters look like hot, young intellectuals, especially the bearded one with the inky black hair, and even better, they have genuine smiles. This restaurant could be in New York, except it's so much better than its NY equivalent would ever be, if only because a NY-version would be mobbed with hipsters and you'd have to wait 2 hours for a table.Friday night, I wanted to celebrate, though I wasn't quite sure what. My full day at the market in Ocotlan? How thrilled I am that I'm becoming friends with my very cool Spanish teacher? For whatever reason, I arrived at La Biznaga, which means \"cactus,\" happy at all the world. It didn't matter that my glass of Chilean merlot was a little too brassy. The salsa that came with my \"Tres Mixtecas\" quesadillas was, like my waiter, just beautiful. (Have I mentioned how cute the waiters are?) The prices at La Biznaga are higher than average, except that for less than $4.50, you can get full on an appetizer of three quesadillas, of mushrooms, peppers, and squash blossoms, with a bit of black bean puree garnished with queso fresco. The food is sincerely Oaxacan, but with a light, modern hand. I was so happy to sit there, scribble in my journal, and reread these words from the \"Labyrinth of Solitude\" by Octavio Paz:\"I remember that in Spain during the civil war I had a revelation of 'the other man' and of another kind of solitude: not closed, not mechanical, but open to the transcendent...in those faces--obtuse and obstinate, gross and brutal, like those the great Spanish painters, without the least touch of complacency and with an almost flesh-and-blood realism, have left us--there was something like a desperate hopefulness, something very concrete and at the same time universal. Since then I have never seen the same expression on any face...The Spanish dream was broken and defiled later, not because it was Spanish, but because it was universal, and, at the same time, concrete, an embodied dream with wide, astonished eyes...Anyone who has looked Hope in the face will never forget it. He will search for it everywhere he goes, among all kinds of men. And he will dream of finding it again someday, somewhere, perhaps among those closest to him. In every man there is the possibility of his being--or, to be more exact, of his becoming once again--another man.\"

I thought I was going to Ocotlán to check out their Friday market. I didn't know I was going to find the solace I had been searching for.The market was sprawling, but with arms radiating out rather than the dense block upon block at Mercado Abastos. Each arm was clearly dedicated to specific items--leather belts or fresh produce or random plastic items. My favorite was the turkey gauntlet, where people formed two long lines while holding their very placid turkeys under their arms. It felt almost stately, like a very dignified beauty pageant. I couldn't quite tell who was buying and who was displaying, as everyone just stood there with his or her bird(s). I really wanted to take a picture, but I know most people don't like to have their pictures taken, and I generally don't ask unless I buy something. This was definitely something I could not take home.I was there early enough to see the nieve, or sorbet, sellers making their ice cream. They place one bucket inside another bucket of ice and presumably salt, and they just keep turning the inner bucket to churn it to the right consistency. None of it was ready for me to eat, hence, no picture of this either. But I did feel entitled to take pictures of everything I bought and consumed. I started with a breakfast of enfrijoladas, which are like entomatadas but in bean sauce, rather than tomatoes. It honestly tastes better than you would think. I washed it all down with a nice cup of chocolate con agua, which came with a soft bun with crumbly, sugary top and a hard little pretzel-shaped biscuit. I've realized that nearly all the bread in Oaxaca improves vastly when it's dunked into some hot chocolate. Hot morning drinks, for some reason, always taste better in a bowl than a mug. I think it's the particularly warm feeling you get when your fingers and palms are wrapped around the smooth curves of a bowl.I then found a couple of benches full of families eating something I'd never seen before. The women ladled out bowls of dark red soup in the back, while the senora out front chopped at a soft, quivering mass of steamed meat. Chopped hot peppers, onions, cilantro and salsa were on every table, and every few minutes, a woman would walk by offering \"blandas,\" tortillas that are softer and tastier than their name implies. I wasn't quite sure what to do, but when I sat down and a blanda seller approached me, a young woman at the next table gave a quick, almost imperceptible smile and nod, so I bought two. It was sort of \"build-your-own-picnic,\" as her family had also bought some avocados and other garnishes to add to their meal. The soup turned out to be full of potatoes, carrots, and green beans, as well as several different kinds of unidentifiable organ meat. This thing that looks like a bit of felt is flesh--I know, I ate it.But even I had my limits. I looked at something that looked like liver, but a tiny bite revealed it definitely was not liver. There was something else that had gelatinous folds, a whole system of mountains and valleys in a bit of meat. I decided not to eat that either. According to Lety, my Spanish teacher, I ate menudo. Hooray! I'd always wanted to eat menudo.I bought some albahaca, or basil, since I keep thinking I'm going to make spaghetti with tomato sauce, though it looks and smells distinctly more like Thai basil than sweet basil. I watched several goats go by, bleating wildly. Perhaps they knew something the turkeys didn't.My heart never leaps at the thought of touring a church, but I was actually moved when I stopped at the church that had been restored with the help of Rodolfo Morales, the local boy who became a great artist. My pictures don't capture how fresh and light it looks, or how lovely the ceilings are with their serpentine gilt vines. It was, however, slightly alarming to see mannequins dressed in cheap satin, representing Christ or saints, encased in glass. Catholicism seems sort of blithely unselfconscious about its morbidity.And then I went to the Casa of the artist himself, which is quite a funny little place. It's just off the main square in Ocotlan, and when I walked into the arched entryway, there was a young, bearded, artsy-looking guy just sitting on a bench. The gate was closed, but he assured me it was open, and when I approached the gate, a woman appeared with a young boy. They welcomed me in, the woman telling me I could leave my shopping bag on a bench, and the boy wordlessly leading me up the stairs to the second floor with its exhibition hall. The exhibit showcased the collages Morales had been making near the end of his life, with ribbon, antique images, lace, even faces I recognized as having been cut-out of Benetton ads. The exhibition hall was right next to what used to be his studio, complete with rolls of ribbon.When I wandered back downstairs, I began to realize what a strange house I was in. He only died in 2001, and you could peer into his bedroom, his kitchen, and his dining room, presumably preserved as he'd left it. On a shelf by the staircase, you could see 30 or so empty perfume bottles, just sitting there like the tchotckes of any older person. But it also became clear that his family was still living in the house day to day. A senora, older than the woman who'd let me in, was in the gorgeous kitchen when I came in, and she began showing me around, telling me how this horse sculpture made of wood was very old, or how that baby doll in a glass case was very old. The china cabinet was filled with crystal, but it also held a plastic thermos and one antique cup with Japanese faces that the senora had hoped I could identify. As we were talking, we heard a wail come across the courtyard, rising above the birds in their cages. Suddenly, a girl with long curly hair appeared, carrying a smaller little girl who was crying. She stopped crying when she saw me, but she started again after the older girl took her into their bedroom. When I asked where the bathroom was, the senora thought for a bit, and then kindly let me use the family bathroom. As I left, the senora told me that the lady of the house had gone to the market for bread and sodas, so I was very welcome to come back and have a snack with them.When I left the house, the bearded boy was still there and he asked me what I liked the best. \"Oh, the kitchen!\" I said.But before I went back to Oaxaca, I had to eat one last thing: a molote. I hadn't seen these before, these little torpedo-shaped fried dumplings filled with potato and chorizo. As always, I felt slightly sheepish ordering \"un molote,\" but the lady was so nice. She asked me with the warmest smile, \"Te gusta?\", knowing the answer already. It's in these moments that I'm glad to be a particularly freaky foreigner--an Asian AND a woman traveling alone. The novelty of seeing me eat and enjoy their food seems to make up for the fact that I can only buy 2 blandas or one molote. When I got back to Oaxaca, I found out from Lety that molotes aren't easy to find, as they're usually the kind of food sold in driveways of private houses on Sunday mornings. If only I'd known, I would have bought a bagful.But perhaps as much as my memories of the food I ate and the art I saw, I think I will treasure the brochure I found at the church for \"Neuróticos Anónimos.\" According to the brochure, \"Neurosis\" is \"caused by a person's innate egoism that keeps him from having the ability to love.\" It advises the reader to read and answer the quiz in the calmest possible manner, with the most honesty possible. The questions include, among many, \"Do you believe the whole world is watching you?\" \"Do you lie without necessity?\" \"Do you do things that you consider stupid?\" \"Do you live disgusted with the entire world?\" So in Ocotlán, I ate several things I'd never eaten before, saw an artist's home, and learned that I'm not as neurotic as I think I am.

I ate a hamburger and fries. I couldn't help it, even though Tito's is famous for its tortas.And it's true, Mexican coke is different from American coke. It's made with sugar instead of high-fructose corn syrup, and the sweetness is definitely more genuine.

It's been interesting to see what middle-class Mexicans will tell foreigners about street food here in Oaxaca. First, they start by telling you never, never to eat street food and to only eat raw fruits or vegetables if they have a good, thick removable skin. I'm not quite sure what the danger is, beyond your usual food poisoning. Although guidebooks and locals will tell foreigners that they have to be careful because their sensitive foreign stomachs aren't used to the local bacterial blend, middle-class Oaxaquenos themselves are careful about where they buy food on the street and they also carefully disinfect lettuce and other produce by soaking them in iodine and water before eating raw salads. Every morning, you can hear a guy shouting in the street, \"Agua! Agua!\", as he delivers big plastic canisters of purified water. And no one ever asks how you want your meat cooked--there's only one option when the butchers don't use refrigerators. Can you imagine what the raw food movement would do here?Their exhortations not to eat street food were so strong, I did wonder at first, if there was something that made street food in Oaxaca more dangerous than in Thailand or Haiti or any of the other places I've eaten street food. But when I started to press them, even the American staff at my school backed down and said, \"Well, I eat street food. We just don't want anyone blaming us if they get sick.\" Pretty soon, I started to get tips from my Mexican family, the cooking teacher at ICO, and my private teacher, about the fruit juice seller at Mercado Juarez that uses purified water, or Senora Angelita whose corn, on and off the cob, is \"muy limpia.\" One of the biggest factors in determining the cleanliness of a vendor is how they handle money. Many of the reputedly clean people have a helper who handles all the money, while he or she handles all the food. But if their helper is absent, the favored method seems to be to put on a thin plastic glove before handling the money, and then taking it off to go back to cooking food. I like it. Any serious cook would agree that it's hard to determine when food is done through plastic or rubber, but the NYC Department of Health would have a collective heart attack.So now that my Spanish classes are in the afternoon, I have from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. to do nothing. I spend most of my morning (and admittedly, most of the night before) thinking about where I am going to eat lunch. Wednesday was my appointed day to go eat at the recommended, \"very clean\" torta truck, \"La Hormiga\" in Conzati Park. \"Hormiga\" means ant, and the truck accordingly has a very happy ant smiling at its customers. The truck itself gleams with cleanliness, and it's always crowded, particularly when school lets out.A torta reminds me very much of a Vietnamese banh-mi. If it's ordinary, it's nothing more than a sandwich. (And personally, I am not big into sandwiches.) But if the bread is toasted right and the crust crackles as you bite into it, and the sharply salty filling is balanced, by creamy avocado and cheese in a torta or by tart pickled vegetables in a banh-mi, it can be so much more satisfying than a sandwich deserves to be. Or perhaps it would be fairer to compare a torta with a panini, since both get toasted and pressed on a grill, and the Platonic ideal of both sandwiches recognize that the bread is as important as the filling. I wouldn't say that \"La Hormiga\" is on the level of Saigon Banh Mi at the back of the jewelry store on Mott St. at the corner of Grand, or my favorite little 'Ino in the West Village, but my torta with cecina, a spicy, shredded pork, and quesillo was crackly, salty, and balanced like an Olympic gymnast. iQué sabrosa!

Hi-- stumbled upon your blog after a sentimental search for La Biznaga (driven by a disappointing meal at SF's Mexico DF) & stopped to enjoy your subtle yet robust observations. Wanted to comment that in SF there's a divey (in the best way) spot in the Mission, Yucatasia, that serves up tortas & banh-mi alongside Yucatecan home cooking. Buen provecho!

So San Francisco to be serving banh-mi and tortas in the same place! I used to live in SF, and my old roommate who still lives in the Mission is coming to visit this week. I'll have to ask her about it, as she's obsessed with Yucatecan food. Muchas gracias! Similarly, there's a place in Greenpoint, Brooklyn, an old Polish neighborhood, that makes a banh-mi with kielbasa. This is what I love best about America :)

Filling my belly with la comida corrida at La Olla

I first heard about La Olla from Karen and Steve, the foodie-couple I met in the cooking class at ICO. They were here for two weeks, and they ate the comida corrida, or the lunch prix-fixe meal, at La Olla almost everyday. They raved about the freshness of the ingredients, the variety of flavors, the awe with which they faced every new dish. They even took the cooking class at the related bed-and-breakfast.I celebrated my first Monday out of school and out of my homestay by going to La Olla, determined to try the famed comida corrida. I had been a bit disappointed by my first meal there, a farewell dinner we had for a friend who was moving on to Chiapas and eventually Guatemala and Honduras to study women's peace movements. My tortilla soup had been tasty, but the tacos nopales (cactus) had been boring, and the chocolate cake and cheesecake my friends had for dessert were dry and overcooked.The comida corrida I had on Monday, however, was absolutely stunning. For 70 pesos, or a little less than $7, I had a four-course meal with a glass of agua de jamaica (hibiscus flower) and a substantial bread basket. The food was straightforward and simple, but done with such care, it was like eating at the home of an extremely talented cook.The bread basket came with homemade tortilla chips, a spicy, dark salsa, and a little cup of pickled vegetables that gave some comfort to me with my increasing kimchi cravings. Did you know you can pickle a baby potato?The comida corrida, however, officially began with a refreshing salad of lightly steamed and cubed chayote and matchsticks of jicama. The vinaigrette was light but flavorful, and I was amazed by the tiny bits of radish that added just enough contrasting color.I was already pretty full of tortilla chips and pickled vegetables, but I still ate every spoonful of the chickpea puree soup, in which they'd placed half a hard-boiled egg. So many of the soups I've had here have this indescribable quality, probably from hierba santa or some other herb that I'm not familiar with, that adds an earthy dimension to otherwise simple soups, making them completely addictive.And then I had a choice of beef with scallions or a chile stuffed with tuna. I chose the beef and ended up with a thin fillet of beef overlaid with sautéed onions with a nice slice of fried cheese and scallions in a slightly creamy sauce. I think the cheese was queso fresco, and I was happy to see it could fry as successfully as halloumi. The cream should have been too rich, but it wasn't in balance with the sautéed scallions. Oaxacan beef is far from tender, but if you like a good chew, and I do, you would love this dish.I no longer had the pressure of being a guest in someone's home, but I ate it all and then finished off the guava pie dessert as well, which was tart with a good crumbly, graham-cracker-like crust and a huge improvement on the failed desserts I'd tried earlier. I like to imagine the waiters were impressed by my prowress, but sadly, no one applauded me, the way my friends Danica and Sharon were applauded in China. No matter, I don't need outside recognition to be proud of my accomplishments.

Oaxaca is surprisingly noisy. I thought I was leaving the biggest, baddest city in the world, to come to a place that was almost rural and definitely simpler. But Oaxaca is really, really noisy.I'm living now in an apartment that faces the street. It's not a major thruway, but because it's on a slope, every car has to rev its engine to make it up the hill, and the ones that want to go fast are as macho as any motorcycle. Are there no decent mufflers in this town? There are also rockets or fireworks that go off almost everyday. I first started to hear a spate of them on June 14, the anniversary of the government's first failed attempt to expel the teachers demonstrating in the zocalo, but apparently, today's rockets were let loose by the multitude of churches that cluster downtown to celebrate, I don't know, the saint of fireworks? If I close the windows, it's much better though by no means quiet, but that means I give up the night breezes that give us all hope during the heat of midday.I'm starting to feel the annoyance of life again. It was so easy not to have a cellphone, and as much as I missed living alone during my homestay, it was also so easy not to cook or to clean or to think about anything like where to get drinkable water. I miss my Brooklyn block, which only has three early-morning motorcyclers and your occasional loud party down the block. I miss my friends, who are all friends of choice, not of convenience. I wish I had taken that other apartment in nearly suburban Colonia Reforma. My God, if it's this noisy on a Sunday, what will it be like tomorrow?So I have to focus on what is good and right: strawberry ice cream at the Mercado Organico. It was only during my third trip to the market that I noticed the vendor selling sweet rolls and hot chocolate was also selling freshly made ice cream. I had been getting ready to leave, having already consumed a delicious, chewy piece of pizza-flatbread and the best cup of coffee in Oaxaca, but then I saw a man walk by with three blue dixie-cups filled with ice cream. It called to something deep in my soul and I practically ran back to the stall.It was fresh. Creamier than most \"nieve,\" the sorbet-like ice cream most available in Oaxaca, it was studded with fresh, tart strawberries and pecan bits. It was being kept cold in a wooden pail packed with ice and salt, but it wasn't just the romance of the old-fashioned ice-cream making that made it taste so good. It could have come out of a high-tech, stainless steel freezer and I would still have been rolling my eyes to heaven. It's rare and magical when ice cream hits that perfect balancing point between rich and fresh, sweet and tart, creamy and yet refreshing. The ice cream will be the subject of my meditation every time I feel like screaming because of the noise outside my windows.

Just when I thought my month of eye-opening, homemade Oaxacan food was over, Patty served posole for our Saturday comida. Her entire family had been up late celebrating her second oldest's graduation. Unlike American teenagers, Valeria and her friends had big party at which her mother, father, little brother, aunt, uncle, and 84-year-old grandmother were all very welcome. Valeria, according to her own words, had several shots of whiskey mixed with soda, right in view of her parents, probably with her parents for all I know. Her grandmother got home around midnight because she was tired; her parents, Patty and Homero, came home at 4 in the morning. Valeria and most of her family were tired and \"cruda\" or hungover, and posole was the most restorative thing Patty could make. I love Mexican family values.Posole is a soup made of chicken or pork broth and rehydrated dried corn kernels, bigger than any most Americans have ever seen, to which various kinds of meat can be added, depending on your regional definition of \"posole.\" Patty's was chicken-intensive, to which you could add shredded cabbage and a fresh squeeze of lime. Some crunchy, fried tortillas crumbled into the broth made it even better. It's my favorite kind of food, homey, warming, and very, very delicious.I wasn't hungover, since I'd spent much of the night watching the Simpsons in Spanish, but I think the posole did me a lot of good, too.

This is what happens when you order nachos, chicken wings, and fried cheese sticks at a sports bar in Oaxaca. I haven't eaten cheese like that in...well, maybe never. Oh, there was that Philly cheesesteak I ate the \"authentic\" way with Cheez Whiz in 2003. A group of us had hoped to find some thrills in watching Mexico play Brazil in the Copa America fútbol tournament in a crowd full of Mexicans, but on top of missing Mexico's two winning goals, due to a misreading of the newspaper, we had to order crapola American food, due to the 80 peso per person minimum being enforced that night. Keep in mind that this was only a first round game, but the bar was packed, and only seats left required me to tilt my head back so far, I started getting a crick right away. Being in \"Metrocity,\" the sports bar, reminded me of being in Seoul in high school. The bar was trying to be very American, despite its almost completely Mexican clientele. It had a black wooden bar that kind of made it look like an American pub, if you squinted and didn't notice the paneling didn't go all the way, and a bunch of random, mainly American sports posters, like one of Scottie Pippen for the Portland Trailblazers, and a big inflated inner tube advertising a beer company. I don't really have to describe the way the food tasted because I'm sure you know. I need to find a new sports bar pronto, because the Copa America is going on all month. I watched Argentina trounce the U.S. beautifully at my homestay last night (sorry, I'm a bad American but it was really well done), but my new apartment doesn't have a TV. It's a good thing I don't have cravings for American bar food, because God knows where I would go.

try going to a cantena, not one of the more modern, 'hip' ones but an old school cantena. they often have 1 or 2 flat screens showing games. also, it's like in spain where you get a free 'tapas', which can be anything from a tlayuda to tacos, with your drink. the old school ones tend to still be a male only crowd but if you go with other people, it should be fine. provecho!

On Sunday, I'm moving to my new apartment. I'm looking forward to living alone again and excited about how my understanding of Mexican food might deepen in my own kitchen, but I'm going to miss my Mexican family. Obviously, the immersion was great for my Spanish, but it's been meaningful in ways I never anticipated. Every week, I would come home and find not only the five people who live in my house, but also a sister, brother-in-law, aunt, uncle, nieces, all of them speaking Spanish at the same time. None of them were ever flummoxed by the sight of a tall Asian woman in their house, who spoke Spanish haltingly, and would simply include me in whatever was going on. On one Sunday, while I sipped banana liqueur, the aunt sitting next to me repeatedly patted my arm and said, \"iMira!\" (\"Look\" or \"You see\"), as she told me and the rest of the family about the terrible car accident her daughter had been in. They reminded me a lot of my large Korean family. They made me miss my own family.Not surprisingly, the cultural immersion I appreciated the most was the chance to eat homemade Mexican food. I got to see what I love most about food, how it can center family and friends and nourish more than our bodies. Given the enthusiasm with which most Oaxacans I've met talk about food, I can tell food is a valued part of their history and tradition, but Patty, I think, is uniquely spectacular. She and her family would give me tips on where to find good street food, the kind that's \"muy limpia\" or \"very clean,\" or tell me which is the most authoritative cookbook on Oaxacan cooking. In the 29 days I spent with them, I ate 28 different dishes. We joked that she should write a cookbook herself, except it wasn't really a joke, she really should. Eating with her, I not only learned words like \"ajonjolí\" (sesame) and \"canela\" (cinnamon), but also \"tresoro\" (treasure) and \"herencia\" (inheritance). In addition to the tamales that I loved so much upon my arrival, my favorite torta, and the coloradito mole that made my toes tingle, there have been a couple of other real standouts. Isn't it magnificent? They're fried taquitos filled with chicken and beans, and then drowned in Patty's awesome salsa verde, finished off with a drizzle of crema, queso, and lettuce. She had also made some guacamole that day, thinner and more sharply acidic than the American dip, and I happily put some of that on as well. I wanted to stop at three, but I just couldn't and I ate all them.This is what I ate for lunch a week later, chicken estofada with rice and a bit of black bean puree, and tortillas, of course. I started with a soup that I would be thrilled to make for myself and serve to guests, so simple but so bright in its flavors. I didn't even have to ask for the recipe, it just declared itself: chicken broth with rice, hierba santa, and then finely chopped white onion, parsley, jalapeno peppers, and limes to squeeze right before eating. And then I ate the estofada, which according to Patty requires you to toast sesame seeds and almonds, and then grind them up with tomatoes and \"muchas muchas spices.\" Like a fine wine, it had such incredible depth of flavor. And like moles, it was obviously fatty because a sauce doesn't get that smooth without fat, but it didn't taste greasy at all. It's not a spicy sauce, for once, and I have a strong suspicion that it must have some Moroccan origin, via Spain, because sesame seeds and almonds just don't seem very Mesoamerican. This is my favorite kind of globalization.And more recently, I dined on this fine chile relleno. I've never been a big fan of chiles rellenos, probably because I don't really like green peppers. I just don't see the point--you have your delicious sweet red and yellow peppers, and you have your fantastic range of hot peppers, so why would you ever eat a pepper that just tastes like crunchy grass? I have to admit, I didn't adore the Oaxacan chile relleno I had with Patty, but I think I would have loved it if the pepper had been hotter, maybe a chile de agua, which is lighter in color but stronger in power. It had a much more interesting filling than the chile rellenos I've had in the U.S., shredded chicken made saucy with tomatoes, raisins, and almonds, all wrapped in the smooth and crunchy exterior of the fried pepper.Finally, the crème de la crème, Patty's mole negro. Look how shiny it is in its darkness. I love how \"the\" dish of Oaxaca can vary so much from restaurant to restaurant, home to home. Hers is a little sweeter than mole I've had elsewhere, maybe a little smokier. It's such a fine balancing act, the bitterness and the sweetness. Jane, the student who's been staying in the apartment out back, requested the dish for lunch the Friday her husband came to town. He and I got into a discussion on immigration reform that nearly boiled over, but Oaxaca must have changed me, because I managed to keep my temper and enjoy every bite of my mole negro.And it wasn't only the main dishes that were so impressive. I had multiple kinds of rice, all cooked to be fluffy and flavorful. I ate every spoonful of every soup, whether it was chicken broth with precisely chopped vegetables or a soup tinged with tomato and filled with pasta. There were days that I ate more than I wanted to, but my desire not to explode was clearly overcome by greater desires. I'm happy to know that Patty and her family will always remember me as the Korean girl who ate everything.

A wall of pork rinds, and a swim in the mountains

Have you ever seen a wall of fried pork rinds? I hadn't, until I went to the big weekly Sunday market at Tlacolula, a pueblo about 25 minutes east of Oaxaca City.As soon as we got out of our \"colectivo taxi,\" a shared taxi, we saw two Zapotec women walking with turkeys tucked under their arms, like they were footballs. This market also sold everything under the sun, from big tin buckets to large metates for grinding cornto pink kernels of dried corn. I have no idea how or why they are this way.I'd eaten an enormous breakfast of eggs cooked in salsa, then wrapped with beans in tortillas, so I couldn't work up much of an appetite, even for the wall of chicharrones but I did buy some tamales de elote, which turned out to be basically sweet corn bread baked in corn husks. Smokier than American-style cornbread, but not the mushy texture of other tamales. Very hearty and satisfying. And I saw the most lovable dog. Look at his face!But I had to admit, it wasn't as much fun to go to a market when I didn't have any reason to buy a plastic bag full of nopales (cactus salad), or a big loaf of pan de yema. And I felt badly just taking pictures of everything without buying much.So the highlight of the day was moving further east to Hierve El Agua, which translates as \"boiling water, which is quite an overstatement. It's actually a slightly lukewarm spring on top of a mountain. But it's not as boring as it sounds! It's a lovely place to get away from the big bad city, and to swim in what looks almost like a fancy infinity pool on top of a mountain.We had taken a \"coletivo taxi\" or a shared taxi from Oaxaca to Tlacolula, and from Tlacolula to Mitla, where we found a pick-up truck with a covered back taking people to Hierve El Agua. It turned out Hierve El Agua isn't actually that far from Oaxaca, but it takes an hour and a half to get there because from Mitla, you have to climb a steep, curvy, unpaved road.Once you enter, you see a fairly bare hilltop, a few spare brick buildings on top of one hill where they serve snacks and drinks, and a few half-constructed buildings that seem to be hopefully anticipating more tourism. Like the rest of Oaxaca, though, Hierve El Agua seemed to be hurting for tourists.We walked down a stony slope strewn with cacti and other dry plants to find the spring itself, enclosed in a little metal fence as if it were in some danger, and then a beautiful pool facing the mountains across and the valleys below. There were a few families with children splashing around, three Asian tourists with cameras slung around their necks, and us. The water had a slight smell of sulfur and it was warm from the sun, but it wasn't anything approximating a hot spring. Still, I was so happy to jump in the water and do a few awkward crawls.I would have liked to take the footpath around the mountain, but we didn't really have time since we wanted to eat lunch, and I didn't really care, it was that kind of day.(Admittedly, it didn't feel so relaxing when we started making our way back on the same curvy, steep road in pouring rain. I saw the driver cross himself before we started, and then at one point instruct his compañero to put rocks behind the tires so we wouldn't slide backwards, but hey, we got back just fine. Such are the joys of public transportation!)

Now that I've been here for over three weeks, it's finally hit me that I'm actually living here, in Oaxaca, Mexico. The raw newness of the city has worn off, and there are areas I can navigate without looking at a map. Best of all, I'm starting to have favorite places, and at the top of the list is the little park of El Pochote.You could walk by El Pochote and not even know it. It's built into the old aqueducts of the city, with only one small wooden door in a brick wall of arches leading into the enclosed space. Once you're inside, it's mainly red dirt with a brick walkway, a small pond with a brush of bamboo, and not much greenery, but there's something so lovely about its quietness and feeling of secrecy. Oaxaca, despite being a city less than 1/12th the size of New York, can still feel noisy, crowded, and polluted at times, and it's always a relief to find myself inside El Pochote.The park regularly shows free art films and hosts events like the bicycle-power generator demonstration I went to Saturday night (inexplicably paired with a series of animated shorts by a Czech filmmaker I'd never heard of, Jan Svankmajer). But the biggest draw of El Pochote for me is undeniably the organic market on Fridays and Saturdays.Like organic markets in the U.S., the customers appear generally middle- and upper-class, along with a lot of the type of gringos who like to visit places like Oaxaca, lefty, green, well-meaning. The whole market is very well-groomed, pretty white tents on wooden poles, instead of helter-skelter plastic tarps. The only non-food items are tasteful, traditional pottery and all-natural soaps and shampoos, no plastic cups with Disney characters printed on them. And as much as I like the crazed chaos of piñatas juxtaposed with raw meat, I have to admit it's often a little easier to enjoy the Mercado Organico.And no market in the U.S., neither the Union Square Greenmarket, or my beloved Alemany Market in San Francisco, or even the gastronomic playland of the Ferry Building in San Francisco has the tlayudas, enchiladas, and tacos I can get at El Pochote. Actually, I don't think there's any other market in Oaxaca where I could get the food I ate at El Pochote. Looking at the wide range of sautéed vegetables--squash, mushrooms, dark leafy greens--I suddenly realized what I'd been missing in my diet for the past three weeks. My stomach cried out for something that would taste fresh and simple, not cooked or pureed or seasoned. I started with a fantastic \"taco\" of a tortilla rolled around diced chicken piquant with sautéed sweet peppers, mixed with a bit of black bean spread and such lovely, tasty sautéed mushrooms. I then had two enchiladas smothered in coloradito mole with some shredded chicken, lettuce, and queso sprinkled on top. I think prices here are slightly higher than elsewhere, but they're still so low by American standards: 23 pesos or a little under $2.30 for a plate of food that would have been more than enough for my lunch. I felt particularly lucky eating these, that I'm here long enough to try multiple versions of my favorite foods. This coloradito had a sophisticated touch of bitterness, but still slightly sweeter and better, I think, than the one I'd tried at Casa Oaxaca.I drank some chilacayote, a pulpy drink with seeds and all made of a type of sweet squash. I didn't like it very much, and wished I had gotten tejate in a pretty little gourd instead, like my classmate who graciously wasn't surprised when I asked to take a picture of her drink.I bought some candied figs, squash, and chilacayote, which were pretty good, but a little too sweet to eat in the huge chunks they sold them in.And then I finally tasted some chapulllines, the Oaxacan specialty of fried grasshoppers. I'd been waiting for July or August, when they would be bigger and better, according to Soledad my cooking guru from ICO, but the little old lady selling them was so insistent, I ended up buying a tiny $1 bag. They tasted salty more than anything, not as crunchy as I'd thought they would be, maybe a bit like anchovies. I love anchovies, but I don't snack on them, and I didn't finish the bag.And to take home, I bought a little chocolate crescent-bread from the Korean woman who runs an organic farm and restaurant in Etla, a pueblo outside Oaxaca. I think she and her half-Korean daughters were as surprised to see me as I was to see them, but I was too shy to get her story. I had hovered by her stall for so long, though, that I felt obliged to buy the bread. Lucky for me, it was really good. I loved the cinnamon-y texture and flavor of the bit of chocolate running through the swirls of sweet, eggy bread. It wasn't at all like eating a crappy pain au chocolate with a stingy bit of chocolate at Au Bon Pain. Most Mexican bread tastes too dry and/or too bland to me, organic or not. This was so much better, wholesome without being boring. (My friend wants to organize a trip to her restaurant, so I hope to get her story sooner or later.) Heh heh, when I have my own apartment, I can take more food home.

After 3 weeks of classes, I now have more than 3 tenses at my disposal, which means I have even more conjugations to run through my head as I search for the right one. We're now in the murky world of tenses that don't have a real equivalent tense in English, and we wrestle with the difference between a desire that may possibly be fulfilled versus a past desire that has already been thwarted. Neither tense is appropriate for the direct declaration, \"I want...\" There's even a difference between asking, \"What happened?\" when you know there's a definite answer, versus when you don't. And we haven't even gone over the subjunctive yet! The Spanish speaker's sense of time, not to mention reality, must be so different from ours. My friend Lisa agrees; she says it's the only explanation for why her half-Mexican husband takes 20 minutes to get out the door after announcing that he's ready to leave.This more complicated and possibly more nuanced view of time is carried over into meals, the Mexican conception of which differs even more from the American one than I'd previously thought. The main meal is definitely \"la comida correa,\" but in addition to \"desayunar\" (to breakfast) and \"cenar\" (to dine lightly late at night), there is also \"almorzar\" and \"merendar.\" \"Almorazar describes the act of eating a bigger breakfast, like eggs or atole or chilaquiles, and it's eaten around 8-10 a.m. Merendar is the act of eating a late afternoon snack, like coffee and a sweet bread, at 6-7 pm. I love that each meal deserves its own verb. It's not good enough just to say, \"I ate breakfast, I ate lunch, I ate an afternoon snack.\" So there's no real point to this, except that I had my favorite \"cenar\" the other day. I only eat 3 meals a day, with an occasional popsicle in between, but my light-dinner is never a sweet bread or yogurt, as explained in my guidebook. I don't know if it's because Patty thinks I'm a hungry American--and given that I eat everything she gives me, she probably thinks I am. But usually, it is a big torta, or sandwich, and my favorite is bean-quesillo-avocado-tomato. I've raved before about Patty's beans, but I'll rave again. They're black beans that have been pureed into a smooth, savory spread. She must just have some made lying around almost everyday, because I know she's not soaking, cooking, and pureeing the beans right before \"cenar.\" But what a way to use leftovers! Patty combines the beans with the stringy Oaxacan cheese called \"quesillo,\" slices of ripe avocado and tomato, and then something spicy and creamy that I finally identified as chipotle mayonnaise.In a week, I'll be moving out of the homestay into my own apartment, and I'm curious to see how much I'll maintain the Mexican pattern of meals, especially since I'll be leaving the institutional classes of the school and switching to private one-on-one classes in the afternoon. If I keep nothing else, I just hope I can figure out some way to approximate Patty's bean-quesillo-avocado-tomato sandwich.

Such a declaration of place!Whenever I ask, \"Do you know Aguas Casilda,\" everyone says, \"Ohhh, Aguas Casilda, muy riquissimas!\" I doubt Casilda is still there, as she would have to be 97 years old, but regardless, her stall is situated just a few stalls down from the nieve place I also love in Mercado Juarez, making that spot a place of difficult decisions. Even those who are squeamish about street food exclaim, \"Y ella es muy limpia,\" because the stall uses purified water. When King Juan Carlos of Spain and unspecified presidents of Mexico, governors, actors, actresses, and singers have come to pay homage to Casilda, who established her stall in 1926, who are you to be afraid of diarrhea? I know all this about Casilda because the laminated menu has a history on the back. If my reading is correct, Casilda was practically a saint, as she is described giving horchata to thirsty, often penniless students, making her, \"La Samaritana Oaxaquena.\" I don't think Americans have ever felt that strongly about a drink-maker. Even your biggest, die-hard Coca-Cola fan isn't likely to want to confer sainthood on the inventor, whatshisname. Their pride in Casilda reminded me a bit of Korea, where the government catalogs every person with a traditional talent or craft, so that Mr. Kim the master of ceramics becomes \"National Living Treasure #548.\"But of course, the most important object of pride is not Casilda's history but her products, the aguas themselves. When I flipped over the laminated history, I could see clearly that pride of place had been given to one drink in particular: horchata con tuna y almendres.Isn't it beautiful? I've always liked horchata, ever since I tried it at my first taqueria with my first burrito in the Mission in San Francisco, but this version of Mexico's famous drink made of rice tasted simpler and purer, and definitely less sugary. The tuna, which you remember is cactus fruit, made it rosier and fruitier, as did the chunks of cantaloupe floating in it. The small bits of nuts were definitely not almonds, but probably pecans or \"nuez.\" Maybe they ran out of almonds. No importa, I love pecans. Sadly, it was over too quickly. I drained my glass in five minutes.

In the past two weeks, I've been to five markets and I haven't even visited the ones in the pueblos yet. I try to remind myself that I'm going to be here for awhile, and that I'll have plenty of time to visit them, and won't it be nicer to go when I actually need to buy things like onions and chilis? But markets are my crack: I can't get enough of them. The biggest market in town is the Mercado Abastos on the southwestern end of town, near the second-class bus terminal and a good 10-15 minute walk away from the tourist-friendly Centro. It's open everyday, but Saturday is its \"market\" day, the day people come from all over to sell and buy everything under the sun. It's not in either of my guidebooks, the fussy Fodor's or the more adventurous Moon Oaxaca, and from talking to my host mother, I get a sense that middle-class Oaxacans aren't too fond of it. But chowhounds, of course, who tend to rate food more highly when it's harder to get, like a frat brother who's been hazed, love to write loving stall-by-stall descriptions of its culinary highlights.Once we went past the zocalo, we soon stopped seeing other tourists and found ourselves squeezing between other people heading to the market with big bags on narrow sidewalks. I somehow ended up in charge, with a map and some sense of where we were going but with no real idea of what I was looking for. The streets felt louder, smellier, oilier even. When we arrived, there was no real entrance. We just plunged in, finding ourselves at first surrounded by flowers, which segued into fish which segued into bread. Tamales! I needed to buy one, but with no fork, I ended up carrying it for an hour, this hot little bundle that the vendor had somehow kept intensely warm in the depths of her straw basket. And then we were in the religious section, with candles, skeletal images and books, on Wicca, and then the section for piñatas and the section for New Age health supplements. We kept turning and turning, and I lost all sense of north-south-east-west. Jane was looking for crafts, and we kept asking people who just said, \"Oh, straight ahead,\" when that could mean absolutely anything. We saw plastic cups hanging in bunches over our heads, tubs of yogurt big enough to bathe a child in, and then suddenly found ourselves in the middle of a stall full of frothy wedding and First Communion dresses. Of course we passed fruit and vegetables, and the white onions that I love because with their tops on, they look like green onions with tumors, but we also passed rows of turkeys and chickens lying on the ground and cages crammed with ducklings and rabbits. It was everything I knew it would be. Oh the excitement to being somewhere with live animals that you know are just waiting to be eaten! The unrecognizable herbs, little old ladies carrying mysterious sacks that could hold anything, perhaps the best homemade tortillas in the world! Yes, your pocket could be picked in the mad scrum of humanity, but you might also find anything and everything. At the same time, It's not an easy market to be in. It's not like sitting in the shade of a secret garden at the organic market, serenely eating the most delicious, healthy-tasting taco ever (more on that to come). In a way, if you've seen Dongdaemun market in Seoul, or been in other similarly chaotic markets, it's not as shocking and exciting as it might be to an American. At the same time, my American friends didn't like it at all. But we're going to another massive market at Tlacolula, a pueblo outside of Oaxaca, on Sunday!

Oh, I love this post. You know, from our brief but passionate affair with caldo y pepino dulce y chicha morada y \"pan de bebe\" at the Mercado Central in Cusco, that my favorite travel locales are the markets. Other favorites so far include the Izmailovsky Market on the outskirts of Moscow and the Chatuchak Market in Bangkok. And I've been reading up on La Merced in Mexico City for our trip to the DF!

Searching for the famed tlayuda of Oaxaca

Tlayudas, according to people more expert than I, are unique to Oaxaca. Before I came, I learned that they're very large hand-made corn tortillas, the size of a dinner plate, but different in texture from even your toastiest tortilla. Like much street food here, it's largely available as a nighttime snack. They might encase meat or cheese or both, and they are grilled over charcoal. I was utterly entranced. \"Are they like huaraches?\", I asked my homestay family within days of getting here. \"No, not really,\" was the short reply since at that point, I couldn't understand them if they had said much more.But after two weeks in Oaxaca, I still hadn't had a chance to try one because I was so busy eating at home. The other night, for my \"light evening meal,\" I had tortillas fried up in black bean sauce with queso fresco and thin rings of white onions. I could probably eat a bowlful of Patty's beans every night. I was so sad the night Patty was late getting home and Betty, her mother, made me a ham and American cheese sandwich.I'd managed to squeeze in a little bit of street food here and there: an \"empanada\" which is more like a tortilla folded in half in American terms, with flor de calabeza (squash blossoms) and quesillo (Oaxacan string cheese); the esquite and elote with salt, lime, chili, queso fresco, and mayonnaise; a couple of tacos at the Friday tianguis (indigenous market) while another American student looked on, expecting me to keel over from food poisoning any moment; and a cup of <a href=\"\"http://www.go-oaxaca.com/newsletter/tejate.html\"\">tejate, a drink made of corn, mamey, chocolate, and the rosita cacao flower. But no tlayudas, at least not until this past Friday night.For two weeks, I took notes. When Soledad, my cooking teacher, mentioned a favorite street corner for tlayudas, I painstakingly wrote it down: Libres y Abasola. But when it finally came to actually walking and finding a tlayuda, I chose the <a href=\"\"http://www.chowhound.com/topics/267737?query=tlayuda%20oaxaca\"\">Tlayuderia Las Reliquias, which a chowhound had described with loud, loving authority.The menu listed four ingredients from which you can make any combination: tasajo, cecina, chorizo, and quesillo. It's a good thing I have no dietary restrictions, because I often find out what something is only after I order it. \"One tlayuda with tasajo and quesillo, please.\" At least I knew how much it cost, 33 pesos.As promised, the restaurant was in the open courtyard of the family's home. They had placed a couple of plastic tables and chairs, the kind you see at bare-bones seaside resorts, in the center of the courtyard, but all around, you could see open doors with furniture, a set of swings and a slide, a typewriter hanging on the wall in a very bohemian-artsy way, and a bright yellow punching bag, just a few feet from the grill.When I first saw my tlayuda, I almost died. It was the size of a dinner plate all right, the modern gigantic size of dinner plate that makes Americans eat too much and become obese. The guy who took my order, both waiter and cook that night, spread (beans) thinly all over it and set it aside while the tasajo, which turned out to be thinly sliced beef, got cooked on the grill. The tasajo, the stringy quesillo, and a fair amount of cabbage slaw got folded into the tlayuda, and the whole thing was then set on the grill to meld together.When it arrived at my table, it was even bigger than I'd remembered. Finally, the moment had arrived. I was going to eat a tlayuda.Oooohhhhh...it was a disappointment. I enjoyed the texture of the tlayuda, the combination of leathery and crunchy, because the outer layers of the tlayuda puff and crumble as it sits on the grill. I loved the stringy Oaxacan cheese called quesillo, which is like an adult version of the string cheese I loved as a child. The salsas the tlayuda came with were powerful. But I felt like all I could taste was smoke, and the beans weren't assertive enough to balance the smokiness. Luckily, a few days later, I had another tlayuda for breakfast at Café los Cuiles, the other wireless internet place in town. For 35 pesos, or less than $3.50, I got a cup of Oaxacan coffee, some fruit salad, and another giant tlayuda with beans, quesillo, avocado and tomato. It wasn't so much that I wanted to give the famed tlayuda another chance, I just wasn't interested in scrambled eggs or the \"whole wheat Belgian waffle.\" It turned out Oaxacan coffee, if Café los Cuiles serves a representative one, is the color of tea and has cinnamon sticks floating in it. Fine if you don't expect it to be coffee. But the tlayuda was tasty! Made on a coffee shop hot plate, it couldn't have the full crunchy texture of the first tlayuda, but the beans were saltier, and the avocado and tomato added an important textural and tangy dimension. Such a relief. I would have been devastated otherwise.

I have now tried four of the seven famed moles of Oaxaca, and I've been lucky enough to have three of them home-made by Patty, my homestay mother.Although I am still learning, I think it's safe to define \"mole\" (pronounced \"mol-ay\") as a sauce, period. Each kind has different ingredients, different kinds of chiles, different kinds of spices, different nuts or seeds, and sometimes even chocolate. The mole might be served over chicken or turkey, to be eaten with rice and tortillas, or mixed into tamales, or spread on a tlayuda. Some are more everyday than others, like the mole verde we whipped up in a blender on class last Wednesday, while the ultimate mole of moles, mole negro, is a serious operation that can take all day and is therefore reserved for Christmas, fiestas, and other special occasions.I came to Oaxaca ostensibly to learn Spanish. That's what I told Yale, when I told them I was going on unpaid sabbatical and needed to continue to receive loan repayment assistance. But really, I came to Oaxaca to learn to make mole negro and to eat and ponder each of the seven moles of Oaxaca.So here's the score so far:Mole negro in tamales oaxaquenos, which are wrapped in banana leaves instead of corn husks: an out-of-the-ballpark 10.Mole coloradito with chicken and rice: an outstanding 9. Such a beautiful deep red. (Sorry, no photo.)Mole verde with chicken and tortillas made in class at ICO: a satisfying 6.5. Very bright and tasty but not as complex as the others.Mole amarillo with chicken and rice: a very good 7.5. More orange than yellow, with an interesting flavor that's deeper than the verde but brighter, perhaps because of the last-minute squeeze of lime, than the coloradito.So only three more to go: rojo, chichilo, and manchamantel!

This is Oaxaca. I took these photos on Thursday, June 14, the anniversary of the \"fallido desarojo,\" or the beginning of the government's heavy-handed and eventually violent crackdown on the protests that took over the city of Oaxaca last year. So it's not all tamales and salsa here. The situation in Oaxaca then and now is almost impossible to decipher from an \"objective\" perspective. Perhaps everyone can agree on how it began, that the annual teacher strike turned into a months-long demonstration by the APPO (Popular Assembly of the People of Oaxaca), a coalition that grew to include teachers, indigenous groups, and others agitating for the removal of the Oaxacan state governor, Ulises Ruiz-Ortiz, as well as the more usual demands about wages. But I can't sift through the little I've read in Spanish-language papers, the New York Times, and the State Department warnings for American travelers and say, \"I know what happened next.\" On June 13, my teacher Octavio told us what he saw and did during the protests last year. He leaves you in no doubt whose side he is on: he was both a journalist and a supporter of APPO. The class sat in silence as he told us about the people who were killed, about families who still do not know where their relatives are, about being beaten himself by the police. He scoffed at news reports that the protesters were terrorists or guerillas. \"I saw a pregnant woman, she was 7 or 8 months pregnant, about to give birth right there, pick up a rock and throw it at the police. I saw a 70-, 80-year-old woman protesting. These people are terrorists? No, they are not terrorists.\" Octavio's tone wasn't polemic, more half-smiling, half-laughing: \"People would call me at home and say, 'Cuidate, te vamos matar' (Be careful, we are going to kill you), and I would say, 'Esta bien' (That's good) and hang up. But don't worry, nothing's going to happen tomorrow. The government will be careful, everyone will be careful. The world is watching now.\" He had been trying to get us to play a game where we, using various past tense forms, were to tell fantastic yet true stories about our lives. The next day, after class, I walked down to the zocalo. No one really looked at me, another gawking tourist with a camera. The plaza was packed, with a crowd any American organizer would have been proud of, and there was fresh graffiti on the walls of the cathedral, but it felt more like a carnival than a protest. There were clumps of people sitting around, some listening intently, some less so, to the people reading point by point the pieces of paper in their hands, forming small teach-ins. There was a mini-parade of signs, a few women in indigenous costumes, and a bunch of anarchist teenagers, some masked and armed with spray paint. The people in the bandstand were making speeches that no one seemed to be listening to, and there were people hawking CD's and T-shirts of the revolucion, as well as your usual balloon and candy sellers. Most comical of all, at least to me, were the large, blown-up photos of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. Stalin?!?!? The others, I could understand, but Stalin?On June 13, I'd been moved by Octavio's story. On June 14, I remembered why movements always annoy me.And then I went home to have lunch with my family and ate blue corn tortillas for the first time.There's so much I can't see or know as a tourist, not now or ever. I wish it really were as simple as this:

I went to that same zocalo to see MARCOS(i couldn't believe it!!) speak. The same blown up images of Marx, Engels, Lenin and STALIN were there. in the two hours of waiting for Marcos' appearance, there was some confusion over the images. They were put up and then taken down and sort up put up before finally being removed. When Marcos finally jumped onto the stage with his signature pipe and black mask, I got chills down my spine and forgot about Stalin. What a presence Marcos has!

Everyday after morning classes, I walk through El Llano, a large, rectangular plaza that grandmothers, workers, skateboarders, and children like to hang out in. I'm on my way to the Oaxaca Lending Library for gringos, where they have wireless internet, and on my way, I have to decide, do I get a paleta at Paleteria Popeye? (You would not believe how hard it is to pronounce \"Popeye\" in Spanish; it's \"Pop-eye-yay.\")I'm hungry. I've been in class for 4 hours without eating anything other than endless cups of coffee or manzanilla tea. I won't eat my comida correa, or the main meal, with my family until 2 or 2:30, but I know it will be a mountain of delicious food.Yes or no? Yes or no?I've only had 3 since I got here, believe it or not. Cajeta (goat's milk caramel), tuna (the cactus fruit, not the fish), and watermelon, the lovely pink one. I think I will have to try every flavor before I leave.Even popsicles are different here. Maybe my life will change, too.\"The border means more than a customs house, a passport officer, a man with a gun. Over there everything is going to be different; life is never going to be quite the same again after your passport has been stamped and you find yourself speechless among the money-changers. The man seeking scenery imagines strange woods and unheard-of mountains; the romantic believes that the women over the border will be more beautiful and complaisant than those at home; the unhappy man imagines at least a different hell; the suicidal traveller expects the death he never finds. The atmosphere of the border - it is like starting over again; there is something about it like a good confession: poised for a few happy moments between sin and sin.\"- Graham Greene, \"The Lawless Roads\"

Esquite: corn kernels that are grilled then boiled right on top of the grill, served in a little Styrofoam cup with lime juice, salt, chili powder, queso, and a little mayonnaise if you like, which I do. Pepe y limonada: no idea if it's Mexican, but my favorite café, owned by an American, serves fresh limeade and cucumber juice in a massive beer stein, which I like to order with carbonated water. Queso de Tehuantepec: a bucket of fresh, salty cheese from the Tehuantepec region of Oaxaca, in the isthmus of Mexico, that someone brought to my family's home, and which I was lucky to eat a lot of.

Soledad's tamales and entomatadas

Truly, God should strike me down for ever doubting my cooking class at ICO. I love the teacher, Soledad Ramirez. I wish she were my grandmother. She's one of those tiny, older women who are obviously forces of nature. I asked her the other day if the majority of Mexican families make their own salsa. The way she replied, \"Claro!\" \"Of course!\" She pointed out how easy it is these days, now that people have blenders, but that for her, she believes salsa is mas sabrosa, or tastier, when made with a mortar and pestle, a molcajete. No shortcuts for her. Claro!At the same time, the food Soledad is teaching us is simple food, food made at home for your family, though beloved enough to be served at restaurants. They involve techniques that have always intimidated me, because who was I to know what consistency tamale filling should be, but now I can see, they're techniques that anyone can learn, if she has the desire. Of course, the subtleties, nuances, and perfect seasoning I've found in Soledad's beans, salsa, and other elements can only come with practice, but now I have hope. The only peril I face is the heavy weight of my backpack if I try to return to NY with my own molcajete, comal (griddle), and jarra (hot chocolate jug).The simple, heartwarming deliciousness of the food we've made has been apparent in the tamales de frijol that we made last Thursday and the entomatadas we made on Monday. For the tamales, Soledad began by mixing masa de maiz (ground corn) with a little lard, salt, and baking powder. She poured in some liquid that she had quickly boiled up, just water with the tomatillo husks she had saved from the day before. She then asked us to knead it by hand for about 10 to 15 minutes. Soledad showed us step by step how to take a clean corn husk and fill it the masa mixture, then a layer of black beans that I could eat by the potful, and finally a few hierba santa leaves. She made it look so easy, wrapping it up and tying a neat bow on it. Not surprisingly, the rest of our tamales were not quite so beautiful. They take a long time to cook, about an hour in a steamer, and when we uncovered our pot, masa was oozing out of the ones that had been wrapped not-so-tightly. But no matter, the seasoning had been done by Soledad and even the ugly ones, especially with a little chipotle salsa from the day before, were muy muy ricos.Perhaps even more amazing to me were the entomatadas we made on Monday. Entomatadas are a Oaxacan specialty, and so easy, it's almost embarrassing that I haven't been eating them my entire life. We lined up one by one to try to follow her neat example.You begin by frying large tortillas in oil, folding them first in half, and then again, to create a neat wedge. You need to be careful to drain them as much as possible of oil, and place them on paper towels to continue draining. In the meantime, you make a mindblowingly delicious sauce: a kilogram (or about 2 lbs.) of tomatoes, 6 cloves of garlic, and 4 serrano chiles (or 2 jalapenos) simmered in a small cup of water for about 15 minutes. When cool, you put the tomatoes in the blender with a piece, maybe half an onion. You then fry this sauce in a pan with two spoonfuls of oil for about 15 minutes on low heat. You can then add two spoonfuls of bouillon or two small cups of chicken stock.Finally, it is ready to put together. One at a time, you place a fried wedge of tortilla in the mindblowingly delicious sauce, and make sure it's thoroughly coated. When you retrieve it, you ladle more sauce onto it. You only need a garnish of cilantro, white onion slices, and crumbled queso to make it better than you ever imagined it could be.Seriously, entomatadas are just fried tortillas in tomato sauce, but the one I ate in class, made with Soledad's help, was one of the most delicious things I've eaten since I got here. Oh Dios mio.

Lest you think all I do is eat, I thought I should share a non-food-related activity that made a big impression on me. Hard to believe, isn't it?Alebrije is a word of Arabic origin that isn't even in my Spanish-English dictionary. According to one guidebook, it means something of indefinite form. In Mexico, at least in this part of the country, an alebrije is a wooden, brightly painted animal that's become the signature craft of the Oaxacan valley town, San Martin Tilcajete. \"A wooden, brightly painted animal\" doesn't sound that exciting, and frankly, most of the ones hawked all over Oaxaca City aren't. They're trinkets, cheap toys to pass out to your friends and family when you get home. It's not an ancient craft, and often, the bright colors seem to fit into a decorative scheme that screams, \"MEXICO,\" in a way that's more crude than authentic. Not quite the same effect as when you see a hippie gringo wearing a garish blouse a Mexican wouldn't be caught dead in, but close.But on Saturday, I saw alebrijes that were the work of an artist, or more accurately, the work of an artist and his family. Jacobo Angeles and his wife, Maria, along with their children and various nephews and nieces, create alebrijes that are full of movement, carved almost completely from one piece of copal wood. They look at a big branch and think about the animal that might be found within, whether an iguana with a curling tail or a lion turning its head to grab an antelope by the neck. It's almost Aristotelian--what does the wood want to be? And then when they paint them, the Angeles family is famous for using paints made from natural sources on their best pieces, rather than the harsher acrylics, and they will show you right on their palms how they can crush pomegranate seeds with a little ground limestone to make a surprising color: green. Or graduate shades of one plant from red to purple to black. They do also use acrylics on their more commercial pieces, or sometimes in combination with the natural paints, but the wholly natural pieces differ obviously in quality.The family also tends to concentrate on animals and symbols that are important to the Zapotecs, an indigenous group that make up about one third of Oaxaca's native population. The most intricately painted pieces have symbols found at the temple at Mitla, signifying animals with certain powers and stages of life. For example, an iguana is a symbol of intelligence, a hummingbird one of happiness.So an Arabic word, borrowed by the Spanish during the Middle Ages, has come to describe a native craft in Mexico, that really began only a generation or two ago. It's truly mind-boggling. Their larger pieces are priced like art, a mid-sized one being a couple hundred dollars and the truly large ones a couple hundred more. A large one can take 8 months to complete. They register every major piece and record the name the collector like any proper gallery.Partly, it's the care and intense detail that's impressive. You can't help but be wowed in the face of great skill. But what moved me most was the combination of choice on the part of the artists, in the colors and patterns, and of fate, in the animals the wood was going to be. An alebrije is a specific form, but each art piece was unique, each piece of wood a specific animal in a specific posture with elements that will never be combined in exactly the same way on any other piece. Isn't that what we all want to believe, that we can become what we were meant to be?

This is a bag of lard. Look how shiny it is!I am sorry for ever having called my cooking classes unserious. The teacher, Soledad, is an excellent cook, and everything we have made so far has been from scratch and with care. Everyday, there's something new to learn and taste, and so I'm a little behind. Frankly, I could blog about something new every five hours, but I am trying not to overwhelm my faithful readers.Last Wednesday, we made memelitas, which are little corn tortillas with a little lip around the edge, the better to hold in a nice spread of manteca de cerdo (lard), frijoles (beans), queso (cheese), and salsa made of guajillo chiles and tomatillos or tomates verdes as they are called in Mexico.We began by toasting herba sante on the stove and boiling the tomatillos in some water. The guajillo chiles were also toasted and then everything was ground together in a mocajete or mortar. It took a lot of work, a little bit from all of us, to get the right texture. Previously, Soledad had taken the maiz we had boiled the day before with lime and had it ground. She added water to create a wet dough and asked us to start kneading it.Again, it took a fair amount of time to knead it to the right stretchy and tight consistency. She then grabbed a small ball of dough and started rolling and patting it into a small tortilla, slightly thicker than the tortillas we normally eat. In a few seconds, there was a perfectly round, flat tortilla in her small hands. Of course, when we tried, the tortilla wouldn't stay round, or it would stick to our hands, leaving gaping holes. When we asked why ours didn't look like hers, she simply said, \"Because you're doing it wrong!\"This is my second attempt. My first one was quite grotesque. I realized the second time around that you really need to pat it between your fingers, not between your palms, and to keep turning it as you pat it. You need to pat it with speed and courage, because the longer you think about it and try to make it better, the worse it will get it.We then put them on the flat griddles on the stove to get toasty and brown. Once they were nicely spotted on each side, Soledad had us pull away at the edges to form a little lip. You have to do it while it's hot, so that the top layer of the tortilla will pull away without leaving a hole. My fingertips burned, but it was a necessary sacrifice.Then the accoutrements: first a thin layer of lard spread on the inside, then a layer of pureed black beans, then a sprinkle of crumbled queso and the salsa we had already made. It all went back on the griddle to get toasted again. Soledad said, en espanol of course, \"You can tell when it's ready because the lard will start bubbling up.\" I ate three memelitas. I couldn't help it, todo con manteca, claro. It was a masterful combination, the crunchy texture of the tortilla, the smooth flavor of the beans, with the salt of the cheese and the heat of the salsa. And we were the masters of the universe.

My biggest fear coming to Oaxaca wasn't theft or machismo or diarrhea. My biggest fear was hunger. Of course, I knew there would be fantastic food in Oaxaca. But my friends who had spent a lot of time in Latin America warned me that the Latino eating schedule would leave me with hunger pangs clawing at my gut like a wild animal. The schedule set by the language school reflected the way Mexicans eat: a light meal for breakfast around 8 am, the biggest meal of the day at 2 or 3 pm, and then a light snack for dinner at 9. For a girl who gets hungry every two hours--and eats every two hours--it was a frightening prospect. Leslie recommended that I fill a suitcase with Powerbars, Lina told me to be prepared for restaurants and even street vendors being open only at certain times. So along with my sunscreen and my Spanish-English dictionary, I duly packed a box of Kashi peanut butter bars, and a bag of almonds and a bag of chocolate-covered pretzels from Sahadi's. I figured these would tide me over until I managed to figure out where I could buy and hoard food for those hungry moments between meals.But I'm not hungry! I haven't felt serious, decapitating hunger once since I got here. For the first two days, I packed a snack to take to school. I picked at my snack each morning, but I wasn't really hungry and I skipped it with no problem on Wednesday. Sure, I eat an enormous plate of fruit and yogurt for breakfast everyday, but at home, I can be hungry an hour after eating two fried eggs and a bagel.By the time I have my lunch at 2:30, I'm pleased to be eating but not desperate. The other day, I ate a \"patele de cajeta\" right after class, but more for fun than hunger. \"Cajeta\" is dulce de leche, but made out of goat milk. How fantastic is that? Lunch is never a sandwich or a taco. There's always soup, with a homemade salsa always on the table. Then there's a plate of meat and starch, like chilaquiles or rice, with maybe some beans or vegetables, including vegetables I've never tried before, like chayote. The homemade salsa is serious stuff, intense heat that isn't cut by sugar or salt. I like to put it on everything.And then, between lunch and dinner, I'm not hungry at all. Some days, I don't even want another meal! I don't mean to make such a big deal out of my lack of hunger, but seriously, it's a completely alien feeling. Yesterday, after drinking so much chocolate in cooking class, all I wanted was to eat elote (corn) in the park. The corn here is different from American sweet corn, and more like Korean corn, with firmly separate kernels that pull away easily from the cob. Luckily, I like it \"con todo,\" since I don't know the words for all the garnishes: lime juice, salt, mayonnaise, cheese, and chili powder. I ate it while watching Mexican skateboarders--isn't it amazing how skaters have the same vibe all over the world?It makes me wonder how much of my hunger in my regular world is the result of boredom, if I needed my stash of nuts and cookies in my drawers at work as much as I needed to read celebrity gossip blogs. I haven't even craved a drink. Maybe this is what my body would want if I didn't ever have to work again.

Oaxaca is famous for its hot chocolate, even though there are no cacao trees here. They are all in Tabasco or Chiapas, two words which have very strong and non-chocolate connotations for Americans. But Oaxaca is where chocolate is made, where it's mixed into sweet drinks and savory sauces. Mexican hot chocolate is one of the few things I'd tried before coming to Oaxaca. I'd first gone ga-ga over the hot chocolate at the Guelaguetza restaurants in LA, and bought a big bag at $15 a pop which I slowly worked through during a cold New York winter. Living far from LA, I'd tried switching to Ibarra, the brand that's widely available in U.S. supermarkets, but something about its flavor had jarred me, too different from my memories. But I'd felt lucky to already have my very mollina, the special Oaxacan kitchen utensil for mixing and frothing hot chocolate, gifted to me by Lina last winter.So when our cooking teacher told us \"chocolate con agua\" would be our first class, I wasn't thrilled. When we were going to start cooking? Our first day of class, in addition to visiting the markets downtown, we stopped at Chocolate Mayordomo, a store run by one of the biggest chocolate brands in Mexico. It was set up to look like a factory, and they had big machines that were churning out chocolate, or mixing chocolate with sugar and nuts, and a long factory runway of rolling tubes, but it seemed more like a show for tourists than an actual mill. At one end were boxes of chocolate from the floor to the ceiling, all for sale, and at the other end was a little \"chocolate bar,\" where cold chocolate was for sale. They brought out samples to try and little dixie cups of cold chocolate, which made me instantly suspicious. Had we been brought here with the expectation we would buy souvenirs?By Tuesday, when our cooking was supposed to start in earnest, I wasn't expecting much. Why would we need two hours to learn how to make hot chocolate, something I'd made on my stove so many times?Stupid know-it-all me. When I got there, Soledad, our teacher, instantly put me and the others to work sorting and cleaning the beans and dried corn kernels. They were going to soak and simmer on the stove for use the next day. She added lime to the corn, which she said was necessary for tortillas and tamales. We were going to make tortillas and tamales? Clearly, this woman believed in making food from scratch. She also began passing out recipes for \"champurrado,\" described in parentheses as \"atole de maiz mezclado con chocolate,\" one of those parentheticals that provides little clarification. It's easier to describe how it's made than what it is. I'd tried \"atole\" before, but not \"champurrado,\" a very traditional drink for weddings and other celebrations.We began with dried corn kernels that Soledad had already boiled for about 30 minutes. These corn kernels were big, fat, and more white than yellow. When they had cooled, she poured the corn with the water into a blender, adding more water when necessary. She asked two students to stretch a cheesecloth between them, and then push and strain the pureed corn liquid through, leaving a bucket of milky white liquid and a big ball of corn mush. The atole went back on the stove, along with a big bar of Mayordomo chocolate. More cooking, and all for a drink. While that was boiling, Soledad began preparing \"chocolate con agua.\" Oaxaquenos, she explained, make hot chocolate with water, not milk. Water, not milk! Suddenly, I realized I didn't know at all what she was talking about. I'd never had \"chocolate con agua,\" only \"chocolate con leche.\" Soledad put the traditional one-handled chocolate pitcher straight on the stovetop and got the water boiling. She then added two big bars of chocolate and started mixing and pushing at the chocolate chunks with the mollino. This one was smooth and dark from years of use, not like my pristine blond one. She began rolling the mollino between her hands, and all of us took a turn, frothing up the chocolate before pouring ourselves a cup.To be honest, my fat-loving heart had been dubious about the Oaxacan style of hot chocolate. Could it be tan rico con agua? Could it be as meltingly rich as the Mexican hot chocolate I'd made at home?It was better. It was sweet but strong and straight, like a cup of great coffee. It wasn't just the difference between dark chocolate and milk chocolate. It was bracing, maybe even fortifying. We dipped pieces of \"pan de yema,\" an eggy challah-like bread, into our chocolate. It was better than any coffee and donuts I'd ever had.The class wasn't even over. We still had the champurrado to drink. \"Atole\" is another flavor that I think doesn't fit into an American's lexicon of flavors. It's nutty, corny, almost a little gritty. It reminded me a little of the nutty Korean powdered drink my mother had fed me through hot summers. It was almost as good as the chocolate con agua.

you can find chocolate atole being made at the 'organic market' under the aqueduct on the weekends. it's the only place that i ever saw chocolate atole. the market definitely feels like it's for the gringos of Oaxaca but there are some yummy finds!

So far, the food I've eaten has been very good in a way that is deeply satisfying. The polite way to say, \"I'm full\" is \"Estoy satisfecho,\" which seems particularly appropriate when it is literally true. But nothing was new or revelatory until I ate at \"Nieves Chanito\" in Mercado Juarez on Tuesday. After looking longingly at the meat market in Mercado 20 de noviembre, I almost didn't believe it when our cooking class actually stopped to eat at a stall proclaiming, \"Nieves Chanito.\" I didn't even know what \"nieve\" meant; after all, wasn't \"helado\" ice cream? Luckily, I didn't have to wonder much longer.The list of flavors in foreign countries is always so exciting: the thrill of ordering a completely unknown flavor. According to Soledad, our teacher, the most \"tipico\" flavors of Oaxaca are \"tuna\" (cactus fruit) and \"leche quemada\" (burnt milk). Since I'd never tried either, it was an easy choice.\"Nieve,\" it turned out, isn't ice cream, but more like a creamy sorbet. And \"tuna,\" it turned out, means \"delicious.\" We had just seen a ripe cactus fruit in the market, which you eat by tearing a little hole at one end and squeezing out the soft, pulpy red fruit inside. The tuna nieve looked exactly like the fruit and tasted just as fresh, perfectly balanced between fruity and sweet. It was nothing like the toxic orange sorbets I hated as a child at Baskin-Robbins, and somehow nothing like the artisanal sorbets at Il Laboratorio del Gelato either. I don't think it was just that it was served in a plastic dixie cup, though I did love the artlessness with which it was all-natural and probably organic. \"Leche quemada\" on the other hand, turned out to be an even more unique flavor. I don't understand how they got the flavor of burnt milk into a creamy white sorbet, but they did. When I told my family what flavor I ate (everyday, I report to them what I ate), they all said, \"Que rico!\" I'm not sure I would agree. It's definitely an acquired taste, the kind of taste that just doesn't exist for an American palate, not even this well-traveled, well-eaten Korean American one. It didn't taste bad, but I ate all of it more out of curiosity than love. With each bite, I thought, \"I don't get it,\" and would eat another spoonful to see if I could.So much to hear, eat, and taste.

I need to be careful not to dump all my pictures on this blog in the first week of my stay here, and save a few goodies for later. But I took 43 photos today at the market and it's hard not to blurt out everything I feel.Classes began today, and I was placed in Nivea 1B. It's a very popular level, those who know slightly more than nothing. The campus is beautiful, with a large enclosed courtyard garden in front and a smaller courtyard inside. It's just the way you want your Spanish school to look, palm trees rising grandly before you, flowering trees, and bright yellow walls with arches and nooks. Of the students I've met so far, there are your college students on summer vacation (who seem painfully young to me), a graduate student studying women's peace movements in Latin America, teachers who want to gain Spanish language skills, and a middle-aged couple who quit their jobs, sold their house, and are starting a Peace Corps stint in a yet-unknown country in August. Whoa baby! Makes my little 6-month adventure seem ridiculously easy.This school likes to pack your day. We have three hours of instruction in the morning, then one hour of conversation, a lunch break, then an optional hour of \"intercambio\" or English-Spanish exchange with a local student, and then an optional 2-hour, 2-week workshop in cooking, ceramics, weaving, or salsa. Guess what I picked?It's definitely not a serious cooking class, but it's nice to do something laid-back in the afternoon. On Mondays, the class goes to market, and so we went to the two everyday markets downtown, Mercado 20 de noviembre and Mercado Juarez. I'd already been to both markets, but this time, I felt less shy about taking photos, especially of the meat market that had been haunting my dreams. Imagine this: a room lined with stalls with their meat on full display, big chunks hanging on hooks, round red links of sausage, long thin slices that then vendors periodically pat with their hands, like they're patting a baby. You see everything through a hot haze, because the room is filled with smoke from the little grills at each stall. When the smoke blows away and you can see the meat and the cebollitas (green onions) getting browned--well, it thrilled me almost as much as when I saw the clouds part above Machu Picchu.(My guidebook and the orientation packet the school gave us today says, \"Do not eat food from street vendors!\" But what's the worst that could happen? I've been immunized for hepatitis and I have plenty of Pepto-Bismol.)The meat was clearly not something to be eaten alone. There were groups of people sitting around large platters of meat with a stack of warm tortillas and all the fixings, radishes, salsa, guacamole. But this wasn't an eating trip and we had to move on. I felt intensely jealous. One day, I WILL eat the meat at Mercado 20 de noviembre!Next post: the \"nieve de tuna\" (cactus fruit sorbet) at Mercado Juarez.

(Revised, with photos, June 5, 2007)God, I wish I could show you a photo of what I've eaten already! But I haven't figured out a way to upload photos from my camera yet. Sooner or later, I'm bound to find a place with wireless internet. (I knew I should have bought a flash drive.) But for now, I'm just going to have to make myself write tantalizingly vivid descriptions to make up for the lack of visual food porn.I arrived yesterday at Oaxaca International Airport, a short 2.5 hour flight from Houston, Texas. Houston was a good way to ease into a foreign country from New York. The Oaxaca airport, thankfully, was small and easy to navigate, and I found myself easily enough in a cheap airport shuttle that dropped me off at my homestay, the home of Betsy the grandmother, Patty the mother, Homero the father, and their two children, Valeria and Homero, Jr. They've had students stay with them for years, and so they're used to speaking slowly, using easy words, and being very very patient. And lucky for me, Patty is an excellent cocinera (cook)--more on that to come.Their house is a little north of the center of the city, but still easily walkable to the famous zocalo (square) and the famous cathedrals, and just blocks from my school, Instituto Cultural Oaxaca. It's on a fairly busy street with a few bodegas, a fancy liquor store, a gas station, and a couple of restaurants, but it's easy to find because it's marked with a huge, beautiful tree with vibrant fuschia flowers that planes directly in front of the gates. The family also maintains a little hostel behind the house where another student, 53-year-old Jane from Miami, is staying. My room, to a New Yorker's eyes, is huge, half the size of the old tiny tenement apartment I shared with my sister in the East Village. To my happy surprise, unlike most mattresses I've encountered outside the U.S., the mattress is firm and I slept better last night than I have in weeks. Probably also helps that I now have absolutely zero responsibilities, ha ha! I spent an hour or two yesterday just orienting myself in my neighborhood, wandering around with Jane who was in Oaxaca two summers ago. But today is the real day my Oaxaca adventures began, starting with an unbelievable desayuno (breakfast).When I sat down at the breakfast table, there was a plate of cut-up fruit, banana, papaya, and half a mango, and a bowl of nicely sour yogurt. When Patty asked me last night if I ate todo (everything), I answered with a strong \"iSi!\", forgetting how much I loathe papaya. This papaya was a deeper orange than any papaya I'd ever seen, and I thought I would give it a chance. Nope, still tasted like fart. I ate as much of it as I could, dumping small pieces in the yogurt and eating it with the banana to mask the taste. I'll have to figure out some way to tell them.I was happy and full, when Patty came out with a big platter--my God, a oaxequeno tamale! Imagine this: the platter covered with unfolded banana leaves, and in the center, chunks of tamale, shredded chicken, the possibly the most complex and delicious sauce in the world, mole negro. \"¿Todo para mi?\" (All for me?). Tamales are not my favorite food. Too often, they're too dense and uninteresting. But a tamale like this, I could eat for breakfast almost everyday. The corny tamale was so flavorful, it was almost fluffy, it was so easy to eat. I wish I had the words to describe what mole negro means to me. It was already my second mole negro in Oaxaca, as I'd had enchiladas en mole con quesillo (cheese) the day before with Jane, and thought it reasonably enjoyable. But this mole negro made obvious why mole is not something to be taken lightly or eaten mindlessly. Slightly sweet, earthy and deep. Perfecto.I ate it all.And then I walked all the way down to the zocalo and sat at a cafe on the western side, drinking pineapple juice and watching people walk by.

So exciting, all of it!I totally feel you on the papaya thing- it has a certain funk. Though I really want to like papaya, as it's now the only fruit I have reservations about. Everywhere I travel, I always try it, hoping to overcome my dislike. And in Brazil this fall I did eat some papaya that I liked much better. But the stuff at home is still funky.Also, over the weekend I cooked Cochinita Pibil from the All About Braising book. After 7 hours in the oven, the 10-lb. pork roast literally fell into pieces once we removed the banana leaves. It made me even more excited for your upcoming adventures in Mexican regional cooking...

Five days left. I've given up on cooking anything that takes more thought than a plate of pasta or a salad. The apartment is a mess, as I try to sort what I'll need in Mexico versus what I need to store in my friends' basements, and living in the mess for the past week has been more stressful than I expected. So it was a relief when Mimi and Alex invited me to come over for a picnic dinner Sunday night. It had been stifling hot all day, especially for May, but by 6 pm, it was a pleasant, only slightly sultry night. They live way west in Chelsea, almost by the West Side Highway, so we wandered over to the strip of park that runs between the highway and the river. New Yorkers are starved for outdoor space--we picnicked right next to a highway. But there was some good brush between us and the cars, and before us was the Hudson River in all its fullness and New Jersey looking serenely green. There were kids running around, solitary people reading in the cool night air, and more than one couple making out with vigor. Ahh, summer in New York!Mimi had gone nuts cooking--poached salmon, thick spears of asparagus, roasted peppers in sun-bright colors, marble-sized green and black olives, and a pasta salad full of surprises: peas, caramelized onions, pistachios, and dried cranberries. We drank the last bottle of white wine from their wedding and talked like we could never run out of things to say to each other. Dessert was mascarpone, drizzled with honey, raspberries and blueberries. There's possibly nothing better to eat when you're sitting on a blanket by the river on a summer night in New York. As much as I fantasize about never coming back, I'm don't think I could ever give this up.

My condiments are gone. My refrigerator is practically empty. My freezer still has random fishy odds and ends my mom stocked while she was here last June--so embarrassing--but I've eaten through all my frozen meat, even the last bit of frozen pancetta. I've stopped buying the 3-lb. bag of onions, the big hunks of cheese, the 2-lb. bags of turkey thighs. From here on out, I subsist on what's left in my pantry, comforting myself that very soon, I will be tasting all the famed gustatory delights of Oaxaca. But I had to try one last new thing, one last tantalizing unknown combination of flavors from Deborah Madison's \"The Savory Way.\" I tried to pick something for which I had almost all the ingredients, hence, \"Chickpeas and Peppers with Pine Nut Dressing.\" The list of ingredients just screams, \"California vegetarian,\" but I trusted her. Besides, how else could I use up the half a can of chickpeas and bag of pine nuts I had in my fridge? The only thing I had to buy was a small bag of olives and a green bell pepper.My paraphrase follows:1 cup dried chickpeas, soaked 6 hours or overnight, or 2 15-oz. cans chickpeassalt1 onion, quartered and thinly sliced crosswise1 small green bell pepper, thinly sliced into 2-in. pieces1 garlic clove, finely chopped1 T. virgin olive oil1 t. ground cumin1/2 t. paprika1 t. tomato pastejuice of 1/2 lemon12 Nicoise olives, pitted, or 6 Kalamata olives, pitted and cut into large piecesadditional paprika for garnishcilantro or parley for garnishdressing:1/4 cup bean broth (or water or milk)1/3 cup pine nuts1 garlic cloves1/4 cup virgin olive oiljuice of 1/2 large lemonsaltfreshly ground pepper2 T. chopped parsley1-2 T. chopped cilantroDrain the beans, cover them with fresh cold water and bring to a boil. Boil vigorously for 5 minutes and remove any foam. Lower the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Add salt and continue cooking until the beans are soft but still hold their shape, about an hour. Drain the beans, reserving the liquid for the dressing. While beans are cooking, warm the olive oil in a skillet and add the onion, bell pepper, garlic, cumin, paprik, and lightly salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring frequently, until onion and pepper are slightly softened, for about 3 minutes. Stir in tomato paste and lemon juice and cook for another 30 seconds or so.To make the pine nut dressing, heat the bean broth, milk or water. Puree pine nuts in a food processor, gradually adding the heated liquid. Add garlic, olive oil, lemon juice, and a little salt and pepper and process until smooth. Add cilantro and parsley and season to taste with pepper.Toss the beans with the dressing. Add the vegetables and olives and toss again. Garnish with paprika, cilantro and parsley.Since I had only half a can of chickpeas, I haphazardly reduced the amount of all the ingredients. No lemons, but I had two limes. I had just a few measly sprigs of still-green cilantro, and the puny bit of pine nuts I threw into my 11-cup food processor just kept getting flung around. No smooth puree. But the dressing was so good! Nutty and creamy, but without any actual dairy--dare I say vegan? The salad overall would have benefited from more chickpeas to balance out the peppers and onions, but cooking them only slightly was inspired. Their crunchiness added a lively, fresher flavor than the more familiar, mellow taste of long-cooked peppers and onions. My little counter was a mess of parley and garlic bits, and all for a measly bit of chickpea salad, but it felt good to concentrate and follow an odd little recipe. I'm know I'm going to miss cooking in Mexico.The rest of my dinner wasn't so exciting and actually kind of wrong. Pasta all'amatriciana is one of my favorite things to eat, and something I always have the ingredients for. Bacon, onion, and tomatoes are a magical combination, but I mistakenly thought it would be good with some sauteed mushrooms as well, which were also in my fridge begging not to be thrown away. The mushrooms should have had a strong flavor, but they just ended up chewy disks in the sauce, and worse, they made it practically impossible to taste the bacon. The whole wheat pasta didn't do so well against this sauce--there were just too many flavors that didn't complement each other. Thankfully, everything improved with a big dusting of parmesan cheese. But now what am I going to do with the leftover pine nut dressing?

It was finally time to get rid of my condiments. I sent out a big email to my friends--come say goodbye before I leave for Oaxaca and \"Take a Condiment\" brunch. I had a few people say, \"What? Take a what?\", but in the end, I had two friends fighting over the walnut oil and another hiding the ginger spread in case someone else took it. I even had a friend call and say he couldn't make it, but could I reserve the horseradish for him? As always, what I thought would be an easy, laid-back menu ended up taking more time than I expected and causing me some last-minute stress as I sliced oranges and pineapple furiously for the fruit salad, but there's a part me that enjoys this kind of stress, the same part of me that gleefully makes hour-by-hour schedules for parties, counting backwards from the time my guests are to arrive.The night before, I prepped the two casseroles: a Paula Deen heart-attack-in-a-pan French toast casserole and a strata I found on an old entry of a SF food blogger. Together, with Candy's chocolate pound cake, I needed 26 eggs! I decided on three salads: the shockingly good salad of fennel, avocado, and sun-dried tomatoes in a nutty, lemon-caper dressing; a fruit salad of pineapple, strawberries, and sliced valencia oranges with a mint sugar garnish; and a simple green salad with sugar-sweet grape tomatoes.My sister was enamored of the French toast casserole, which was baked with a praline topping that called for two sticks of butter, a cup of brown sugar, a cup of chopped walnuts, two tablespoons of maple syrup, 1/2 a teaspoon of cinammon and 1/2 a teaspoon of ground nutmeg. I got scared of what Paula Deen would consider sweet, and I didn't use all the topping I made, which was a good thing. (It's unbelievable that she even tells you to serve it with additional maple syrup.)Others, Louisa in particular, loved the strata with its prosciutto, chard, spinach, and gruyere-parmesan filling. I personally have decided I am not a fan of soggy bread unless it's bread pudding, but I was glad the experiment was successful to my guests. It was definitely impressive when it came out of my oven, all puffed, golden, and glistening.Leslie and Richard couldn't get enough of the fennel-avocado salad. It really is amazingly good, possibly the best salad I've ever had, maybe because the surprise of seeing something so novel makes it taste even better.And everyone loved the chocolate pound cake, as I knew they would.And of my once mighty collection of condiments, I have only red-wine vinegar, white-wine vinegar, the blood orange jam I couldn't give up, some Korean jammy teas, and a couple baking staples. I might have to make another cake before I leave.

Wish I could have been there to bid you adieu and wrestle for some new spices... and I'm happy to see that blood orange jam was such a hit! I'm going to have to look for it at some of the Italian stores in SF.

right before i leave for a long trip or move to a new place, i have this nervous childlike excitement like something really special is going to happen. but at the same time, i have this incredible sadness for what i'm leaving behind. i think it must be what homesickness feels like -- but without a permanent home to miss, it's hard to say. this is my roundabout way of saying that i'm already missing our times in the city together and hope that you have a special and exciting time in Oaxaca.

It was a relief to be at home alone on Saturday night. Work has been draining lately, and with everything I had to do to prep for Sunday's brunch party, I made sure to have no plans other than a bottle of wine and a simple pasta dinner.For all my talk of good ingredients and organic produce, I'm a cheapskate. Hell, that's a huge part of the reason I cook so much. And for a long time, it was unthinkable to open a bottle of wine just for myself. But for the past few years, I've developed a habit of drinking alone (which I think is quite healthy, so there), just a drink or two when I get home from work. So I'm always on the lookout for cheap wines $10 or less. I don't know enough about wine to find those wines on my own, so I often go out of my way to get to Astor Wines in the East Village. I'm sure there are wine shops in the city that are more intelligent or thoughtful, but I love that the staff at Astor Wines is used to stupid people and that when you ask for a wine that is $10 or less, they don't suggest wines that cost $10.99. Unfortunately, few of the cheapo wines I try are worth seeking out a second bottle, but I was pleasantly surprised by the easy, clean taste of the Spanish Blanc de Nulles. It was a night of small, happy discoveries, as I also found a whole wheat pasta that actually tastes good. There's definitely been a theme lately of me trying to eat healthier. I finally decided to face the fact that regular pasta is a blackhole of nutrients. But the one time I had tried whole wheat pasta before--I must have been living in California--it tasted so much like cardboard I couldn't bring even my cheapskate self to eat the rest of the box. To my great relief, the Bionaturae spaghetti I bought at the Coop had real flavor. Their advertising is truthful--it really does have a nutty, honest flavor, the flavor of good whole grain bread. It's different, the way tofu is different from meat, but once I accepted that, its strong flavor held up well against sauteed kale and crumbled DiPaola's turkey sausage, with a generous grating of fresh parmesan cheese. Me, wine, pasta, and the early Sunday NY Times: it was a happy night.

International Junk Food, part I

One of the things I love most about traveling is international junk food. Like most people who like to travel, I love things that are different. Maybe I have a bad tendency to fetishize the exotic (and an unhealthy attraction to men with accents), but I can indulge my love of international junk food knowing the risks are low. Yes, it might taste terrible, but it only cost a few dollars! And the packaging is always, always rewarding.I'm not the only one obsessed with international junk food. Clearly, there are many who love seeing how similar and how different cultural preferences can be, all centered around the universal affinities for sugar, salt, and fat. Everyone likes to use cartoons to sell candy, but Japanese cartoons are very different from American cartoons which are very different from French cartoons. And then, there's always the fun of seeing a blissful disregard for political correctness:I found this chocolate bar in Astoria. It's made in Croatia and since it's chocolate with rice krispies, it's called \"Mikado,\" and has a picture of a Japanese garden. Makes perfect sense, no? (Incidentally, it tastes like chalk.)The Peruvians have a very different idea of how to decorate chocolate. The label would make a beautiful, retro poster for Pottery Barn to sell. I haven't tried it yet because I can't figure out what it's for. It might be cooking chocolate.The great thing about New York is that you don't even have to leave the country to find great examples of international junk food. Before my Indian dinner on Sunday night, I had a little time to kill and started walking up and down Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside. I felt like I'd found Ali Baba's cave when I came across the Butcher's Block, an Irish deli and grocery store.I love the look on this butcher's face. The cow has no idea what's coming to him.I bought these Jaffa cookies because of the words on the box: \"10 spongy cakes with the squidgy orange bit\"! \"Squidgy\" is an English word but definitely not an American one. I like how gleeful they are, too: \"New recipe with lots more orangey centre yippee!\"They smelled very fragrant when I opened the box, and they tasted pretty good, too, though I think you'd have had to grow up with them to love them.This isn't junk food, presumably. Kellogg is an American company, but Irish citizens are getting cereal that Americans didn't have access to, at least until Irish expatriates began importing it to Sunnyside! I also bought some Finnish licorice (bad) and something called \"Bounty,\" a Dutch version of Mounds that comes in milk and dark chocolate (delicious). I would have taken so many more pictures, of tea and juice and more candy, but as nice as the guys behind the counter were, I thought snapping a ton of pictures would look suspicious.Food is such a major part of how immigrants adjust and adapt to life in the U.S. It's often the last thing immigrants' children cling to, so that the only words they know in their parents' or grandparents' language are food-related. It just cracks me up that we need our own mass-produced junk food, too.

I haven't been cooking much lately. I bought some nice, fresh produce at the Coop this Sunday, one ear of corn, a bunch of purple kale (which I've never tried before), a handful of crimini mushrooms, and some fresh fava beans, but even the thought of all that produce in my fridge couldn't tempt me home to cook dinner alone on Tuesday, and I went out for beer and sausages with Lina and Leslie. I've been feeling a little subdued lately. Part of it is work-related; I got some bad news for one of my favorite clients. And part of it is a little fear about my upcoming trip, not so much about being in Spanish-speaking countries for six months when I can barely say, \"Me llamo Grace,\" but whether I will come back with any more clarity about my life.Luckily, fresh fava beans demand so much attention, you have to focus to the exclusion of all other thoughts, even an overdue response to a motion to dismiss. They really are too much work when you're not paying someone else to shell and cook them, but for me, they say \"spring\" almost more than any other vegetable and I couldn't resist them. And on a Wednesday night, coming home around 8 pm, I still managed to get dinner on the table by 8:30. First you shell them. Whenever I discard the pods, I feel so wasteful. Not only do I end up discarding a good three-quarters of the weight I paid for, the pods are so spongy and soft, they feel like they should be useful in some other way, like filler for seat cushions or something. Then you blanch them, letting them cool long enough so you can handle them. Then you have to slit their little opaque skins and squeeze out the tiny, bright green beans inside. It's almost a joke when you look at the handful of beans you have and the bag of empty pods. Mmm, $1.94 per pound!But the little buggers tasted so good, especially with pancetta and meaty crimini mushrooms. It wasn't planned. I just had some pancetta in the freezer, which was older than I'd like to admit, and the mushrooms I had bought on a whim. While the water for the pasta boiled and the mushrooms and pancetta were cooking, I squeezed the little green babies out of their skins, giving the mushrooms a stir every once in awhile. The mushrooms got so infused with pancetta fat they started to taste like pork, so the fava beans were the perfect counterpoint, so green I could just feel the vitamins bursting from them. A shaving of parmesan, also older than I'd like to admit, rounded out the dish.It would have been better with a small, shaped pasta, like orecchiette or those ruffly ones, but the spaghetti was good enough for conveying the salty, fatty, green taste of spring.

My friend Raj has been tempting me to go try Indian-Chinese food in Queens for months now. He and his girlfriend frequently zip up to Queens from their place in Brooklyn to sample such tantalizingly named dishes as chicken lollipops (well Raj does, Allison is vegetarian). We finally planned to go on Sunday night, and he enlisted some friends to join us so we sample a good portion of the 200+ items on their menu.His usual choice, Tangra Masala, is a tiny place, and so Raj suggested we meet at their cavernous sister restaurant, Tangra Asian Fusion, just off the 40th St. stop on the 7 train. Unfortunately, this view of their over-the-top interior was as close as we got to eating chicken lollipops that night. Perhaps eating Chinese food is an Indian tradition on Mother's Day, but for whatever reason, a restaurant that is normally empty was packed at 8 pm on Sunday night, with the crowd impatiently spilling onto the sidewalk. We put our names down at 8 and were hopeful that we would have a table by 8:30. It was a nice night, and we stood on the sidewalk chatting amicably. Then 8:30 came and went. When Raj went to check with the host and showed shock at the long list of names ahead of us, the host tried to reassure him, \"Don't worry, people eat quickly!\" When more time passed, Emily decided to fight her way through the throngs to ask when our table would be ready. Fifteen minutes later, she returned with the news that if \"Houd\" was gone, the next table would be ours! Unfortunately, \"Houd\" was very present.It was time for Plan B. There was a \"Cafe Romania\" across the street, a Turkish place a few doors west, a Japanese place a few doors east, and another, small, bare Indian restaurant on the same block, Vicky Punjabi Haandi. Emily, who lives in Sunnyside, said that she had gotten take-out there before and that the food was fine. By that point, that was good enough for us.I only know the name of the place because I took a photo of the small, photocopied sign taped to the front window on my way out. There is no larger sign declaring the actual name, though neon letters make clear that you are there to eat \"INDIAN CUISINE.\"The decor inside was similarly schizophrenic. The tabletops were shiny with a huge, blown-up photo of blowsy pink roses on each one. There were a few tapestries tacked high up on the walls and a TV in the corner playing Bollywood movies, but the room was otherwise more stripped down than a Chinese take-out place with bulletproof glass. Vicky was obviously catering more to take-out customers. Still, nothing was out of the ordinary, and we could smell good things from the kitchen.We only began to realize we had entered a Twilight Zone of Indian restaurants when we began to order. One lamb tikka, one chicken tikka masala, one fish goa, and then, Raj, the only Indian, tried to order bhindi masala. \"Bhindi masala,\" he said. \"No, bhindi masala,\" the waitress said. At first, we thought she was telling us there was no more bhindi masala, but no, she was correcting his pronunciation. Raj was too nice to tell her his family is from the south and they don't speak Hindi. Things got stranger. A group of three kids came in and she walked over to them with an obvious roll of the eyes. I thought she knew them, but no, she was just unhappy to see them. Then a group of 14 came in, of which 5 were under six, hungry, and cranky. Tangra Asian Fusion was clearly overflowing into Vicky Punjabi Haandi. We heard the children scream and cry, \"We waited over two hours!\" \"I didn't eat today!\" The waitress was really unhappy to see them.It became quickly obvious why. We waited and waited and waited for our food. Tangra Asian Fusion called my cellphone to tell me our table was ready at 9. We laughed and relinquished it, believing our food would be on our table at any moment. We waited and waited and waited. Emily and her friend Lory got antsy. They became the cranky, hungry children at our table. I have never heard someone \"hmmph\" and sigh with as much gusto and repetitive speed as Emily did that night. Other parties started getting up and switching tables for no explicable reason. I tried to start conversation topics that weren't about food or hunger, but only Raj answered my questions. Every 10 minutes or so, our table would watch the waitress come out with plates of food, and we would sing in a hopeful crescendo, \"Oh--oh--oh,\" only to let out a deflated \"nooooooo\" when she put the food on a different table. Twenty minutes after they arrived, the party with the starving children were asked what they wanted to eat. We waited and waited and waited.At 9:30, 45 minutes after we had arrived at Vicky, and an hour and a half after we had started waiting for dinner, our food arrived.And the irony of ironies? The food was really, really good. Everything came out hot, like it had just come off the stove. The flavors were fresh and bright, with a balanced smoothness and complexity that showed obvious care. The tikka masala sauce looked real, not pink. The tandoori lamb was moist, the naan fluffy, crispy and chewy all at the same time. As we ate, we could imagine the beleaguered lone cook, talented but unused to crowds, grinding spices and making everything from scratch, methodically moving through the orders one by one. We ate everything in 10 minutes. We even dared to order more naan, and wonder of wonders, we got it in 5 minutes. We geared up to ask for the check, and when we finally waved her down and said, \"We'd like our check please,\" she replied, \"You look like my sister.\" She was looking straight at Emily, who is East Asian. In case we didn't understand, she said, \"She's an Indian woman.\" She then took some plates and walked away. When we realized she probably hadn't absorbed our request for the check, we did an estimate of what we owed and just managed to get the check in time to check our math. We had had delicious Indian food. It was time to leave.

It's been 8 years since my friends and I graduated from Yale, but in the way of many Yalies, in those eight years, one of us has been in New Haven in one way or another. This year will mark probably the last Yale-related graduation for us, when Romy graduates from the Yale School of Art with a master's in graphic design. A group of us in New York headed north on Saturday to see her graduating class show and incidentally, to eat some good New Haven food.Danica offered to drive, citing a need to get back to New York early Sunday morning. As we drove on I-95, however, it became clear that she had other motives for choosing her parents' car over Metro North.In our four years as undergraduates, we were sadly unaware of Stowe's, just a short drive away on the shore in West Haven. It's easy to forget that New Haven is a coastal city, but Stowe's makes it deliciously obvious. Danica is good at taking every opportunity possible to make up for lost time.Stowe's has your classics, like fried clams and lobster bisque, but their crowning glory is the lobster saute roll, a version of the lobster roll that Connecticut can be proud to claim as its own.Unlike the usual lobster roll with mayonnaise, celery, and often unknown filler, the Connecticut version is just lobster meat and butter. \"Just\" lobster meat is probably the grossest understatement. Served on a soft, New England-style split-top hot dog bun, and offered for only $9.50, Stowe's lobster saute roll is...sublime. This wasn't our dinner. On our agenda: New Haven pizza. The best New Haven pizza is a hotly debated topic, with most people arguing vehemently about Sally's versus Pepe's in Wooster Square. I prefer to avoid the long lines at both places, because no pizza is worth waiting 2+ hours for, especially when all the locals know you can get fantastic pizza at Modern on State Street. But a good downtown alternative is the pizza at BAR, which despite being kind of a cheesy place and not even the best of New Haven's pizza establishments, makes a chewy, flavorful crust that blows many a NY pizza legend out of the water. It's also the only place I've ever been that serves pizza with mashed potatoes and bacon. It's best to eat it on a \"white\" pie (no tomato sauce). Don't knock it till you try it.One summer day long long ago, Danica and I ate an entire large pizza for lunch, while a table of four middle-aged men looked on us with a mixture of awe and respect. This time, we couldn't quite do it. Four of us ended up leaving almost third of a pie. The whole day was an exercise in remembering who we had been then and realizing how different we are now. We walked across the New Haven Green to our favorite coffee shop and then got past the locked gate at Timothy Dwight College to look at the home we had shared for four years. The dining hall was full of students eating dinner between finals, who barely noticed the 30-year-old alums wandering among them. I whispered as loudly as I dared, \"Don't go to law school!\", knowing they would never listen. We wondered where students sat to talk in the courtyard, now that the fence was gone. We mourned the loss of the beautiful tree that bloomed each year just as classes came to an end.And then we went to Romy's show and presented her with her graduation gift, a Lithuanian coffee cake from Claire's with an obscene amount of buttercream frosting. Romy was the one who came up with our group motto, \"FIAGO\" or \"Fuck it and go on.\" It was only appropriate to give her a cake declaring, \"FIAGO 4-Ever.\"

In three weeks, I will be on a plane to Oaxaca, Mexico. By the time I come back in November, two of my best friends will have left New York. Lina is moving to Providence to be with her husband; Leslie is going to grad school in Boston. During the past two years, both of them have been my family here, friends I can admit horrible, embarrassing things to, because I know they love me. For awhile, I felt bitter about losing my friends, but now, I feel lucky about the time we had together. We met in high school, went to different colleges in the Northeast, and both of them having serious wanderlust, there have been years where one is in Haiti, another in Paris, then in Italy, then in Mexico. We never expected to live in the same city again, all at the same time. In addition to all the substantive, meaningful ways they are wonderful friends, they are also good people to have over for dinner. I can feel free to experiment, I can feel free to say, \"Fuck it,\" at the last minute and get take-out. And if I do cook, I know they will eat with gusto.Last night, we gathered at my place for a casual Thai dinner. In planning the menu, I started with one of my staples, Thai green curry made with store-bought green curry paste. Some of my friends in San Francisco took a beginner's Thai cooking class with Kasma Loha-unchit, and when they shared what they had learned about making green curry, I was amazed at how much more intense and bright the flavors were than 90% of the green curries I've had in restaurants. In the beginner's class, Kasma just recommends certain brands; the more advanced classes learn how to make the pastes from scratch. I love her strong, opnionated tone. It's very comforting when you're staring at a shelf of products in an unfamiliar language.The recipe for green curry is very simple and adaptable. I've substituted fish for pork, and last night, I substituted DiPaola's turkey thighs which were in my freezer. Sometimes, I use eggplant and zucchini, sometimes I add green beans, whatever vegetables look good and fresh. The key, I think, is to follow the steps at the beginning: frying up the cream of the coconut milk first until the oil bubbles at the edges and separates and frying the curry paste in the coconut cream to release the fragrant flavors. My friends emphasized tasting as we went along, and it's a fascinating way to see how the flavors balance and change as each ingredient is added. When you first fry up the curry paste, it should be intensely flavored and too salty. When you add the palm sugar (I used regular sugar last night), the curry almost seems to get spicier because it takes on a different note. Adding the slivered Thai chilis at the end adds another dimension to the spiciness. It's amazing how many different ways a sauce can be hot.For a long time, I was intimidated by Thai food because the unfamiliar ingredients just overwhelmed me. But once you buy the staples, most of them keep very well, and Thai green curry easily becomes something you can whip up on a weeknight with stuff that's already in your kitchen. In New York, the Thai grocer at Mosco St. and Mott St. in Chinatown is wonderful. It's a small store, packed with almost all of Kasma's recommended brands, as well as fresh ingredients like Thai basil, the adorable round Thai green eggplants, Thai chilis, lime leaves, galangal and lemongrass. They're also very nice. (And you can get 5 dumplings for $1 at Fried Dumpling next door.) As I walked back to the office through Chinatown, I started to imagine other dishes I could add to our dinner. I stopped at one of the fish markets on Canal and bought a pound of squid. Calamari is cheap, delicious, and so much easier to cook than you would think, and it freezes well, too. I looked at this recipe and that one, and then just riffed on them. I sliced up the squid, prepped all the ingredients, and sauteed it with some fish sauce, chopped ginger, chopped garlic, slivered Thai chilis, and thinly sliced red onion right after the girls walked in, then dressed it with lime juice on a bed of mint. I also had a big bag of green beans in the fridge, and found this easy recipe online, which basically just called for a big dab of red curry paste. Looking at the recipe now, I see I forgot to add the sugar. Oops. I thought something was missing.Leslie brought beer, Lina brought strawberries and passionfruit sorbet. I cut up some mangos, and we just sat and talked about our day and funny memories and how we would love to live in a commune together and trips we might take next year. Nothing out of the ordinary, and exactly what I love about our friendship.

Tonight was one of those nights I was really glad to be eating alone. Fort Greene Park's Greenmarket, despite being small in the summer and miniscule in the winter, has a very nice fish stand where they sell a surprising range of stuff, from tender calamari to mussels and clams, as well as several kinds of fish fillets and whole fish, all at very reasonable prices. I'm very fond of seafood, but it's definitely a weak spot in my cooking repertoire because I have a deathly fear of overcooked fish. Unfortunately, tonight was not the night that I suddenly blossomed into a fabulous fish chef. I wanted to do a simple pan-grilled fish with chermoula sauce, from Claudia Roden's recipe in \"The New Book of Middle Eastern Food.\" But since I'm generally suspicious of fillets, I decided a whole striped bass, just over a pound, would be a good substitute for the cod or hake fillets she recommends. The chermoula sauce itself was delicious, to the point that I kept dipping a spoon into it and getting intense raw garlic breath, another good reason to be eating alone. So easy, another food processor wonder--I just whirled 1/2 cup of cilantro, 4 garlic cloves, 1 t. of cumin, 1 t. of paprika, 6 T. of olive oil, and 3 T. of wine vinegar (or lemon juice). (Next time, I might use a bit less garlic.)I then let the fish marinate in half the sauce while I did my laundry, reserving the other half for serving. The problems began when I tried to actually grill the damn thing. I was so excited to use the other side of my reversible grill/griddle, but I didn't heat it enough before laying the fish on. Then, I was so scared of overcooking it, I turned it too soon, ripping the skin off completely, and then I turned it too early again on the other side. I ended up just cooking the top layer on each side, leaving the insides translucent and gray. I didn't even realize what was wrong until I scraped away the top layer and then couldn't get the rest of the fish to fully flake away from the bone. For a moment, I even wondered if this fish had an alien skeletal structure. So stupid. I ended up throwing it back in the pan to finish cooking it through, ending up with a mauled-looking whole fish missing its skin and top layer of flesh, but still edible. I got impatient and started tearing at it with my fingers, even gouging out the tender little cheeks. In the end, the fish was a mess, bones and bits all over the place. I didn't look too good either. Despite all the abuse, the flavor was great. Bass is such a tasty fish, and in the end, I didn't overcook it. The chermoula sauce didn't overpower it either, as I'd feared it might. And with some bulgur and chickpea salad and some halved radishes, it made a very fresh, spring dinner. And since I don't have a pretty picture of my dinner, here's a picture of some of the stunning tulips I saw this weekend at the Brooklyn Botanical Garden.

Leslie is one of my favorite people to have over for a meal. She's appreciative and also not stupid. Some people are impressed just that you've cooked something, anything. Leslie has standards, and when she says, \"I think these are the best pancakes I've ever had,\" I feel justifiably proud.To be sure, the recipe is not my creation. I did a quick Google search this morning before she came over, and found Bette's buttermilk pancakes from a May 1999 issue of the San Francisco Chronicle. And I think my new griddle did a lot of good, too, though I'm still learning to respond to its heat-holding powers. The little pancakes just sizzled up so beautifully as they were dropped onto the griddle.But more importantly, they were as delicious as they were beautiful. They were actually light, with a tender, just slightly sweet flavor. I love pancakes, but I almost never order them because they're often insipidly doughy and they land with a leaden thud in your stomach. And I rarely get to eat them at home because you can only divide a batter by so much, and even I cannot eat 10 pancakes for breakfast. I served the pancakes with little patties I made out of DiPaola's turkey sausage from the Fort Greene Greenmarket, which again amazed Leslie, who didn't believe turkey could be so deliciously fatty. It was a truly bounteous weekend of breakfasts. In addition to \"the best pancakes ever\" on Sunday, I had the most satisfying brunch of fried eggs, \"Moroccan-style\" on Saturday. After a 6-mile run, I couldn't imagine a better place to be than sitting in my sunny kitchen with some crispy fried eggs, dotted with deeply spicy harissa and anchovy fillets, a warm pita, and good coffee in my little white cup and saucer. I'm a very lucky girl.

My sister and I like to play a game where one poses a question to the other, \"Noodles or rice?\" \"Chocolate or vanilla?\" \"Cilantro or mint?\" Any pair of foods or flavors, with the understanding that you cannot have both, but must choose only one to eat for the rest of your life. Fun game, no? For me, the question of noodles or rice is easy--noodles forever. Most Korean people I know feel a strange sense of emptiness if they go more than a day without eating rice, and I admit I feel that way occasionally as well, but the thought of giving up naengmyun, soba, ramen, udon, pho, chow mein, all the gazillion types of pasta, it's just no contest.Last night, Lina, Leslie, and I decided to go see the Radical Lace and Subversive Knitting exhibit at the Museum of Art and Design in midtown. Leslie is the most anal and exact one of us three (and the only trained pastry chef), but she was the most frightened by the precision and concentration required for some of the pieces we saw. Probably the most awesome, in the most literal sense of the word, was the one of three large floor-to-ceiling panels of black rubber or plastic into which the artist had painstakingly cut tiny diamonds and slits to create an intricate pattern of lace using an EXACTO KNIFE. My God.Leslie had made clear from the beginning that she was only coming for the dinner we would have afterwards at Menchanko-Tei. When I suggested that maybe Lina might want to eat something other than ramen, her work-lunch staple, Leslie got this sad little catch in her voice as she said, \"We can eat somewhere else if you like.\" Menchanko-Tei makes me so happy. There's always so much more food than I think I can eat, but I just can't stop. I got the \"chigae miso menchanko,\" which came in a earthy, spicy broth that reminded me of Korean daenjang chigae, or fermented bean paste stew, albeit with a Japanese touch. That kind of salty, deep flavor is so addictive, more addictive than any bag of potato chips. Lina got the \"hiyashi chuka,\" a big bowl of chilled noodles in a bit of broth with chicken, ginger, egg, mushroom and lettuce; Leslie the \"tsuke men,\" also chilled noodles with thick slices of roasted pork, though the spicy miso broth came separately for dipping. I'd never tried the \"tsuke men\" before, and I loved how it combined what I love about cold soba with the flavor of ramen noodles. Their noodles are seriously toothsome. After dinner, we wandered west to Hell's Kitchen looking for a drink or some tea. We managed to find Kyotofu, a new Japanese dessert restaurant on Ninth Avenue. The restaurant was a pleasant surprise, with the sort of modern decor that manages to be also warm. The two desserts we shared, the black sesame sweet tofu and the soy-milk rice pudding with goji berries and ginger, were very subtle, maybe too subtle. Our decaf coffees definitely overpowered them, though I was very fond of the beautiful swirls in my cup and saucer. I'm sure they would have paired better with one of their teas, and I scraped away every bit of both puddings, but I don't think I'll be rushing back, though I am tempted to try their mochi desserts. I think I was hoping more for Chinese-style tofu desserts, which are sweeter and heartier. I did love the little cubes of kiwi jelly they brought with our check.I might also have gotten overly distracted by the couple sitting next to us. The man would not let his date get a word in edgewise, despite telling her he thought she was very beautiful. I guess he just wanted to look at her.

I've been craving salads lately. It's getting warmer, beautiful greens and vegetables are coming into the markets, and frankly, now that I'm 30, my body is no longer able to absorb with metabolic abandon everything I throw into my mouth.A simple salad of bright, flavorful greens dressed in a perfect vinaigrette and nothing else is a beautiful thing, and I'm lucky to have access to farmers' markets with greens that are fresher and tastier than anything in supermarkets, even the Coop. But five minutes after a big bowl of the best greens ever, I'm usually still hungry. So for one-dish meals, I normally rely on salads that have greens as a base, but are loaded up with nuts, cheese, and tangy-sweet vegetables or fruits. I might add an anchovy or two, some canned tuna, or a hard-boiled egg, but I never make those monstrous salads you see at overly expensive chains, with fried chicken and corn and tortilla chips and enough food to feed a small village. Roasted beets take a lot of time on a Sunday afternoon but no work and keep well in the fridge. My sister taught me how to \"supreme\" oranges and grapefruit, cutting the north and south poles of skin off, and then cutting away at the skin in strips to remove the pith, leaving only the sweet flesh. In the winter, pomegranate seeds go in almost everything, and sometimes thin, small slices of apple or pear. I'm partial to little cubes of semi-hard cheese, like halloumi or ricotta salata, that add bites of salty flavor, and I always have pine nuts, walnuts, pistachios, or some combination in my freezer. I'm not philosophically opposed to bottled dressing, but I never buy it since I've had some nasty surprises and it's so easy to make a vinaigrette. My overall goal is to balance the flavors I love best: some peppery notes, a little sweetness, a little tartness, some creamy texture, and good old salt. Every once in awhile, I end up with a not-so-harmonious melange, but I usually avoid that by sticking to ingredients that make regional sense.So I was really surprised when I saw the ingredient list for Fennel, Avocado, and Mint Salad with Pistachio-Caper Dressing on Chow, from the chef at Pure Food and Wine, one of those crazy raw food places. In addition to all the ingredients in the name of the salad itself, the recipe calls for a good amount of sun-dried tomatoes, lemon zest, and chopped parsley. It was maybe vaguely Mediterranean, except what were the avocados doing there? It was a combination I'd never considered, even though almost every one of the ingredients is a staple in my kitchen. (Well, I didn't have pistachio oil but I did have walnut.) It felt more labor-intensive than my usual salads, but it wasn't really. I had to boil some water in my kettle to reconstitute the sun-dried tomatoes, but while they were soaking, I didn't chop much more than I normally do. It was almost 9:30 at night, and I was starving, but I wanted to try to plate it in layers as recommended, even though I was the only one to whom it would be presented. So in between bites of leftover pita and Moroccan-style hummus, I carefully laid a layer of thinly sliced avocado in a radiant circle. I piled on some thinly sliced fennel tossed with the sun-dried tomatoes and lemon-caper-nut vinaigrette, followed by a clumsy sprinkling of chopped mint and parsley. How are you supposed to sprinkle herbs with damp, avocado-stained fingers? Again, avocado, fennel, herbs; avocado, fennel, herbs. Finally, I ate it. Wow. Lemony tart, with the sweetness of sun-dried tomatoes, the crunch of fennel, the fragrance of the mint and parsley, the brine of the capers, the creaminess of the avocado, everything I want in a salad and more. And even better, unlike soggy green salads, the leftovers were almost as good the next day.

It was an intense weekend of food for me, if somewhat laid-back in terms of cooking. Friday, my friend Leslie came over for drinks and snacks. I had originally planned for crudites and other pantry antipasti, but I got all worked up sitting in the office thinking about spiced pork meatballs with guacomole that I rushed to the Coop right after work to get groceries for a bigger, Mexican-flavored meal. The Coop was a madhouse, though, and I only got home seconds before Leslie arrived, too exhausted to carry out my grand plans. So we had a slap-dash dinner of meatballs, guacamole, store-bought salsa and chips, and some quick quesadillas with monterey jack cheese and spicy yellow peppers. Leslie is, thankfully, the kind of friend I can ask to grate cheese and chop vegetables, and it turned out prosecco goes surprisingly well with semi-Mexican food. Easy and satisfying, and I got to use my new griddle.Saturday, I went to a dim sum birthday brunch at Dim Sum Go Go at 11 am, followed quickly by a daytime wedding at 1. By the time I left the wedding at 6, I was so stuffed (and tipsy) I could barely see straight. I waddled home and went almost immediately to bed.On Sunday, a big group of friends and friends of friends gathered at Spicy & Tasty for lunch. We were overwhelmed by the menu--what was \"luscious duck\"? \"Enhanced pork\"? How much should we order? What to do?I felt like I had to take charge, since I had organized the outing, but to be honest, I felt too nervous to order what I truly would have ordered if I had been alone and had four stomachs. We got two orders of dan dan noodles, one of my favorite things to eat in the whole wide world; two orders of cold sesame noodles; two orders of tea-smoked duck; eggplant in garlic sauce; enhanced pork; seaweed with garlic; beef with peppers; and an almost disgustingly bland soup of soft bean curd and zucchini, our attempt to order something we had seen at another table that looked a lot tastier. (If I had been alone, I probably would have also ordered jellyfish, maybe some tripe or tendon, and some more cold, spicy dishes.)The dan dan noodles were perfect, with that strange, subtle flavor so unique to Sichuan food. The \"enhanced pork\" and the beef with peppers were big hits, as was the tea-smoked duck. And when the bill came, we were stuffed, but we seriously considered ordering more so we could help the restaurant pay its rent--$11 per person! I'm dying to go back. By Sunday evening, I was exhausted from all the eating I'd done. I could have skipped dinner, I suppose, but that didn't really occur to me. I knew it would be good to have a refreshing salad, something raw and crunchy and clean. I already had all the ingredients for the jicama-melon salad I hadn't gotten around to making on Friday: jicama, cantaloupe, blood oranges, cilantro, and fresh limes. (No pomegranate seeds for me, since they're a winter fruit in NY.) I threw everything together, let it sit for an hour in the fridge as recommended, and ate a big bowl while watching a PBS documentary on dogs. You know you have serious dog-fever if you find yourself cooing to the TV by yourself. But the salad was good! Next time, I'll use a little less lime and hope for a riper melon.

For our Tuesday night book club dinner, I had offered to make dessert, and although I wasn't constrained by war-time parameters, I was constrained by my general laziness towards dessert. (Now I am going to get on my soap box.) I think dessert should be simple. My sister and my friend Leslie, former pastry chefs, would probably disagree, but after a big meal, the best thing to eat is a little something sweet, something to round out the meal, to make you feel particularly happy and cozy inside, but not something that's going to weigh you down and make you forget the good taste of everything you ate before dessert. I love sugar and I love cream, so I am definitely advocating more than a piece of fruit, but for me, the point of dinner is not dessert, it's dinner. I've always found dessert-focused restaurants slightly nauseating--a tasting menu of desserts, are you kidding me? So there are a few desserts I make over and over: sorbet or ice cream with maybe a little nut cookie (from Deborah Madison's \"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone\"); galleygirl's pear tart which is moistened with the juices of the ripest, most fragrant pears you can find; and a simple summer fruit cake, which I also first found recommended on Chowhound. (I rarely make chocolate desserts because actual chocolate always tastes so much better to me than chocolate-flavored anything.)For our book club, I trotted out the summer fruit cake once again, and again, it did not disappoint. The recipe is so easy that I mixed the ingredients at 9 pm on Monday night and had it baked and cooling by the time I went to bed at 10:30. I had all the ingredients just sitting in my pantry, with a bag of frozen strawberries in the freezer just for occasions like this. I've made this cake with all kinds of fruit. Raspberries are particularly good, cranberries very pretty for holiday dinners, and plums arranged in concentric circles are really beautiful. I like to run the cake under the broiler for 30 seconds at the second, so the top gets really caramelized, and then dust with some powdered sugar and serve with whipped cream. I ran out of powdered sugar, but it didn't matter, it was still delicious.

I agree -- simple desserts are better (although I feel like people expect more of me so I sometimes make something a little fancier). Didn't I make elementary school cupcakes for your 30th birthday? But I also think a nice dessert helps to leave a good impression of the meal you cooked (especially for those times your \"experiment\" of an entree doesn't quite work out).

We've been at war for over four years now. I first read MFK Fisher's \"How to Cook a Wolf\" 10 years ago, when I tore through the one-volume compilation, \"The Art of Eating,\" during a particularly boring summer in suburban New Jersey. A lot of the children's books I read growing up also had World War II in the background, nothing really intrusive or disturbing, but the characters were always talking about buying victory bonds or hoarding sugar ration cards or collecting tin for the army. So Fisher's advice to those who were scrimping and sacrificing didn't seem odd, just very quaint and earnest, and not something that would ever be relevant in my lifetime. So now we are at war, but you would never know it to look at what we eat and how we eat. Food and foodie culture have come to mean so much more than nourishment, and even more than status and money. Pork and other fatty meats feel like an obsession in New York, and people seem almost proud, rather than just happy, to eat at a place like Momofuku or Fette Sau, where vegetarians and dietary restrictions in general are shunned. In some ways, New York's trendy love of unrestrained food is part of a general movement towards slow food, the kinds of food our grandparents ate, before people got obsessed with calories, sugar, and carbs. But in other ways, especially in a city like New York, the food trend of absolutely no restraints feels weirdly macho, with each eater out to show they can eat more, in quantity and quality, than anybody else. It's silly of me to complain, since I'm not the kind of eater this culture is mocking. I mean, I go around declaring that vegans must be bad in bed. But reading \"How to Cook a Wolf,\" and eating a meal inspired by it, has been making me think about the kind of satisfaction Fisher describes, and whether the culture I live in knows that kind of satisfaction.At one point, MFK Fisher describes a friend who is very poor but still very fond of giving dinner parties. At Sue's \"wolf-dodging\" dinners, she would serve \"little bowls of chopped fresh and cooked leaves,\" a \"common bowl of rice,\" giving you a \"soup dish full of sliced catcus leaves and lemon-berries and dried crumbled kelp.\" The food was good, not because \"she wandered at night hunting for leaves and berries; it [was] that she cared enough to invite her friends to share them with her, and could serve them, to herself alone or to a dozen guests, with the sureness that she was right.\" MFK Fisher is the last person to suggest eating is an unimportant activity. But what she does suggest, which would be heresy in our foodie-culture, is that what we eat may not be quite so important.\"How to Cook a Wolf\" was our reading for this month's book club dinner. (It's true, I belong to yet another food club, a book club that focuses on books about food and wine.) Maaike, the host, decided to serve a simple meal in keeping with our reading, costing less than $25. She was almost embarrassed to serve it: a hot, heaping bowl of spaghetti with butter, cheese, and fresh sage she couldn't stop herself from adding; some peas and baby onions from a frozen bag; and big wedges of iceberg lettuce. Obviously, I am not one to advocate deprivation for deprivation's sake. Just because our president doesn't call on us to sacrifice in any way for a war only he believes in doesn't mean I'm going to self-ration my sugar to feel morally superior. But Maaike's \"Wolf\"-inspired dinner was as satisfying as MFK Fisher promises. There was red wine and good conversation and lots of laughter. The food was good; it didn't need to be anything more.

The first time I tried kibbeh was at a celebratory dinner at a Palestinian restaurant in Paterson, New Jersey. My clients, a couple who had just successfully fought deportation, wanted to take me out, and they ordered a feast. There were six of us, the two of them, their three young children, and me, but we still couldn't finish the enormous platter of grilled meats with rice, yogurt cheese, and hummus. We did, however, manage to eat all of the kibbeh, those delicious little fried footballs of bulgur and lamb. I think I will always associate my love of kibbeh, the crisp, crackly outer shell contrasting with the soft, spiced meat and pine nuts inside, with this family and their generosity and love. At the end of the meal, the father inexplicably stopped at a big grocery store, told us he'd be really quick, and came back bearing an economy-size carton of yogurt. It was the biggest carton of yogurt I had ever seen. He wanted me to have it, so I could make my own labneh, or yogurt cheese. He was very serious as he instructed me to line a strainer with paper towels and let the yogurt just sit in the colander overnight. And he was right, it really is as easy as that, and with a little olive oil and salt, it becomes so much more than yogurt.I've been obsessing about Mediterranean food all year. Clifford Wright's massive tome, \"A Mediterranean Feast\" has been sitting next to my bed for the past two months. Every other night or so, I read a couple more pages and fall asleep hungry. It's fascinating to see how history and religion have intersected with food culture all around the Mediterranean, the foods that Spain absorbed from the Arab world, what the Ottomans brought to Turkey, how taken medieval Italy was with those exotic spices of the Middle East. There's something not quite satisfying about this book, perhaps because all the nuggets of information and all the recipes feel somewhat disjointed, but I definitely can't complain about lack of information.And as I've previously noted, I've been cooking a lot from Paula Wolfert's cookbooks all winter. More recently, the cookbook of the month all April on the Chowhound Home Cooking board has been Claudia Roden's \"Arabesque,\" which gave me a great excuse to check out \"Arabesque\" and her earlier book, \"The New Book of Middle Eastern Food\" from the Brooklyn Public Library. (Incidentally, the Brooklyn library has an impressive cookbook collection. I'd almost rather keep it a secret, so they're all always available for me.) As much as I love kibbeh, it seemed intimidatingly difficult. Paula Wolfert's list of 50 varieties of kibbeh in \"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean,\" and even her detailed instructions on how to form those tasty footballs scared me. I felt like I needed a Lebanese grandmother. So when Claudia Roden provided an easy one-layer baked version of kibbeh, it was irresistible. And the recipe, in her classic simple style, is very easy; the food processor does more work than you:Kibbeh base:2/3 c. fine-grain bulgur1 medium onion, cut in quarters1 lb. lean leg of lamb1/2 t. saltblack pepper1 t. cinnamon2 T. vegetable oilTopping:1 pound onions, sliced3 T. extra virgin olive oil1/4-1/3 c. pine nutssalt and black pepper1/2 t. ground cinnamonpinch of ground allspice1/2-1 T. pomegranate molasses (optional)Rinse the bulgur in a fine sieve under cold running water and drain well. Puree the onion in the food processor; add the mealt, salt, pepper, and cinnamon and blend to a paste. Add the bulgur and blend to a smooth, soft paste. With your hand, press the paste into the bottom of an oiled, round, shallow baking dish or tart dish (I used a springform pan), about 11 inches in diameters. Flatten and smooth the top and rub with 2 T. of oil. With a pointed knife, cut into 6 wedges and run the knife around the edges. Bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for about 30 minutes.While the base is baking, fry the sliced onions in olive oil until golden brown. Add the pine nuts and stir until lightly colored. Add the salt, pepper, cinnamon, allspice, and pomegranate molasses. Cook, stirring for a minute or two.Serve the kibbeh with the topping spread over the top.Unfortunately, this recipe didn't meet my deep desire for homemade kibbeh. The edges didn't get nearly as crispy as those delicious footballs, and I had to admit to myself that a good part of the reason I love the oval kibbeh is that it's fried. It was good, just not great.The rest of the meze were so straightforward, recipes seem almost unwarranted. I made an orange-olive-onion salad with walnut oil, cumin, paprika, and a little white wine vinegar since I had run out of lemons. I had about 1.5 cups of yogurt I had strained, per my client's instructions, just sitting in my fridge, and I only had to add some cucumbers, crushed garlic, and a bit of mint from my garden to make cacik. I also had maybe 2/3 cup of canned chickpeas that needed to be eaten, and after quick glance at Paula Wolfert's \"Slow Cooking of the Mediterranean,\" I blended them up with some cayenne, olive oil, salt, and tamarind (substituting for lemon juice) to make something that approximated Wolfert's Moroccan hummus.I loved the loose and easy way all these dishes came together. I had a friend visiting from out of town for the past couple of days who only left at 4 pm on Sunday, but I managed to do two loads of laundry, catch up by phone with a friend in Napa, and have dinner ready by 7 pm, when my friends Mimi and Alex showed up to help prevent me from massive and immediate weight gain.It was such a beautiful night, we had a picnic on my deck. And we finished with homemade honeydew sorbet, made from half a melon leftover from my weekday breakfasts. I was particularly proud of the sorbet because I just winged it, pureeing the melon, adding a little lemon juice for character, and several tablespoons of sugar. Final kibbeh words of wisdom from Paula Wolfert's \"The Cooking of the Eastern Mediterranean\":\"We who have grown up with Kibbeh, and who continuously argue about how it ought to taste, smell, feel, and look, equate the making of it with the indestructability of our will to go on, to live in faith, optimism, and thanks.\" - Barbara Thomas Isaac, \"Everyday Delights of Lebanese-Syrian Cooking\"

\"So one of my co-workers, her engagement ring is this 3.3-karat Harry Winston. It's so pure it has some XX rating, something beyond the usual rating.\"\"That must be, like, six figures.\"\"Yeah, his family has a lot of money...I don't care, you know.\"It takes a lot for me to be willing to listen to this kind of conversation, namely, a whole BBQ-ed pig. Such a pig, plus a whole extra butt, can only be consumed at a party, and even though I knew I'd have to listen to people talk about how Cartier watches are just too common, I knew I might never again have the chance to see and taste such a pig. My friend Lina and her roommate organized the birthday party for their husband and fiance, respectively, and all of them have a fine appreciation for pork. Daisy May will actually deliver a whole pig with corn bread, several sides, and pineapple (when watermelon isn't in season) to your home with paper plates, forks and knives, and handy wipes. They like to call it the \"Big Pig Gig\". So convenient and so New York.When it arrived, the entire party of 20 or so people just stood around taking pictures, it was such a spectacle. We had to line the kitchen counters with aluminum foil because the counters in this luxury condo are made of some sort of soft stone that stains easily. (Retarded, I know.) But it did make for a celebratory, shiny bed.This being a Korean party, kimchi was requisite. The sides were good, if not exhilarating: creamed spinach, coleslaw, beans, and creamed corn.So I was impressed. The pig was moist, juicy, in places even silky. The butt came with a gravy that wasn't so exciting, but it just fell apart at the slightest touch. It was definitely more than a gimmick. But more and more, I'm realizing BBQ is one of those few dishes that I'm really only interested in eating if it blows my mind. I like my meat to be interacting with other flavors, not just its own fatty juices. I'm sure it's heresy in some parts, but I like sauce. And this is definitely going to offend someone somewhere, but I loved the BBQ I had at Jack's Bar-B-Que in Nashville during a friend's bachelorette party weekend. What can I say, I like sauce and I'm not ashamed of it!I guess my only real criticism is that I wish the pig had come with sauce. Maybe something got lost in the delivery, because Peter Meehan at the New York Times got sauce, and he only ordered half a pig.I'm not quite sure the pig made up for having to smile at mindless inanity, but at least now I won't yearn and wonder, \"What would it be like to order a whole BBQ-ed pig?\" Oh God, did I just mentally prostitute myself for pork?

Spring chose a good time to come back to New York. After a week of unseasonably cold weather, Friday was sunny and Saturday, today, is downright hot. Everyone is radiant. Erin, my roommate from San Francisco, is in town, and we walked all the way to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden today to look at the cherry blossoms. Even though I have been on a spending freeze, and virtuously resisted the adorable little herbs at the farmers' market, I couldn't stop myself from buying a big potted dahlia. Spring also means sorrel is back at the farmers' markets. The first time I tasted sorrel, at the Alemany market in San Francisco, I almost couldn't believe it. It seemed so unreal, this bright, green leaf that tastes so intensely lemony. I'm always looking for new ways to cook with it, to see what strange and delicious things it can do. Deborah Madison's \"The Savory Way\" is definitely one of my best cookbook buys this year. I snatched it for $5 during the madhouse of the James Beard Foundation's biennial cookbook tag sale, which makes it even more precious. Whenever I use her recipes, I end up with food that is fresh, delicious, and healthy without being self-consciously so. For example, the tomato, fennel, potato with saffron stew calls for a big blob of garlic mayonnaise, and this lovely sorrel and lentil soup happily incorporates a tablespoon or more of heavy cream. And with every added ingredient, you can really taste the change, the added dimension. It's funny, the recipes feel only incidentally vegetarian--the word \"vegetarian\" is nowhere on the cover, and the first mention of it in the inside flap is to proclaim, \"These brilliant recipes are not just for vegetarians.\" Heh, heh, apologetic vegetarianism is my kind of vegetarianism.Deborah Madison is right to warn you that the soup isn't pretty, because it isn't. But she's also right in saying that it's absurdly simple, and the more I ate it, the more I loved it. It's almost miraculous how flavorful a handful of lentils and water can be, and the sorrel, as it turned olive green and murky, kept its sharp, citrus tone. I would probably reduce the amount of water to 1 quart next time, but that's the only modification I would make. The recipe is so easy that the summary that follows is from memory:1/2 cup of lentils1 small red onion, diced small1 bay leaf1/2 t. salt1.5 quarts of water3 handfuls of sorrel, shredded1-2 T. of heavy creamCombine lentils, onion, bay leaf, salt and water. Bring to a boil and simmer for about 30 minutes, until the lentils are completely soft. Puree half the lentils. Add the sorrel and cook for 10 more minutes. Stir in the cream, add salt to taste, and serve with freshly ground pepper.That's it, a great Saturday spring lunch.

Damn, I keep forgetting to take my digital camera with me to dinner. This photo, alas, is not of the delicious sauerkraut and cheese pierogies my friend Magda served at the April meeting of our Brooklyn Supper Club. I stole it from Road Food. Magda's pierogies had beautiful, dark brown bits of caramelized onions on top, and her mountain of pierogies was only one of several dishes that weighed down her table.In law school, a group of friends who were planning to move to California after graduation started the \"California Dining Club.\" It just started somehow, one person had a dinner party and another person offered to host the next one, and it just snowballed in the most delicious way. When I moved into a NY apartment with a real eat-in kitchen, I knew I wanted to start a Brooklyn supper club, and happily, one of the old \"California\" members had also moved to NY, and I had a couple of other friends who were happy to get together once a month to catch up and eat a big meal. We've had some people \"try out\" and not come back, we've had one person bring in her fiance and friends, but the core has managed to absorb and hold steady. I expect that it'll be going strong while I'm in Oaxaca, waiting for me to come back and test out my mole-making skills. (I recently joined another supper club, that originated from Chowhound's Outer Boroughs board, and though it seems to be defunct now, Magda accused me of being a \"supper club whore.\" It's true, I belong to more than one dining club, but how else is a single girl going to find enough people to eat all her cooking?)Last night's dinner was a triumph. While we chatted about Magda's meat-eating brand of vegetarianism, and HIV prevention by circumcision, and the men's colored underwear article from the Times, we ate homemade pickled herring, accompanied by baked fingerling potatoes, pickled mushrooms, and pickled cucumbers to start. We had stuffed our faces with abandon, assuming there could not be more food, when Magda told us the next course was ready: a big platter of braised leeks in vinegary sauce with chopped hard-boiled eggs, an enormous bowl of roasted beets with goat cheese, and another giant platter of roasted asparagus. And it still wasn't over: the aforementioned pierogies followed, in the biggest ceramic roaster I've ever seen, and a ricotta-orange-pine nut torte made by Jeremy, Magda's fiance. And she sent me home with leftovers.

It's been a long time, too long, but last night, I remembered how much I love nachos in all their unauthentic glory.Every other week, I meet a friend for dinner, for me to practice Korean and for her to practice English. We've been meeting for over a year now, and it's taken us a surprisingly long time to figure out exactly what kind of venue we need. We usually meet for two hours, so we can't go anywhere we'll be rushed out, but we also want to keep things cheap, and cheap food in NY almost necessarily goes hand in hand with quick turnover of tables. A few weeks ago, though, I had a craving for a good hamburger and we discovered that the perfect venue for us is a laid-back bar on a Monday night. We sat at Old Town Bar for two hours with interruptions from the easygoing waitresses only for refills of water, and had excellent burgers. Last night, I chose South's Bar, just a few blocks from my office, where I knew I would find a similarly easygoing atmosphere with solid, good food. (Their website looks new, and it makes the bar look spiffier and less lovable than it actually is.)But to my heart's surprise, I also found a renewed love of nachos. Mmmm! Sadly, I have no photos, only memories of the mountain of chips and toppings that came to our table. And for $7! I stopped eating nachos around the same time I realized TGI Friday's was not good food. When there were heirloom tomatoes and levain breads and untold artisanal cheeses to discover in my post-high school New York-New Haven-San Francisco circuit, I forgot about the pleasures of canned jalapenos and sour cream. South's version is particularly rich. It's not just a layer of chips with stuff on top. The kitchen actually weaves layers of chips between the black beans, the jarred salsa, and the cheese that you know is real because it gets hard. The mountain is topped with a big dollop of sour cream and an equally big dollop of guacamole, accompanied with a generous sprinkling of big, juicy, sliced jalapeno peppers, that provide the kind of familiar, vinegary spiciness that can only come from canned ingredients. It is very very good.And there's something, I don't know, weirdly heartwarming to me about an Irish pub in New York serving Mexican nachos. Sure, nachos aren't really Mexican, but South's isn't really Irish, and who can turn up their nose at a lovely mess of chips and dips?(Apparently, nachos were invented by Ignacio \"Nacho\" Anaya. Yeah, uh huh.)

I should've just taken your word for it, but I just had to look at that Nacho Anaya link. Hilarious. Now that you've reconnected with your love of them, what do you say we both start observing International Day of the Nacho (october 19)? Oh and those clams below look so delicious.

It's been raining all day, big, fat, rain drops coupled with a fierce wind. It was the perfect day to lie in bed and read all day--sadly, that is not what I did. Since I had to go out anyway, I got a few groceries and made a proper dinner, another Sunday experiment.There must be an Asian woman in the neighborhood who buys a dozen clams every weekend, because the fish guy at the Fort Greene farmers' market seemed to think I was her. A dozen clams IS sort of a funny quantity, but such a good one for me. I bought them on a whim, along with my usual turkey thighs from DiPalo's, and realized I had almost everything I needed \"chicken and clams\" from Bittman's \"The Best Recipes in the World.\" It's precisely what it sounds like, chicken with clams, and some sauteed onions, garlic, chicken stock, and parsley. Skinless turkey thighs were not a good substitute, because they did get a little dry, but oh, I loved the clams. The soupy, briny sauce, I ended up spooning directly into my mouth with an enormous ladle. A dozen clams supplies a surprising amount of meat, and for $5, a nice weekend treat.I've been roasting potatoes in the way Marcella Hazan recommends for bluefish Genoese style--thinly sliced and tossed with olive oil, garlic, and parsley, in a cast-iron pan. You end up with all these lovely, crispy bits.And one of my favorite salads, roasted beets with haloumi cheese, drizzled with olive oil and lemon juice, with a little parsley for color.If only I could stay in bed all day tomorrow.

Wow! Great blog. And to think I found it through the Blogger tool bar. Food is always an interesting subject, but you need someone who can write well to make it truly compelling. And you're right, beer in the afternoon is a wonderful thing.

There's something so lovely about beer in the afternoon. Drinking at night is fine and often quite festive, but it's never as relaxing as drinking in the afternoon. It's more like having coffee or tea, a nice way to sit and watch the day go by, except time seems to slow down even more with booze. Maybe it feels healthier to have a buzz in bright sunshine? Leslie and I separately discovered how much we love drinking during the day, but once we found the other felt the same way, we declared it would be our new birthday tradition. We're particularly lucky to also share a love of schnitzel, spaetzle, wieners, and all the other things that go so well with beer in the afternoon. For her birthday last November, we went to Loreley on the Lower East Side. Since it was my birthday, I forced her to walk all the way to Avenue C in the East Village.Even though it was depressingly cold for April, the sun was shining like it was spring, and Zum Schneider felt warm and cheerful. We got there just as they were opening, and everyone seeemed to be in such a good mood. There were no crowds, no lines, just a couple of happy people chatting over full beer steins.The pretzel was very, very good, particularly with the excellent mustard. We also got the spaetzle plate with cheese, onions, and bacon, and the \"O'Batzda,\" which is very accurately described as a \"cheese spread of brie and blue cheese made w/ onions & beer.\" The weisswurst tasted just as they looked. Boiled and white. Solid food, all of it just as good as expected. My schneider weisse amber beer was smooth as smooth could be. It was a very meaty weekend. The night before, Sharon and I had had baby back ribs and chicken wings from Smoke Joint in my neighborhood. Her eyes lit up when I mentioned a barbecue place had opened in Fort Greene, so I couldn't say no, even though I knew we were going to Keen's Chophouse for dinner on Saturday. I owed her a steak dinner, and after almost a year of thinking about it, she was hungry for meat. Her recent trip to India only whetted her appetite for cow; she even had a nightmare that she was thwarted from eating her steak. I had their famous mutton chop, she had the sirloin. I thought the waiter's attitude towards us, two Asian women, changed markedly when we ordered two huge pieces of meat and asked for the scotch menu. The meat was intense. Very good, though i couldn't eat more than a third of that crazy mutton chop. A French couple sitting two tables away from us literally swiveled their heads as it came to our table. Sharon, impressively, finished her steak. As she put it, \"All you have to do is apply yourself.\"But I was the one who insisted that we have dessert, a butterscotch sundae. Next week, I am going to be vegetarian.

My sister had a bad oyster at The Spotted Pig and couldn't come to Prune for my birthday brunch, but she made it up to me by taking me out to Aburiya Kinnosuke, her favorite Japanese izakaya, for dinner on Wednesday night. Even though the food at an izakaya, a Japanese grill, is as far from pancakes and bloody Marys as you can get, Prune and Aburiya Kinnosuke share the same philosophy of caring about food that is honest and straightforward. Sure, presentation's important--how could the Japanese not care about presentation?--but it's never meant to distract from or cover up the clean taste of the food.Here's Mona squeezing her fresh grapefruit to pour into her shochu-soda cocktail. We initially hesitated about ordering the green salad, that it would be \"boring,\" but shame on us for doubting that Aburiya Kinnosuke would serve anything inferior. It was nothing more than advertised, a green salad with a mix of greens, broccoli, and cucumber, but with an intense freshness and crunch. We needed the raw salad to balance all the fuller flavors of the cooked food we had. Their homemade tofu comes unadorned. You add the salt, the grated ginger, and perfectly diced skinny scallions. I shoveled my share into my mouth, and ate most of Mona's, too.I got too excited and forgot to take pictures of the rest of the food. I wish I could show you the \"tsukune\" or grilled ground chicken with teriyaki sauce that we got from the robata grill. It comes on a paddle! We also got meaty grilled eringi mushrooms and the salmon with miso on houba leaf that comes on a little shichirin grill for your table. Thankfully, others on Flickr are taking photos of their meals at Aburiya Kinnosuke.And when I thought it couldn't get any better, we had dessert. Mona is very fond of their black sesame pudding, which are all words that thrill me, too, but we were intrigued by the \"red bean bavarois\" on the menu, and when we asked the waitress about it, she got the most genuine smile and exclaimed, \"It's delicious!\" She told us that there was a visiting chef who had put on the menu, and we would only have a small window of time to try it. It's the first time I've wanted to lick a dessert plate in awhile, to get every bit of the perfect, custardy, red bean goodness.THIS is the kind of restaurant I love best.

It's been a gluttonous weekend, but it's pretty much impossible for me not to devote Sunday night to cooking at this point. It seems like such a waste not to try something new, with all that lovely free time to chop and simmer. Tonight, well, I regret not inviting anyone to come eat with me, because truly, it was delicious, and I made successful mayonnaise for the first time to boot.Deborah Madison calls this a \"failed fisherman's soup,\" with all the elements of a bouillabaisse minus the fish. I had some frozen fluke I wanted to use, from my previous big fish, so I slipped in some pieces at the end, but I didn't bother making a fish stock and pretty much followed her recipe. What follows is a paraphrase:1.5 lbs red or yellow-fleshed potatoes 2 fennel bulbs1 pound ripe tomatoes, peeled and seeded, juice reserved or 2 cups whole canned tomatoessalt3-4 T. virgin olive oil1 large leek, white part only, finely diced1 large yellow onion, cut into wedges 1/2 in. thick2 garlic cloves, finely chopped1 t. herbes de Provence2-3 pinches of saffron threadsa large strip of orange zest, about 2 in. long2 bay leaves1 cup dry white wine 2 T. chopped parsley12 Nicoise, Gaeta or oil-cured black olives, pittedPeel the potatoes and slice them lengthwise into quarters or sixths. Trim the fennel and cut into wedges 1/2 in. thick. Cut the tomatoes into large, neat pieces.Boil the potatoes for 5 minutes. Remove the potatoes but reserve the water.Warm the olive oil in a wide pan and add the leek, onion, garlic, herbs, a little salt, saffron, orange zest and bay leaves. Cook slowly over medium heat until the onions soften, about 6 minutes. Add the wine and reduce by half. Add tomatoes, potatoes, fennel, half the parsley and olives. Pour in enough of the potato water to cover and bring to boil. Simmer covered for about 35 minutes, until vegetables are tender. Or preheat oven to 375, cover loosely, and bake for about 1 hour. Garnish with remaining parsley and garlic mayonnaise.I've tried making mayonnaise before, and ended up with this harsh, viscous pudge. It was time to try again. This recipe is from Deborah Madison's \"Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.\" Whisk one egg yolk until it's thick, add one t. Dijon mustard, and 2-3 t. lemon juice or white wine vinegar. Add 3/4 c. peanut oil in drops at first, while whisking, and then in a steady stream after it's started to thicken. Then add salt and lemon juice to taste. I set my bowl on the counter with a towel coiled under it, and although I was too clumsy to really drip the oil drop by drop, it really worked. With some mashed up garlic, presto, it was garlic mayonnaise.It's amazing, I love tomatoes and I know I love tomatoes, but it's still a shock to me every time I eat something rich with tomatoes how sweetly delicious they are. This very simple soup, which is essentially vegetables and herbs, had so much bright flavor, and it just went over the top with a dollop of garlic mayonnaise.I wish I'd been hungrier so I could have eaten more, but I'd gone to Jackson Heights for lunch to have chilaquiles, enchiladas with mole poblano and more with some friends at Taqueria Coatzingo. Oh the woes of having only one stomach!

I turned 30 on March 30--my \"golden birthday\" according to my friends. To be honest, I wasn't so thrilled. An ex-boyfriend says I've been 30 my entire life, and in a way, it feels natural to finally be 30. But trying to make that day somehow more special, brighter than the days before and after, it's just the kind of pressure I don't need. Even choosing a place for a celebratory meal felt tiresome. As I get older--and become a better cook--I don't like eating out as much any more. It's hard for me to enjoy food that I could have cooked myself at home better and for less money, and I have less patience for food that tries too hard. So I was relieved when Lina and Leslie, my oldest friends, invited me to have dinner at Leslie's place. Spaghetti with clams--this is the kind of simple food that Leslie makes perfectly. The clams were juicy, clean and salty, the pasta just al dente. Lina and I agreed, it's a dish we love but never order in restaurants because it's often executed so poorly. And in classic Leslie-style, it was preceded by simple antipasti--fresh mozzarella balls; roasted eggplant, onions, and peppers; and crusty bread--and followed by a green salad and the lightest, most delicate cupcakes.The next morning, we went to Prune for brunch. We had to get there by 10 am to get seated in the first seating, and it was really too early to eat a big meal, but we made a good effort, starting with bloody Marys. I'm quite proud of my strong stomach and its ability to eat pickled herring and fennel early on a Saturday morning. It came with a \"side\" of beer.Prune is the kind of restaurant I would open if I were ever to own a restaurant--simple, satisfying food cooked perfectly. (There's a theme here.) Stewed chickpeas with poached eggs, which were somehow coated with buttered bread crumbs, and served with a little plate of harissa, preserved lemon, some unidentified pickle, and oil-cured olives. My favorite kind of food. The rest of the dishes were similar pleasures, hearty and straightforward, not relying on anything other than the ingredients. The famed Dutch pancake wasn't the puffy, eggy pancake I've always called a Dutch pancake, though obviously cooked in a cast-iron skillet. It was a thick with a crunchy crust, but somehow light like a good cake and not too sweet.When the check came, these little licorice dogs came, too. Perfect, again.But I can't say I'm going to rush back. In the end, it's still a Manhattan restaurant that's too hard to get into, with prices that are slightly too high for brunch (though not for what it was, very good food). Prune is the kind of restaurant I would open if I were to own a restaurant, but only if it were less popular. I care more about food than most of my friends, and I think about food almost every second of the day, but in the end, I don't think it should be such a big deal. I want good food to be an everyday part of my life, not something revelatory or inspired or mind-blowing, not something rare to strive for, I guess in the same way I want my birthday to be as good as any other day of my life.

Leslie's cupcakes are really the best that I've ever had. Billy's Bakery, Cupcake Factory, etc. don't compare to hers. Leslie's cupcakes stay moist, are light and fluffy, and have just the right amount of buttercream frosting (applied perfectly of course). I can't wait to try the recipe but am anxious that they won't turn out as well. - Btw, Ookie had all three that evening although he did pace himself. I think it took him a few hours to devour them.

One obvious benefit to cooking and living alone is that you're the only one around to lick the batter bowl. But what you really need is a good eating friend, someone who is willing to eat whatever you make. I make fun of B all the time, for preferring Breyer's ice cream to premium gelato and otherwise being the child of a mother who never cooked with butter, but she really is the best friend I could have. She doesn't really like the taste of fat, yet she graciously lets me feed her braised short ribs rendered meltingly tender by their own fat, roast chicken with potatoes roasted in the chicken's own fat, and cakes fatty with butter and eggs.We were supposed to go to Greenpoint last night to eat Polish food with some friends, but with the piles of snow and ice around, she suggested we make Irish soda bread, innocently not even realizing it was St. Patrick's Day. It was the perfect excuse for me to make the \"World's Best-Braised Cabbage\" from \"All About Braising,\" fry up some turkey sausage from DiPalo's stand at the farmers' market, and roast some rosemary-garlic potato chunks. I'm sure turkey sausage isn't particularly Irish, but it seemed Irish, and it was hearty and warming on a cold night. I pointed out to her that it was a pretty healthy dinner, since there wasn't much butter or oil involved, but she didn't really believe me.And bless her heart, she didn't even protest when I told her I wanted her to come back for dinner the next night, when I was planning to make lasagna and chocolate pound cake, courtesy of Candy on Chowhound Home Cooking.Oh Sunday. Is there anything better than having a chocolate cake baking in the oven and a bolognese sauce simmering on the stove on a lazy Sunday afternoon?

Well, the chicken looks beautiful.I love roasting chickens on Sunday afternoons. I love the lazy luxury of making something that takes time, nothing complicated or stressful, but something that needs to cook slowly while I nap or read or watch figure skating on Sunday afternoon TV. And even though it seems preposterous to roast an entire chicken for one person, it's actually very efficient. Roast chicken for lunch, shredded chicken for salad, a nice carcass to save for later stock-making. Almost makes me feel like a Native American buffalo hunter.I normally make Marcella Hazan's \"Roast Chicken with Two Lemons,\" combined with the Zuni Cafe pre-salting method, and it's the easiest, juiciest, loveliest chicken in the world. But tonight, I thought I would try Paula Wolfert's roast chicken with Moroccan flavors, what she calls \"Expatriate Chicken.\" It's an odd recipe. You prep the chicken by stuffing the cavity with a mixture of chopped garlic, preserved lemon pulp, olive oil, ground ginger, and a pinch of cayenne early in the day. The odd part begins with the cooking. The chicken gets started in a cold oven that gets cranked up to 550 degrees while boiling water is poured into the roasting pan with grated onion, saffron, a cinnamon stick, and a little bit of sugar. After 45 minutes, the oven gets turned down to 275, and you're supposed to keep turning the bird to get it brown on all sides, 20 minutes one side, 20 minutes on the other, and 10 minutes on the back. At the end, you take the bird out and let it rest, add green olives and cilantro to the pan, and then let the pan juices reduce further in the oven. I would give more exact instructions, but it wasn't very good. The inner seasoning didn't seem to have done much for the outer bird. The breast was a little too dry, and there just wasn't much flavor. The pan juices were deliciously fatty, but the olives and cilantro didn't really meld into a larger, more complex flavor. Not bad, just disappointing. And to top it all of, I realized that the Moroccan flavors wouldn't really make for a very stock-able carcass. So it goes.

The easiest way for one person to get a lot of dumplings made quickly is, of course, to have a party and have your guests make dumplings for you. It's amazing how quickly 300 dumplings can be made, even with amateur dumpling makers.It's the Year of the Pig, which meant porky dumplings were even more appropriate than usual. One of the co-hosts is Chinese-American, but since I was in charge of the food, I hijacked the dumplings for the Korean New Year tradition of dumpling and rice cake soup. It's everyday food, the kind of thing my mom made for dinner when she was tired or busy, but it's so satisfying and obviously lucky, since Koreans eat it every year on New Year's without fail.The broth was made by simmering a 3-lb. piece of brisket for about 2 hours, being sure to skim off the brown foam as it started to boil. Then seasoned with a little soy sauce (not too much, as it would turn it brown) and salt. I then let the brisket cool, shredded it, and mixed it with chopped garlic, scallions, a little soy sauce, and a little sesame seed oil. With little diamonds of pan-fried eggs and crumpled up seaweed, the beef was set aside to be added for last-minute garnish and flavor.I prepped two kinds of dumpling filling: a vegetarian, tofu-and-kimchi filling, and a truly porky filling adulterated only by minced garlic, minced ginger, chopped scallions, soy sauce, and sesame seed oil. Koreans traditionally like to put strained, crumbled tofu in their meat dumplings, but I've decided that until I start making my own dumpling skins, the thick, doughy kind that I love the best, I'll go with the more Chinese, meaty style for store-bought wonton skins. The rice cakes just came from the big Korean grocery store on 32nd Street--I've never known anyone who made her own--but they fascinated more than a few guests, including one who insisted on seeing the bag and noting where they were bought.So the upshot: 4.5 lbs. of ground pork + 2 lbs. of firm tofu + 3 lbs. of brisket + 300 dumpling skins + 50 guests = mighty fine eating.And for dessert, since it was the Year of the Red Pig, I made a red velvet pig-shaped cake!

Koreans hate eating alone. Food is a social activity, which is as it should be, but what it means is that it's very rare to see a woman eating alone, even in a fast-food outlet. There's a Korean saying, better not to eat at all than to eat alone.Obviously, I don't agree. But eating alone in a fine restaurant, in a restaurant with white tablecloths and murmuring couples and celebrating parties, is still hard. Last November, I ended up in Lima, Peru, alone for the night before my flight back to New York. My hostal ended up being across the street from the famed \"Astrid y Gaston,\" a restaurant I had been reading about on Chowhound.com. It's celebrated for using traditional Peruvian ingredients in inventive ways, and I was dying to try it. But I had never eaten alone at a good restaurant before. Was this the right first time? The fact that my hostal was so close was clearly a sign from God, if I believed in God. I tried calling to make a reservation, got a busy signal, and promptly gave up. But then I ended up at a bookstore looking at Peruvian cookbooks, and found one by a Gaston. When I asked the nice young clerk if it was the same Gaston of \"Astrid y Gaston,\" he started flipping through the pictures, sighing and smiling: \"Que delicioso!\" Another sign! I invoked M.F.K. Fisher, the patron saint of all women eating alone, gritted my teeth, and marched towards the restaurant. It wasn't open for lunch, and it looked so closed up, I almost gave up again, but the security guard looked friendly and I blathered at him in broken Spanish until he let me into their office. The two young women there and I had such a hard time understanding each other, but there was a lot of smiling and finally a dawning of understanding on my part that yes, there were no tables available, but they could make me a solo reservation in the lounge.So now I had a reservation, other people who would expect me to show up, but as I got dressed later that day, I still considered just eating at the cafe down the street. I had just gotten off of a 4-day trek on the Inca Trail, had no nice clothes, and the only shoes I had other than my mud-covered boots were my mud-covered Converse sneakers. The moment I walked into the restaurant, I wanted to hide. It was beautifully lit, modern, one of the chicest restaurants in Peru if not South America. I was led to a low table in the lounge, where I tried to tuck my feet into themselves. Just being in the lounge, tucked away from the open dining room, I felt sort of unwanted and hidden away. The waiter quickly brought out some snacks--olives, a spongy, feta-like cheese, and delicious garlic and oil dip--and I was so grateful to have something to do. I recognized a couple from the trail, and they recognized me, but they didn't take pity on me and ask me to join them. I kept eating. And then, Hans, the angel head bartender, noticed me. \"What are you doing, sitting there alone? Come sit at the bar!\" I almost tripped over myself rushing the two feet to the bar. He told me about the different pisco cocktails, helped me pick my menu, and basically made me feel incredibly welcome. I chose a potito sour, a yeasty almost beer-like cocktail, then a tiradito to start, like ceviche with with long strips of fish rather than cubes.Then a blue corn ravioli filled with parmesan scallops in a light, slightly astringent broth.And of course, dessert, rice pudding fried into little donuts with an intensely flavored passionfruit sorbet. Hans really approved of this choice.The whole meal was concluded with the most beautiful petit fours: tiny alfajores, which are cookies sandwiched with dulce de leche (caramel), and candied aguaymanto, which are tiny husked tomato-like fruits.The other bartenders didn't speak English as well as Hans, but they smiled at me constantly, happy to see me so happy. Hans would talk a bit between drinks he was mixing, offer me tastes of different cocktails, and explain what I was eating. What I loved about this meal was that all of them seemed to respect my deep desire to have good food, even if alone. They were friendly because they were happy for me, but they didn't see eating alone as something to be embarrassed about, to cover up with a lot of chatter. I was still eating alone, and amazingly, I was happy doing so.

I loved my first Le Creuset dutch oven like people love their first car. But after only one and a half years, after beautifully braising short ribs and simmering soups, I found tiny hairline cracks in the bottom of the pot. I had been so careful not to shock it with sudden changes in temperature. I was so upset, I could barely sleep. I wanted to call Le Creuset right away, but their customer service line was closed for the evening. When I called Le Creuset the next morning, their customer service was as gracious as promised by their lifetime guarantee. They offered to replace it, but said it would take 2-4 weeks. I considered living with my flawed baby, since it was the middle of January and I was obsessed with braising. But the nice lady said if the cracks actually resulted in chipped enamel, it could end up in my food. Sigh. So I told her that I needed a new 4.5 quart round oven in red, knowing they couldn't guarantee a replacement in the same color, and sent it off.Last night, I came home to a big box from Le Creuset. Guess what I got in return? A beautiful, red, FIVE-AND-A-HALF QUART round oven!!!! I'd been agonizing all year about whether I bought the wrong size, wishing I'd gone up one more size, especially with all the insane sales everywhere. Living alone, it'd been hard to justify spending more on such a huge pot. But now, I have a lovely, bigger pot for only $12 in shipping! I hope I don't sound too callous, but I love my new baby even more than my old one.

I love Paula Wolfert. I don't want to sound like a stalker, but I've been writing and rewriting a letter for over a year begging her to take me with her on her travels. (One day, I will send it.) I love the adventure of her life, that her recipes always seem to come with some story about going to a tiny village in the mountains and finding a Georgian peasant woman who instructs her on how to make bread using the village oven. But I love even more how homey all her food feels. It's not so much that all her recipes are simple, though many are. It's more that even the elaborate ones use simple techniques that women have used for centuries, rather than some new technology for foaming carrots. I can't be overly nostalgic about this world of women spending all day, everyday cooking dinner, but it's somehow reassuring to me to know some things don't have to change. There's so little about my life that my grandmother would recognize, but she would know why it's so important to me to cook with care and love.I've been cooking from my two Paula Wolfert cookbooks and her website all winter. This past Friday, I had to use up half a can of chickpeas, and a friend was coming over for a last-minute dinner, so I made \"Chickpeas and Swiss Chard in the Style Tunisian Sahel (Morshan)\". I couldn't believe how good this was. It's so simple, I didn't expect it to taste anything other than simple and clean, but it had this amazingly deep and earthy spiciness. I'm Korean, I know all about spicy, except when I eat dishes like this and I realize I don't. I would love to write a book on how the New World pepper traveled the globe changing diets in unimaginable ways.Saturdays and Sundays are my days to try out more elaborate recipes, and I was excited to try the \"Tunisian Poached Fish with Olives, Preserved Lemons and Capers\" in \"Slow Mediterranean Cooking.\" \"Slow,\" unsurprisingly, has a lot of recipes that involve many, many steps. I almost always end up with all four burners going, and I should find that annoying, but I don't. The amount I need to concentrate, to understand a description of a technique or an ingredient I've never even seen, reminds me of when I was little and practiced Bach on the piano. It's the deepest kind of relaxation, where the task at hand crowds out all other thoughts from my brain.Here's a shortish paraphrase:Ingredients:1.75 lbs fresh halibut steaksalt and pepper1 t. ground cumin1 small hot fresh pepper4-6 baby onions, preferably red3 T. extra virgin olive oil1 medium red onion, grated2 medium tomatoes, halved, seeded, and grated1 head of garlic, cloves separated1 T. tomato paste1 t. le tabil or ground coriander seeds1 cup brine-cured green olives, rinsed and drainedflour, for dusting4 cherry tomatoes1/4 cup capers, rinsed and drained1/2 preserved lemon peel, rinsed, drained and cut into thin julienne1 T. chopped celery leaves1. Rinse the fish, pat dry with paper towels. Season each piece with salt, pepper, and cumin and cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.2. Steam the hot pepper and baby onions until almost tender, about 10 minutes. Stem, seed, and coarsely chop the pepper. Peel the onions.3. In a deep-sided medium skillet, heat 2 T. of the olive oil. Add grated red onion and cook over medium heat until softened. Add tomatoes and cook until excess moisture evaporates. Add garlic, tomato paste, tabil or ground coriander, olives, hot pepper, baby onions and 1 cup water. Cover and cook over medium heat for 10 minutes. The sauce should be thin, light, and very hot.4. Heat the remaining 1 T. oil in a large nonstick skillet. Dust the fish with flour and fry until skin is crusty. Pour hot sauce over the fish. Add the cherry tomatoes, capers, preserved lemon and simmer over low heat for 1 minute. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 15 minutes. Garnish with chopped celery leaves.I modified a fair amount. No baby red onions, so I used pearl onions. Tomatoes aren't in season, so Pomi chopped tomatoes had to do. I hate celery, so no garnish. And the farmers' market where I got my fish told me to use fluke for halibut, which made me happy since Atlantic halibut isn't sustainable. But it all worked!Of course, I had to figure out how to make this properly without having to end up eating it everyday for a week. Fish is always a particular challenge, since I don't mind eating pork roast 3 days after it's made, but fish definitely doesn't keep. The original recipe is meant to feed 4 to 5. The fish guy at the market had fluke fillets and whole flukes. Fillets always seem so sissy to me, but what was I going to do with a whole 1.5 lb. fish for myself? I ended up hacking off about half a pound and then freezing the rest. But with the rest of the recipe, I left the quantities pretty much the same. I've found through painful, dried-up experience that you can't really halve oil in the pan and liquids in general, unless you use a smaller pan than the recipe calls for, and I am of the school that one should have pans that are too big than too small.The dish was a triumph. The fish was as tender as Paula promised, though the sauce not as thin as promised. Nevermind, it was delicious. I ate my big half-pound portion so quickly, I forgot to take a picture.And with all the leftover sauce, I had two very good breakfasts. I was thinking about huevos rancheros and fried eggs cooked in salsa, how much I love a good fried egg, and how I often eat olives and tomatoes for breakfast, and it was the most natural thing to heat up the leftover sauce in a pan and fry an egg in the middle of it. Eggs really go with almost anything, especially when there's bacon, too.

Being single, living alone, and loving food, I sometimes feel like the world is conspiring against me. Groceries are sold in value-packs. I only have one pair of hands to carry groceries home. No one is buying me a Le Creuset dutch oven or a Cuisinart food processor off my wedding registry. It's hard to justify opening a bottle of wine just for myself, though I do it anyway. And sometimes, you just can't get around buying one really big fish.Eating out has its own challenges. I'm slowing getting over the awkwardness of eating alone in sit-down restaurants, with the help of M.F.K. Fisher, but even in hole-in-the-wall places, eating alone means I'm facing only one kind of curry, instead of three or four. Of course, I love cooking for other people. I'm the daughter of a woman who equates feeding with love, and there's nothing like having friends around my dinner table tucking into food I've chopped, browned, and simmered all day. I have people over for dinner almost once a week, whether it's my best friend for a clean-out-the-pantry meal or my supper club of gourmands.But most of the time, I can't just feed other people to deal with my leftovers, or my other challenges eating and living alone. This is how I'm figuring it out, how I'm learning to adapt recipes and be frugal, without compromising quality or variety. And no matter how much I complain about not being able to buy 6 kinds of cheese in one go, there are things I love about eating alone. No one is vegetarian in my house. No one is telling me he doesn't eat anchovies or olives. I can try some elaborate new recipe without worrying that I'll make anyone sick other than myself. I can eat in my underwear, which is often necessary when the oven's been on for hours. It makes me happy.

When I started this blog in 2007, I saw it as a semi-public place for me to practice writing. I never expected any of my friends to read it regularly, and I certainly didn't expect any strangers to find it. I'm really grateful and amazed that I had any readers. Ah, the wonders of the Internet!So I hope you'll continue to read me at the blog's new location at www.oneforkonespoon.wordpress.com. I'll be blogging about a new project, a Korean cookbook that I'm working on with my friend Diane Choo. The book will be published by East Rock Publishing, a new publisher focusing on East Asian culture, sometime in 2010. I'm really excited about it, and especially about our upcoming research trip to Korea. Regional specialties, learning from master housewives, it's my dream come true!

This is my last post about Argentina. It's been over a month since I got back, but I still think about it all the time--the things I saw, the people I met, and of course the food I ate. So after the mildly snide comments I've made about Argentine food, it seems fair and right to write my last post about a delicious Argentine meal we ate that was not steak.Café San Juan in San Telmo wants you to feel comfortable and cozy. There are no menus, just substantial blackboards that the servers will prop up on your table. One is devoted to tapas, the other to main dishes like rabbit and lamb chops. (I love lamb chops but I love them even more when they're called \"chuletitas de cordero.\") The kitchen is open, but not in the flamboyant way you see in the U.S., since it's small and just pushed off to the side. It almost feels more like the restaurant just didn't want to separate the chefs from the dining room and vice versa. The décor in general is quiet and unassuming, clean but a little bare. The warmth of the room comes completely from the food and the happy people eating it.We ordered two tapas and two entrees. The waiter seemed a little surprised, and when the food arrived, we realized why. The portions were huge, so that even before we started eating, we could see we were clearly in the New World. We Americans, North and South, love our food big!But I can't complain that the roast pork tapas were too big. I loved every bite I had, both my piece and the half I got from my friend. Thick slices of roast pork were layered on a piece of good, crusty bread, with more than just a drizzle of a green cilantro sauce. The gazpacho was served in its own shot glass, but there was nothing precious about the presentation. I made a mess on the tablecloth pouring the gazpacho over my share. I didn't care.Likewise, the olives were speared onto equally thick and generous slices of cheese. Simple, delicious, and totally satisfying. The rabbit was also very generous--it looked like the entire rabbit was on our plate. Though there was nothing wrong with it, we agreed there was something about the uniformly rich and braised flavor that didn't really suit our palates.But what impressed me the most was the beautiful canelones de mollejas, or cannelloni stuffed with sweetbreads. They were monstrous tubes of pasta, reminding me again of how the New World super-sizes everything from the Old World, but I wanted as much of it as I could get. The sweetbreads had been mixed with a wonderful ricotta, and the pasta itself defied all my expectations with its firm al dente resistance. The tomato sauce was incredibly rich, obviously full of some kind of fat, but it still added the tartness and brightness necessary to make the dish unstoppable. I don't know if sweetbread cannelloni is particularly Italian, but it felt very beefy and Argentine.My friend, who had found other Argentine desserts impossibly sweet, loved our dessert. It was just a sweet little rice pudding with an icy mango sorbet and some very jaunty tuiles.The Guía Oleo, an Argentine online food guide, describes the food at Café San Juan as \"porteño,\" the Argentine word to describe the people who live in Buenos Aires, even though I'd heard it described on Chowhound as Spanish. Now that I've been there, I think the Guía is right. This is true porteño food.

\"Voulez\" in French means, \"You want.\" When you arrive at Voulez Bar, a French bistro and cafe in Buenos Aires, it's pretty clear, yes, you do want. It's not just that you might be tired of steak and excited to eat a little quiche/tarta with some fresh greens dressed in a very French way. Of course, the space is beautiful, with large windows that let in the kind of light that makes the most lowly glass of white wine gleam and glimmer. It is obviously popular, despite being a little expensive by porteño standards, filled with ladies lunching, businessmen dining, and a trio of Americans who seemed more like expats than tourists judging by their self-satisfied conversation. (I would be self-satisfied, too, if I managed to figure out a way to live there.) It's just the magic that's always in the best cafes. It's that perfect low-level buzz of noise that comes from the echo of voices and clinking silverware, and the feeling that you can sit as long as you want looking out the window. You can be alone but have conversations surround you. And the quiche there really is very good.

Chinese food, and the possibilities of life in Buenos Aires

For me, love comes with familiarity. So it was only in my second week in Buenos Aires, and my third week in Argentina, that I really began to love the city. I knew at least a few of the major bus routes leaving off of Avenida Santa Fe. I could carry a vague map of the city in my head. I had my favorite café, where I could drink a café cortado and eat medialunas all day and even plug my laptop into an outlet. (New Yorkers love Buenos Aires because it shows them life in a big city doesn't have to be quite so hard.)But what really moved me to love Buenos Aires, and to be able to imagine living there for more than a week or two, was the discovery of great Chinese food. Yes, Buenos Aires has great Chinese food. Great Chinese food is a good thing, wherever you are, but it's particularly noteworthy when you're in a country where the culinary standard seems to be a serious aversion to garlic, spices, and heat. (I try really hard to accept a country's food on its own terms, but a Korean girl has her limits.) Chinatown in the leafy, outer neighborhood of Belgrano turned out to be just a few blocks, but like all Chinatowns around the world, there were gold and red tchotchkes for sale and tourists and Argentines looking for exotic thrills. The kind of thrills Zizou* and I were looking for, we happily found at a place called Lai Lai, from a Chowhound tip. It was very \"Chinese,\" to be sure--red lanterns, red walls, red light. There were postcards of Taiwan lined up in right above the tables all around the room, that made me wonder what the owners longed for, especially when Zizou, whose family is from Taiwan, told me the staff were speaking Mandarin with a Beijing accent. Unlike many of the restaurants we normally go to in San Francisco and New York, this restaurant could not be bare-boned. It had to prove its Chinese-ness to its non-Chinese clientele.At the same time, the menu was oddly reassuring in its Spanish translations. There was very little in the way of bird's nest soup or abalone, and the chicken, beef, and pork that was there was translated in a way that claimed, \"This is very much like this that you already know.\" Tofu was \"queso de soya\" or \"soy cheese\"; wontons were \"raviolines.\" It made me realize how flexible American culture is, that we happily learn new words for the new foods we eat, even if we might mangle their pronunciation. We say \"panna cotta,\" not \"Italian custard,\" and \"taco\" instead of \"Mexican pancake stuffed with meat.\" In the end, what we loved about the food wasn't that it was just like the mapo tofu I've had at Grand Sichuan in Chelsea, or the dumplings we've had at Koi Palace in Daly City. Everything we ate was a little unexpected, a little surprising, and all good. Our appetizer of spicy dumplings was served in a hot, oily broth, rather than the pool of chile oil we expected, but the broth was so tangy and restorative, we spooned it up.The lamb with scallions was a little tough with gristle, but the taste of the scallions was a joy, like chewing on springtime after all the vegetable-less dishes I'd eaten. The beef with Chinese broccoli had an intense flavor of star anise, but it was curious and interesting because it had a flavor that wasn't one of the three dominant flavors in Argentine food.The best part, though, was the mapo tofu. Not only was the tofu slightly firmer and more resilient than usual, it tasted of beef! Not pork! I've seen recipes for mapo tofu that call for beef, not pork, but it just seemed so appropriately Argentine to replace the most common meat in Chinese food with their beloved beef. We first were concerned it wasn't red enough, but then we realized the red light of the restaurant was hiding the amount of chiles in the sauce. It was absolutely delicious.At one point, Zizou asked me, \"Do you think this would taste as good if we were in New York or in San Francisco?\" Probably not, given that the food tasted the way I imagine manna tasted to the starving Israelites, but in a way, it didn't really matter. It was Chinese food, the Argentine way. And that is how I fell in love with Buenos Aires.*Zizou, the alias of my privacy-seeking friend and traveling buddy.

Found in a sign-in book at the Cervecería Artesanal, a restaurant in El Chaltén:Sunday 20th March 2005-Dear Mr. Bar Man,We came in this afternoon and noticed that you were really hot.............So we brought our friend back to meet you.....Only to discover that there was a different (but equally hot guy) behind the bar....From talking to you the night before we knew a bit about you so we asked the (new) guy if he was your friend and you were traveling together.........He seemed a bit confused and so did we...........until we realized that you are in fact THE SAME GUY and must have had a shave!Patagonia is magical like that.Hot guys aside, there really is something strange, wild, and magical about Patagonia. Most of it is empty of almost everything but wind. There are no bounds to what you are looking at--the sky keeps going, as does the land. And then, in the midst of all this emptiness, there are the glaciers. There is no way to describe what a glacier looks like, only what it did to me to look at them and to feel some of the strongest yearning I have ever felt for something to exist and continue existing, no matter what were to happen to me. But after gazing and hiking and yearning, you must eat. And the best place to eat in strange, wild, and magical El Chaltén is the Cervecería Artesanal, the very same restaurant in which we found this funny story. You could almost miss it from the outside, just another wood-hewn building among others, with no clear sign indicating its name. We might have walked right by it the first day, if it weren't for the hikers who looked so happy sitting outside drinking the home-brewed cold beer. When you walk in, though, you can see immediately how much the owner loves her restaurant. The walls are papered in articles and photos, from James Dean to Leo Tolstoy, and there are sturdy, good-looking cakes on the counter. The aforementioned sign-in books are scattered on the tables, and you can spend a very pleasant afternoon flipping through the happy memories of people from France and Australia and Spain while the light streams in the windows. It is always a refuge, whether it's hot or windy, and I'm sure even when it's cold. That same love and attention is obvious in the food. The salad is composed beautifully and creatively. Everything, the pears, tomatoes, celery, walnuts, blue cheese and cream, tasted clear and sure, cut and placed authoritatively in the bowl. The lamb ravioli was firm and tender at the same time; no fear of sub-par Argentine pasta here. In classic Argentine fashion, you can pair any pasta with any sauce, but I think I did well in picking the light and tangy tomato sauce.Bodegon is a good place to have a beer with some complimentary peanuts and popcorn at any time, but I highly recommend going there especially if you have camped for five days eating nothing but Knorr instant food.That is Patagonia. Yearning for something you can't even identify, and then finding happiness in a hot shower, a bowl of ravioli, and a quiet place to read funny stories.

Nuevo Hermann, or Buenos Aires-speak for very old restaurant

There is no shortage of hipsters in Buenos Aires, kids in high tops with surprisingly good-looking mullets. But there is also no shortage of restaurants like El Desnivel, or Manolo, or my favorite, Nuevo Hermann, restaurants that don't seem to have changed in 50 years. It's what makes Buenos Aires feel like a rich city, rich in a diversity of lives and memories. We walked into Nuevo Hermann almost on a dare. It was just a block or two from our first apartment on Guemes in Palermo, it was our last night in Buenos Aires before we left for Patagonia, and I wanted to eat someplace that wasn't listed in any of our guidebooks, just walk in blind. I was afraid to risk not just my stomach but also that of my friend Zizou*, but I had to try it.The waiter was old and gruff. The menu was enormous. There were dishes that were vaguely German and dishes that were vaguely Spanish, and the usual gamut of Argentine meats and pastas. Milanesa, anyone? We asked him, \"What would you recommend? What is the best?\" And the answer was, \"Everything is the best.\" This was not said with much enthusiasm.But it became clear why the question was so foreign to him as we watched the restaurant fill up with regulars from the neighborhood. Elderly and middle-aged couples came in, didn't even glance at their menus, and ordered their dinners. One couple, according to Zizou, didn't even order, the waiter just brought their food. The restaurant was pristine and proud. It wasn't being retro; it wasn't even aware its time had passed. So how was the food? Zizou's pork chop was overcooked but still strong in flavor. But I was really scared when my Vienna sausage and ensalada rusa came out. I knew that my ensalada rusa, a classic Spanish tapa, would be full of mayonnaise and not in a good way, but I felt this perverse desire to order it. The sausage looked like my worst nightmares, so pink and clean and consistent. But it was delicious. The smoothness of its texture didn't mean that it was lacking in character. And even the ensalada rusa was comforting and satisfying, because it was exactly as I had expected it to be.That's why everyone else was there, to get food exactly as they expected it. To be so sure of having one's expectations met--that's a beautiful thing, isn't it?*Zizou, aka my friend and traveling companion, not Zinedine Zidane.

Scannapieco at Avenida Cordoba 4826. Flavors like Crema Armenia, a boozy fig and anise, and limoncello, as light and refreshing as anything called \"limoncello\" should be. It's true, most Argentine gelato is too sweet, but it's hard to fault a city where ice cream gets delivered by bicycle.

There were moments in Buenos Aires when I thought, \"Thank God, I chose to study Spanish in Mexico.\" These were not the moments when I was dancing till 4 a.m. or eating luscious steaks for criminal prices. I missed small-town Oaxaca the most when I sat staring at my \"ensalada caprese,\" a sorry mass of tasteless arugula, hunks of \"mozzarella\" or pizza cheese, and the saddest, blandest tomatoes to ever bear the name. To be fair, I was at an all-night eatery, as Zizou* and I had few choices after getting back to BA late at night. But Argentine traditional cooking just can't compare to the zingy surprise of a street emapanada de mole amarillo or the complex curiosity of mole negro.When there wasn't steak, there were Argentine empanadas, and as Zizou found, most empanadas were a doughy excuse to carry some meat around in an easy way. When she complained the dough was utterly forgettable, we imagined gauchos carrying them cold in their saddlebags, caring little for texture or flavor. This is where La Cupertina came in, to make us more gracious towards our host country. Located in Palermo Soho, and specializing in food from the province of Tucuman, La Cupertina is a very pretty place--heart cut-outs in the wooden chairs, green plants spilling over an antique stove. The owner, whose fame is apparent in the framed articles on one discrete wall, clearly cares a lot about what she is doing. I love people who care, and I loved her food as much as I'd hoped as we sat waiting in the sunny dining room.The empanadas were baked, the ham and cheese empanadas with sugar. The tamal, more meat than masa, was moist and so good we ordered another one after finishing the first. The locro, though, was my favorite. A traditional stew of whole corn kernels with white beans, beef, and sausage, there was an intensity and range of flavor that I'd been missing while chewing the excellent Argentine beef.Their desserts, too, are beautiful to behold, and although they were as sweet as all Argentine desserts, they weren't so singular in their sweetness. (But to be totally honest, the best empanadas we had the entire time we were there were from El Mazacote, the corner pizzeria in Montserrat. Flaky, buttery, revelatory--Zizou felt vindicated--\"I told you the dough could be flaky!\")* aka, my non-\"French soccer star\" friend and traveling companion.

Most people who love to travel are running away from something. I know this because that's why I travel. That can be bad, when you're avoiding persistent problems in your life, but it can also be good, when you ignore your preferences from back home and learn to accept things on their own terms. In short, Argentinian pizza is quite good if you accept it for what it is. Not New York pizza. Not Neopolitan pizza. Not Chicago-style, nor New Haven. But Argentinian.Our first pizza experience horrified Zizou,* and she didn't even taste it. We had gone to Kentucky Pizza (what a name!) after lots of dancing to La Bomba de Tiempo at Ciudad Cultural KONEX with some new friends. I was so hungry I ate my pizza without comment or even consciousness, but Zizou could not forget it. \"It was so thick and doughy! It looked disgusting!\"She wasn't mollified when I ordered the above fugazetta, an onion-intense pizza at Bodegon, our favorite restaurant and local brewery in El Chalten. We had just come off five days of camping, where we ate nothing other than instant oatmeal, Frutigram cookies, and gummy Knorr-mix pasta. I was not going to complain about the crazy amount of cheese or the flatbread crust. It wasn't the most delicious thing I had ever eaten, but it was good enough that I ate it cold for breakfast the next day. When we got back to Buenos Aires, and I mentioned that my former boss's grandmother had invited us to have pizza, Zizou looked scared. But it was she in the end who steered us, even before we went to dinner with Nilda, to El Cuartito, one of the oldest and most famous pizzerias in Buenos Aires. The look of relief on her face when she bit into her slice! \"It's good!\" The cabresa was layered with cheese, many pieces of longaniza (essentially pepperoni), and a strongly tomato-flavored tomato sauce, which is not a redundant thing to say in Argentina. (For a country populated by Italian immigrants, they have sadly forgotten the taste of a true tomato.) The crust was crunchy, but not doughy. The famous faina, the thin chickpea flour pancakes Argentines like to eat literally on top of their pizza slice, was tasty, too. It must be a descendent of farinata, no? It wasn't like any pizza we'd ever had before, but it had everything right-cheese, bread, and sauce.El Cuartito itself is wonderful. It proudly declares that it began in 1934, thanking its customers, their parents, and their grandparents for their patronage. The walls are covered with memorabilia, except unlike TGIF, the memorabilia has age. Marilyn Monroe sits next to Diego Maradona, as well as Muhammad Ali.But the crowning moment for Argentine pizza came on our last night, at dinner with Nilda, an 84-year-old former human rights lawyer who I would call feisty if that word didn't sound so inadequate when applied to a woman like that. Sitting at her kitchen table with her pale gold hair, she watched closely as she asked us, \"What do you think of Fidel Castro?\" This is a woman who said, \"Of course I am not Communist, just in my thoughts!\" The pizza she served us, urged on by my former boss, was from the family's favorite pizzeria, El Mazacote, a neighborhood place in Montserrat on the corner of calles Chile y Jose. It was a revelation. The dough was yeasty, chewy, flavorful. The sauce and cheese were sharp with salt. We loved it, the Argentinian pizza.*Zizou, a pseudonym for my good friend who wishes to remain anonymous, and not an indication my good friend is Zinedine Zidane.

Medialunas (literally \"half moons\") are the Argentine version of the French croissant, except they are very different and very delicious at the same time. They come in three variations--de grasa, de manteca, and dulce. The first kind is my favorite, the skinniest, more of a thin crescent than a half moon. They're almost crunchy while also being flaky and more than a little salty. The second and third, I have to confess, I have a hard time distinguishing. They both flake in softer layers and have a shiny wash of sweetness. All of them are small and lovely. I had a bagel this morning in commemoration of my return to New York, but I miss my café con leche con tres medialunas.

You may have already heard my theory on how a country's junk food reveals a lot about its culture. Ta-da, here is Argentina's rendition of the Oreo: An alfajor is two cookies bound together with a filling, dulce de leche in Argentina, and then covered in a thin layer of chocolate. Like all Spanish words that start with \"al,\" it's derived from the Arabic word for \"relleno\" or \"filled,\" and entered Spain with the Moors during the time of Al-Andalus. Hmm, that would explain their extreme intense sweetness. And then there are the chocolate cookies with beef fat in them: And cows everywhere:

I don't want to sound like an ass, but you haven't lived until you've had some whiskey on ice from the glacier you're standing on. It doesn't even need to be good whiskey. It can be Famous Grouse, and it will still leave you with a weird and wonderful feeling of chilliness, warmth and delirium.Zizou* and I arrived in El Calafate in southern Patagonia bleary-eyed and dog-tired. We'd stayed up all night drinking with new friends before getting on a 5 a.m. flight, which was unfortunately dominated by a very loud and boisterous group of French tourists. Despite being half-awake, with only one eye open, I distinctly remember hearing one of them say, \"J'ai peur! J'ai peur!\" (\"I'm afraid! I'm afraid!\") as the pilot went for a second try at landing around the giant lake. I was especially surprised that I understood what he was saying, because I don't understand spoken French.But we somehow managed to haul ourselves to our hostel, America del Sur, and to book ourselves for a \"mini-trekking\" trip on the glacier the next day from Hielo y Aventura.We approached the ice by boat on water that was a milky blue from the sediment in the glacier. Marco, our guide, was waiting for us. As Zizou said, \"Good God! You get off the boat and there's a handsome Argentine waiting for you on the dock!\" There is mucho eye candy in this country, mucho.The guides tied crampons, giant metal teeth, onto our boots, and we soon marched onto the ice in groups of ten. The crampons felt fantastic--we could walk up steep slopes like we had been given Spidey powers. Our group was the \"English-speaking group,\" though it was mainly Germans and French people, which meant we got to hear Marco say in his very flat and funny way, \"Now we go hi-gher,\" with a hard \"g.\"We marched up, we marched down, in a quiet single file, too awed by what we were seeing to say much. We walked around pools of water and looked down deep blue holes. We cupped water into our mouths, and I surreptitiously crunched on ice. The glacier, as smooth as the ice looked from far away, was made up of tiny little bits of ice, so that we were walking on a path of crunchy glass shards. We were told to wear gloves, despite it being a warm day, because if we fell, we could cut our hands.There is so much more texture and color and variation in a glacier than I'd ever imagined. I had learned, from a book, that glaciers move, but nothing could have prepared me for the sense of movement beneath my feet. From the viewing balconies, the peaks had looked like giant teeth crowded and pushed against each other. Up close, there were also soft, undulating waves that reminded me of Gaudi.Near the end, we marched up one last slope and found a little tableau, like a movie set, two small tables with glasses, a bucket, and a few bottles of whiskey. We stood around, finally laughing, while Marco poured drinks and we ate alfajores, the national sandwich cookie.The whiskey tasted sweeter than any whiskey I'd had before. I could feel happiness spreading through me. It was the best drink I have ever had.*My friend has asked me to identify her as \"Zizou\" to protect her privacy. I, unfortunately, am not a traveling companion of the great Zinedine Zidane.

In all the news coverage following the election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, one small blip involved Oprah Winfrey talking on her show about the middle-aged white man she had been leaning on, literally crying on his shoulder, during the celebratory rally in Grant Park, Chicago. Everyone called her, asking, \"Who was that man?\" And she confessed she didn't know who he was, that he was simply Mr. Man. But of course, because she is Oprah, Mr. Man was soon identified as Sam Perry, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Obama campaign volunteer, and he appeared on her show.It's such a small thing, Oprah leaning on the shoulder of an unknown man while she cries listening to President Obama's speech, but the more I think about it, the more it encapsulates what I saw in this campaign.We won this together. We won, not just with friends and family we cajoled, but with complete strangers across the country. We won with Oprah, media mogul and superstar, and with my friend Mimi who had never volunteered for a campaign before. We won with Shaddai, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and with Joe, the union dry-wall finisher, who stood outside our polling site with me all day. We won with Chung, the woman my mother's age who made phone calls to Korean-American voters for hours, and if you are not impressed, it's because you don't know what it takes for a Korean person to call strangers. We won with the stream of men and women who came into Childs Elementary School in South Philly to vote, African-American mainly but also white and Vietnamese-American and Chinese-American. I had never seen any of them before in my life and will probably never see any of them again. But like Oprah, we felt a connection to each other that moved us to hug each other, cry together, and celebrate together. Even three days after the election, as I walk around my Brooklyn neighborhood, I smile at strangers and they, miraculously, smile back. Obama didn't just declare that we are one nation, we are one people. He made us feel it and know it in our hearts as well as our minds. I thought I had always loved my country and the ideals on which it was founded, but now I know, this is love.\"So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.\"

Despite all my complaints, there are several things I've enjoyed as an immigration lawyer. My clients, for the most part, have been wonderful people with stories I feel truly privileged to hear. Winning, of course, always feels great. But almost as much as winning, I've loved the opportunities I've had to eat with my clients. I've eaten Dominican food at the home of the warmest Dominican family. I've been given cooking tips by an Egyptian caterer. I've tasted a crumbly and sweet anise-scented Palestinian dessert that is such a homey item, you can't buy it in stores. This one case took over my life in the weeks leading up to the trial, but I ate very well, the Middle Eastern food that I love, culminating with the amazing strategy meal I had at Assayad Restaurant in Clifton, New Jersey.But now the hearing is finally over. There's still a written summation to write and the judge won't render a decision before September, but four days of testimony have been completed. And I am no longer a lawyer. It may not be the last case I work on, but it is for the foreseeable future. So it seems like a good time to end this blog as well, for the few of you who were still expecting something new to be posted. I'm hoping to have other opportunities to write now, including working on a book on regional Korean food with a good friend of mine. But thank you to everyone who faithfully or even sporadically checked in. It was nice to have an audience!

Since I got back from my travels, I've been drawn to simpler meals and simpler flavors. Partly, it's because working two part-time jobs is exhausting. But mostly, it's because the trendy American obsession with food--and my obsession with food--has gotten a little exhausting as well. One of the things I loved most about eating in Mexico, Spain, and Korea, was how good food felt very easy. I didn't have to search for it, I didn't have to pay a lot for it, and most of the time, it came from a stand or restaurant that specialized in one thing. More and more, I want to feel that way about the food I cook and eat. I'm still drawn to recipes for Georgian chicken broiled with yogurt or Tunisian chickpea stew, things I can only cook with a carefully drawn out grocery list and a propped-open cookbook, but I'm not making three-course meals for myself these days. My favorite food memories are small and singular, one dish or sometimes even one new, bright fruit, and it feels good to be building new memories that way at home. So in that spirit, I've been cooking things like pasta in tuna-tomato sauce, or squid sauteed with bitter greens and a splash of soy sauce and lemon juice. And when I'm feeling up for a challenge, like a Rick Bayless fish enchilada recipe, I'm happy not to take on a salad, rice, and a roasted meat at the same time. That way, I can reserve energy to make my own tortillas.I can't say that I've mastered them, as easy as they are supposed to be with masa harina, the instant tortilla flour. (You can't make truly authentic tortillas at home without fresh masa dough, and because fresh masa dough goes bad so quickly, you can only get fresh masa dough in the U.S. by living next to a tortilla factory.) But they were better than the last time I tried, more flexible and less doughy in my throat. Making tortillas is almost therapeutic, to roll each ball of dough, flatten it in the tortilla press the way I'd seen women do all over the streets of Oaxaca, and toss it on a cast-iron griddle. The filling was a bit more work. There was the tomatillo-serrano sauce, made by first broiling 12 ounces of tomatillos and 2 serrano chiles under a broiler, about 5 minutes on each side. The tomatillos and chiles then melded in a food processor. In the meantime, I sauteed half a diced white onion until rich and brown, stirred in 2 chopped cloves of garlic, and when that had just cooked a minute more, the onions and garlic got added to the tomatillo-chile mixture and pureed until smooth. The whole sauce had to be transferred to a skillet to be fried, its flavor getting deeper with a bit of fish broth. Then there was the half a pound of sea bass I bought to poach. I ignored the potatoes in the recipe and focused on the fish, flaking it and then mixing it with half a cup of the tomatillo sauce. Finally, following Bayless's recipe, I added a bit of thick Greek yogurt to the remaining tomatillo sauce, since I couldn't find any creme fraiche or sour cream at the corner bodega. The assembly was the easiest part: spoon some fish on a tortilla, fold it over, and then ladle on more sauce with a sprinkling of crumbled cotija cheese (my substitution for the queso anejo I didn't have) and some chopped raw onions and cilantro. I ate nothing else that night, just these enchiladas with a beer. I was very happy.

Hello. I stumbled onto your lovely and mouth-watering blog whilst searching for the cross streets of a restaurant here in Oaxaca. Just wanted to share how much I've enjoyed your culinary anthropology. And even though I've lived in Oaxaca for months now--I find myself following your nose to places I had yet to try. So thanks!

When I started this blog in 2007, I saw it as a semi-public place for me to practice writing. I never expected any of my friends to read it regularly, and I certainly didn't expect any strangers to find it. I'm really grateful and amazed that I had any readers. Ah, the wonders of the Internet!So I hope you'll continue to read me at the blog's new location at www.oneforkonespoon.wordpress.com. I'll be blogging about a new project, a Korean cookbook that I'm working on with my friend Diane Choo. The book will be published by East Rock Publishing, a new publisher focusing on East Asian culture, sometime in 2010. I'm really excited about it, and especially about our upcoming research trip to Korea. Regional specialties, learning from master housewives, it's my dream come true!

This is my last post about Argentina. It's been over a month since I got back, but I still think about it all the time--the things I saw, the people I met, and of course the food I ate. So after the mildly snide comments I've made about Argentine food, it seems fair and right to write my last post about a delicious Argentine meal we ate that was not steak.Café San Juan in San Telmo wants you to feel comfortable and cozy. There are no menus, just substantial blackboards that the servers will prop up on your table. One is devoted to tapas, the other to main dishes like rabbit and lamb chops. (I love lamb chops but I love them even more when they're called \"chuletitas de cordero.\") The kitchen is open, but not in the flamboyant way you see in the U.S., since it's small and just pushed off to the side. It almost feels more like the restaurant just didn't want to separate the chefs from the dining room and vice versa. The décor in general is quiet and unassuming, clean but a little bare. The warmth of the room comes completely from the food and the happy people eating it.We ordered two tapas and two entrees. The waiter seemed a little surprised, and when the food arrived, we realized why. The portions were huge, so that even before we started eating, we could see we were clearly in the New World. We Americans, North and South, love our food big!But I can't complain that the roast pork tapas were too big. I loved every bite I had, both my piece and the half I got from my friend. Thick slices of roast pork were layered on a piece of good, crusty bread, with more than just a drizzle of a green cilantro sauce. The gazpacho was served in its own shot glass, but there was nothing precious about the presentation. I made a mess on the tablecloth pouring the gazpacho over my share. I didn't care.Likewise, the olives were speared onto equally thick and generous slices of cheese. Simple, delicious, and totally satisfying. The rabbit was also very generous--it looked like the entire rabbit was on our plate. Though there was nothing wrong with it, we agreed there was something about the uniformly rich and braised flavor that didn't really suit our palates.But what impressed me the most was the beautiful canelones de mollejas, or cannelloni stuffed with sweetbreads. They were monstrous tubes of pasta, reminding me again of how the New World super-sizes everything from the Old World, but I wanted as much of it as I could get. The sweetbreads had been mixed with a wonderful ricotta, and the pasta itself defied all my expectations with its firm al dente resistance. The tomato sauce was incredibly rich, obviously full of some kind of fat, but it still added the tartness and brightness necessary to make the dish unstoppable. I don't know if sweetbread cannelloni is particularly Italian, but it felt very beefy and Argentine.My friend, who had found other Argentine desserts impossibly sweet, loved our dessert. It was just a sweet little rice pudding with an icy mango sorbet and some very jaunty tuiles.The Guía Oleo, an Argentine online food guide, describes the food at Café San Juan as \"porteño,\" the Argentine word to describe the people who live in Buenos Aires, even though I'd heard it described on Chowhound as Spanish. Now that I've been there, I think the Guía is right. This is true porteño food.

\"Voulez\" in French means, \"You want.\" When you arrive at Voulez Bar, a French bistro and cafe in Buenos Aires, it's pretty clear, yes, you do want. It's not just that you might be tired of steak and excited to eat a little quiche/tarta with some fresh greens dressed in a very French way. Of course, the space is beautiful, with large windows that let in the kind of light that makes the most lowly glass of white wine gleam and glimmer. It is obviously popular, despite being a little expensive by porteño standards, filled with ladies lunching, businessmen dining, and a trio of Americans who seemed more like expats than tourists judging by their self-satisfied conversation. (I would be self-satisfied, too, if I managed to figure out a way to live there.) It's just the magic that's always in the best cafes. It's that perfect low-level buzz of noise that comes from the echo of voices and clinking silverware, and the feeling that you can sit as long as you want looking out the window. You can be alone but have conversations surround you. And the quiche there really is very good.

Chinese food, and the possibilities of life in Buenos Aires

For me, love comes with familiarity. So it was only in my second week in Buenos Aires, and my third week in Argentina, that I really began to love the city. I knew at least a few of the major bus routes leaving off of Avenida Santa Fe. I could carry a vague map of the city in my head. I had my favorite café, where I could drink a café cortado and eat medialunas all day and even plug my laptop into an outlet. (New Yorkers love Buenos Aires because it shows them life in a big city doesn't have to be quite so hard.)But what really moved me to love Buenos Aires, and to be able to imagine living there for more than a week or two, was the discovery of great Chinese food. Yes, Buenos Aires has great Chinese food. Great Chinese food is a good thing, wherever you are, but it's particularly noteworthy when you're in a country where the culinary standard seems to be a serious aversion to garlic, spices, and heat. (I try really hard to accept a country's food on its own terms, but a Korean girl has her limits.) Chinatown in the leafy, outer neighborhood of Belgrano turned out to be just a few blocks, but like all Chinatowns around the world, there were gold and red tchotchkes for sale and tourists and Argentines looking for exotic thrills. The kind of thrills Zizou* and I were looking for, we happily found at a place called Lai Lai, from a Chowhound tip. It was very \"Chinese,\" to be sure--red lanterns, red walls, red light. There were postcards of Taiwan lined up in right above the tables all around the room, that made me wonder what the owners longed for, especially when Zizou, whose family is from Taiwan, told me the staff were speaking Mandarin with a Beijing accent. Unlike many of the restaurants we normally go to in San Francisco and New York, this restaurant could not be bare-boned. It had to prove its Chinese-ness to its non-Chinese clientele.At the same time, the menu was oddly reassuring in its Spanish translations. There was very little in the way of bird's nest soup or abalone, and the chicken, beef, and pork that was there was translated in a way that claimed, \"This is very much like this that you already know.\" Tofu was \"queso de soya\" or \"soy cheese\"; wontons were \"raviolines.\" It made me realize how flexible American culture is, that we happily learn new words for the new foods we eat, even if we might mangle their pronunciation. We say \"panna cotta,\" not \"Italian custard,\" and \"taco\" instead of \"Mexican pancake stuffed with meat.\" In the end, what we loved about the food wasn't that it was just like the mapo tofu I've had at Grand Sichuan in Chelsea, or the dumplings we've had at Koi Palace in Daly City. Everything we ate was a little unexpected, a little surprising, and all good. Our appetizer of spicy dumplings was served in a hot, oily broth, rather than the pool of chile oil we expected, but the broth was so tangy and restorative, we spooned it up.The lamb with scallions was a little tough with gristle, but the taste of the scallions was a joy, like chewing on springtime after all the vegetable-less dishes I'd eaten. The beef with Chinese broccoli had an intense flavor of star anise, but it was curious and interesting because it had a flavor that wasn't one of the three dominant flavors in Argentine food.The best part, though, was the mapo tofu. Not only was the tofu slightly firmer and more resilient than usual, it tasted of beef! Not pork! I've seen recipes for mapo tofu that call for beef, not pork, but it just seemed so appropriately Argentine to replace the most common meat in Chinese food with their beloved beef. We first were concerned it wasn't red enough, but then we realized the red light of the restaurant was hiding the amount of chiles in the sauce. It was absolutely delicious.At one point, Zizou asked me, \"Do you think this would taste as good if we were in New York or in San Francisco?\" Probably not, given that the food tasted the way I imagine manna tasted to the starving Israelites, but in a way, it didn't really matter. It was Chinese food, the Argentine way. And that is how I fell in love with Buenos Aires.*Zizou, the alias of my privacy-seeking friend and traveling buddy.

Found in a sign-in book at the Cervecería Artesanal, a restaurant in El Chaltén:Sunday 20th March 2005-Dear Mr. Bar Man,We came in this afternoon and noticed that you were really hot.............So we brought our friend back to meet you.....Only to discover that there was a different (but equally hot guy) behind the bar....From talking to you the night before we knew a bit about you so we asked the (new) guy if he was your friend and you were traveling together.........He seemed a bit confused and so did we...........until we realized that you are in fact THE SAME GUY and must have had a shave!Patagonia is magical like that.Hot guys aside, there really is something strange, wild, and magical about Patagonia. Most of it is empty of almost everything but wind. There are no bounds to what you are looking at--the sky keeps going, as does the land. And then, in the midst of all this emptiness, there are the glaciers. There is no way to describe what a glacier looks like, only what it did to me to look at them and to feel some of the strongest yearning I have ever felt for something to exist and continue existing, no matter what were to happen to me. But after gazing and hiking and yearning, you must eat. And the best place to eat in strange, wild, and magical El Chaltén is the Cervecería Artesanal, the very same restaurant in which we found this funny story. You could almost miss it from the outside, just another wood-hewn building among others, with no clear sign indicating its name. We might have walked right by it the first day, if it weren't for the hikers who looked so happy sitting outside drinking the home-brewed cold beer. When you walk in, though, you can see immediately how much the owner loves her restaurant. The walls are papered in articles and photos, from James Dean to Leo Tolstoy, and there are sturdy, good-looking cakes on the counter. The aforementioned sign-in books are scattered on the tables, and you can spend a very pleasant afternoon flipping through the happy memories of people from France and Australia and Spain while the light streams in the windows. It is always a refuge, whether it's hot or windy, and I'm sure even when it's cold. That same love and attention is obvious in the food. The salad is composed beautifully and creatively. Everything, the pears, tomatoes, celery, walnuts, blue cheese and cream, tasted clear and sure, cut and placed authoritatively in the bowl. The lamb ravioli was firm and tender at the same time; no fear of sub-par Argentine pasta here. In classic Argentine fashion, you can pair any pasta with any sauce, but I think I did well in picking the light and tangy tomato sauce.Bodegon is a good place to have a beer with some complimentary peanuts and popcorn at any time, but I highly recommend going there especially if you have camped for five days eating nothing but Knorr instant food.That is Patagonia. Yearning for something you can't even identify, and then finding happiness in a hot shower, a bowl of ravioli, and a quiet place to read funny stories.

There is no shortage of hipsters in Buenos Aires, kids in high tops with surprisingly good-looking mullets. But there is also no shortage of restaurants like El Desnivel, or Manolo, or my favorite, Nuevo Hermann, restaurants that don't seem to have changed in 50 years. It's what makes Buenos Aires feel like a rich city, rich in a diversity of lives and memories. We walked into Nuevo Hermann almost on a dare. It was just a block or two from our first apartment on Guemes in Palermo, it was our last night in Buenos Aires before we left for Patagonia, and I wanted to eat someplace that wasn't listed in any of our guidebooks, just walk in blind. I was afraid to risk not just my stomach but also that of my friend Zizou*, but I had to try it.The waiter was old and gruff. The menu was enormous. There were dishes that were vaguely German and dishes that were vaguely Spanish, and the usual gamut of Argentine meats and pastas. Milanesa, anyone? We asked him, \"What would you recommend? What is the best?\" And the answer was, \"Everything is the best.\" This was not said with much enthusiasm.But it became clear why the question was so foreign to him as we watched the restaurant fill up with regulars from the neighborhood. Elderly and middle-aged couples came in, didn't even glance at their menus, and ordered their dinners. One couple, according to Zizou, didn't even order, the waiter just brought their food. The restaurant was pristine and proud. It wasn't being retro; it wasn't even aware its time had passed. So how was the food? Zizou's pork chop was overcooked but still strong in flavor. But I was really scared when my Vienna sausage and ensalada rusa came out. I knew that my ensalada rusa, a classic Spanish tapa, would be full of mayonnaise and not in a good way, but I felt this perverse desire to order it. The sausage looked like my worst nightmares, so pink and clean and consistent. But it was delicious. The smoothness of its texture didn't mean that it was lacking in character. And even the ensalada rusa was comforting and satisfying, because it was exactly as I had expected it to be.That's why everyone else was there, to get food exactly as they expected it. To be so sure of having one's expectations met--that's a beautiful thing, isn't it?*Zizou, aka my friend and traveling companion, not Zinedine Zidane.

Scannapieco at Avenida Cordoba 4826. Flavors like Crema Armenia, a boozy fig and anise, and limoncello, as light and refreshing as anything called \"limoncello\" should be. It's true, most Argentine gelato is too sweet, but it's hard to fault a city where ice cream gets delivered by bicycle.

There were moments in Buenos Aires when I thought, \"Thank God, I chose to study Spanish in Mexico.\" These were not the moments when I was dancing till 4 a.m. or eating luscious steaks for criminal prices. I missed small-town Oaxaca the most when I sat staring at my \"ensalada caprese,\" a sorry mass of tasteless arugula, hunks of \"mozzarella\" or pizza cheese, and the saddest, blandest tomatoes to ever bear the name. To be fair, I was at an all-night eatery, as Zizou* and I had few choices after getting back to BA late at night. But Argentine traditional cooking just can't compare to the zingy surprise of a street emapanada de mole amarillo or the complex curiosity of mole negro.When there wasn't steak, there were Argentine empanadas, and as Zizou found, most empanadas were a doughy excuse to carry some meat around in an easy way. When she complained the dough was utterly forgettable, we imagined gauchos carrying them cold in their saddlebags, caring little for texture or flavor. This is where La Cupertina came in, to make us more gracious towards our host country. Located in Palermo Soho, and specializing in food from the province of Tucuman, La Cupertina is a very pretty place--heart cut-outs in the wooden chairs, green plants spilling over an antique stove. The owner, whose fame is apparent in the framed articles on one discrete wall, clearly cares a lot about what she is doing. I love people who care, and I loved her food as much as I'd hoped as we sat waiting in the sunny dining room.The empanadas were baked, the ham and cheese empanadas with sugar. The tamal, more meat than masa, was moist and so good we ordered another one after finishing the first. The locro, though, was my favorite. A traditional stew of whole corn kernels with white beans, beef, and sausage, there was an intensity and range of flavor that I'd been missing while chewing the excellent Argentine beef.Their desserts, too, are beautiful to behold, and although they were as sweet as all Argentine desserts, they weren't so singular in their sweetness. (But to be totally honest, the best empanadas we had the entire time we were there were from El Mazacote, the corner pizzeria in Montserrat. Flaky, buttery, revelatory--Zizou felt vindicated--\"I told you the dough could be flaky!\")* aka, my non-\"French soccer star\" friend and traveling companion.

Most people who love to travel are running away from something. I know this because that's why I travel. That can be bad, when you're avoiding persistent problems in your life, but it can also be good, when you ignore your preferences from back home and learn to accept things on their own terms. In short, Argentinian pizza is quite good if you accept it for what it is. Not New York pizza. Not Neopolitan pizza. Not Chicago-style, nor New Haven. But Argentinian.Our first pizza experience horrified Zizou,* and she didn't even taste it. We had gone to Kentucky Pizza (what a name!) after lots of dancing to La Bomba de Tiempo at Ciudad Cultural KONEX with some new friends. I was so hungry I ate my pizza without comment or even consciousness, but Zizou could not forget it. \"It was so thick and doughy! It looked disgusting!\"She wasn't mollified when I ordered the above fugazetta, an onion-intense pizza at Bodegon, our favorite restaurant and local brewery in El Chalten. We had just come off five days of camping, where we ate nothing other than instant oatmeal, Frutigram cookies, and gummy Knorr-mix pasta. I was not going to complain about the crazy amount of cheese or the flatbread crust. It wasn't the most delicious thing I had ever eaten, but it was good enough that I ate it cold for breakfast the next day. When we got back to Buenos Aires, and I mentioned that my former boss's grandmother had invited us to have pizza, Zizou looked scared. But it was she in the end who steered us, even before we went to dinner with Nilda, to El Cuartito, one of the oldest and most famous pizzerias in Buenos Aires. The look of relief on her face when she bit into her slice! \"It's good!\" The cabresa was layered with cheese, many pieces of longaniza (essentially pepperoni), and a strongly tomato-flavored tomato sauce, which is not a redundant thing to say in Argentina. (For a country populated by Italian immigrants, they have sadly forgotten the taste of a true tomato.) The crust was crunchy, but not doughy. The famous faina, the thin chickpea flour pancakes Argentines like to eat literally on top of their pizza slice, was tasty, too. It must be a descendent of farinata, no? It wasn't like any pizza we'd ever had before, but it had everything right-cheese, bread, and sauce.El Cuartito itself is wonderful. It proudly declares that it began in 1934, thanking its customers, their parents, and their grandparents for their patronage. The walls are covered with memorabilia, except unlike TGIF, the memorabilia has age. Marilyn Monroe sits next to Diego Maradona, as well as Muhammad Ali.But the crowning moment for Argentine pizza came on our last night, at dinner with Nilda, an 84-year-old former human rights lawyer who I would call feisty if that word didn't sound so inadequate when applied to a woman like that. Sitting at her kitchen table with her pale gold hair, she watched closely as she asked us, \"What do you think of Fidel Castro?\" This is a woman who said, \"Of course I am not Communist, just in my thoughts!\" The pizza she served us, urged on by my former boss, was from the family's favorite pizzeria, El Mazacote, a neighborhood place in Montserrat on the corner of calles Chile y Jose. It was a revelation. The dough was yeasty, chewy, flavorful. The sauce and cheese were sharp with salt.

Medialunas (literally \"half moons\") are the Argentine version of the French croissant, except they are very different and very delicious at the same time. They come in three variations--de grasa, de manteca, and dulce. The first kind is my favorite, the skinniest, more of a thin crescent than a half moon. They're almost crunchy while also being flaky and more than a little salty. The second and third, I have to confess, I have a hard time distinguishing. They both flake in softer layers and have a shiny wash of sweetness. All of them are small and lovely. I had a bagel this morning in commemoration of my return to New York, but I miss my café con leche con tres medialunas.

You may have already heard my theory on how a country's junk food reveals a lot about its culture. Ta-da, here is Argentina's rendition of the Oreo: An alfajor is two cookies bound together with a filling, dulce de leche in Argentina, and then covered in a thin layer of chocolate. Like all Spanish words that start with \"al,\" it's derived from the Arabic word for \"relleno\" or \"filled,\" and entered Spain with the Moors during the time of Al-Andalus. Hmm, that would explain their extreme intense sweetness. And then there are the chocolate cookies with beef fat in them: And cows everywhere:

I don't want to sound like an ass, but you haven't lived until you've had some whiskey on ice from the glacier you're standing on. It doesn't even need to be good whiskey. It can be Famous Grouse, and it will still leave you with a weird and wonderful feeling of chilliness, warmth and delirium.Zizou* and I arrived in El Calafate in southern Patagonia bleary-eyed and dog-tired. We'd stayed up all night drinking with new friends before getting on a 5 a.m. flight, which was unfortunately dominated by a very loud and boisterous group of French tourists. Despite being half-awake, with only one eye open, I distinctly remember hearing one of them say, \"J'ai peur! J'ai peur!\" (\"I'm afraid! I'm afraid!\") as the pilot went for a second try at landing around the giant lake. I was especially surprised that I understood what he was saying, because I don't understand spoken French.But we somehow managed to haul ourselves to our hostel, America del Sur, and to book ourselves for a \"mini-trekking\" trip on the glacier the next day from Hielo y Aventura.We approached the ice by boat on water that was a milky blue from the sediment in the glacier. Marco, our guide, was waiting for us. As Zizou said, \"Good God! You get off the boat and there's a handsome Argentine waiting for you on the dock!\" There is mucho eye candy in this country, mucho.The guides tied crampons, giant metal teeth, onto our boots, and we soon marched onto the ice in groups of ten. The crampons felt fantastic--we could walk up steep slopes like we had been given Spidey powers. Our group was the \"English-speaking group,\" though it was mainly Germans and French people, which meant we got to hear Marco say in his very flat and funny way, \"Now we go hi-gher,\" with a hard \"g.\"We marched up, we marched down, in a quiet single file, too awed by what we were seeing to say much. We walked around pools of water and looked down deep blue holes. We cupped water into our mouths, and I surreptitiously crunched on ice. The glacier, as smooth as the ice looked from far away, was made up of tiny little bits of ice, so that we were walking on a path of crunchy glass shards. We were told to wear gloves, despite it being a warm day, because if we fell, we could cut our hands.There is so much more texture and color and variation in a glacier than I'd ever imagined. I had learned, from a book, that glaciers move, but nothing could have prepared me for the sense of movement beneath my feet. From the viewing balconies, the peaks had looked like giant teeth crowded and pushed against each other. Up close, there were also soft, undulating waves that reminded me of Gaudi.Near the end, we marched up one last slope and found a little tableau, like a movie set, two small tables with glasses, a bucket, and a few bottles of whiskey. We stood around, finally laughing, while Marco poured drinks and we ate alfajores, the national sandwich cookie.The whiskey tasted sweeter than any whiskey I'd had before. I could feel happiness spreading through me. It was the best drink I have ever had.*My friend has asked me to identify her as \"Zizou\" to protect her privacy. I, unfortunately, am not a traveling companion of the great Zinedine Zidane.

In all the news coverage following the election of Barack Obama as the 44th President of the United States, one small blip involved Oprah Winfrey talking on her show about the middle-aged white man she had been leaning on, literally crying on his shoulder, during the celebratory rally in Grant Park, Chicago. Everyone called her, asking, \"Who was that man?\" And she confessed she didn't know who he was, that he was simply Mr. Man. But of course, because she is Oprah, Mr. Man was soon identified as Sam Perry, Silicon Valley entrepreneur and Obama campaign volunteer, and he appeared on her show.It's such a small thing, Oprah leaning on the shoulder of an unknown man while she cries listening to President Obama's speech, but the more I think about it, the more it encapsulates what I saw in this campaign.We won this together. We won, not just with friends and family we cajoled, but with complete strangers across the country. We won with Oprah, media mogul and superstar, and with my friend Mimi who had never volunteered for a campaign before. We won with Shaddai, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and with Joe, the union dry-wall finisher, who stood outside our polling site with me all day. We won with Chung, the woman my mother's age who made phone calls to Korean-American voters for hours, and if you are not impressed, it's because you don't know what it takes for a Korean person to call strangers. We won with the stream of men and women who came into Childs Elementary School in South Philly to vote, African-American mainly but also white and Vietnamese-American and Chinese-American. I had never seen any of them before in my life and will probably never see any of them again. But like Oprah, we felt a connection to each other that moved us to hug each other, cry together, and celebrate together. Even three days after the election, as I walk around my Brooklyn neighborhood, I smile at strangers and they, miraculously, smile back. Obama didn't just declare that we are one nation, we are one people. He made us feel it and know it in our hearts as well as our minds. I thought I had always loved my country and the ideals on which it was founded, but now I know, this is love.\"So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves, but each other.\"

Despite all my complaints, there are several things I've enjoyed as an immigration lawyer. My clients, for the most part, have been wonderful people with stories I feel truly privileged to hear. Winning, of course, always feels great. But almost as much as winning, I've loved the opportunities I've had to eat with my clients. I've eaten Dominican food at the home of the warmest Dominican family. I've been given cooking tips by an Egyptian caterer. I've tasted a crumbly and sweet anise-scented Palestinian dessert that is such a homey item, you can't buy it in stores. This one case took over my life in the weeks leading up to the trial, but I ate very well, the Middle Eastern food that I love, culminating with the amazing strategy meal I had at Assayad Restaurant in Clifton, New Jersey.But now the hearing is finally over. There's still a written summation to write and the judge won't render a decision before September, but four days of testimony have been completed. And I am no longer a lawyer. It may not be the last case I work on, but it is for the foreseeable future. So it seems like a good time to end this blog as well, for the few of you who were still expecting something new to be posted. I'm hoping to have other opportunities to write now, including working on a book on regional Korean food with a good friend of mine. But thank you to everyone who faithfully or even sporadically checked in. It was nice to have an audience!

Since I got back from my travels, I've been drawn to simpler meals and simpler flavors. Partly, it's because working two part-time jobs is exhausting. But mostly, it's because the trendy American obsession with food--and my obsession with food--has gotten a little exhausting as well. One of the things I loved most about eating in Mexico, Spain, and Korea, was how good food felt very easy. I didn't have to search for it, I didn't have to pay a lot for it, and most of the time, it came from a stand or restaurant that specialized in one thing. More and more, I want to feel that way about the food I cook and eat. I'm still drawn to recipes for Georgian chicken broiled with yogurt or Tunisian chickpea stew, things I can only cook with a carefully drawn out grocery list and a propped-open cookbook, but I'm not making three-course meals for myself these days. My favorite food memories are small and singular, one dish or sometimes even one new, bright fruit, and it feels good to be building new memories that way at home. So in that spirit, I've been cooking things like pasta in tuna-tomato sauce, or squid sauteed with bitter greens and a splash of soy sauce and lemon juice. And when I'm feeling up for a challenge, like a Rick Bayless fish enchilada recipe, I'm happy not to take on a salad, rice, and a roasted meat at the same time. That way, I can reserve energy to make my own tortillas.I can't say that I've mastered them, as easy as they are supposed to be with masa harina, the instant tortilla flour. (You can't make truly authentic tortillas at home without fresh masa dough, and because fresh masa dough goes bad so quickly, you can only get fresh masa dough in the U.S. by living next to a tortilla factory.) But they were better than the last time I tried, more flexible and less doughy in my throat. Making tortillas is almost therapeutic, to roll each ball of dough, flatten it in the tortilla press the way I'd seen women do all over the streets of Oaxaca, and toss it on a cast-iron griddle. The filling was a bit more work. There was the tomatillo-serrano sauce, made by first broiling 12 ounces of tomatillos and 2 serrano chiles under a broiler, about 5 minutes on each side. The tomatillos and chiles then melded in a food processor. In the meantime, I sauteed half a diced white onion until rich and brown, stirred in 2 chopped cloves of garlic, and when that had just cooked a minute more, the onions and garlic got added to the tomatillo-chile mixture and pureed until smooth. The whole sauce had to be transferred to a skillet to be fried, its flavor getting deeper with a bit of fish broth. Then there was the half a pound of sea bass I bought to poach. I ignored the potatoes in the recipe and focused on the fish, flaking it and then mixing it with half a cup of the tomatillo sauce. Finally, following Bayless's recipe, I added a bit of thick Greek yogurt to the remaining tomatillo sauce, since I couldn't find any creme fraiche or sour cream at the corner bodega. The assembly was the easiest part: spoon some fish on a tortilla, fold it over, and then ladle on more sauce with a sprinkling of crumbled cotija cheese (my substitution for the queso anejo I didn't have) and some chopped raw onions and cilantro. I ate nothing else that night, just these enchiladas with a beer. I was very happy.

When I told my friends I was coming to San Francisco, Erin suggested that we cook a big dinner together and invite the rest of my San Francisco friends. She and her roommate, who I will continue to call \"Zizou\" out of politeness to her and fantasy for me, share a beautiful apartment with the kind of kitchen only rich New Yorkers can dream of. It's filled with light, equipped with an island and even a prep sink, and the stove has some gaseous power that I can't even grasp, something about BTUs. All I know is that it boils up water like you wouldn't believe. We started our shopping at Alemany Market, my favorite farmers' market in San Francisco. Unlike the famed and rather bourgeois Ferry Building, Alemany doesn't truck in artisanal chocolate sprinkled with grey sea salt. So there are few tourists, and instead plenty of resident yuppies, Chinese bargain-hunters, and those who really want a live chicken, which probably overlaps more with the Chinese bargain-hunters than the yuppies. While Erin and I bought meyer lemons, strawberries, asparagus, and lilacs, Zizou took it upon herself to buy a few dozen Kumamoto oysters. She doesn't cook, but she sure knows how to eat.The rest of the meal we picked up here and there, from the prosciutto I bought at the Cafe Rouge meat counter (not so exciting) to the walnut bread Lika picked up from Tartine (unbelievable, made me feel slightly less annoyed at Tartine). And Diane brought the wine from Sonoma. She had called me the night before, telling me she was packing and wanting to know what I was serving for dinner. I momentarily forgot she makes wine for a living and asked, \"Does the food you're going to eat affect what you're going to wear?But what really amazed me is how relaxed I was planning and cooking the dinner. Partly it was that Erin was there. I don't normally cook well with others, but I trust her cooking judgment, especially when it comes to risotto. It's nice working with someone when you don't have to worry that she'll \"dice\" carrots into uneven chunks. And partly it was that after we baked our anise-almond biscotti, we took off to go eat sausages at Rosamunde's and then went for a walk at Crissy Field, where it was unusually sunny and characteristically gorgeous. I've never done that before, go somewhere in the middle of cooking an elaborate dinner for anything other than a missing ingredient. So when we ended up being late getting home, and Anne had to stir the citrus risotto for another hour after all the guests arrived, I didn't really care. I did care how good the Zuni pistachio \"aillade\" was on the roasted asparagus, which required Lika to pound away at 2 ounces of pistachios for a good 20 minutes, pulverizing them to a dust that I could bind up with a couple of tablespoonfuls of olive oil, a mashed garlic clove, a splash of grappa, orange zest and salt and pepper. If you have a friend with a powerful arm, I can't recommend this enough. The flavors blend together as you let it sit, and it's so much more complex and delicious than you could have imagined. We were torturing Elena, who's allergic to raw nuts, with our oohing and ahhing. The citrus risotto, also a Zuni recipe involving sections of grapefruit and lime, was also surprising and tasty, the tartness cutting the usual heft of risotto in my stomach. It eased the pain when it turned out the scallops were pretty low-grade.But I think the star of the show was the meyer lemon ice cream we served with anise-almond biscotti and early strawberries. Happy birthday to me!

My friend Lina asked me recently if I'd gotten tired of my blog. I protested that I hadn't, but I think I had, just a bit. But I recently spent a long weekend in San Francisco and got reinspired. I didn't have any culinary epiphanies, despite the city's reputation. In fact, I got seriously annoyed that my favorite bakery, Tartine, is no longer a place to have a quiet breakfast with a paper on a weekday morning. I think it was having an intense, packed weekend of opportunities to share good food with people I love, who I hadn't seen in so long. One of those friends even ended up taking me on an all-afternoon eating tour of the East Bay.\"Zizou\" (as she prefers to remain anonymous) did preliminary research, and as you can see, provided a full write-up as well. So I'm not going to repeat everything she said, just highlight my most lasting memories.1) We went to eleven places!2) We only ate at eight. The remaining three, we picked up food to eat later. 3) Zizou packed a cooler for stop #3, the meat counter at Café Rouge. She always carries a cooler, \"just in case.\"4) I had ice cream that rivaled Il Laboratorio del Gelato and I do not say that lightly. The Catalan flavor at Ici, started by the pastry chef from Chez Panisse, was so good, I didn't want it to end. It had a curious flavor that I didn't recognize immediately, a mixture of anise, lemon, and something else that made it special and absolutely inimitable. I ordered it in a cup, to which Zizou said, \"What! You want the cone. She'll take the cone,\" turning to the laughing ice cream scooper. She was right. The hand-rolled cone had a nugget of chocolate at the bottom.5) Vik's Chaat is as good as I'd hoped all that time I lived in San Francisco and never went there. I especially loved the chapati that came with the hyderabadi fish special--simple, flavorful, chewy, everything a flatbread should be.6) Tao Yuen in Oakland's Chinatown had crispy, not at all greasy, tofu skin rolls that I would never have believed could come out of a take-out dim sum place. I think they were 50 cents or something equally obscene.7) We found at the Cheeseboard a bigger, pizza-only place next door to the cheese shop, with an elderly musical trio performing and young, happy Californians spilling out of the restaurant and just sitting on the grassy median in the middle of the busy two-way street. Pizza as excellent as ever. I love San Francisco when it just does its own thing and doesn't worry whether its pizza crust lives up to some NY/New Haven ideal.8) Taco trucks are the best, always.I did eat dinner afterwards. I told Anne I had to eat vegetables, and she, former Midwestern carnivore, suggested we go to Greens, where I had a very simple and refreshing salad of greens, celery root, cheese, and butter beans. I was embarrassed that the waiter might think I was the kind of woman who only orders salad, but he praised my choice, saying, \"Beautiful! That's my favorite salad!\" I was in such a good mood, I only giggled quietly and was thankful for all that the Bay Area had bestowed upon me that day.

Remember when I was forced by Mexican airport security to leave my molcajete behind in Oaxaca? It's now at home with me in Brooklyn!My friend Katherine, who lives in Oaxaca and was coincidentally on the same plane as me that day, heard the whole story and decided to check if the airline had kept it when she flew back home. The airline official weirdly accused of her lying about being my friend and being on that flight, as if she had the nefarious desire to steal a Mexican mortar and pestle. But he did give it to her and this week, she emailed me to tell me she was coming to NY and did I want my molcajete! I never imagined I would ever see this little pig again. It must be a sign. I'm not sure of what, but something good, don't you think?

I got this last month ago as a late Secret Santa gift from a good friend of mine. She \"published\" my blog posts from Mexico and Spain on lulu.com. I was really touched. I cried! I also felt secretly proud--I had no idea I'd written so much.

Tuesdays, I generally work from home, which meant that instead of obsessively reading every scrap of information coming out of the primaries in Ohio and Texas (and Rhode Island and Vermont), I tried to calm my nerves by making a very slow-cooked chickpea, celery, and porcini soup with pecorino cheese, from Paula Wolfert's \"The Slow Mediterranean Kitchen: Recipes for the Passionate Cook.\" I must be the kind of person Paula Wolfert thinks is \"passionate,\" even all by my lonesome, because I love this book.It was a very slow soup, even when I halved the following ingredients:1 cups dried chickpeas¼ t. baking sodasalt½ oz. dried porcinipinch of sugar3 imported bay leaves½ cup extra virgin olive oil1 medium onion, grated in a food processor2 garlic cloves2 cups thinly sliced celery ribs1/8 t. Italian or Greek oreganofreshly ground pepperpinch of hot pepper flakescurls of pecorino or manchego cheeseIt had to be started the night before, with the dried chickpeas soaking in water with a little bit of baking soda, and the dried porcini mushrooms soaking in its own water with a pinch of sugar in the fridge. I followed the directions very precisely.The next morning, I grated a small onion in my food processor and placed it with the chickpeas, 2 bay leaves, 3 T. of olive oil, a pinch of salt, and water to cover the chickpeas by an inch in my small two-quart dutch oven. Paula Wolfert says you're supposed to use a clay pot like the Italian peasants, though you can buy a sand pot that works just as well in Chinatown. I figured a French-made Staub was good enough.This part was freaky--I put it in a cold oven, cranked the heat to 450 degrees, and then let it sit for 30 minutes. Then I turned it down to 250 degrees and let it cook for three hours. Yes, three hours.When the three hours had almost expired, I heated a garlic clove in a pan of hot olive oil for a little bit, then tossed in the celery and oregano for about 2 minutes. I added the drained, chopped porcini mushrooms with the soaking liquid, then the chickpeas and its cooking liquid, and a little more water. I also added a cup of homemade chicken stock, even if the recipe didn't call for it. It bubbled away on medium heat for 20 more minutes. How easy is that?And then it was done. Just a good amount of salt, generous amounts of freshly ground pepper, a pinch of hot pepper flakes, and curls of pecorino cheese.The soup was wonderful. It was warming and satisfying, so much more than you would imagine chickpeas, celery, and mushrooms to be. The chickpeas had an honest texture you never get in canned beans, the mushroom flavor was silky smooth, and the cheese added an intense salty sharpness. I loved it. I love even more that like so many Paula Wolfert recipes, it comes from peasants who can't be bothered by complicated steps, resulting in directions so simple I could more or less recite them to you by heart.So there was one bright spot that Tuesday.

Have you ever followed a recipe that didn't make any sense?I like to think that even if I am not quite a great cook, I do increasingly have a good sense of what it takes to make something bind together, to be fluffy, to rise. In short, to taste good. So I was perplexed when I saw this ridiculously simple recipe from Patricia Wells's, \"Bistro Cooking\":Tourte Aux Blettes (Savory Swiss Chard Tart) (paraphrased)Pastry:1 cup flour¼ t. salt¼ cup extra-virgin olive oilFilling:1 lb. swiss chard leavesSalt and freshly ground pepper3 large eggs1 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese1. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees.2. Combine flour and salt; add 1/4 cup water and then the oil, mixing until thoroughly blended. After kneading briefly, the dough will be very moist like cookie dough. Press dough into loose-bottomed metal tart tin.3. Wash and dry the leafy portion of the chard and coarsely chop the leaves. Wilt the leaves in a skillet, seasoned to taste with salt and pepper. Heat until most of the water has evaporated.4. Combine the eggs and grated cheese; add the chard and pour mixture into the pan.5. Bake for about 40 minutes, until crust and filling are golden.Perplexed, yet intrigued. I thought all pastry crusts had to made with butter and rapidly, to keep the butter cold and the pastry flaky. As I pressed the crumbly olive oil-colored dough into my springform pan (no tart pan), I thought, thank God I'm only making this for myself. Then the three eggs seemed so meager, just barely swimming around the cooked chard. How could it be so easy to make a tart?It turns out I know nothing about the physics of cooking, because the recipe worked just fine. In fact, it was quite good and as easy as it appears, and the kind of recipe you can follow after coming home after work with only a vague desire to cook that bunch of swiss chard in your fridge, though you do have to be prepared to eat your sliver of a tourte at 9:15 pm. (And that is easy enough if you have only recently returned from Spain, where they do not think of eating before 9 pm.) I didn't have a glass of crisp white wine as recommended by Patricia Wells, but I did have a glass of refreshing Pernod. God, I love the taste of licorice.Despite being in my pajamas, I felt almost like one of those French girls that get described as \"effortlessly chic.\"

I tried again, this time with napa cabbage instead of daikon radish. I went the easy route, cutting up the cabbage after brining it for almost 6 hours, instead of the more traditional, more beautiful way of keeping the cabbage whole, with all its nooks and crannies filled and rubbed with spicy paste. But it's still not quite what I was looking for. Last time, it was too much ginger. This time, too much salt. Sigh.

I attempted to make kimchi last year, but did not have a reliable recipe. I used daikon and regular white cabbage. As it turned out, it wasn't bad, but not great, either.One aspect in which I lack confidence is the addition of seafood products to it. I used ground, dried shrimp, from a mercado here in Mexico.Th photo of *your* kimchi looks great.

You know, I think that kimchi is like good pie crust--it just takes a sense of feel that only comes with a lot of practice. I was researching for the cookbook, and it turns out the shrimp is fermented, so I don't think dried shrimp alone would do it. Even Vietnamese fish sauce would probably be better.

Raj tried to warn me. \"A lot of the sauces all taste the same. Some of the dishes taste better the next day!\" After almost a year of trying to get to Tangra Masala for Indian-Chinese food (the Indian take on Chinese food, the way chop suey is the American take on Chinese food), Raj and I finally made it to Sunnyside, Queens last Wednesday. The friends we had invited to come along had bailed at the last minute, pleading that Queens was too much, even Raj's friends who live in Queens. I think Raj was worried that I would be disappointed, after all of the hullabaloo. He said, with great earnestness, that Tangra Masala reminded him of better food eaten elsewhere.But how could I be disappointed, when I was presented with this? True, as much as the chili paneer sizzled, it didn't make me swoon. The vegetable tangra masala turned out to be vegetable fritters in gravy, the \"lollypop chicken\" to be fried chicken drumsticks in an adorable shape, but with a batter that was a bit too bready. Everything had that yummy, salty, satisfying flavor of take-out Chinese, but with nothing that would make me take the G train to the 7 train for on a weekly basis. Maybe every couple of months or so.Still, I was so happy to be eating something I had never eaten before, within city limits even. And such video!

There is a part of me that not-so-secretly loves Martha Stewart. I get a thrill when I'm having friends over for brunch, and I see the sunlight streaming into my kitchen onto the white tablecloth with the flowers in the middle, the matching cups and saucers, and my beloved juice glasses. But in the end, this little glee is nothing compared to my deep, adamant, heartfelt conviction that none of it really matters. I may not believe in God, but I believe in breaking bread. I don't think people should be afraid to have people over because they don't have space or time or matching plates. Or even because they think they can't cook. There can be as much fun and happiness over a pot of chili as over a three-course meal starting with foie gras. Given how some of my friends feel about foie gras, probably more.So as part of my new evangelism, I made a New Year's resolution to start hosting a monthly soup night. Just soup. I would happily accept drinks or dessert contributions, and not worry about whether they \"matched\" what I had made. With the money I would have spent on an occasional three-course dinner, I could have more people over more often, and even buy a couple of extra bowls. And since it was a New Year's resolution, I kicked it off with Korean dumpling soup for Lunar New Year.Some people ate in shallow soup bowls, some ate in giant salad bowls, and some with teaspoons, but nobody cared. I was so happy. The dumplings could have used more salt and soy sauce, but hey, that's why you put salt on the table, right? I'm so excited about March and April and May...

That's not quite accurate, as they're still saying hello, over and over, to pancetta and bacon and sausages braised with plums. They've just recently decided that considering the environmental impact of meat, they will stop eating big, giant chunks of meat. But being who they are, they are saying goodbye with a bang. They said goodbye to beef in December with 20 lbs. of spareribs. And they said goodbye to pork this weekend with an almost 9-lb piece of pork butt. When I told Lina I was coming to visit her this weekend in Providence, she immediately responded, \"What do you want to do? Do you want to smoke a pork butt?\" I love Lina. I told her I wanted to leave around 3 pm on Sunday and she said, \"No problem, we'll just get a small, 6-lb. butt and smoke it starting Sunday morning, have a late lunch, and put you on the bus.\" But then we got to the store, and Ookie couldn't resist buying a 8.75-lb. pork butt: \"It's on sale!\" He brushed the logistical problems off, saying, \"We'll just smoke it overnight!\"He seemed so excited, I didn't make my usual protestations as a houseguest who doesn't want to make too much trouble. This is a guy who lives in a house with no walls, as they're still renovating it, but owns a 100-lb. gorgeous smoker/grill. Lina and I went off to Boston Saturday night to see our friend Leslie, and as I hesitated over my second drink, wondering if I would be sober enough to rub the butt when we got home, Lina assured me, \"You're worried about the pork? The butt is rubbed!\" And true enough, when we got home, the butt was thoroughly rubbed with paprika, cayenne, cumin, and garlic powder; there was a sauce pan of homemade barbecue sauce on the stove; and a bowl of vinegar-based \"North Carolina\"-style sauce for basting on the counter. I hope one day, like Lina, to marry a man I can trust to rub the butt while I'm out having drinks with my girlfriends. The next morning, Lina told me that Ookie had gotten up at 5 a.m. to add more coal to the grill. I was so moved. By the time we woke up around 10:30, the fire had gone out, but we just reheated the pork while we roasted some brussel sprouts, made corn muffins (to make it seem more like breakfast), and tossed a green salad. The pork butt was beautiful. It had a serious crust, excitingly spicy, with tender, fatty pink meat inside. I don't think I've ever had a butt quite like that, not from Daisy Mae's, not in Nashville. It was the most beautiful butt I had ever seen. I couldn't believe how well-behaved their dog was, just lying there next to the table. If I were a dog, smelling those smells, I would have been going crazy. The brussel sprouts were creamy and warm on the inside, the salad was simple and sharp, the corn muffins a little too sweet, but fun to eat. I felt so proud to call Lina and Ookie my friends, and thankful I was not saying goodbye to pork.P.S. This is Ookie's account of what went into the rub and the barbecue sauce:\"i didn't exactly follow a recipe. the rub was roughly 1-2 tablespoons each ofpaprikacayenne pepperonion powderblack pepperand 1-2 teaspoons each ofground fennel seedcoriandercuminsaltmustard powder (we didn't have any this time)garlic powderthe barbecue sauce was2 cups of ketchup1/2 cup of molasses1/4 cup of mustard3 tablespoons of worcester sauce1-2 tablespoons of onion powder (or a diced onion)the rest was some combination of the spices used in the rub. previously, we traded some cayenne pepper for a couple tablespoons of tabasco.\"Whatever you're doing, it works!

My last night in Madrid, I ended up tapas-hopping with a fellow chowhound from the New York region. He had seen my blog and was very complimentary. I was particularly flattered when a week or so later, he suggested that I submit my blog to the James Beard Foundation awards, in the category of new media. He even offered to pay the $100 application fee. I turned him down, partly because the previous winners were real food journalists, but mostly because I don't really want to be a food writer. I don't think food is really that important. I write about food, in a world where every schmuck has a blog, because right now, I don't know how else to talk about the things I care about. I don't know how else to show and not tell that I love my mother, that I miss my friends who've moved away, that I value things made with care and by hand, that I love traditions that are proud but alive with change. It's like the most over-used MFK Fisher quote, \"It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love, are so mixed and mingled and intertwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it...and then the warmth and richness and fine reality of hunger satisfied...and it is all one.\" Such a poor example of her writing. It's so much better to read the rest of \"Gastronomical Me,\" and see what a filter and prism food is for the things that really matter to her. And it's so much better for me to stop this paragraph now and tell you what I ate in Koreatown last Friday.I asked my friend to meet at Gam Mee Ok on 32nd Street because I've been craving Korean food like a pregnant woman since I left Seoul. Even if I don't eat a Korean meal everyday, I dip into the kimchi in my fridge almost everyday, the way I used to snack on olives or bits of cheese. I'm sitting here now with a glass of wine and a bowl of my homemade radish kimchi. Everything looked fine. There was their famous kimchi, fiery red-orange, with cabbage all mixed in with the giant chunks of radish. There was the clay jar of sliced scallions, the little pot of salt to add to the sullongtang, or beef stew, the specialty of the house.But the soup tasted flat. The rice in it clumped unappetizingly together. The broth had no body, and no amount of sharp scallions or salt or pepper was going to save it. The noodles were mushy. I ate nearly all of it anyway, beggars can't be choosers, but I was so disappointed. Even the kimchi was bad, sour and not in a good way. Gam Mee Ok had always been one of my favorites, the best place to go if your Korean friends have kept you out till 4 a.m. in a seedy karaoke room. Clearly, those memories of fabulous hot beef soup are very, very old.It may be that the place has gone downhill, or it may be that I am too fresh from memories of my mother's superlative cooking. But it's definitely another spur to make Korean food happen for myself.

great blogging! I can't help myself from not commenting on your Gam Mee Ok review. This is my favorite Ktown joint because of that awesome soup. I guess it's possible there you were there on a bad night, but I can say that I go there often enough over the last couple of years (especially this time of year) to always leave VERY satisfied. Note: I like to ask for a little extra kimchi sauce to add in my soup. Simply Delicious!

With all due respect to Martin Luther King, Jr., the best thing about this long weekend was that I finally had time to sit down and make some kimchi. I can't tell you how it turned out, as I need to wait a few days for it to ripen, but I'm not very hopeful. Right now, it tastes sort of raw and angry, not too spicy, but perhaps a bit too much ginger. Maybe its flavors will mellow and blend as time goes by. But it was my fault, I didn't follow any one recipe, sort of picking and choosing among two different recipes and then ignoring instructions when I felt like it.I started with a big daikon radish, about 3.5 lbs., that I peeled and cut into large chunks, feeling gratitude towards my friend Diane who gave me a giant cleaver for my 30th birthday. Then I tossed it all with two tablespoons of salt and let it sit for 20 minutes, draining it at the end.In the meantime, I minced 1 teaspoon each of garlic and ginger and 6 stalks of green onions. I measured out the Korean fish sauce that's used specifically for kimchi making and 6 big tablespoons of ground Korean red pepper. I ignored the instructions to add shrimp because I didn't have any, and I didn't know what kind to buy. It was fun, if a little scary, to rub all the ground red pepper into the radish cubes. Then everything else got tossed in, I packed it all into a big Tupperware I'd bought just for this purpose and set it on the windowsill. According to my cookbook, I would have to let it sit for 24 hours in room temperature to begin the fermentation process. So after 24 hours, what can I tell you? It's started, but I don't know yet how it'll taste 2 or 5 days from now. To a certain extent, kimchi will just keep changing and there's a certain joy in eating new kimchi and a different joy in eating riper kimchi. But there are kimchis where there is no joy at all. In a way, this kind of cooking is particularly good for the anxious soul--you have to learn to let go and just see what happens, and then be willing to try again.Korean food isn't hard to make. Fermentation, or pickling, just happens if you put the right things together. The hard part is figuring out which combinations make for best balance of flavors. My little Korean lunch, a spicy soft tofu stew, was the same way, not bad but not great. I miss my mother more than ever.

You know, it still tastes kind of raw and too gingery. But I'm enjoying it by thinking it as a salad more than as a pickle. I also bought some salted shrimp, so I'm going to do another go-around before Lunar New Year.

I had all this stuff I planned to write about, even video footage of bulgogi bubbling away on a copper grill at Sariwon, but nothing made me want to write until I tasted the pasilla chile-honey sauce on the seared pork I made last night. Rick Bayless calls it \"Borrego (o Puerco) al Pasilla Enmielado.\" The Spanish syllables just roll off your tongue as smooth as the sauce, no? Be sure to roll the double \"r\" in \"borrego.\"I'd been easing my way back into cooking. One of the first things I did when I got back was to sign up for a new shift at the Park Slope Food Coop so I could get back into the store--I am now \"food prep,\" which I am told secretly means \"cheese taster.\" I made a trip to Koreatown to stock up on Korean groceries, including a daikon radish the size of my calf that I plan to turn into kimchi. But I started with cooking just one-plate meals, feeling sort of overwhelmed by how busy life is when you actually have to work. Soon, though, I felt sort of itchy but also scared. I needed other people to eat what I cooked, but I needed them to be people I could treat as guinea pigs without fearing the loss of their friendship. My original supper club of Brooklyn friends was perfect, appreciative yet forgiving. They raved about the tomatillo-avocado guacamole, which was really excellent, with a subtle but lingering kick from the roasted serrano chiles. They didn't say anything about the jicama sticks with chile powder, lime juice and salt, but they ate almost all of them. Magda said the Mexican white rice was cooked perfectly, and truly it was, baked according to Bayless's precise directions. The black beans were not so exciting, despite the epazote I went all the way to Sunset Park to find, but it wasn't a total waste of trip since I got to practice speaking Spanish. I'll have to keep trying and find out. The homemade tortillas were similarly, at best, an inspiration to keep trying, they were so sad and small. But the chocolate pound cake was a hit with the birthday girl, whose husband had tipped me off to her favorite flavor.The star of the table, though, was the seared pork and sweet potatoes in pasilla-honey sauce. It was worth every little thing I had to do to get in on the table: 1) Scrub my cast iron griddle with steel wool and reseason it after my sublettor left it rusty.2) Take the R train to Sunset Park on a Sunday morning to find flexible, fresh pasilla chiles.3) Slice open the chiles to remove the seeds and stems. 4) Lay them flat and toast them on the griddle one at a time, pressing on each side for a few seconds.5) Rehydrate them in warm water for 30 minutes.6) Put them through the food processor with roasted garlic, a bit of cumin, freshly ground pepper, and Mexican oregano.7) Sear chunks of pork in batches.8) Add the chile sauce, fry, and then simmer with beef broth for 30 minutes.9) Add the sweet potatoes and simmer for another 30 minutes.10) Add just enough honey for an \"edge\" of sweetness (Bayless's very precise wording) and salt to round it out.Seriously, it was worth it. (For the full recipe, buy his book, \"Mexican Kitchen,\" as the man deserves every cent of his royalties.) The pasilla chiles had a bitter flavor that tasted almost like ash when I first ground it up into a paste. It had me considering a last-minute pizza delivery order. But it magically took on an amazingly smoky, rich flavor as it cooked and absorbed the flavors of the meat and the broth. Even before I added the honey, it tasted insane--I had been crazy to consider pizza. When I added the honey, my head exploded. It was like Emily Dickinson's definition of poetry, except it was pork.Decorated with slices of white onion and cilantro, it looked quite pretty, too. Along the way, this blog became a travel food log, with little amateur assessments of empanadas on the streets of Oaxaca, tripe stew in Barcelona's La Boqueria market, and the Kimchi Field Museum in Seoul, but I'm so happy to be reminded that what I love best, what really makes me glad I've come home, is cooking for people I love.

What about naengmyon?

\"What about naengmyon? Such a wonderful commingling of parts -- chewy gray noodles! Cold savory broth! Sweet grainy pear! Salty pickled radish! Vinegar, mustard! Pretty boiled egg!\"This is how my sister feels about mul naengmyon, the Korean dish of chewy buckwheat noodles in a very clear, very fine cold beef broth. She feels pretty strongly about bibim naengmyon, too, which are the same noodles also served cold, but in a sweet, spicy red pepper sauce, rather than the beef broth. I've never shared Mona's passion for naengmyon. There's nothing like a cool bowl of naengmyon on a hot summer day, but there is also so much mediocre naengmyon out there, I had forgotten how good it could it be. But yesterday, having lunch at Hanwoori, I had a naengmyon epiphany. It is one of \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia\".It was easy to forget because unlike some of the other contenders, naengmyon is a difficult food. Nine times out of ten, a bowl of pho or ramen will be perfectly tasty, if not sublime. Naengmyon, on the other hand, will be utterly forgettable nine times out of ten. The tenth time, it will be sublime.The biggest challenge with mul naengmyon is the broth. If the idea of a cold meat broth turns you off, there's a reason. It has to be carefully clarified, skimmed of all fat, rich in flavor and yet still clear and light, without the heavy gelatinous mouth-feel of most meaty stocks. The broth and the noodles are the main players, so they must not be overwhelmed with garnishes, but a few thin slices of pickled cucumber and radish, sweet Asian pear, cold sliced beef, and half a \"pretty boiled egg\" add just the right amount of contrast in texture, crunch, and flavor. Even if a perfect bowl comes out of the kitchen, you the eater have to be careful with the last-minute condiments of a spicy mustard and vinegar. The perfect proportion will make the broth sing; too much of either will muddy the broth and no amount of adding the other will ever restore the balance. Bibim naengmyon is not much easier. There's no cold beef broth to deal with, but the sweet, spicy sauce is surprisingly hard to get right. I've had so many bowls of bibim naengmyon that were too spicy, too sweet, or too much of both, as if the cook hoped to simply overwhelm my tastebuds to hide his lack of skill. At Hanwoori, only a small amount to just coat the noodles was sufficient to make the noodles perfect. It was just spicy, sweet, and tart enough to tease you into wanting more.Naengmyon is a culinary lodestar. It reminds me that the best food is made with balance, restraint, and care. The best food can't be eaten everyday or wherever you want--there is no good naengmyon in Manhattan. Most of the time, I will still choose what is more easily satisfying--like ramen during a layover at the Tokyo airport--because warm satisfaction is good for the soul. But it's equally good for the soul to occasionally eat and know there are foods like Hanwoori naengmyon out there.

Sometimes, I wonder if I am just another victim of the American trend for slow food, organic food, localism, and food obsession in general. And then I have a day like last Wednesday, when my mother hustled me out of the house at 10:40 a.m. so we would be sure to arrive at 버드나무집, Budnamujip to have a bowl of short rib soup before they all sold out by 11:10. I'm a victim of heredity. Budnamujip is a grand old dame of a restaurant. It's famous for its galbi, or barbecued short ribs, both marinated and unmarinated, with the unmarinated ones being even more expensive because the quality of the meat is that much higher. (You generally have to reserve orders of the unmarinated galbi before you get there.) One order of unmarinated meat costs about 68,000 won, about $70, and many people order more than one order per person, plus stew or cold noodles after the grilling is done. Filled with smoke, fronted with a glass butchering shop, and waitresses in ugly uniforms running around, it's the Korean equivalent of a glorious, old-school steakhouse.But we weren't there to eat grilled short ribs. Its lunchtime 갈비탕, galbi-tang, or short rib soup, for 12,000 won a bowl, has its own following. As my mother puts it, for some people, eating this soup once a week is their joy in life. We actually ran into one of those people and his wife, family friends who come every Sunday and holiday, when he can close his doctor's office. Today was Election Day, so they came with plans to eat and then to vote.We were the first car to pull into the parking lot at 10:50, and the restaurant wasn't open yet, so we went for a walk around the block. By the time we got back 5 minutes later, there were already 10-15 people waiting in line. When the restaurant finally opened its inner doors to the downstairs dining room, the crowd moved expertly inside and quickly spread out, claiming their tables, one, two, three.Once everyone was seated, a waiter came by and handed out little laminated tickets with numbers on them. Four orders of galbi-tang at our table, so four tickets. There are 100 tickets. If you don't get one of them, tough luck, no galbi-tang for you!Once the restaurant knew who was getting a bowl of galbi-tang, no other questions were asked. Every table got the same side dishes, cubed radish kimchi, garlic scape kimchi, white water radish kimchi, and a spicy lettuce salad. Then everyone just sat there patiently for 45 minutes, secure in their possession of one of the precious galbi-tang tickets.They arrived. Huge, steaming bowls of chopped up short ribs in a broth with chopped scallions and glistening drops of fat on the surface. The ribs crowded the stainless steel bowl that was almost as big as my head. As they say in Korean, it was time to \"rip the meat off with our teeth.\"This is the kind of experience I would heartily recommend to any chowhound, but with a major caveat. You must, you must be okay with ripping meat off the bone with your teeth. You must be okay with tendon and meat and fat all crowded together on the same bit of rib, the way it grows on a cow. It is socially acceptable to eat around the parts you don't like, but there is no way to eat this meat without picking the bone up with your hands and gnawing on it. For about 30 minutes, there was no conversation, just the sound of us chewing and discarding our bones in the bowls left on the table for just this purpose. When there was no meat left, there was the beautiful broth to concentrate on. Like liquid gold, so rich, so smooth. I drowned the rice in my soup like a little kid, loving the way the rice grains soaked up broth, too. Whenever the richness got almost too overwhelming, there was the excellent kimchi to cut through the fat on your tongue.Our family friends, Mr. and Mrs. Kim, asked if there were restaurants in New York where people lined up to eat even before the restaurant opened. \"Oh yes,\" I said, thinking of Prune. \"But not for food like this!\"(Merry Christmas! I'm off to Guam for a few days with my family. If I eat anything noteworthy on Guam, I'll let you know.)

Be forewarned, what follows are less delicate aspects of Korean cuisine.In Mexico, people would often express surprise when I sat down to eat barbecued goat or a spicy stew of innards. I would shrug and merely say, \"But I'm not really American, I grew up in Korea,\" and immediately, the questioners would nod understandingly. I wish I could say my willingness to eat all kinds of random things comes from great bravery and open-mindedness, but it's because I grew up never really knowing what I was eating. I love tripe. I love it cooked in tomato sauce at Babbo, I love it in meaty Korean soups, I love it in a warm Spanish stew. But growing up, I thought it was lamb. The word in Korean for tripe is 양 or yang, which happens to be the same word for lamb. Somewhere in my little kid head, I thought the curly fur of the lamb somehow got transferred to its meat, resulting in the curly, rough surface of the tripe. I had no such excuse for not knowing what 족발, jokbal is. After all, it literally means \"pig foot.\" But I somehow never put \"pig\" and \"foot\" together, probably because I was so distracted by how much I loved the contrast between the simple boiled pork meat, the extremely chewy fat, and the salty, shrimpy sauce in which it's traditionally dipped. It is really, really chewy, as Koreans just love chewy things.Don't knock it till you try it.순대, soondae, I do take credit for simply being brave even if no one ever told me it was blood sausage, because only an exceptional kid, or perhaps a supremely uncurious one, would eat something so dark and strange. I have a vague memory of some kid telling me that the casing was intestine, but I thought she was just trying to scare me. The filling is mainly rice, and blood of course, though many places will also add chopped up Korean glass noodles. Actually, the noodles scared me more; I thought they might be worms. I figured out it must be blood sausage only a few years ago, when I learned about the existence of blood sausage in other cultures. (That's liver on the left--one thing I've never liked.)I am proud of my Korean heritage for many reasons, but particularly thankful that when organ meats became cool, I was ready.

1) Fried food is delicious. 2) Fried food is at its most delicious when it has just come out of the fryer.These are two difficult truths, when one is eating fried food at home instead of a restaurant. It means the smell of hot oil and whatever has been fried can't dissipate before the dinner guests arrive. It means that the cook will not be a gracious host when the dinner guests do arrive, because she will still be frying and frantic. The best way to deal with this problem is to only fry for those you love and who love you. These people will not care that you are still in an apron splattered with batter, they will not care that they will also smell like fried potatoes or chicken or codfish potato balls. Best of all, they will be willing to just stand around the stove and eat the hot little goodies with their fingers.I know this is the best way because the best fried chicken I've had at home was last week with my mom, when we fried chicken wings on our portable stove and ate them right in the kitchen.My father was out to dinner with his friends, and I wanted to learn how to make the dish I have loved my entire life. Our camp stove has never seen a campsite, but it is very useful at home when you want to avoid grease splatter all over your real stove. My mom laid out a bunch of newspapers on the kitchen table and placed her wok and the camp stove on top. She quickly made a crisp, raw salad for me, but we didn't bother to set the table or make anything else. Instead, we focused on the chicken. She showed me every step and we sat together in the kitchen, alternating frying, eating, and laughing. I don't know if this is a particularly Korean way to fry chicken, as it's different from the \"Korean fried chicken\" I had with my cousin. My mom couldn't remember how or why she had started frying it this way, only that we all loved it. I think the key is that the chicken is seasoned with garlic, green onion, salt and pepper, before the potato starch batter is applied. Or it might be that my mom has always used wing meat and eating such small pieces makes it as addictive as popcorn. Maybe it's just something I love because it's from my childhood, as it's quite simple and sometimes a bit greasy if we wait too long to eat. But when I bite into it fresh from the fryer, and my mouth is burning from the heat and the juices squirting from the meat, I can't stop because it tastes so good.I'm sorry the amounts and directions are so approximate; that's the way my mom cooks.Ingredients:2 lbs. chicken wings 2-3 T. chopped garlic2-3 T. chopped green onion1.5 T saltpepper to tastea little less than 1 T. sesame seed oil1.5 cups of potato or sweet potato starchcorn oil1. Prepare the chicken by removing excess fat and making small cuts in the chicken meat to help it cook faster.2. Add garlic, green onion, salt, pepper, and sesame seed oil to the chicken. Let it sit for 30 minutes to an hour.3. Prepare batter by adding water to potato starch. The batter should be slightly thick, like pancake batter. Add more starch or water as necessary.4. Add the chicken to the batter and mix well. The batter will not completely cover the chicken and obscure its meat, though it will when cooked.5. Heat oil for frying. The oil should be sufficient for the chicken to float in it. (My mom doesn't bother with a thermometer, but it is important to wait until the oil is hot enough and not to use an oil like olive oil that will start to smoke before it gets hot enough. When I try this back in NY, I will definitely reread the oil section in Harold McGee's \"On Food and Cooking\" and make sure my oil is at the right temperature.)6. Once the oil is ready, add the chicken to the pan. Don't crowd the pan and fry the chicken in batches, taking all the chicken out before putting more in as that will cause greater fluctuations in the temperature of the oil. After 10-15 minutes, the chicken should be done. It won't be completely golden brown, more brown in spots, as the potato starch makes a mainly white batter.7. Eat while hot!

Thanks for this recipe! I vaguely remember jotting down notes about potato starch as I watched your mom fry us chicken years ago (back when you didn't realize just how amazing her cooking was ;P). I don't remember anything about marinating in garlic! She must have left that family secret out when I was snooping around in her kitchen.

My sister and I invented a game a few years ago in which one person gives the other two foods (or ingredients or flavors), and that person then has to say which one she would give up for the rest of her life if she had to choose. Chocolate or vanilla? Salt or sugar? Basil or mint? There are no other rules, but we both get mad when someone says something like, \"Bacon or pumpkin?\" Only people who don't care what they eat make this kind of error. Sure, there's no winner, but it's a lot of fun to play while you're waiting for the bus, and if you're playing with someone like my friend Leslie, you can torture her by asking, \"Noodles or rice?\"It's shocking how hard this question is for a girl who grew up in Rome, but even putting aside the category of Italian pasta, the mere existence of a dish like Korean handmade knife-cut noodles should make the answer clear. And 칼국수, kalguksu, doesn't even belong in the \"Top Five Noodles Dishes of Asia\" pantheon! That is how deep that field is.This is another dish I didn't appreciate until I ended up in the impoverished Korean-food land of New York City. (This is one area in which Los Angeles beats New York's ass.) My family's favorite place to eat these noodles in Seoul is at 산동칼국수, Sandong Sone Kalguksu, which translates into Sandong Handmade Knife-Cut Noodles, located close to the Yangjae subway station. On its business card, it lists right under its name the following three words: \"Giant Dumplings--Korean Boiled Pork--Cold Noodles,\" but as the name declares, the knife-cut noodles are the best. On each table, you can find an urn of kimchi, from which you serve yourself throughout the meal. This kimchi has a strong, sharp flavor, but it's still a little raw with almost crunchy cabbage leaves, and therefore not that sour. You might think you only need to fill the little dish provided for this purpose, but my family ends up emptying almost the entire urn.The noodle soup is also clean and simple. The broth has the clear, light flavor of anchovy-broth, with some body that likely comes from dashi. The noodles have that irregularity so dear to the hearts of all those who love homemade noodles. They have that important bite, not the Italian al dente standard, but an exemplary chewiness that is so prized by Koreans in a range of foods, there's a word for it, 쫄깃, cholgeet. You say it twice, cholgeet-cholgeet, if it's really deliciously chewy. Piled on top of the noodles are a good number of clams, a little gritty but who's complaining at 5,000 won a bowl? And then there are strips of dried seaweed, carrot, and zucchini, which add a little flavor and a lot of color, which is an important principle in Korean cooking. It's not a zingy food. It's not the kind of thing that will make fireworks go off in your brain, and I can imagine some non-Koreans might even think it a little bland. But that's what the kimchi is for, and there are days when nothing is as satisfying as a restorative soup of handmade, knife-cut noodles. The answer for me is always the same, \"Noodles forever!\"

Are you and Ookie arguing about which of your families' recipes are the best? So funny, I grew up not even realizing other people did things differently. Did you know North Koreans put long beans and potatoes in their kimchi jjigae? And people in the far South put two kinds of kimchi and no tofu?

You know how when you're young, you don't think of your parents as real people? For a long time, I felt that way about Korean food. It wasn't food in the way Malaysian nasi lemak is food or Oaxacan mole is food, something to be fascinated by. It was like air, something I didn't notice until it was gone, when I realized I was truly living alone and no one was going to make Korean food for me.Even worse, I realized I didn't even know that much about Korean food. I would start to answer questions on Chowhound and then stop because I didn't even know the right name for that whole-radish kimchi I like so much, the one that's shaped like an elongated pear. (It's 총각김치, chonggak kimchi!) I can't identify half of my favorite 나물, namul, or vegetable 반찬, banchan--I just think of them all as \"mountain vegetables.\" Though I should be able to identify at least one; my mom was picking it off the ground in Fort Greene Park when she came to visit. This is why I ended up peering at plastic kimchi last week at the Kimchi Field Museum on the second basement level of the COEX Mall. My mom and I had a hell of time finding it; the mall must be designed to make you lose direction and just shop until you get out. By the time we got there, her bad knee was acting up and so we sat down next to a rack of magazines and books and kimchi, found a very authoritative one written in Japanese, and started to flip through it together. My mom didn't need to understand the text to explain everything to me with happy familiarity. It was like she was flipping through a family album, except instead of saying, \"This is your crazy Second Uncle,\" she was saying, \"This is chonggak kimchi, a really delicious one, your aunt loves it. She always says, \"Please make it for me until I die!\" The museum turned out to be small and fairly low-budget, with clearly some efforts towards interactivity, but with almost no effort to hire a fluent English speaker to do their translations. I learned more from my mother sitting with a Japanese-language kimchi cookbook in the front room. But if you don't have a Korean mother, and especially if you enjoy looking at plastic food (hello, Sharon!), it's not a bad way to spend an hour. If nothing else, you will learn that there are hundreds of kinds of kimchi. That's why it's not quite accurate to describe kimchi simply as Korea's national pickle--it just can't be described in the singular. They can be made of napa cabbage or regular cabbage, cucumbers, green onions, eggplant, big radishes, small radishes, etc., etc. Even my mom saw types she had never tried, as specialties vary from region to region. My new kimchi cookbook divides its 105 recipes into \"Refreshing Northern Kimchi, \"Simple and Tasty Seoul Kimchi,\" and \"Intensely Flavored Southern Kimchi.\" There's some that are fiery red and others that are so mild, you're supposed to drink the clear, sour juice with the cabbage. Sadly, the kimchi museum has no samples, though the plastic kimchis do glisten in their glass cases. (Apparently, you can sample and even make kimchi on certain days--oops.) There's an odd sort of closet where you can open doors and smell the key ingredients in kimchi, like ginger and garlic, but the intense national pride seems to have stopped at putting a dish of fish sauce or dried shrimp in one of the closets. (This is always a revelation I make to vegetarians with mixed emotions--nearly all kimchi includes some sort of seafood-derived ingredient.)The exhibits also explain how kimchi is made, how it was traditionally buried in clay jars in the ground during the winter months, which would control the temperature and keep it from fermenting too quickly. Thus my ancestors ate vegetables through the winter and avoided scurvy. There's also a funny but poorly translated dig at U.S. soldiers stationed in Korea during the war for stupidly thinking that Koreans were eating food straight out of the ground. Now, nearly all Koreans have special kimchi refrigerators that are colder than regular refrigerators for year-round kimchi preservation. We have one that's almost twice the size of the washing machine, and my mom says it's a small one.Sadly, though, younger families rarely make their own kimchi. Sometimes, they'll buy their kimchi in grocery stores, but as the change is recent, most still get to eat their mothers' and mothers-in-law's kimchi. The question, of course, is what will their children eat? I loved Laura Ingalls Wilder when I was young, and I yearned to live in a world where people canned and pickled and preserved things. I didn't realize it was happening in my own home.But I doubt Koreans will ever stop eating kimchi, no matter how trendy hamburgers and pizza get. My mom and I had a dinner today of rice, two kinds of kimchi, and kimchi stew. And they can always put it on their hamburgers and pizza! Koreans feel no fear in adding their favorite food to all their new favorite foods, as the wall of \"kimchi foods\" attests. In any case, the Korean government seems to have funded a significant amount of research on the health benefits of kimchi, just in case you don't like the taste of food, which you can read all about at the museum. It is an excellent source of vitamin C, though could it really help you lose weight? Apparently, people are already selling chile-laced nasal spray as a weight-loss aide.)It's a pity that the museum isn't more exciting. Perhaps I was focused too much on the poor English translations, but given how central kimchi is to Korean life, the most likely audience would be foreigners, not Koreans. With my newfound enthusiasm and pride in Korean food, I can imagine a museum with truly rich exhibits on the science and the culture. I mean, pickles can be seriously exciting. And then their cross-cultural display could include more than weirdly chilling laboratory jars of sauerkraut and Filipino pickles.But I can't completely rag on the existing Kimchi Field Museum. After all, you can take pictures with a mannequin ready to feed you kimchi from her chopsticks!

I don't know anyone like my cousin Young. She's a writer, a former award-winning journalist who'll urge me to read James Salter and Henry Miller, almost in the same breath as she's pressing upon me a mix CD consisting mainly of Charlotte Church. She's a good Korean girl, a daughter who respects and honors her parents in a way that makes Mulan seem selfish, and yet she also holds her liquor better than anyone I have ever met. She once did an oil painting of a bag of Funions--without irony. The girl loves Hot Pockets. The most amazing thing is that she doesn't surprise herself at all, nor is she trying to surprise anyone else. Young is simply who she is.It's hard to say what I enjoyed more the other night, her company or the delicate, crispy skin on the fried chicken we were eating. It may sound as if I am not respecting my cousin as much as I claim, but Korean fried chicken is spectacular. I could explain how it is different from the Southern-style fried chicken Americans know, except the New York Times already did it last winter. It caused a minor sensation, at least in my food-obsessed world. Chowhounds from all over the world were asking desperately, \"Where, oh, where can I find Korean fried chicken?\" Although in New York, you have to go specifically to Koreatown in midtown Manhattan, or to Queens, it is possibly in Seoul to simply decide, as we did, that you want fried chicken and wander until you find it.This particular place was called TO:UR Fried Chicken, a classic Korean-English abbreviation of \"Top Our Fried Chicken,\" close to the Shinsegae Department Store in Myungdong, a very young neighborhood of energetic shopping and drinking. (As a general tip, any place with the sign \"Hof,\" a bastardization of the German word \"hofbrau,\" will serve beer, soju, and fried chicken.) As hofs go, it was spiffy, with a bright red and black décor that was reasonably clean and attractive. As the night went on, it got more and more crowded with a good mixed crowd, businessmen, middle-aged women, and us, all happily eating fried chicken and drinking beer.The chicken was just as it should be, moist, ungreasy, and delicious. Koreans fry the whole chicken and then cut it up into pieces, serving it unadorned with just a dish of salt and pepper for dipping or coating it in a sticky, sweet, slightly spicy sauce. For 14,000 won, or about $15, we got half an order of each, as well as the usual accompaniments of shredded cabbage-cole slaw and cubes of pickled radish. We each got a big stein of beer, simple and refreshing. The more we drank, the hungrier we got, so we ordered another half order of plain fried chicken and shared another large mug of beer. I am not ashamed to admit we ate one and a half chickens in total. It was a lovely dinner. We talked, we laughed, we drank, and we ate. Even though I've always loved and admired Young for all the ways in which she differs from me, it was nice to learn that we do share a key core value, a passion for Korean fried chicken.

As promised.But the better 호떡, hodduk, makers were in Kangnam, who used some newfangled metal mold, so that the outside was perfectly crisp without being greasy, the inside chewy and sweet.(For those of you who have never tried this, it's a ball of dough filled with brown sugar and sometimes nuts. The sugar melts when the dough is flattened and fried and you end up with one of the best street food snacks in the world.)

My friend Diane has a brother who is even more obsessed with food than I am. A couple of years ago, we were talking about the essays he was writing for business school applications, including one on the biggest dilemma he had ever faced. He said he was having trouble because in all honesty, the biggest dilemma he had ever faced was on a Singapore Airlines first-class flight to Hong Kong, when he was served a beautiful, truly gourmet meal, and he had to decide whether he would eat it, or forego it to save room for the astonishing food that would be waiting for him as soon as he landed.During that same conversation, we began talking about \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia.\" This was a running list Michael kept in his head. He told me that Numbers 1 through 3 were clear to him, but he had been going back and forth trying to settle in his own mind what dishes occupied 4 and 5. If I remember correctly, one through three were pho, ramen, and soba, and four was some Chinese noodle dish, maybe chow fun. In any case, nothing in the Top Five was Korean; in fact, he said to me in horror, \"Can you believe some people say 잡채, chapchae?\" (Michael is Korean.) I admit I am also horrified that some people would consider that slippery, simpering glass noodle dish to belong in the pantheon of \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia,\" but a recent meal at 한우리, Hanwoori, has made me decide that among my personal top five, I would have to include 국수전걸, guksujungol, or Korean noodle hot pot.(I can hear my sister protesting, \"What about 냉면, naengmyun?\", which is her second-favorite Korean food in the world after braised short ribs, but that is another blog post.)Hanwoori is one of those restaurants that's been around forever. Several stories high, it serves traditional Korean food that's famous for its clean, uncluttered flavors. Our family has always been particularly fond of the kimchi, the shabu shabu (Japanese hot pot), and noodle hot pot. It's not cheap, but it's so good, especially when my parents are paying for it.If you have never had hot pot, Korean, Japanese, or Chinese, you should run out and try it. It's good party food, where people who don't know each other have to get comfortable fast, since they're circling a big pot of broth in which, depending on where you are, thinly sliced beef, strong Asian greens, meaty mushrooms, and assorted fish and fishballs cook lightly and quickly. I wonder why it's not more popular among the ethnic-hipster-foodie set--it's just as DIY as Korean barbecue without being as smelly. And the legends are fun--all about hordes of invading Mongols having to cook their food quickly on the march. The Korean noodle hot pot at Hanwoori isn't quite DIY, but the principle is the same. A big shiny pot of broth is placed on the burner set into the table. It's an anchovy-broth, and Hanwoori's epitomizes all that anchovy broth can be, clear and clean, not meaty and yet full in flavor. (If you think anchovy-broth sounds gross, it's similar to Japanese dashi broth, which you'll find in every bowl of miso soup.) Once the broth starts to boil, the waitress slides into the broth a platter of sliced vegetables--napa cabbage, mushrooms, green onions, and firm greens that hold up well in boiling broth; very thinly sliced beef; and a big pile of toothsome noodles. The broth is then flavored at the table with plenty of minced garlic (this is what makes it Korean!), Korean red pepper flakes, and salt. After 10 minutes or so, the pot is ready. The noodles have released some of their starches, the meat and vegetables have added another dimension to the broth, and so now the broth is thicker, almost more like stew than soup. The noodles are soft but not mushy, the beef still has the kind of chewy texture I love, and the greens clean your palate. It's a wonderful one-bowl meal.This kind of food doesn't need much accompaniment. Rather than a spread of 반찬, banchan, Hanwoori sticks to a few dishes, meant to provide some light, pickled contrast to the bowl of hot noodles in front of you. There's spicy cabbage kimchi, of course, some sweet and spicy dried squid, some non-spicy cabbage kimchi, and then individual bowls of white kimchi, again napa cabbage that hasn't been spiked with red peppers and instead is served in its own light, slightly sour juice.If I were to really raise Korean noodle hot pot to Michael as a serious contender for one of \"The Top Five Noodle Dishes of Asia,\" I think he would shoot me down. To be completely honest, it doesn't have the complexity of pho or the almost mysterious flavor of soba. It's simple food, where each component announces itself and nothing more, but this is why it's so satisfying.

It gives me a warm feeling to think about how so many cultures love to eat foods wrapped in dough. Pierogies, dumplings, wontons, empanadas--the list goes on and on. In Korea, our national dough-wrapped food is 만두, or mandoo. The most traditional version involves a thick doughy skin, more like a pierogi than a wonton, with a filling of mainly crumbled tofu, lots of green onions, perhaps some bean sprouts and/or kimchi, and a bit of meat. We like to eat them bobbing in soup, sometimes with sliced ovals of 떡, dduk, or rice cake. They are as comforting as all foods that are doughy and warm.One of my favorite places to eat mandoo in Seoul is called, simply enough, 만두집, Mandoo Jip, or Mandoo House, a tiny little hole-in-the-wall restaurant in Apkujongdong. Apkujongdong is probably Seoul's most chichi neighborhood, full of cafes serving 10,000 won (over $10) coffees, bars serving even more expensive drinks, and hip restaurants for ladies who lunch. It's wedged into a little shed-like building that is itself wedged into an alley right next to the new Uniqlo, which occupies the space where McDonald's used to be, right across from the glossy Galleria Department Store. It would look like a little bewildered thing, surprised by what's sprung up around it, except that it has spruced itself up a bit lately so that everything is shiny and new.For 7,000 won, you get cabbage kimchi, a refreshingly spicy and slightly raw julienned radish, and a big steaming bowl of fat mandoo. It's all very bare-bones--there's nothing in the beef-broth soup than a sprinkling of Korean red pepper powder that gives it a heartening bite. Such a fat little bundle that has been boiled in beef broth is likely to be scalding hot, and so you are supposed to take one mandoo out of the soup, place it in the little side dish provided for you, and cut it with your spoon into pieces, adding a bit of scallion-spiked soy sauce with each bite. The dough here achieves that perfect, difficult balance, thick but not starchy, satisfying rather than stupefying. The chopped green onions in the filling are not just a side note, they take up a lot of room, adding a clean, green sharpness to the crumbled tofu. The filling is seasoned so well, you only need a dab of soy sauce to make it complete. This is the kind of Korean food I miss the most when I am in New York, a small restaurant making one thing so well, it becomes a minor masterpiece.

My favorite food in the entire world is 김밥, kimbab. Kimbab is rice, meat, and vegetables wrapped up in seaweed, and then sliced to form neat, round, colorful cross-sections. The meat is traditionally beef marinated in the ubiquitous Korean bulgogi marinade, salty and sweet, and when combined with ribbons of egg, pickled daikon radish, sautéed spinach, and julienned carrots, it's a very happy looking dish. Now, it's become trendy to replace the beef with canned tuna, to add processed American cheese, which makes me ill, and other modern ingredients. It's Korean picnic food, the kind of food that kids love, which is why you'll never see it on the menu of a big Korean restaurant. I love it intensely. Unfortunately, I only get to eat it a couple of times of year, in the few compressed weeks that I'm at home with my parents in Korea. It's simple food, with no sophisticated searing or deglazing. But it's the kind of food that in Korean is literally called a \"handful.\" The rice has to be good, each grain distinguishable and yet sticky, and carefully seasoned with salt, a little vinegar, and sesame seeds. The unsalted seaweed is easy enough to buy. But the carrots have to be sliced and slivered and sautéed in oil. The spinach needs to be blanched, squeezed of excess water, and dressed with sesame seeds and sesame oil. The pickled radish, even though it comes packaged, still needs to be cut into neat long strips. The eggs have to be beaten, salted, and cooked into thin pancakes that are carefully sliced, also into neat long strips. If you are my mom, you will also have to julienne and sautée burdock root, which adds a wonderful slightly sweet, chewy element. And this is all pre-assembly. To assemble, you need a clean bamboo roll, on which you place a sheet of seaweed, spread some rice, and then lay out the rest of the fillings. It's not difficult work, but it takes a little practice knowing how much rice and various fillings you can comfortably stuff into a neat seaweed roll, and my rolls always come out sort of square. If you're going to go to all this trouble, you might as well make ten or twelve rolls, which means you can spend all morning making kimbab. In other words, I rarely make kimbab for myself. So when I come home, one of the first questions my mother asks me is, \"How many times do you want to eat kimbab?\" And she always makes sure it is on the menu at least two times while I am at home, little caring that it's kiddie food to my dad.Growing up, I ate kimbab all the time. It was a frequent lunch that I took to school, that my mother carefully packed for me. My sister and I left for school at 7:30 a.m., which meant she got up at 6 to make my favorite food, after prepping the night before. I didn't even know what this meant until I was in law school, five years after I had left home for college, when I decided to make kimbab myself for a party. It wasn't right, the rice wasn't right, the rolls weren't round. My back ached from standing, chopping, rolling for so long. I had no idea. It really is the most delicious food in the world.

There are a few things from my past that I am deeply embarrassed about. One is that as a teenager, long, long ago, when I didn't know much about anything, I was a big fan of New Kids on the Block. The other is that also when I was a teenager, long, long ago, when I didn't know much about anything, I spent most of my time eating out at TGI Friday's. At least with my bad taste in music, there wasn't much lost other than my dignity. But with my bad taste in food, while growing up in Seoul, Korea, I lost a thousand and one opportunities to eat a meal as delicious as the one I had last night.Last night, my cousin Young and I went to 사월에보리밥 , or Sawhuleh Boleebap, which translates into something like \"Barley Rice in April.\" The fact that it has a name that sounds sissy in English is a hiccup of cultural translation; it doesn't say anything about the food, which is as simple and assertive as the best Korean food has to offer.Koreans love pork. We love it so much some people have convinced themselves it prevents hypertension and eliminates toxins. It's true that 보쌈, bossam, one of the best manifestations of Korean pork, has a surprisingly clean flavor. It's simply boiled, sliced pork, with nothing on it or under it or in it, not even salt. I think it also tastes purer than it deserves to because of the way we eat it. Like many Asian cuisines, Korean food values a contrasting balance of flavors and textures. If you're eating a tender hunk of pork with glistening lumps of fat, you're not supposed to douse it in gravy and eat it with potatoes. You're supposed to place it in a crisp piece of napa cabbage or spry shiso leaf or even just a very fresh piece of red-leaf lettuce with a good piece of spicy bossam kimchi. Some people might even add a small piece of hot green pepper or raw garlic, or raw oysters dressed in spicy sauce, or just a bit of soy sauce to add some acidic saltiness. In any case, the raw, bright, fresh flavors in your mouth make that fatty pork taste almost as virtuous as salad. And it may even make your skin glossy!While we ate our pile of pork, we also cleansed our systems with bowls of barley rice, into which we mixed various sautéed vegetables and red pepper sauce, a variation on the bibimbap many Americans know. I loved the nutty flavor of the barley, especially combined with the slightly bitter greens, the bean sprouts, and the chewy root vegetables. And since Koreans rarely eat rice without soup or stew, there was also a very good bowl of hot 된장찌개, daenjang jjigae, a stew made from Korean fermented soybeans, filled with potatoes, squash, and cubes of firm tofu. Daenjang is a good example of a Korean food with the fifth flavor of umami, beyond salty, sour, sweet, and bitter, the unmistakable sense that a food tastes full. We washed it all down with a comically large jug of 동동주, dongdongju, a creamy, sweet liquor made out of rice. My cousin, like the good Korean she is, had most of it.I have so much lost time to make up for! I gained 10 pounds in Spain. I may just have to gain another ten here.

Yay for happy pounds! This entry was fascinating, and had me salivating. Also, I keep meaning to tell you that when I type \"one fork one spoon\" into my browser, I always think of the melody of that silly ballad from West Side Story, \"One Hand One Heart.\" You know, \"one fork, one spoon, even death won't part us now...\" See, you weren't the only one with dorky adolescent musical tastes.

I'm home. I'm lucky I have two places to call home: Brooklyn, New York, U.S.A., and Seoul, Korea. Brooklyn has its obvious charms, particularly the absolute joy of living alone without one's parents, but as I get older, being at home with my parents in Seoul has its own incomparable sense of comfort and ease. There's the twin bed I slept in from the age of 9 through high school graduation, the little yard I used to run around with our dog, and most of all, the ugly, ornate, wood table on which I ate so many of my meals growing up. Before I left New York, my mom called to see what I wanted to eat for my first meal when I arrived home. I knew if I gave her even the slightest encouragement, there would be an almost-obscene amount of food waiting for me. So I said to her over and over, I really can't eat that much just getting off the plane, just a bowl of my favorite Korean soup will do.It's hard for me to describe what 배추국, or baechuguk, tastes like. How would your average American describe the taste of mac and cheese, of meatloaf? (Meatloaf, incidentally, remains one of the most bewildering food items to me.) It's a fermented soybean soup, made from daenjang, which is a more aggressive, Korean version of the Japanese miso, with a beef broth-base, in which sliced Napa cabbage is simmered until it's tender and delicious. That's really it. You can throw in some minced garlic and green onions to add a bit more bite, but you don't need much else. With a bowl of rice and a few small plates of banchan, maybe some spicy, chewy anchovies or black beans cooked in soy sauce and sugar, it is the perfect meal for someone who has been traveling for almost 24 hours. I didn't take a picture because I was too busy basking in the warmth of my mother's love. But here are some pictures of a spicy 나물, namul, of greens dressed with garlic and sesame seeds, with fresh homemade 김치, kimchi, in the background. And then there is my sister's favorite food of all time, Korean braised short ribs with chestnuts, or 갈비찜. I ate all this for lunch the next day. I am lucky that my mother is who she is, and that I am her daughter.

You know that there is something not quite healthy about your life when you find yourself thinking, \"I just cannot eat another bite of foie gras.\" Or when you eat 14 delicious razor clams by yourself and still don't really feel happy. I had some additional fabulous pintxos in San Sebastián before I left, including a pistachio croqueta with a buttery-smooth interior and an excellent crunchy exterior at Bar Garbola and an unbelievable special foie dish at Hidalgo 56, as well as their award-winning \"volcan de morcilla\" with crumbled blood sausage, a just warmed but still runny egg yolk and a smooth sauce made of apples. (Todo Pintxos is an amazing site, no? You can find an English version by clicking on the top right-hand corner.) But my very last day, instead of going to the famed Aloña Berri, I went to a classmate's apartment where she and her roommates served spaghetti with jarred tomato sauce. It tasted great, too.So I think all this means it's time for me to go home, which is appropriate as I am going home today. In less than 12 hours, I will be in New York. I'm not really going back to real-life yet, as I will be in Seoul, Korea for most of December visiting my parents, and I hope to rectify the dearth of posts about Korean food on this blog while I'm there, but I doubt I'll be blogging with the fervor I've been for the past 6 months. This blog didn't start as a travel-food blog and so will continue life as it started even when I get back from Korea, but I can't imagine I'll be nearly so prolific. So dear family, friends, friends' mothers, and a few random people who don't know me but have kindly read my blog, thank you for helping me feel like I have someone to talk to while traveling alone for so long.

Oh, the French (in Spain)

Like many people, I can only keep one foreign language in my head at once. At one point in my life, I knew quite a bit of French. I never did speak it gracefully or even well, and I never really could hear it properly with all those mushy syllables, but I understood it well enough to pass out of Yale's undergraduate foreign language requirement. Now it has been completely crowded out by Spanish. (Korean, thankfully, is in a separate part of my brain.) This became particularly apparent when the nice young French family next to me at Zurriola Marítimo noticed I was taking pictures of my food and started to talk to me, asking if I spoke French. Although it literally took me a whole minute to remember how to say \"trés bon,\" the \"un peu\" French I do have enabled me to understand the husband's very French assessment of food in Spain: \"La cuisine française est la meilleure de Europe!\" (French cuisine is the best in Europe!) So modest of him not to proclaim, \"de tout le monde,\" n'est-ce pas?I also did not love the food at Zurriola Marítimo, although it was much better than it should be, given its spectacular view of the surf at Playa de Zurriola. Most restaurants with astonishing views tend to have terrible food, and it's a testament to San Sebastian's gastronomic standards that the food was good and reasonably priced, if not great. But I doubt the French homme thought what I did while eating my roasted oxtails: \"It would be so much better in a hot Korean soup!\"The first course I ordered, a vichysoisse of leeks with a poached egg and poached bacalao was tasty, if not quite hot enough. (Is it because I'm Korean that I want my soup to be piping hot?) The soup was very smooth and clean-tasting, despite its rich creaminess, and the salt cod was as soft as butter, almost melting in my mouth. They need to be a little careful with the sea salt on the poached egg, though; I almost choked on a small pile of salty granules.The second course was not as good, though there was nothing really wrong with it. The oxtails had been browned until they glistened, almost caramelized, and the meat still fell easily from the bone. They sat on a surprisingly light bed of soft, long-cooked potatoes and carrots, perhaps celery as well, and there were interesting tasty blobs of orange sauce that I couldn't identify. The fried strips of green pepper were wonderful, so much sweeter than any green pepper I've ever had in the U.S. So perhaps it was me, not the oxtails. I couldn't help but yearn for oxtails just simmered straight in a very hot beef broth, perhaps a handful of glass noodles, scads of chopped scallions, and a big pinch of sea salt...Korean oxtail soup! I also sat there pitying cultures that didn't enjoy spicy, picante food, thinking how just a little bit of a spicy condiment, like Korean red pepper paste, would have enlivened the stew. So who am I to think the French are snobby about food?Especially since the family was very nice. The maman directed her little boy to give me a bisou, or a kiss on the cheek, before they left. Qué cariñoso!

I just made the same complaint about my soup today! I had soup for lunch and complained to Ookie that in Western restaurants the soup is never warm enough and it seems tepid to me (thus, too cold). Surely, Koreans aren't the only ones to prefer their soups to be boiling hot but THAT is what I crave when I want a hot soup.

Yeah, we Koreans like to sweat over their soup! Besides, then you have more time to eat it before it gets lukewarm. We really know best, don't we?

I remember the first time I saw a crumb-catcher. You know, one of those thin, metal implements waiters use in fine restaurants to sweep away the crumbs at the end of the entrees and before the desserts and coffee are served. I was so wowed that someone would think of that detail and even invent an instrument for that purpose and that purpose alone. It made me feel special, because I was a person who shouldn't have crumbs on her table as she ate her dessert. In a way, I'm much more cynical and jaded now. I only consider one or two meals as having been absolutely perfect, from the perfectly cooked food to the perfect service, where everything was like magic. I've been around the crumb-catcher block. But I am proud to say that I am a woman who can still enjoy an imperfect meal and with gusto. After my gluttonous meal almost killed me on Monday, I set Tuesday aside for the three-course menu del día at the Restaurante Kursaal, housed in the modern, glassy building of the same name on Playa de Zurriola. The restaurant is owned and managed by Martín Berasategui, one of the giants of Spanish nueva cocina, though it's clearly not his crown jewel. But for 18 Euros or so, we mere peons get to choose from a broad menu of appetizers, entrees, and desserts. I was excited when my first course arrived, the \"arroz cremoso con mejillones\" or risotto with mussels. Sadly, it was inedible. The rice was cooked to just the right consistency, maintaining integrity in each grain while being creamy, but, oh and such a big but, there was too much salt. And I like salt. A lot. I was pretty sad, actually. I don't like to get disappointed by legends.And then my second course arrived, \"txangurro a la donostia,\" or spider crab in the style of San Sebastian. There was the requisite foam, which I actually quite enjoyed because it was interesting to taste the unique flavor of parsley in a different form. But more impressively, the txangurro! It had been shredded and then cooked in a tomato sauce that was both interesting and comforting, a difficult balance to be sure. I loved it. Honestly, just to have someone pick out the meat for you is worth a small fortune. According to Mark's Kurlansky, \"A Basque History of the World,\" the Basques are the only ones to eat this tiny crab with its sweet but challenging meat, and I thank them for having discovered how delicious it is.The dessert was another surprise, a cross between a bread-pudding and a tres leches cake, super soft and sweet in the middle, the sweetness saved only by the very distinct and sure flavor of burned sugar. It was full-on burned sugar, too, not the caramely top of crème brulee or crema catalana. I was impressed how the two flavors worked together, not just balancing each other out but almost aggressively pushing against each other. Yummy. The lemon ice cream was wonderful too, so creamy it was more like crème fraiche than lemon.All in all, I was quite happy. It wasn't a perfect meal, but neither am I.(A tip: if you want to have every culinary choice available to you in San Sebastian, do not visit in November. It seems like half the restaurants and tapas bars here have gone on vacation and in the European-style, for three weeks to a whole month. I am anxiously awaiting the reopening of Aloña Berri tomorrow, but I've had to tell myself, \"próxima vez\" to La Cuchara de San Telmo, El Fuego Negro, and other celebrated dining establishments.)

Death by the tasting menu

I've never had a tasting menu before. I've always understood it to mean a menu designed by the chef to show off his skills, providing a range of flavors in one meal. I never knew it meant death by gluttony, albeit a slow and pleasurable one.I've finally woken up to the fact that I only have a few days left in Spain and even fewer left in San Sebastian. I've spent less money than I expected, and so it is time to spend my surplus! But the cheapo cynic in me still isn't interested in spending 100+ Euros at Arzak, or even 55 Euros at Kokotxo. Another student at Lacunza, a retiree with enough money to spend at more expensive places, said one of his favorite meals was the 36-Euro menú de degustación at Casa Urbano. And so off I went.On a Monday afternoon, Casa Urbano was quiet, just a few pairs dining in the calm, cream-colored restaurant. There was abstract art involving wood branches and cream-colored squares on the walls, nothing very interesting, but nothing very offensive either, and the waiters were very kind. Even if it isn't a Michelin-starred restaurant, it declared itself still to be some place special, with white tablecloths, strong napkins, and even buckets of ice for white wine at each table. After all the inner strength I've mustered to enter bustling and noisy tapas bars solo, it was a breeze to sit down in that quiet restaurant by myself. I didn't feel like everyone was having so much more fun than me. The middle-aged couple in front of me barely said a word to each other throughout their entire meal.The menu was more intricate than I'd understood from reading it outside--you got to try all three appetizers listed, with the option of switching one out for the daily special; your choice of an entrée or two half-portions of two entrees; and then your choice of a dessert or two half-portions of two desserts, plus wine, bread, and bottled water. Of course I maximized my options, which meant I had seven plates set in front of me. So be warned, the following is very long.But I'll start with the wine, which was a choice between house white, house red, and txakoli, the very drinkable, slightly fizzy young Basque white wine. When I chose the txakoli, I was presented with the entire bottle, so it sat dangerously in front of me throughout the meal. First came the pastel de esparragos y langostinos, a little soft mousse-like cake of pureed asparagus and shrimp, with a delicate little shrimp on top. It sat in a little sauce that was so good, I sopped it all up with my bread, little understanding what I had ahead of me. I loved that it was nouveau but still soft and comforting, though my first bite indicated that there was one big problem with the restaurant--prepped food isn't properly being allowed to come to room temperature.Then came the ensalada temporada de chipiron, a warm baby squid salad. I loved the crispy grilled legs and the olive oil generously dressing the squid in its own ink. But again, sadly, the potatoes were cold, though the olive on top was fantastic.I swapped the third appetizer for the daily special, pimiento relleno con queso y anchoa, and was glad I did because it was my favorite of the three. The roasted red pepper encased a perfect cylinder of a firm, white cheese, but what made it special was something that I couldn't quite place, that nagged and nagged me until I realized they had somehow caramelized an anchovy! It was the perfect combination of sweet and salty. I'm not clever enough to figure out what the white sauce underneath was, some sort of emulsion, but it was also good enough for me to eat the rest of my rather large roll. I didn't know it at the time, but this was the beginning of the end.Ha! The \"Gilda\" de bonito fresco con refrito al vinagre de sidra, or a tapa of fresh tuna with delicious fried bits of garlic, little green peppers, and dried red peppers, in olive oil and Basque cider vinaigrette was not a \"tapa\" as described on the English menu. The \"Gilda\" refers to a famous San Sebastian pintxo of olives, pickled peppers and an anchovy, all skewered together and created in homage to the Rita Hayworth movie, \"Gilda.\" It's supposed to be as surprisingly sexy. It was delicious, and the tuna was fantastic also, just seared so that the inside stayed a warm red. It sat in a literal bath of olive oil, but it didn't overwhelm the simple, fresh flavor of the fish.By the time my second entrée arrived, I was starting to feel ill. But I couldn't stop; it was like I was in a trance. Besides, it was magret de pato al agridulce de frambuesa, or duck, one of my favorite meats in the world, in a raspberry sauce. I normally hate the words \"raspberry sauce,\" but the sauce here was delicate and tart, as well as sweet, and my aching stomach didn't stop me from eating all of the butternut squash puree, too, which had a strong, tart apple flavor. I did leave one chunk of potato.When the waiter came to take my dessert order, some part of me knew I had to stop, but the rest of me didn't want to listen. At this point, I couldn't plead ignorance of what this restaurant considered a \"half-portion,\" but I still ordered two desserts. The pantxineta crujiente \"Gorrotxategi\" was a flaky, crispy almond tart layered with a lovely rich cream. As if that weren't enough, it was served with a scoop of nutty ice cream that I think was also almond-flavored.Given how truly ill I was feeling at this point, I thought I should have some fruit: fruta asada de temporada con su subayon, or roasted seasonal fruit of pineapple, peach, and strawberries in subayon. Again, the fruit was a little too cold, but the \"subayon\" turned out to be a frothy, almost foamy (Spanish foam again!) tart sauce that must have had some milk or cream in it, because caramelizing the top had created a little skin. I wanted to die and I was drunk. The waiter was surprised when I ordered my espresso before the second dessert arrived, saying, \"But you're still missing one dessert!\" But I needed it immediately, some injection of caffeine and energy that would allow me to carry my bloated body back home and into my bed.The really scary thing is that four hours later, I thought, hmm, I should buy some bread to eat for dinner with the duck pate in the fridge.(If you're wondering if you should subject yourself to this particular slow death the next time you're in San Sebastian, I thought the coldness of the food really was a problem, with the insides of all the seared meats and even the roasted fruits being just too cold. I don't want to sound like a restaurant critic, but a fine restaurant should not let that happen. That said, it was a lot of excruciating fun at a very good price, and if you don't want to die eating seven courses, the a la carte menu is quite reasonably priced as well.)

I confess, I am one of those Americans who like to complain about their country while traveling. The bread is better here, the family is more important here, oh life is more beautiful here in _________. I know that I tend to exaggerate, and I get mad if other people bash America, but one thing is definitely true about life here in Spain--drinks are so much cheaper here! And more importantly, the culture of pintxos bars in San Sebsatian is lovelier than anything I have experienced before. I had feared before I arrived that pintxos might not really be my thing. I thought they might be too precious, too expensive, and more arty than tasty. San Sebastian, after all, boasts more Michelin-starred restaurants than anywhere else in the world, other than the center of Paris, but none of them were on my to-do list. The rest of the Basque country likes to say that San Sebastian cuisine is very French, and they don't mean it as a compliment.But even if they are right, pintxos in San Sebastian are the most democratic form of haute cuisine I've ever seen. There's nothing precious about them. More likely, you'll end up with sauce on your face and olive oil on your fingers trying to eat one in the requisite two bites. In Bar Goizargi this past Saturday, everyone, young and old, was eating the brocheta de gambas, or grilled shrimp skewered with bits of bacon and served with a vinagrette sauce of red and green peppers, onions, and carrots. They're award-winning and even included in the sixth edition of \"Los Mejores Pintxos de Donostia,\" but at 2 Euros, they cost the same as the Sunday issue of El Pais, a major national newspaper. Sure, there are places that are more haute than others. Sure, a couple of pintxos don't make a meal and can add up quickly. But I had two pintxos at the award-winning Goizargi, the shrimp and a tiny bowl of succulent squid in ink sauce, plus a glass of rosé for 5 Euros. Even at the obscene U.S. dollar-Euro exchange rate, that's only $7.50 at most. I can't get a freakin' glass of wine in Manhattan for less than $8. And I couldn't tell you if the crowd is young and hip or old and rich, since it was crammed with a group of students, older couples, and families with young kids. Okay, it definitely wasn't an angry young pro-ETA bar, but the food hadn't drawn a certain self-selecting crowd, the way it often feels in NY. There was no statement being made by the people eating there, that they support organic local food or that they are hip enough to eat meat by the pound on a picnic table in Williamsburg. They only wanted to stand with their friends with a drink in one hand and an empty toothpick in the other on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.I can't even wish that someone would open a true pintxos or tapas bar in New York. It wouldn't be enough for there to be one such bar, as there would always be a line out the door and the easy joy of it that I love would just disappear. So I have three days left here. Ready, set, go!

Very well said re: the self-selecting element of food cultures in New York; certainly the same is true of San Francisco, too. It's funny how different forms of identity politics seep into something as basic as eating. More importantly, you now have me viscerally craving pintxos...

Everyone who knows me knows I love Sahadi's with a passion. Sahadi's is my favorite place in New York, and even though I've said this so many times, I'll say it again. I feel about Sahadi's the way Holly Golightly feels about Tiffany's. Whenever I'm blue, I go to Sahadi's because nothing bad could ever happen at Sahadi's.But I must confess that the other day, I walked into a gourmet food store in San Sebastian that made me feel a little bit like, well, like I'd had a brief but meaningful affair with a beautiful Spaniard. If Sahadi's is my faithful lover waiting for me back home, Don Serapio is my Iberian fling (though sadly, the closest I'll get to an Iberian fling, sigh).The first thing that drew me was the faint but sure scent of the Italian moscatel grapes sitting on the sidewalk. Pale green fading to gold, they tasted like sweetness and flowers. I grabbed a big bunch and went inside, only to find myself feeling weak in the knees. I looked at the house-made jams, with tantalizing flavors like peras rioja, pears poached in Rioja wine, and ciruela con menta, plum with mint. I ate a tiny cube of 17 Euro/kg cheddar and almost bought a hunk immediately. I gazed at various unknown Spanish cheese with cute little goat and cow faces on the labels, at bright red strips of chorizo and panceta, in shiny foil packets. I bought a tiny little bottle of olive oil because I was seduced by the simple, luxurious packaging. Of course, there were giant legs of jamon iberico and fascinating sausages. I don't know why Don Serapio affected me so much, more than the other little Spanish stores I've been in so far. It may have been that the store has done a fantastic job of labeling everything, so that I understood just enough to know what I was looking at and yet had never tasted. In other words, the store is very attractive, tantalizingly so. I bought a few things to eat at my shared apartment but I knew that I could never try enough in the 5 days or so I have left in San Sebastian. I would never give up Sahadi's and the happiness I know I can find there. For one thing, Sahadi's is amazingly affordable, and Don Serapio is not, not to mention one can't eat foie gras every week. But I did ask myself for the first time, \"What if I just didn't go home?\"

What a wonderful world we live in, that I can see Rufus Wainwright in concert singing Gershwin while wearing the knee socks and breeches of a Basque folk costume in San Sebastian. And how appropriately strange and alluring to eat pintxos before the concert in a city that values tradition but also loves surprises.I walked into Bar Bergara with all the panache of an experienced solo tapas eater. I smoothly ordered a \"copa de txakoli,\" knowing I still wasn't pronouncing it quite right but that I was getting closer. Then I looked at the jewel-like bites laid out in large platters, completely covering the counter. The counter, being plastered with pintxos, cleverly had a little shelf under the counter on which you could place your little plate of pintxos. That's where I quickly took a stealth photo, and how lucky I am that it came out fairly focused because these were the best, most intensely flavored and most mind-blowing pintxos I have had so far.The one on the left is revuelto, or scrambled eggs with roasted red peppers, with a little cross-hatch of roasted green pepper strips. An awesome combination of flavors and textures, the smoothness of the eggs, the sweetness of the peppers, the appropriate bright saltiness of the entire ensemble.The one right behind is half a deviled egg on top of an anchovy on which is piled, believe it or not, shredded boiled egg white, topped with a dollop of aioli and a curled shrimp. I would never, never have thought of serving egg white like that, but it wasn't just a showy trick, it was excellent. Again, so perfectly salty!The third one is diced tomatoes and browned garlic tossed in fantastic olive oil, and then topped with golden fried onion bits and more green pepper. Like eating a bite of late summer.The best one, I couldn't even take a picture of it. Sorry, I already stick out enough, I can't bring myself to wave my camera around. It was \"foie gras con uva de oporto,\" which I think translates as foie gras drizzled with grape-port wine sauce. So rich, so smooth, just sweet and tangy enough to make vow immediately to return.To be honest, I'd enjoyed my pintxos and tapas up to this point, but I hadn't really seen them as something worthy of extreme hype, just something lovely about Spanish culture. I get it now.

My sister asked me the other day, \"Have you had a bad meal yet?\" Shockingly, I haven't. That doesn't mean every meal has been transcendent, but I haven't been served anything that I really just couldn't eat. I have, however, had some very ill-chosen meals, through my cultural blindness to the unspoken assumptions in the Spanish menu.It's ironic because my food vocabulary in Spanish is much fuller than any other area. I can't seem to keep in my head the word for grass, but I can say razor clam, mussel, baby squid, regular squid, dogfish, hake, and octopus. I've even picked up a few food and wine words in Catalan and Basque. But knowing the words alone never makes you fluent. Knowing that \"patatas\" are potatoes, and even knowing that \"rioja\" is a kind of red wine, didn't enable me to know that my appetizer of \"patatas de rioja\" was going to be a very rich and heavy stew of potatoes, sausage, chorizo, and beef. It was delicious, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I hadn't also ordered \"entrecote con garnis.\" \"Entrecote\" is steak, \"garnis\" I assumed meant some sort of vegetables would come alongside. Good Lord, the \"garnis\" turned out to be French fries. The phrase \"meat and potatoes\" took on a whole new meaning for me that day.You know you're having a serious fruit and vegetable deficiency when your apple tart tastes incredibly fresh and nutritious to you. It's too bad, because the Café Iruña in Bilbao was a warm and bustling restaurant, if somewhat brisk, with an ornate mudejar interior, and all the food was very good.The worst thing is I did it all over again the next day! I was in Gernika/Guernica, I wandered into the Jatextea Julien (\"jatextea\" meaning restaurant in Basque) and ordered alubias, a very typically Baque dish of beans that also turned out to be stewed with assorted meats, which I hadn't known when I had also ordered roasted pork with French fries for my second course. (Note the enormous bowl out of which I was to serve myself, as well as the entire bottle of house red wine.) Thank God the roast pork came with a green salad, nothing more than some fresh romaine lettuce with raw white onions, but it was like manna to me.I always make fun of the American trend of listing every ingredient and its origin on a menu but I'm starting to see there are some advantages.

I've decided to stop searching out restaurants. That is, I've decided that at least while traveling, I will not go around and around in circles looking for something specific cited in some guide written by someone I don't even know. I'm just going to walk into whatever feels right.Yesterday, I arrived in San Sebastian around four in the afternoon. The sky was gray but the city still gleamed. The bus station, really just a small parking lot, opened directly onto a path by the city's ría, a shallow ocean inlet. By following the ría north, I quickly came to the sea, the beaches that line San Sebastian's northern edge and make it astonishingly beautiful. I'm sharing an apartment with a single Spanish mother in the Gros district, literally blocks from Playa de la Zurriola. It's too cold now to go in the water--not that it stops the surfers--but it's still so emotional to be living by the ocean. I was so inspired, I went for a long run from the end of Playa Zurriola, around the northern crest of the Casco Viejo, and then along Playa de la Concha and Playa de Ondarreta. I wish I could live by the sea always. It makes me glad at least to live in New York and not, say, Cleveland, Ohio, though people always laugh when I say NY has beaches.Being the end of a holiday weekend and a Sunday, many restaurants were closed. I wandered around, trying to figure out if any of the open bars were serving anything more substantial than pintxos. I'd had pintxos and a plate of fried calamari for lunch in Bilbao and I was starving for something a little hefty. Finally, I found a little slip of a bar that advertised \"platos combinados\" and a nice owner who exclaimed, \"Claro!\" when I asked if the kitchen was open.So this is what I ate. It's not very impressive, really, but it was filling and satisfying. I hadn't known that a hamburguesa wouldn't come with a bun, so the American hegemony isn't as powerful as I'd thought, but there was plenty of good crusty bread. Even the iceberg lettuce and greenish tomatoes tasted good, being fresh. The fries were freshly fried, the meat had good flavor. The best part, though, was when the owner caught me taking a photo of the food. I'd tried to wait until he went back into the kitchen, but he suddenly reappeared with the ketchup and mustard, noticed me, and asked, \"Are you putting the photo on the internet?\"What a world we live in. Apparently, I am not the first American to be caught taking pictures of her food in his little Bar Diz.

So you can see some of Café-Bar Bilbao's creations:I went back for an early lunch, my last meal in Bilbao. The one on the left turned out to be a ball of cream cheese with something slight and meaty in the middle, covered in slivered almonds, and then topped with the aforementioned raspberry jelly. Not so exciting, and the cream cheese made me only long for a proper bagel. But the one on the left was tasty, I think bacalao mixed in olive oil with a slice of sautéed zucchini and a blob of sauce that was more tart than spicy.And then I ate an entire plate of fried calamari. The first few were so good, so succulent, so far from anything served by the kind of American restaurant that serves fried calamari. But by the end, sigh, I realized why fried calamari is usually shared.

Hola!That calamari looks SO amazing, I can understand not being able to stop enoying it until it's too late! Even if you couldn't share the pintxos, thanks for sharing your travels. I am inspired by your reports and your great appreciation of new experiences!

Bilbao has been hard for me.The city itself is beautiful. It has a bad rap, affectionately called \"el botxo\" or \"the hole\" by locals, and was known mainly as an ugly industrial city for years, until it got the Gehry-designed shiny Guggenheim 10 years ago, which, incidentally, is more beautiful than I ever imagined. But it must be \"ugly industrial\" European-style, because if this city were in the U.S., it would be advertised as a picturesque tourist destination. It's not in the style of Salamanca or Santiago de Compostela, which can brag about their 500-year-old medieval buildings. Bilbao's colorful houses and buildings along its Ria, or inlet from the sea, are only from the 19th century; perhaps that's why it's not considered one of Spain's beautiful cities. But it has the Guggenheim; it has the Mercado de Ribera, the biggest covered market in Europe; it has fantastic public transit; it has the world's oldest transporter bridge (very cool, trust me). Also, the river apparently used to stink, but I went for a morning run my first day and it smelled just fine!Bilbao has been hard because here, it is undeniable how social Spaniards are. One of the things I love most about Spain is the way people go out, young, old, infant, all together, every night. A typical tapas bar is a place to gather with friends, maybe even your grandparents, and not a place to cruise strangers. Bilbao is chilly these days, but it doesn't stop the crowds from standing outside the Cafe-Bar Bilbao or Sasibil or Berton with drinks and pintxos, Basque tapas, in their hands. Food and friends go together so well here they have gastronomic societies called \"txokos.\" (Anyone want to start a Txoko Brooklyn with me?) People have a drink and a pintxo and then move on to the next bar. The classic drink in Euskara Herreria, or Basque country, is txakoli, a light, fizzy white wine with low enough alcohol content that you can move from bar to bar all night without getting smashed. Spanish kids must get smashed sometime, but it must be after I go to sleep because I haven't seen a trashed Spaniard yet, even though every person I see seems to have a drink in her hand.As lovely as this is, though, it is not an easy society to fit into as a solo traveler. I'm reminded of what my friend Bianca said to me when I was getting ready to move to New York from San Francisco. \"NY is not a good place to find someone, but it's a great place to be single--at least you know you're not the only one.\" Spain, and a pintxo-focused city like Bilbao, is the exact opposite. I am the only person alone in the entire city! So what was I supposed to do in this pintxo-paradise? I tried one strategy, going when it's not prime-tapas hour and I knew I could quietly snag a corner bar stool. In Salamanca, I had forced myself into a café-bar and been rewarded with strong black olives and luscious chunks of jamon, its chewy texture giving it a flavor I liked even more than the thinly sliced jamon I'd always known. Here in Bilbao, I started with pintxos for breakfast at Abando y Barra, one block from the Guggenheim. I think that's a little fried quail egg. It was so adorable, it was calling my name like a puppy in a pet shop window. I wouldn't have thought a room-temperature egg would taste good, but it did. The little sandwich was mainly a tangy tuna sandwich, a little fishy for breakfast, but fortifying for the hours I spent in Richard Serra's \"The Matter of Time.\"That night, around 7:00, I walked to Bar Berton, just down the street from the Pension Mardones, and ate this pretty trio. The croquetas just melted in my mouth. Good, but afterwards, I wished I'd ordered the \"solomillo con foie,\" one of the few that you had to order off the menu. Here, there was even space at the end of a long table and I sat down and scribbled in my journal, closing the world away from me.I felt like I was training for a marathon. The next night, I had to push myself further. I walked by Café-Bar Bilbao twice before I could work up the courage to go in. It was 8:30 pm and it was buzzing, people spilling out onto the Plaza Nueva, people ordering and carrying away 2, 3, 4 glasses at once for their friends waiting outside. But once I was inside, the array of colors and textures on the counter gave me strength. I wanted so much to try one! I ordered a glass of txakoli and three pintxos. Sadly, I was too embarrassed to take out my camera. One can only overcome one insecurity at a time, no? I'm not even sure what I ate, I gulped everything down so fast. I only know that it was very, very, very good. Café Bar Bilbao is known for pushing pintxo boundaries beyond tradition. It must be so, because I think one of my pintxos had raspberry jelly on it. Could I really tapas-hop on my own? Would I go home slightly hungry or stop at one more place? It's funny, once you do something scary once, it really isn't so hard the next time. It wasn't nearly so painful to walk into Sasibil alone, even if the bartender there didn't have the kind crinkly-eyed smile of the one at Café-Bar Bilbao. I'm thankful this time I was able to take a photo and have a memento of the 5 minutes I spent there. The one on the right was some sort of chopped jamon with maybe a parmesan crisp on top, and good, but the ones on the left, of bacalao, were stupendous. I think they were rehydrated salt cod, not cooked and so almost raw. The one in the foreground had a little fried quail egg and sitting on top of that, a round slice of octopus. So deliciously chewy! And the one behind had some serious chili oil happening, one of the few spicy things I've eaten in Spain.I'm in San Sebastian now--here's hoping for less harrowing pintxos-eating here.

I'm sure that I've told you this story but I have to tell it again seeing the Lays photo. One of my friends once hosted a group of us at his family's vacation house in Malaga where they asked that we respect their Muslim dietary rules when buying groceries and bringing food into the house. Although it was difficult in a country like Spain, we were very good about enjoying our pork products outside of the house. Then, one of our more American friends felt the craving for chips so he bought an exciting bag of \"Jam On!\" Doritos and didn't realize until he passed them around to us that it was Ham Doritos.

If you are ever in Santiago de Compostela, you have to take a tour of the cubiertas or roof of the famous cathedral. The tour guide will literally lead you to the top of the cathedral and you will walk out onto the sloped steps of the roof, where pilgrims for almost 1000 years would walk at the end of their pilgrimage to burn their clothes and start their life anew. If you are a sentimental fool like me, the first sight of the sky, the red terracotta roofs of the city, and the clock tower so close to you will bring tears to your eyes and you will gasp with joy, \"It's so beautiful, it's so beautiful!\"A good place to eat after this inolvidable experience is Bierzo Enxebre where I had an inolvidable meal. The interior is warm Galician farmhouse, wood beams and stone walls where people have inexplicably stuck pennies into the crevices, making bright copper spots throughout the dining room. The food is served in traditional Galician dishware, an off-white with abstract splotches of blue and brown. The young lunchtime waiter has a gentle face and Botticelli curls, and he will smile and approve your choices, that is, he approved mine.I couldn't resist yet another plate of pimientos de Padrón, smaller and even more delicious than the ones Becca and I had in Sevilla. The plate seemed so big but the peppers disappeared so fast. This plate actually did hold a couple of surprises, a couple pleasantly spicy ones.I'd walked in all set to eat the famous pulpo a la gallega, but when I saw with the mother and daughter next to me were eating, I had to ask what it was. They were costelas de porco adobadas (costillas de cerdo adobadas in Spanish or pork ribs rubbed in spices in English) on a bed of French fries. They were insane. They were all crunch, like eating pork rib popcorn. I got a half ración and the platter came overflowing with ribs, but I still ate them all. I couldn't help it, the way you can't help eating a tub of popcorn.The wine was just the albariño of the house, but as good as every other albariño I've had here. Albariño is the typical white of this region and it's light and young, not as fizzy as a Portuguese vinho verde but it goes down just as easy.The waiter's approval really hit a peak when I ordered dessert on top of the enormous meal I'd just eaten. \"Please, crema de lemon con castañas.\" Castañas are chestnuts and they are all over the market. The lemon custard tasted like lemon and nothing else, just cream and tart and happiness with the sweet, nutty texture of roasted chestnuts. It was \"muy bueno,\" just like the waiter had said. When I thought no one was watching, I scraped away at the bottom of my cup.I felt like a beached whale, a very happy beached whale. I thanked the God I don't believe in for my good luck and walked off towards the Museo de Peregrinaciones, the Museum of Pilgrimages.

I bought the bread and cheese at the Mercado de Abastos in Santiago de Compostela. The bread is \"pan de maiz,\" or cornbread, though nothing like the cornbread we know in America, and the cheese is \"tetilla\" cheese, a mild, tangy, Galician cheese. The pan de maiz is crumbly like soda bread and the cornmeal is definitely mixed in with flour, but it has that characteristic, hearty flavor of \"honest bread,\" as M.F.K. Fisher would say. I ate it for days, even on the 12-hour bus to Bilbao; neither bread nor cheese went bad just sitting in my hotel room.Even more than the cheese and bread, and the green-skinned freixoa fruit I tried, I liked the way the women at the market smiled at me when I bought it. Maybe I am getting starved for company, but people in Santiago de Compostela are so nice! People started asking me again where I was from and telling me that I spoke Spanish well and smiling such warm, genuine smiles at me. It was almost like I was in Mexico again. I wonder if it means anything that so many Galicians emigrated to Latin America.

(Just arrived in Bilbao, so I'm only one city behind now!)For all my bravado in Salamanca, I arrived in Santiago de Compostela a little sad and pensive. I'd had too much time on the bus to think and I dreaded what I might think about for the next couple of weeks. But from the moment I first started walking around the city, I felt happy. At the risk of sounding hokey, I felt at peace. Santiago is famous for being the destination of pilgrims on the Camino de Santiago for over 1000 years, and even though I didn't walk for three months to get here, it feels right to be in a city where I'm just another solitary traveler looking for something.And the food! I dare Bilbao and San Sebastian to beat the food memories I've made here.Galicia is another corner of Spain that isn't quite Spanish. They speak galego (or \"gallego\" in Castilian), which looks like Portuguese and sounds like mushy Spanish. So \"plaza\" becomes \"praza,\" \"iglesia\" becomes \"egrexia,\" and \"jardin\" becomes \"xardin.\" It also has a strong Celtic heritage, which means you hear Riverdance music everywhere and junk souvenirs with Celtic symbols on them. Their traditions are peasant traditions of square-shaped men and women fishing and working hard on the land to grow the biggest cabbages I've ever seen, judging from what I saw at the Mercado de Abastos. Thus, their food is peasant food, my favorite kind.My first taste of Santiago was a café con leche and a piece of tarta de Santiago, their famous cake made of almonds, at Hostal Girasol's café, across the street from my own lovely little pensión, the Casa Felisa. Eating anything so deliciously nutty makes me think of my sister and even though I missed her more than ever, I was happy to be eating something that reminded me of her. And then I moved on to lunch. Casa Manolo is tucked into a corner of Praza de Cervantes and is clearly in more guidebooks than Lonely Planet, as there were plenty of pilgrims in walking sandals and Gore-tex clothing eating there. But just because a place is popular with pilgrims is no reason to sneer at it.For 8 euros, I was given my choice of an appetizer, an entrée, dessert, and bread. Wine was extra, but a \"copa\" for a 1,80 euros turned out to be a carafe with a good two glasses worth of the light, bright local white, albariño, that was a true pleasure to drink. I'd been curious about white asparagus ever since I saw it in jars at gourmet shops in Madrid, but the white asparagus I had with olive oil, mayonnaise, and boiled eggs was nothing particularly exciting. The bread, though, was the best bread I'd had in Spain. It was my favorite kind of bread, a good brown, floury crust with a slightly tangy, tender crumb, not as tough of a levain but as flavorful. It didn't need any butter or olive oil, it held up so well on its own.I had a typical Galician dish for my entrée, merluza or hake cooked with paprika and olive oil. The boiled peas and carrots were very peasant in being tasteless, but I was so impressed by how good a white, firm fish could be. It was simple, very clean, and so so good. Even the boiled potatoes were good.I wrote in my journal as I ate, \"I am so happy! I am so happy!\"

We ate at Casa Manolo in October, 2002. The food, IMO, was undistinguished, but (as in the famed Catskill hotel exchange), there was plenty of it.We loved Santiago also. We stayed at the Hostal Alfonso, Rua Pombo, between the Alameda and the Casco Viejo.

I think I loved Casa Manolo more for the kindness of the waiter than anything else. Spanish people normally don't know what to do with solo travelers, but in the city of pilgrims, everyone was very nice.

After all my talk about how I was going to bravely sally forth and travel alone through Spain, I am only truly alone after three and a half weeks of travel. I'd been lucky to have Anne for Madrid and Barcelona, Becca for Andalucia, and I noticed their absence sharply when I stepped off the 8-hour bus from Sevilla into the city of Salamanca. I arrived at the Pension Lisboa, a small cheap hotel selected by Lonely Planet, and I immediately wondered why it had been picked out of the myriad, small, cheap hotels in the city. The best I can say about it is that it was clean, which is an important attribute to be sure, but it didn't totally balance out the hideous polyester floral bedspread. I felt like I had come to a guesthouse for genteel women fallen on hard times to come, live out their days and die. I wasn't really unhappy, though. I spent the first afternoon just sitting in the sun on the steps of the Colegio de Anaya of the Universidad de Salamanca, looking at the cathedral across the plaza but not really in any hurry to go inside. I wandered around the commercial district, buying a hat and gloves to protect me from the cold of Castilla y León, a brutal shock after sunny Sevilla. I walked through \"the most beautiful Plaza Mayor in Spain.\" I poked through the old building of the famous university and tried to find the good luck frog on the façade. I wandered through a pretty garden, unmarked on my map, and ate two kinds of buñuelos, little donuts filled with whipped cream or chocolate or buttercream, what have you.And I survived my first dinner alone in Spain. I even enjoyed it.I wandered around for awhile looking for a place where I wouldn't feel too inconspicuous. I'd had lunch in Barcelona alone, but even super-social Spaniards eat lunch alone once in awhile, and I never felt like an oddity. But dinner was more challenging. I didn't want to go into a bustling tapas bar filled with people laughing and jostling each other while holding drinks in their hands. I didn't want to go into a desolate tapas bar with only old men who know each other from 50 years ago. I picked a sit-down restaurant, Rúa Mayor near the Plaza Mayor, because there was already one elderly woman tourist eating there alone. Thinking about the intrepid women who traveled alone in times when that was really weird gave me courage, that and the thought that I could soon have a glass of wine.I started with the pimientos rellenos, the red peppers stuffed with potato, a bit of cod, and tiny shrimp, baked in an earthenware dish with a tomato sauce and cream. It had been run order the broiler, and the top was very attractive, brown and crispy. The potatoes were so smooth, they tasted almost cheesy, and the tomato sauce was sweet and rich. It came out very hot and I could feel myself getting happier and happier.My entrée was simpler, churrasco de la ternera a la parilla, or a piece of grilled beef rib. It came crispy French fries and a mushroom sauce. It had a fair amount of gristle, but it was exactly what I wanted, something satisfying and simple. Since I had no one to talk to, I talked to myself by writing in my journal and jotting notes about my meal. In a way, that satisfied me more than anything, to be writing again. I knew that I could have asked Becca or Anne for some time to write, but I had had to gorge myself on their company, like a bear preparing to hibernate. And I hopefully now had sufficient fat stored up to survive the rest of my solo trip.By that point, the wine and food had made me woozy. I'd stuffed myself, since I'd only eaten Gummi bears and Maria biscuits all day. I was glad that the Pension Lisboa was so close. As I stumbled home and fell into my bed, I didn't even notice the ugly bedspread.

After spending two days walking around the hills and pueblos blancos, or white villages, around Ronda, we returned to Sevilla for one night. It was like coming home. We went to one more flamenco show, an intense, beautiful performance at Casa de la Memoria Al-Andalus with a guitarist whose hands flashed as he played. We had pimientos de Padrón one more time at Modesto. Becca bought another shirt at Zara. And we went back to the Alameda de Hercules park.The Alameda park in Sevilla was one of our favorite places in the city, which was odd because it wasn't much of a park and more a long, skinny length of brown dirt and scrubby trees. It runs a long ways between the barrio of Macarena, where we initially stayed, and ends near the commercial, shopping district in the center of the city. They were clearly doing some remodeling, and one night, these giant metal statues showed up on the beds of even bigger trucks, but the construction didn't stop people from congregating there almost every night, Monday through Friday. The bars and restaurants that line the Alameda draw a crowd that's a bit hipster, a bit grungy, the type that will happily sit around a guitar for hours, but also lots of children, as the Spanish are big on keeping their kids up at all hours. Becca and I couldn't understand it--they didn't look grouchy or tired, which I always thought was the reason for putting your kids to bed at 9. In the U.S., everyone says that when you have a child, it changes your life, and I'm sure it does, but I get the feeling that it wouldn't change your life so much here. We saw extended families at outdoor bars late at night, from babies to grandparents all time. If I ever have a child, I will definitely be the kind of mother who takes her baby to the bar.Almanara, our favorite restaurant on Alameda, would be just the kind of place a mother could take her children. During the day, it's a sleek narrow column of a restaurant with some outdoor tables serving fruit drinks and smoothies, including the most intoxicatingly delicious lemonade with yuerbabuena. (Note to self: plant yuerbabuena in container garden next summer.) At night, they serve food from a mainly vegetarian menu, but it's good! Really, I'm not kidding, and the menu even had words like \"seitan\" and \"tempeh.\" The best thing we had was their gussied-up, more veggie-filled versions of the tortilla española, with eggplant in my case and courgettes, or baby squash, in Becca's. There was plenty of cheese and plenty of salt, and the layers of potato and egg and eggplant almost melted together, they were so smooth.We did have an odd seaweed pasta in a balsamic sauce, literally strips of seaweed taking the place of old-fashioned pasta. I'm sure it's a low-carb dieter's dream. It didn't taste bad exactly, but it didn't really taste good. Ambitious and imaginative, though, so I would give a B for effort.And to prove that it is not a restaurant devoted to self-deprivation, Almanara serves an insanely delicious chocolate dessert. I'm not quite sure what it is--who knows, it might have soy or something, but it's almost as firm as a frozen custard without quite being an ice cream. It actually tastes like chocolate, unlike many chocolate desserts, and they serve it with those simple Maria biscuits I like so much. That was our last meal in Sevilla. The next day, Becca got on a plane back to New York and I got on a bus to Salamanca. (And 5 days later, here I am in Santiago de Compostela, getting ready to go on to Bilbao tomorrow.)

Moroccan food and architecture in Granada

I have to admit, it was a bit of relief to arrive in Granada and eat Moroccan food. Maybe it was Jaime's stories about the less-than-innocent origins of the Spanish love of pork, but I was ready to eat something other than jamón, and Granada turned out to be one of the best places to do so. All over Spain, I'd seen signs of Muslim immigration, but in Granada, the Moroccan presence was strongest, from the Moroccan crafts sold to tourists to the teterias or tea shops all over the Albayzin, the old and now new Muslim quarter. And of course, Granada is the home of the Alhambra.We had a good lunch at a random little shop, more of a café than a restaurant with low tables on which they served good hummus and kefta, translated for Spaniards as albondigas, and which we know as those Middle Eastern meatballs. And then we found dinner at Restaurante Arrayanes.It was obviously a popular restaurant and it filled up quickly after we walked in. The owner treated the restaurant like his baby and came to every table, asking if we needed anything, if we were enjoying ourselves. As a true Muslim restaurant, it didn't serve alcohol, but it did serve a delicious lemonade made with mint.The food was good, if not the best Moroccan meal I've ever had, but one thing did truly stand out--the \"Macedonian\" dessert. It was the dessert of the day, not on the menu, and so I'm not quite sure if it's literally called a \"Macedonian.\" It was a soft molded dessert, not quite a custard but not quite a cake. It was sweet without being cloying and so comforting, you could feed it to a baby. We argued for a bit about what was in it--Becca thought saffron and coconut, I argued that it was carrot. I was gleeful when it turned out I was right. It had reminded me very much of an Indian carrot pudding I had years ago in San Francisco.And so we were fortified for our hike up and around the Alhambra the next morning, but the need to cleanse myself of ham didn't last long. The next night, we were back to plates of jam, cheese and olives, washed down with a touristy pitcher of sangria. Ah!

I'm so glad you're enjoying Spain, Grace! As usual, I love your posts, but as usual, pedantry is the only thing that actually manages to move me to leave a comment:\"Macedonia\" is just the term they use for fruit salad in Spain, France, and Italy, including the horrible canned stuff produced by Del Monte et al. There's even a wikipedia entry for it, apparently:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macedonia_(food)But what you're eating looks like some variation on carrot halwa (the Arabic term they also use in India), decorated with some kiwi and mandarin slices. I don't know much about Moroccan food, but have seen Sephardic/North African recipes for something similar in both my Claudia Rodin and another Jewish cookbook. Macedonia sounds to me like a shrugging translation based on the garnish.Looking at the picture makes me hungry for a sweet, notwithstanding my Halloween gorging!

Ah, Anna, as always, you are fount of random knowledge! Thanks for the clarification and the word \"halwa.\" I kept saying to Becca it reminded me of \"halvah,\" and she looked at me like, no, it is not a sesame candy.

Córdoba was an easy trip from Sevilla, a short train ride that deposited us quickly near the winding, narrow alleyways of the historic center, where the tourist-to-local ratio feels like it's 10 to 1. But when we went just a few blocks beyond the Mezquita, the justly famous mosque, we found quiet streets lined with white buildings and colorful flowerpots hanging on the walls. Our favorite restaurant turned out to be just outside the old city walls. We had already had an afternoon snack at El Olivo, two glasses of manzanilla, the slightly salty yet appealing sherry so popular in Andalucia, and a plate of fried calamari, but we went back for dinner because of Jaime, the tour guide at Casa de Sefarad a museum devoted to the history of Sephardic Jews in Spain.Jaime will probably be one of my favorite memories of Spain, rivaling the sight of Becca whizzing around the Mezquita in a wheelchair to rest her lame foot. The museum is located close to the one synagogue that wasn't destroyed in Córdoba, and although it's very small, really just 5 or 6 rooms, Jaime has so much to say, you can't help but leave feeling a bit heady. He's a classic nerd, so intensely interested in his subject that he draws everyone in, like a black hole. But he's not at all the shy, retiring kind of nerd. He's more like the arrogant professor who's well-aware that he knows a lot, and although that would be annoying in a friend, it's quite ideal in a tour guide.We learned from Jaime how the Spanish love of jamon and all pork products comes, in part, from the Spanish desire to distinguish themselves from Jews or, in the case of the convertidos, to prove that they were no longer Jews after their expulsion in 1492. He also told us how at the same time, many of Spain's most beloved dishes have Jewish origins. He talked about Maimonides, about families buying documents to hide their Jewish origins, and about how expelled Sephardic families sought to preserve their memories of their lives in Spain. Whenever he asked if there were any questions, he was met by a stunned, yet gratified silence.In the end, though, Becca had a question. After all the other tourists had left and we were chatting with him about menorahs in the gift shop, she asked for a restaurant recommendation, a place that was good but \"informal.\" \"iInformal!\" he exclaimed. \"Quel horreur!\" (He literally said that in French.)After we stopped laughing, he did recommend \"El Olivo,\" and thus cemented his place in my memories as a most knowledgeable person. The plaza, which had been sunny and pleasant earlier, was now golden with the light reflecting off the stone of the city walls. It was mid-October and we were sitting outside in weather that felt like the best of New York's summer nights.Becca loved her pisto, which turned out to be a Spanish version of ratatouille served with two fried eggs. There were plenty of tomatoes to make it sweet and lovable.And I, I adored my chuletitas de cordero, or grilled baby lamp chops liberally salted with coarse sea salt. They were possibly in the top 5 favorite things I've eaten in Spain, so simple and so good. I could have eaten 10 more. (It also felt right to eat lamb after feeding murcillo or blood sausage to Becca earlier that day.)When it was time to order dessert, I insisted we order two. I thought Becca's choice of pears poached in red wine was boring and got tarta de queso, or Spanish cheesecake, instead. They were both good but the pears put Becca over the edge. I had to admit I'd never had poached pears so smoothly delicious, like eating pear mousse. I accused Becca, \"I thought you didn't like soft desserts!\" to which she retorted, \"I do when they're this good.\"And then the kind old waiter brought us, on the house, glasses of ice-cold sweet lemony liqueur.As Becca put it, \"If I were Spanish, I would never leave Spain.\"

Sevilla seems like the kind of place where people would eat fried fish. The Rio Guadalquivir runs through the town, with most of the old city on the eastern bank, but with the old fishing neighborhood of Triana on the western bank. The city has developed smooth bike lanes that run along much of the river, as well as a lovely new bicycle-based public transportation system, Sevici, where you can pick up a bike from one station and drop it off at another station clear across town for about 1 Euro every half hour. The bikes are insanely heavy, maybe to keep you from being tempted to steal it, but they have sturdy bike baskets, good night lights, and everything else you would need to cruise around town. Brand-new bike system + brand-new river-view bike lanes = sheer joy.So back to the fried fish. It's such a stereotype that people in Sevilla don't work very much and just enjoy life sitting in the thousand little plazas that dot the city, but cruising around town and sitting in those same plazas ourselves, it did seem sort of true. And that kind of carefree, easygoing attitude just seems to go with an affinity for fried fish, especially since fried fish goes so well with a sunny plaza and a cold beer. Of course, my view is probably colored by the fact that Sevilla actually is famous for pescaito frito, or a platter of assorted fried fish. One night, Becca and I biked from our apartment on the western edge of the old city to the Jardines Murillo, the northeastern edge. We made our way to Modesto, a casual seafood-focused restaurant so big and popular, it took up two separate plazas and two separate indoor spaces facing each other. We got a platter of pimentos de padron to share, while she ordered the famed pescaito frito and I got the cazón frito en adobo.The pimientos de padrón were on my to-do list because of an essay by Calvin Trillin in his book, \"Feeding a Yen.\" (Others say, \"I did Madrid,\" or \"I did Granada,\" but I say, \"I did pimientos de padrón.\") According to Calvin Trillin, they come from Galicia, the state on the northwestern tip of Spain. They are local only to Galicia and are extremely hard to find outside of Galicia, as their season is also very short. In fact, I don't even know for sure that our pimientos de padrón were the real thing. But I do know for sure that they were very good.They turned out to be thin-skinned little green peppers, fried and then liberally salted with sea salt. It was like eating potato chips but better. They were the only green peppers I have ever really loved. Every once in awhile, and you have no idea when, you may encounter a spicy one, but they're otherwise mild and easily lovable. Becca loved them so much, we came back our last day in Sevilla and ordered one platter and then another. They went excellently with Cruzcampo, the light and tasty local beer.The fried cazón turned out to be chunks of tender dogfish tossed or marinated in some sort of spice that made it pleasantly salty and almost tart. We enjoyed this very much, too.The famed pescaito, however, was not so universally loved. It was another dish that I ate most of, even though Becca had ordered it. There was quite an assortment of fish, from fried anchovies to small red, curled-up fish (had they died that way?), even a bit of fried fish roe. I popped the fried anchovies like they were popcorn and was thankful for my good appetite.When we came back almost a week later and ate our two plates of pimientos, we also shared a plate of coquinas, these skinny little clams barely bigger than the tip of your thumb. They'd been cooked in lots of olive oil and salt, and I loved them, too. I hope New York gets a public bike system soon. Mayor Bloomberg, do you hear me? We already have the river, if not the attitude. Would it be too much to also hope for a place that sells pimentos de padron, fried fish, and coquinas, and maybe an extra plaza or two?

Arriving in Sevilla

(Now I am really behind--I'm in chilly Salamanca, having left sunny Andalucía behind, but just starting to blog about Sevilla.)Arriving in Sevilla was a joy. My flight left Barcelona before dawn, but when I arrived in Sevilla at 9:30 a.m., it was sunny and just starting to get warm. The apartment Becca and I rented was in the barrio of Macarena, a formerly working class neighborhood on the western edge of the old city that is being colonized by hipsters, complete with hipster dads pushing strollers through the nearby park, Alameda de Hercules. I had found it online at Embrujo de Sevilla, and it went beyond all expectations, with its soaring ceilings, sparkling clean, bright IKEA furniture, a dishwasher and washing machine, AND a roof terrace. It was nicer than my own apartment. In many ways, Sevilla reminded me of Mexico, and Becca agreed, it was the most Latin American of the Spanish cities she's been to. The buildings were low and brightly painted, and you knew there were sunny courtyards in nearly every one. Even the machismo was the same; after two weeks of walking unnoticed, I started getting catcalls and kissy noises again. People spoke even more quickly than they had in Madrid, and they swallowed the ends of their words like Caribbeans, but they smiled more easily than their compatriots in Madrid and I felt happy again that I could speak Spanish, más o menos. And being outside Spain's biggest cities, I began to see and enjoy the little mistranslations I saw everywhere. Growing up in Korea, we'd always gotten a big kick out of the way Korean words were translated into English, and it was strangely gratifying to see the Spanish were as bad as the Koreans. The best, or the worst, was definitely at Taberna del Alabardero, a restaurant in Sevilla, where at the end of our meal, we were presented with an evaluation form, including a place to rate the \"saw-off\" we got. But the meal itself was one of the loveliest Becca and I had in Andalucía. It looked like a favorite of moneyed Sevillians, judging by the way the other guests were dressed, but the happy waitress was warm without formality, as the restaurant itself is. When you walk in, you see a classic Sevillian space, a light and airy courtyard brightened even more by its yellow paint. The dining rooms are off the courtyard and have beautiful Moorish tiles to look at while you eat. The food was also classically Spanish, simple, a bit too salty, and very flavorful. I loved my appetizer of \"maccarones con salsa de tinta y calamares,\" the pasta and squid so perfectly toothsome. Becca also loved her \"crema de puerro con salteado de verduras y langostinos,\" a creamy leek soup with deeply caramelized vegetables and shrimp. Our favorite, though, was the \"merluza en salsa verde,\" or hake in a herby green sauce, served with a poached egg. The fish was obviously fresh, the sauce very bright and it managed to be delicious in and of itself, without needing to resort to heavy flavors.Becca didn't like her \"chuleta de cerdo con col y melocoton,\" or pork with caramelized cabbage and a peach sauce but I loved it. We realized Becca doesn't really like the texture of most Spanish meat, but I liked the way it was both flavorful and chewy without being dry, and I loved the peach sauce which was more tart than sweet.We couldn't miss dessert--the whole three-course meal only cost 12,90 Euros! I also learned that Becca doesn't like soft desserts, other than whipped cream, as she wasn't too fond of the \"flan de naranja con magdalena tibia y salsa de menta,\" or orange flan with madeleines and mint sauce, or the chocolate mousse cake that was the special of the day. It was a happy realization for me, since I got to eat almost all of both desserts.But as always, the best meals aren't only about the food. Our young waitress, more blonde than you would ever expect a Spaniard to be, was so happy and kind. She spoke fairly good English and only laughed when we started to confuse her by speaking English and Spanish simultaneously. When she saw me looking at the little bottles of olive oil on the table, she brought me 4 more to take home, which went immediately clinking into my bag. (I ended up leaving 3 in the apartment for future tenants, but took one in case I saw a good tomato on the road.) There was no question, we rated the \"saw-off\" as excellent.

I finally got a Spaniard to ask me where I was from, while eating breakfast solo at El Quim in La Boqueria, my last full day in Barcelona.In Mexico, I got asked 5 times a day where I was from, from the cabdriver to the waitress to the guy working in the cemetery who insisted that I see where Benito Juarez's daughter was buried and then shyly showed me photos of him riding a bull attached to his keychain. Almost always, the question was asked with curiosity, warmth and kindness. But in Spain, in the 3 weeks I have been here, I have been asked that question once.El Quim belongs a Spanish food genre that doesn't exist in the U.S., not quite a restaurant, more of a counter, but not like a diner, as it may very well serve wine, beer, and sparkling Spanish cava, not to mention razor clams, calamari, and jamon iberico. El Quim, even within this marvelous class, is near the very top. It's a wonder just to watch the owner and his assistants move with sureness and speed in the little space that serves as their kitchen behind the counter. El Quim is one of the young upstarts that have started to challenge the legend of Pinotxo at La Boqueria, and I say, \"The more the merrier!\" Although El Quim does list a menu on a board behind the counter, it's not actually comprehensible. There are clearly things displayed in the glass case on the counter that are not on the board, and I did what I have learned to do brazenly, gawk at what others are eating. I even made a full circuit around the U-shaped bar, dismissing the tortilla espanola as old hat, dismissing eggs as too typically American for breakfast. Finally, on my second turn around the stall, I noticed a man at one end eating a round, flat earthenware dish of a red, chunky stew. \"Cual es?\" I asked. I don't know why I bothered, as I didn't understand the response, \"Callos,\" but it looked very much like tripe, one of my favorite things to eat. THAT would not be a typically American breakfast for sure. So I sat down next to him and ordered the same.My God, it was so good! The tripe was wonderful, so tender and yet still springy. There were chunks of sausage and plenty of tomato sauce that I sopped up with pieces of good crusty bread. The nice guy behind the counter had filled my plate almost to overflowing, but I couldn't stop eating. It may go down in memory as one of the best breakfasts I have ever had, if not one of the best meals. As I ate in gusto, I could tell the man next to me was glancing at me from time to time. I recognized the question emanating from him: who was this Asian woman who spoke Spanish with an American accent, who thought nothing of eating tripe for breakfast? In Mexico, he would have asked the question immediately, but it stalled for awhile. But in the end, he had to ask.I had done it, me and my stomach. I had finally made someone in Spain ask, \"De donde eres?\"

Hola from India! I'm enjoying reading about your Spanish culinary adventures, even while I gorge myself on all things masala. Definitely a difference in the two countries, but don't discount the impact of being alone- I think that wherever I am, I wind up having far more authentic conversations when I'm alone, versus being with another traveler.Te extrano, amiga!

I had been a little apprehensive about what the cooking class might be like at Cook and Taste in Barcelona. It was listed in my Lonely Planet, and a poster on Chowhound had recommended it, but I had been afraid that it was a school targeted to tourists wanting to swill sangria and that it would inevitably avoid \"scary\" ingredients. When I saw the menu, I wasn't really reassured: tortilla espanola (the eponymous potato omelet), paella (the eponymous rice dish), sopa de tomates (suspiciously like the eponymous gazpacho), and crema catalana (suspiciously like flan). I wanted to learn how to make food that was essentially Spanish, but also to learn more about Spanish food than I could in New York.But as I've learned so often on my travels, my pessimism was greatly misplaced. Bego, our teacher, was instantly likable, a somewhat serious woman with a quiet but sharp sense of humor. She had been an engineer for years and had started the cooking school as a major career change, but she kept her kitchen clean and her knives sharp like any professionally trained chef. And there was cuttlefish in the paella, bought fresh from La Boqueria that morning.The class wasn't big, three middle-aged women traveling through Italy and Spain together from Los Angeles, me and Anne, one young guy who was clearly a foodie from Australia, and then one motorcycle instructor from England, who it turned out never cooked but had been sent there as part of a tour package. We cooked through the recipes together, two volunteers at a time joining Bego, but all of us watching on, which was a nice change from the team-approach at other cooking schools I've been to. What I loved best was definitely the sopa, the cold soup that she served in little glasses, with a pungent garnish of garlic aioli, hazelnuts, and a hard grated cheese. The tomatoes were almost raw, having only been blanched in boiling water to remove their skins, but sweet and red. It was as beautiful as it was good.Tortilla espanola, I have never particularly cared for, since potatoes are not my favorite vegetable. Bego revealed that the question of whether onion should be added to the potatoes cooked in oil was a controversial question in Spain, one that could even divide families. When I asked Isaac, Mao-Mei's husband about it, he said, \"Huh, that's funny. I never eat tortilla without onion,\" proving her point. But this tortilla, so expertly flipped by Anne, did have a lovely golden crust, and although I still will order almost anything else at a tapas bar, I can see how it's the kind of everyday food that I love, simple, cheap, filling, and tasty.The other controversy in Spanish cooking is apparently whether lemon should be squeezed on paella or not. Bego warned us, if we're invited to a Spanish home and served paella without lemon, not to ask for it. Anne and I had avoided paella up to that point, since it's the kind of thing that tends to get advertised by garish backlit photographs at tourist restaurants, and we both loved what the lemon juice added to the prawns and the cuttlefish, the tomatoes, and almost al dente rice. I loved how the grains felt in my mouth, as if each grain had its own integrity.Crema catalana, in the end, turned out to be a Catalan version of crème brulee, complete with blowtorching of the sugar on top. I liked it, as I like almost all custards, but I think you can imagine what it was like without much more description.I had to admit, what was typical was still real and still good. I left New York to be humbled, to stop being so sure of what I like and what I don't. It's happening.

Even before I had ever tasted them, I knew I would love razor clams. I loved the way they looked at Maceiras in Madrid, at the table next to us, I loved the way they looked in the markets with their long, slim shells and the clam body sticking out at the end like a tongue. I just didn't know how much I would love them until I finally tried them at Alta Taberna Paco Meralgo in Barcelona.Paco Meralgo is a spruced-up tapas bar in the L'Eixample neighborhood with no tables, but blond wood counters running all around and through the restaurant and plenty of bar stools. It's quick and it's busy, bustling with good food and happy people. Anne and I were overwhelmed by the Catalan menu, and frankly, by the Castilian menu as well, but our waiter kindly made a few recommendations to fill out our dinner beyond razor clams. We loved the three kinds of setas or wild mushrooms, liberally drizzled with olive oil, especially an inky-black one that looked as crinkled as seaweed. Based on the signs we read in La Boqueria, we think they were \"trompetas de la mort.\" We enjoyed more croquetas and the crunchy, thin tortillitas de camarones, studded with tiny bits of shrimp. But the first bite I had of my razor clam was like heaven. It tasted salty like the sea, with so much chewy flavor and none of the bitter graininess that you sometimes find in clams. It was seriously succulent. It was possibly one of the top ten most delicious things I've ever eaten.I liked it so much that I licked my razor clamshell from one end to the other, to get all the juice. When Anne saw what I was doing, she offered me her second razor clam, saying that I was enjoying it so much more than she was. Normally, I would be polite and refuse but I couldn't. I ate three, she ate one.I really love Anne, I really do.

I'm surprised that this is your first encounter with razor clams. I love them too. When you come back we can feast on them at casa mono -- my treat. Why are yours so big, though? The ones I've tried have always been pretty small...

(I'm now in Ronda with Becca, having spent the last week traveling through Andalucia, so I'm playing major catch-up. Lo siento!)I liked Barcelona so much more than Madrid. Largely, it's because in Catalonia, Anne and I stayed for a chunk of time with our friend Mao-Mei and her husband Isaac in Vilafranca, a small town outside of Barcelona in the heart of cava, or sparkling wine, country. And partly, it's because I had massive culture shock coming to Spain from Mexico. After Mexico, I expected salespeople to greet me like I was a long-lost cousin, waiters to smile with approval at what I ordered, and everyone to be complimentary about my Spanish. It turns out that's just a Latin American thing. In Madrid, until we met up with a friend of a friend who lives in Madrid, Anne and I lived in a little tourist bubble, moving silently among the madrilenos. But being who I am, one of the big reasons I loved Barcelona was the food. Despite our morning adventures, breakfast was not Madrid's strong suit, whereas in Barcelona, I had some of the most memorable breakfasts of my life at La Boqueria, Barcelona's famed market.Our first morning in Barcelona, Anne and I went straight to Pinotxo, the most famous bar/food stand in La Boqueria, which is immediately visible the moment you walk in the Ramblas gate. Juan, the owner, has been greeting locals and tourists for many years. There's no menu, so I tried to hold off ordering for as long as possible, to see what everyone else was eating. We got a big plate of chickpeas in a strong, olive sauce; some ham croquetas that melted away, and two little glasses of café con leche. But we were still hungry. \"Could I have one of those donuts over there?\" I asked.\"No, they're not available,\" the counterman said. \"They've been reserved.\"Reserved! We inquired about their name, xuxo, pronounced \"chu-cho,\" Anne and I looked at each other. The solution was obvious. \"Please, could we reserve donuts for tomorrow?\"\"Two?\"\"Yes, two!\"\"Okay, I'll remember!\"The next day, there they were, waiting for us on top of the espresso maker. (TIP: if you get there early enough, around 9:15, there will be some unreserved donuts left, but you'll have to move fast.) Anne and I hadn't even really known what they were when we reserved them, knowing only that they were beautifully brown and dusted with a good quantity of granulated sugar. So imagine our surprise when we bit into them and found a lovely, light cream inside. The outer layers were as flaky and crisp as a good croissant. It was like someone had taken the idea of a Boston cream donut and made it 1000 times better. Later, when we talked to Bego, our cooking teacher about them, she nodded knowingly and said, \"Yes, Pinotxo is the place to eat xuxos. You'll see them elsewhere, but they're not the same.\"Would it be wrong to name a child, \"Xuxo\"? Perhaps a dog would be better.

My mother loves to look at what other people are eating. We all think the grass is greener on the other side but my mom takes it to a whole new level. When our dog was still alive, she would take him for walks and brazenly look in the windows of restaurants in our Sucho-dong neighborhood in Seoul. Sometimes, she would even hold him up to the window so he, too, could see what people were eating. Who knows what the diners thought, seeing a middle-aged woman and a Yorkshire terrier watching them eat, but she didn't care.Weird tics diminish with each generation, so when I was in Madrid, eating with Anne at Maceiras at Calle Huertas, 66, I didn't have the courage to stare full-on at the three boys eating at the table next to us. But I wanted to. Maceiras is a Galician tapas bar, Galicia being the region in the northwest corner of Spain, renowned for its seafood, and these boys were taking full advantage. Being on Huertas, a street known for its bars, Maceiras had an English menu (and a French one, and a German one), but Anne and I still had trouble picking our food. Our neighbors, on the other hand, had obviously hearty appetites and they ate wave after wave of food: a big bowl of razor clams, 2 plates of steak and French fries, and so many other things I couldn't quite identify and so could only gaze upon with wonder.Our meal itself was very good, but I think we could have benefited from their sure-footed expertise. It turns out an empanada in Galicia is neither a flaky turnover or a maiz tortilla filled with mole amarillo, but a bready, almost casserole-like dish in which some filling of fish or meat can be found in the middle. Hearty and I'm sure satisfying for a hungry Galician peasant, but not revelatory. Similarly, Anne and I felt just okay about the croquetas. There was nothing wrong with them, they weren't greasy, but I think they must be like French fries here for Spaniards, standard and beloved and so they are on every menu.The pulpo, or octopus, however, was excellent, meaty and succulent.The mushrooms sautéed with jamon were also very good, though probably not as nutritious as we told ourselves they were, being one of the few vegetable dishes we ate in Madrid.The restaurant was bustling, with plenty of tourists looking for good cheap food, but plenty of locals, too. It was busy but warm, and I loved its rough-hewn tables and even the amateur, unstylized bird on their bright green sign. I also loved how the wine was served in small white bowls; I just love drinking things in bowls. Must be my Asian blood.Perhaps if I were as brazen as my mother, I could have asked those boys what they were eating or even asked for a taste, but sadly, I am not.

It's funny what you realize about your country only once you leave it. Americans, and I include myself, really like to see a list of available items and their prices. It's important to know how much your coffee costs and that it comes in small, medium, and large. Perhaps it's because we're a very diverse country, and you can never really know what you'll find, or perhaps it's because we know we can be gouged. In Spain, however, things are different. In Madrid, in particular, with its old-school, bocadillo bars and little corner cafes, it was hard to find anything announcing what you could get. So imagine poor Anne and me arriving early in the morning into Madrid, changing trains twice to get from the airport to the hotel by subway, and then looking for breakfast, bleary-eyed. I can barely remember that the café was called Chocolate, and that there was a long bar with middle-aged men eating pastries and drinking coffee and a few café tables. There was a menu on the table, but it seemed to list only fruity, expensive juices, nothing about the coffee everyone was clearly drinking, nor the churros everyone was eating. No one else seemed perturbed; clearly, they all knew what was available. I tried to ask in my Mexican-accented Spanish what was available, and the most we could understand was that there were churros and tostada, or toast. Okay then, some churros and tostada! We were also offered brightly wrapped candies or chocolate, and we had no idea what they were or what they cost or perhaps they were free, who knows?But we did get better at navigating breakfast. We managed to locate places in small alleys, which is no small feat as the old part of Madrid is 90% small alleys, and we lost the fear that we would be charged something exorbitant and unexpected because we never were. Anne found a strong endorsement for Chocolateria San Gines near Puerta del Sol, and by then, we had learned enough to know that churros were skinny and sugarless and that something called purros or parros were a fatter version, similar to the crullers Chinese people like to eat for breakfast with their congee. It was a good thing Anne had done this research because here, also, there was no menu. That didn't detour us, though, and we boldly ordered one of both, cost be damned, and happily dipped them into the thickest hot chocolate I have ever had in my life. It almost sat in my spoon like pudding. I almost didn't miss my morning coffee, the chocolate was so intense. So this is why the churros weren't dusted with sugar! And our breakfast, as always, cost less than expected.Our triumph was complete when we ate croissants at Antigua Pasteleria on Calle Pozo, a tiny little one-block street near Puerta del Sol. We had walked by one morning too early, as it didn't open till 9:30 a.m., but we had seen through the screen doors the happy fat bakers at work. When they saw us peering in, they smiled, \"Buenos dias,\" and we promised each other we could come back the next day.The croissants were unlike any croissants I'd ever had. In my former, snootier life, I might not have ordered them, as I used to be very orthodox about my croissants. They were glazed with an orange-scented marmalade and they pulled apart like sweet challah, but even eggier. There was nothing flaky about them, nothing that shattered, nothing that meant my old criteria for an excellent croissant, but I really enjoyed mine. The bakery didn't sell coffee, so Anne and I wandered towards Puerta del Sol until we found a standard Au Bon Pain-type eatery, which being in Spain, made all its coffee using espresso machines. We found a quiet corner upstairs, with a big window looking out towards Puerta del Sol and ate our croissants and drank our cafes con leche. I don't know how Anne felt, but I felt proud, like I had come a long way.

Anne is one of the best people you could ever travel with. I know that I can be judgmental, opinionated, and incredibly annoying, especially when it comes to food, but Anne was gracious and kind the entire time we were traveling together in Madrid and Barcelona. Even when I took her to an over-the-top fancy and expensive restaurant in Madrid, where we awkwardly sat surrounded by ladies who lunch and businessmen in suits, she only laughed. In the end, I think we had more fun than anyone else in that restaurant.I had picked Zaranda because the Maribel Guides said they offered a fantastic 20-28 Euro prix-fixe lunch. Sadly, it was no longer true and we sat there for at least five minutes, wondering if we should just scurry away, poor American mice that we are. I felt so disoriented, and although the very energetic waiter spoke English, his translation of the menu was so rushed. He kept asking us what we wanted, and when Anne finally chose a baby squid appetizer, I said to her, \"I didn't know you liked squid!\", to which she replied, \"I didn't know what it was, I just had to make him stop!\" Also sadly, Zaranda seemed to be a restaurant where most people don't eat all their food. To me, that's the only explanation for why the waitstaff kept whisking things away before we were done. So although Anne loved the little sesame cracker in the hors d'oeuvres tray, I never got to have any.It's not that the food wasn't good. The amuse-bouche, a monkfish liver, was sharply salty and delicious, meeting that craving that potato chips meet in a much more downmarket way. And it seemed right that at least at some point in Spain, I should eat something with foam on it.The chipirone, or the young squid, was also very good, perfectly tender and succulent.Anne's young female chicken seemed very bland to me, but I enjoyed my solomillo, or beef filet, with a potato stuffed with menudillos. The waiter translated \"menudillos\" as kidneys, my dictionary says giblets, and I'm inclined to go with the waiter as I've never heard of a cow with giblets. It's hard with fancy restaurants that like to use words in fanciful ways. I sat there just staring at the menu, feeling like I had learned nothing in four months in Mexico. In any case, it was tender and tasty, though I'm the kind of girl that likes my beef to have some chew to it. I was more excited to be eating menudillos, which had a strong but not unpleasant taste.The best part, though, was when it came to dessert. When we ordered the toffee molten cake, we were told that it would take some extra time and were fed complimentary little cups of a light, white custard with passionfruit jelly on top. This was delicious and I loved it.The toffee cake wasn't bad either, and we finished that, too. But then, as we began to relax and think about how this whole disorienting experience might soon be over, the waiter came over with a platter of little cookies, the petit-fours, saying as he presented them, \"Normally, I bring these over with the coffee, and I didn't know what to do since you didn't order any coffee, but I thought I'd bring them anyway.\" He meant well, but I guffawed when Anne whispered, \"He didn't know what to do with people as cheap as us, but here are the cookies anyway!\"I almost died laughing when Anne followed up with, \"I bet we're the only people in this restaurant who would even consider staying at the Hostal Lopez.\" She thought it even funnier that after our meal, we finished the day by touring the stadium Santiago Bernabeu, the home of the Real Madrid futbol team, where she took a particularly memorable photo of me clutching my heart in front of a larger-than-life photo of Zinedine Zidane. I don't mean to be criticizing Zaranda, which I'm sure provides a delectable experience for those who are fortunate enough to enjoy it without a thought for their pocketbooks. I'm just happy that Anne and I will have memories of Zaranda that go way, way beyond the food.

By the time we got to Segovia, our fourth full day in Spain, Anne and I were full of culture, and not in a happy way. Our first day, we arrived in Madrid at 7 a.m. (1 a.m. NY-time), felt a rush of energy from the thrill of being in Spain, and marched out at 9:30 a.m. to see the Palacio Real, the Royal Palace. We kept this up somehow for a couple of days, seeing museums and palaces and cathedrals, and by the third evening, when we had gotten home from a day-trip to Toledo, I said to Anne wanly from my bed, \"If you don't mind, I think I'll sit in a café while you look at the Alcázar in Segovia tomorrow.\"But as we sat on the bus to Segovia, my spirits lifted as I read about Segovia's specialty--roast suckling pig, or cochinillo. Segovia itself was beautiful, sunny and inviting, in a way that Toledo with its dark, cramped alleys just hadn't been. I was moved by the 2000-year-old Roman aqueducts, and even enjoyed the Moorish Alcázar, with its Sleeping Beauty turrets and large picture windows, revealing views of rivers, minor castles, and enormous sky. And when it was time to eat lunch, I realized just how much I liked Segovia.We chose Narizotas, more for its sunny patio than anything else, and ordered the \"menu del dia turistico,\" which includes a soup of judiones, or white beans, cochinillo, ice cream for dessert, and the glass of wine that is so obligatory, it's almost always included in the prix-fixe lunches. We also added a plate of jamón ibérico, our first taste of Spain's famed ham.The jamón was as delicious as it looked, and we congratulated ourselves for eating vegetables, the ripe tomatoes and herby green sauce, sharp with mustard, that came with the jamón. It's good that Anne is a doctor, as she was able to reassure me that despite the serious lack of vegetables in my life here, I would not get scurvy in 7 weeks. The soup of judiones beans was simple, lots of tomatoes and chunks of meat. Good, but not exciting, and to be quite honest, I had a little bit of trouble eating meat that still seemed to have some hair stuck to it. But the cochinillo was everything I had dreamed it would be. Cochinillo is always made from a 21-day-old piglet that has eaten nothing but its mother's milk. I don't know any more because I didn't have time to do sufficient research on Spanish food before leaving, but luckily, I didn't need to know more to eat with gusto. The skin didn't merely crackle, it shattered, and the meat was incredibly tender, melting in its own fat.We sat in the sun, drinking wine and sparkling water, eating roast pig and watching Segovia locals and tourists walk by. It's what you imagine life in Spain to be like, no?

Before I left for Spain, I had a friend say to me, \"You know, my friend So-and-So didn't really like the food in Spain.\" To which I replied, \"But she doesn't eat pork!\" And my friend had to agree that So-and-So would probably not be the best judge of food in Spain.Spain is famous for its jamón, or ham, giant hind legs of the pig, complete with hoof, that you see hanging everywhere. The hoof, I've learned, is attached to the leg for an important reason, but I'll get to that later. The first time I saw them displayed, I got very excited and started taking pictures, but the sight of them is almost passé to me now. Eating them, of course, will never be passé.Anne and I arrived in Barcelona on Monday afternoon and stayed in Barcelona proper for two nights before heading to Vilafranca del Penedés, a town of about 35,000 people an hour outside of Barcelona, where our friend Mao-Mei lives with her Catalan husband, Isaac. (I'm going to have to go back and write more about Madrid.) Barcelona immediately felt very different from Madrid--warmer, both in terms of temperature and attitude, and very open, with its Paris-like wide boulevards as beautiful and as striking as the medieval warren of streets of the the Barri Gotic. The Moderniste architecture by Gaudi and others adds an immediately whimsical feel to the city, but Anne and I may also like Barcelona so much because after all the churches and castles of Madrid, we took a bike tour and a cooking class in Barcelona. The cooking class included a market tour of La Boqueria, the oldest market in Barcelona and the most famous. Located right off the Ramblas, the main thoroughfare as touristy as Times Square but more attractive, La Boqueria draws a lot of tourists as well. But it's also a real, functioning market. I saw one butcher showing off pictures of her granddaughter to a regular, and as Bego, our teacher pointed out, you could see the changes in Spanish society by the new stands focused on Asian or Latin American ingredients. I even saw a Korean stand called \"Macitta,\" which means \"delicious\" in Korean, though they seemed mainly to sell a lot of prepared food and instant ramen.For an American who glories in gory food, La Boqueria was heaven. There were chickens with their heads still on, heads of lambs complete with eyeballs, and skinned rabbits laid-out with their little butts facing up, like darling little sunbathers. And the seafood! My God, when I think of the fish stands of your average American supermarket and how you can't find a freakin' whole fish. I saw big octopi with their tentacles spreading like blooming flowers, shiny little herrings, entire stands devoted to bacalao or salt cod, and funny fish heads that I almost wanted to talk to.But the highlight of the market tour, to be sure, was when Bego explained how to pick a good ham. First, you get what you pay for. Second, the \"pata negra\" or the black hoof belongs to the best pigs, the black ones who feed on acorns and wander free-range in the Extremedura. This is what is called jamón iberico, and as it's the priciest, you need to make sure that you are truly getting jam from a black pig. Show me the hoof! One seller we saw had a flat-screen TV showing his pigs, presumably, frolicking in the meadow.Once the ham has been sliced through, you can look for things like a thick, white rather than yellow layer of fat around the ham. There should also be small white specks in the red part of the ham itself, as that indicates that it has been well-cured.Once you have such a fine ham, Bego advised that it had to be served correctly, always at room temperature. If vacuum-packed, the ham should be opened for at least half an hour before serving.When I asked how long a ham would last, Bego smiled and said, \"It goes very fast.\" But if you ration yourself, your ham can last as long as three months. You can leave it hanging out at room temperature, using the outer layer of fat to cover the cut area. I instantly had a beautiful image of a ham hanging from the ceiling in my Brooklyn kitchen, but can you imagine me trying to squeeze a giant leg of ham into my backpack? Dreams, sueños, dreams.

As shocking as it seems, but I didn't plan out my entire food itinerary before I got here. I only had reservations at one restaurant in Madrid, I had no list of \"must-dos.\" What I wanted to feel was the culture of food here, for ordinary people everyday, to be in a world where anchovies were normal. Poor Anne, she patiently followed me as I walked up and down the aisles of the grocery store at the basement of the department store chain, El Corte Ingles, not looking at me like I was a crazy person while I peered at flan sold in pudding packs, tins of shellfish, and jars of marmalade. She even took a photo of me caressing an entire ham.So in my first 6 days in Spain, in Madrid, I've inevitably had meals that were so-so, not bad, just very ordinary, except it wouldn't have been very ordinary in New York. I had a cheap bocadillo, or sandwich, the other day, a plain almost tough roll with some fried boquerones, or white anchovies, inside, no mayo, no sauce, no nothing. It was the equivalent of a decent slice of pizza on any random corner in N, but in NY, Whole Foods sells boquerones for some insane price per pound.And then there are places like Txirimiri, a pintxos/tapas bar in La Latina with food so good that when I dropped half my tapa on the floor, I considered applying the five-second rule and eating it.Anne and I arrived there by accident. We were aiming for one of the more famous places in La Latina, along Calle Cava Baja or Cava Alta, but it was pouring and we jumped in. Instantly, I was overwhelmed. The bar was lined with people chatting, drinking, eating, there were pintxos, or Basque-style tapas on bread on the counter, and then a blackboard listing more. I'd read all the guide books on how tapas worked, but I felt so frozen, so totally lost. Anne says I hid it well, but I was terrified. Luckily, I didn't have to fight for the bartender's attention and I managed to order a glass of wine and two raciones, or larger portions of tapas, of the blackboard.This was called a bacalao tempura, and it came on a bed of caramelized onions and peppers, so sweet and rich, and a perfect balance to the golden cod. I had told Anne earlier how much I loved the word \"bacalao,\" and when I told her it was salt cod, she had been wary, but not after tasting this. The crisp crust, the meltingly tender fish inside--it brought fried fish to a whole new level. This was called \"habitas baby,\" and we deduced after it arrived that the \"habitas\" must refer to the beans. More caramelized onions, which was good as I can never get enough. It was like an intense, salty shot of flavor, topped with jamon and foie. By now, I was relaxed. The wine was working its magic, especially since it was so cheap, and we just started pointing and eating. I started to fall in love with Madrid. Three nights later, we came back for our last dinner in Madrid and ate another round of the bacalao and things I didn't need to identify to enjoy. Txirimiri is special and obviously popular, as packed as it is with hip young things, but in its own way, felt as ordinary as the corner bar selling bocadillos de boquerones fritos. I've long gotten over my embarrassment taking pictures of my food, but I felt a pang of sadness, knowing that to eat cheap, delicious food and drink a $2 glass of wine in a comfortable bar was nothing notable for the Spaniards around us. But not so sad that I lost my appetite.

Coming home was a horror. I'd been looking forward to going back to NY for days, maybe even weeks, but it was awful. As I tried to board my plane from Oaxaca to Houston, security forced me to leave my molcajete behind because it was in my carry-on and it was too late to put in in the luggage I had already checked. But I managed to be Zen and get on board, reminding myself how crowded my kitchen is with gadgets, except that two hours later, I arrived at an American airport where everyone was decidedly not Zen. The girl in front of me in line at immigration made a constant stream of loud, unpleasant noises about how she was going to miss her flight. The sense of self-importance was frighteningly, recognizably American. When I went to the cash register to buy my NY Times, the clerk looked at me like I had just given her yet another reason to hate her life. I sat down in my seat on a crowded plane for the Houston-NY leg, and the elderly woman next to me barely mustered a response to my hello, my English translation for the \"buenos dias\" I've gotten so used to saying to anybody and everybody. (To be fair, she was quite nice to me later, but I'd gotten so used to the Mexican way of assuming everyone is nice, instead of waiting to see.)It got worse. For our \"dinner/snack,\" Continental served \"pizza\" and a \"salad.\" I am not putting those words in quotes to be cute. There was something seriously demented about the \"food.\" The pizza, which was supposed to be steak and cheese, also declared that it was \"Made with Ranch Dressing.\" And they're bragging about this? It made the bready slice of Papa Johns pizza I had gotten before the flight seem like the finest Neopolitan pizza in retrospect. I considered eating the salad, trying to garner at least some nutritional benefit, but as I looked at plastic container filled with pieces of iceberg lettuce and a few sad shreds of carrot at the bottom, I realized I would lose more than I gained by putting the creamy dressing on it. I was better off eating the little Kit-Kat bar for the calcium in the chocolate.The worst thing about it is that everyone else ate their snack, all of it. They were hungry, I'm sure, and maybe they didn't even notice how bad it was. I almost felt like rising up, like a labor organizer, \"Demand your rights to decent food! We don't have to put up with this!\"But I didn't. Welcome home.

Best MarketThe most unbelievable one in Oaxaca City proper is Mercado Abastos, which is literally labyrinthine. Mercado 20 de noviembre and Mercado Juarez south of the zocalo are definitely worth visiting, as they are always bustling with a huge array of stuff, from leather sandals to mole pastes to nieves to piñatas. Ocotlan and Tlacolula are two exciting pueblo markets, held on Friday and Sunday, respectively, that sprawl with plenty of live animals, turkeys, rabbits, goats. Rick Bayless raves about the tamales and empanadas at Mercado de la Merced, about 8 blocks east of the zocalo, but I've never been because I had my own neighborhood market: Mercado Sanchez Pascuas. It's situated between Tinoco y Palacios and Porfirio Diaz just north of Quetzalcoatl. It can seem really dead in the afternoons, but if you go in the mornings, especially on Saturday or Sunday, it's bustling with people doing their daily marketing. This is not a country that shops once a week for groceries. In addition to the stands selling meat, fruit, cheese, and bread, there are vendors who just set up tarps outside the western entrance, selling whatever they brought in that day from their village, like roses, chiles de agua, and giant fava beans. There are two tamale sellers, the one in the middle of the meat section and another with a little table by the empanada/memela ladies near the western entrance. The one in the middle has the better tamal de mole, wrapped in banana leaf with mole negro and chicken, but the one on at the entrance has a great tamal de salsa verde, very fresh and bright.The Mercado Organico at El Pochote on Fridays and Saturdays is also terrific, but I don't think of it as a true market, as there's very little fresh produce. There is, however, some of the best street food in Oaxaca, and safe for sensitive gringo stomachs. You can also buy good Real Minera brand mezcal, from a sweet man who will pour a very generous taster of anything you want to try. The Anejo and the Reserva, I think are particularly good, and the cremas, which are sweet versions flavored with everything from passionfruit to coffee, are good alternatives for people who don't really want to be drinking mezcal. I almost always bought breads (especially the long, flat pizza-flatbreads) and Korean take-out food from Alegria de Angelis, and frequently bought the maracuya-coffee jam, the organic coffee, and pottery. The one man who consistently sells fresh produce has very beautiful lettuce and other greens, right inside the door, though it goes fast, and there are always people with unusual, striking native flowers outside the doors the same days. Don't bother showing up before 9:30 or even 10, though--you're in Mexico.Mercado Hidalgo on Emilio Carranza, a block north of Belisario Dominguez, in Colonia Reforma has beautiful produce, but it's a little out of the way for most tourists.Best SupermarketWhen you need toilet paper, dish detergent, peanut butter, and unsweetened, plain yogurt: Gigante. The one in Colonia Reforma is the spiffiest, but the one a couple of blocks west of the Basilica de la Soledad on Independencia is probably closer for most tourists. If I just need a few things, I like going to Pitico, which is a small grocery chain scattered throughout the city, bigger than a bodega but smaller than Gigante, which is sort like Kmart. I've bought good chorizo there, decent produce, as well as things like paper towels, but I've only seen Alpura brand, unsweetened yogurt at Gigante. Even though nearly all yogurt is sweetened (and watch out if it says \"no sugar,\" as it could be sweetened with Splenda), all the granola I've tried in Oaxaca, just bought at grocery stores, has been surprisingly unsweet and very good.Best BreadThe vendor furthest north, or furthest to the right as you're facing the Tinoco y Palacios entrance at Mercado Sanchez has good bread, chewy and flavorful, my favorites being the flat rolls with sesame seeds on top and the large cinnamon-raisin breads with brioche-like topknots, but only in the mornings. Pan & Co., on Constitucion at the corner of Garcia Vigil, has very good bread, including one of the best ciabattas I've ever had, but it's \"European artisanal style,\" not Mexican. I am very fond of Fidel Integral on 20 de noviembre, south of Hidalgo, which makes whole-wheat breads that don't taste like cardboard.Best CoffeeMexico produces some of the best coffee in the world, but the highest-quality tends to get exported to the U.S. and Europe, as Mexico doesn't have the coffee culture of Italy, France, or even Starbucks-America. If you are a coffee-lover, your ordinary cup in Oaxaca will probably taste a little feeble, though if you get a chance, the traditional café de olla, flavored with piloncillo or unrefined sugar and cinnamon, can be good and strong. A lot of the little fondas in the markets will just use instant Nescafe. It is possible, though, to find places in Oaxaca that serve Mexico's best, called Pluma Hidalgo. These two are my favorites: 1) El Pochote Mercado Organico, the woman with the stand farthest north, selling also whole-bean and ground coffee called \"Maravilla de Araguz\"2) Nuevo Mundo on M. Bravo between Porfirio Diaz and Alcala. I've heard Coffee Beans on Garcia Vigil, next to Café Brujula, also serves Pluma Hidalgo, and Café Antigua on Reforma north of Constitucion is also popular. Best Street FoodSo good you feel like you're going to faint, and so hot they made my nose run: empanadas de mole amarillo and tacos de chile relleno next to Iglesia Carmen de Arriba on Garcia Vigil. But almost everything at Mercado Organico is also fantastic, especially the tostadas, the mole enchiladas, and the mole tlayuda, made with what the vendors say is a Zapotecan-style of mole. I love the tamales at Mercado Sanchez, especially the ones sold from the center of the room with the meat vendors. And I will always feel a special fondness for Sra Angelita's esquites and elotes on the western side of El Llano (Parque Juarez), as that was where I had my first street food.Best nieves, aguas, and paletasIf the woman selling yogurt and fruit tarts at Mercado Organico is selling strawberry-flavored nieve, get it! Otherwise, they are good but not like you're going to die. In general, I've never had bad nieve, from Chonita in Mercado Juarez to El Niagara near the Basilica de Soledad to the beaches in Puerto Escondido.The best paletas are at Popeye's. You'll see the orange carts all over town and there's a proper outlet on the southside of El Llano. I tried a paleta at Michoacan once, and there was something sort of metallic-tasting, though it may not be fair to judge it based on one paleta. My favorite flavors are cajeta, nuez, sandia, fresa, y chocolate.And of course, Aguas de Casilda.Best ChocolateEveryone I respect agrees that Chocolate Mayordomo has the best chocolate, even if it is the most commercial and widely marketed. I always took visitors to the one on Mina, between 20 de noviembre and Miguel Cabrera, south of Mercado 20 de noviembre, because it's bright and spacious with samplers in easy reach. It smells really good, too.I didn't taste much prepared mole while I was there, but I am planning to take some home from Chocolates de Guelaguetza and Chocolates de Soledad, based on Patty's and Soledad's recommendations. It's easy to end up with mole that's too sweet so be sure to taste a sample before buying, it's normal.Desserts in Oaxacan restaurants, especially for the set-lunch, can be disappointing, but I had addictively delicious chocolate desserts at La Biznaga and Casa Oaxaca, and I am the kind of person who sneers at molten chocolate cake.Best Wireless CaféAll of these have good, strong signals with plenty of seats. Where I went depended on what I wanted to eat. I would probably give a slight edge to Café los Cuiles for having the broadest menu, as well as alcohol. I like having a beer while I write, don't you?1) Café Los Cuiles on Abasolo between Alcala and 5 de mayo, across from the handicrafts plaza. Nothing to write home about, but dependable, decent food and excellent Oaxacan hot chocolate.2) Café Brujula on Garcia Vigil just north of Allende. The nicest, smiliest staff ever and my favorite drink in Oaxaca, pepe y limonada con agua mineral, cucumber-lime juice with carbonated water.3) Nuevo Mundo on M. Bravo between Porfirio Diaz and Alcala. Uncomfortable chairs, sort of metal-café style, but very laid-back, nice staff, and excellent coffee.Best Cooking ClassSra Soledad Ramirez, who teaches at the Instituto Cultural Oaxaca and will teach private classes upon request, is a Oaxacan grandmother to all who know her.Seasons of My Heart, with Susana Trilling in Etla, is a completely different experience. Not quite like being in a Oaxacan abuela's home, but also a lot of fun. Susana is not a Oaxacan grandmother, but knowledgeable nonetheless, and just tasting the hand-harvested salt from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and tasting the excellent El Rey Zapoteco mezcal is exhilarating.

My Very Subjective Best of Oaxaca Guide, Part I

Best All-Around RestaurantLa Biznaga is perfection. Casa Oaxaca has wonderful food, but La Biznaga is even better and in a classy, yet casual setting. It's nueva cocina, traditional Mexican food with smart, interesting modern touches, but without ever losing respect for the traditional. Don't be deterred by the \"nice restaurant\" prices--the portions are big, and no one will care, including you, if you just order an appetizer for dinner. You'll be particularly happy if you order the Trilogia Mixteca, an unbelievable appetizer sampler that includes quesillo wrapped in a hoja santa leaf, a memelita with beans and queso fresco, a fried little cone stuffed with jamaica in refreshingly picante guacamole, and even a little blob of simple yet delicious beans. But if you are hungry for more, other dishes I've loved are the mushroom soup, the chicken stuffed with peppers and squash blossoms in a chile poblano sauce and the chicken stuffed with plaintains in a guava mole sauce. I almost never order chocolate dessert, but their chocolate mousse I would happily eat over and over.And if La Biznaga is closed, I would go to Zandunga for istmeno food. A plate of garnachas and a beer is good eating! But if you want more, we also tried and liked the estofada, chicken stewed with fruits and vegetables, all sort of mixed together. Don't be turned off by the fact that it looks like a pile of turd, it's good.Best Comida CorridaI went several times to La Olla on Reforma between Abasolo and Constitucion for their comida corrida and was disappointed only once. It's a pleasant, brightly lit restaurant, and everything comes prepared and plated with finesse, but it's only 70 pesos for a 4-course meal, plus an agua of fruit. Nothing will blow your mind, but almost everything is tasty and comforting, starting with the excellent tortilla chips, bread and salsa. My favorites off the menu are the pasilla chile stuffed with cheese and beans and the tlayuda azteca, a big thick, almost tough but very Oaxacan tortilla which you can ask to have spread with half red mole and half black mole, and then the chicken, avocado, and tomatoes.I tried various set lunch deals at other places, but nowhere else was particularly noteworthy, other than El Escapulario on Garcia Vigil north of Carranza. It's more of a hole-in-the-wall, and not something to make space in your schedule for, but if you're here for awhile and want to get a good meal for 35 pesos, El Escapulario is a good place to go.Best SeafoodIf you go to Puerto Escondido, definitely the old man selling shellfish out of his bucket on Playa Carrizalillo. But if you want to eat someplace a little more regulated, Marco Polo on El Llano was one of the few places I went more than once. A long-time American resident in Oaxaca told me that Sushi Itto in the zocalo isn't bad, but when I said I would go try it, she hastened to add that I shouldn't bother, it's only acceptable for people who are truly stuck in Oaxaca.Best Place for Bar SnacksLa Biche Pobre closes before dinner time, but if you need an excuse to drink in the afternoon--I don't--their fried pork is an excellent excuse. There are other snacks that are tasty, but the fried pork is sublime.I, sadly, did not get to try very many cantinas, places where they bring you free food with your booze. El Paseo's food was so-so. I wish I had tried La Farola, advertised as the oldest cantina in Oaxaca, complete with swinging doors, but I never got around to it. La Farola is reputed to serve El Rey Zapoteco, my favorite brand of mezcal.Best Place to Eat on a Cold and Rainy NightI thought Patty's pozole was the best, though it might have been the heady thrill of trying it for the first time, but if you're not staying with her and her family, you can find warming pozole at La Gran Torta, open from 7 pm to 2 am, on Porfirio Diaz between Morelos and Independencia (closed on Tuesdays). They serve three kinds, Jalisco (white), Guerrero (green), and Michoacan (red). The Guerrero comes with chicharrones and avocado, as well as your choice of meat, but the Michoacan is more warming and spicy.

I spent some time in Puerto Escondido this past December, and time in Oaxaca several years ago. In Puerto we ate at a large garage-type cantina and had squash blossom juice that was wonderful. I've recently posted a picture of the squash blossoms on my photoblog - you should check it out. I will also be posting some pictures of the bay that we stayed on in Peurto (my in-laws home).My husband loves Mexican food, so I will make sure he spends time checking out your site.www.visualpeace.blogspot.com

Those are some gorgeous squash blossoms. I never saw juice in Oaxaca, though, how interesting.

Just came back from a month in Oaxaca. The food was EXCELLENT. Loved La Biznaga, La Olla, Casa Oaxaca and even the little place near Parque Juárez--Wl Fogoncito. Their \"arrachera\" was tender. I tried the new El Naranjo and was thrilled. I had been to it with the previous owner Ilyana and found the new owner to be knowledgeable and willing to try new things. I loved the estufada and in particular what he did with the two-toned soup. You could order the the salsa made from one of the soups to be poured over chicken. Couldn't argue with the location either.

AppleSister; I knew that when I was looking for specific restaurant recommendations in Oaxaca, I could go to your blog and get info with confidence. I'd seen a rather florid review of La Biznaga elsewhere and it gave me doubts. It was difficult to get good Google results on Zandunga.So, from what I'm reading here, you'd rate La Biznaga número uno, and Zandunga número dos?What IS, exactly, \"Istmeño cuisine\"? I can't help but think of iguanas.Saludos, Mike (AKA \"Anonimo\" on CH and on TT)

You know, I just figured out you're \"Anonimo\" yesterday :) I really liked La Biznaga. At least when I was there in 2007, the prices were slightly higher than eating at a more typical place but I felt like they were justified. Everything was made with care and thought; the hoja santa wrapped around quesillo was incredible. I only ate at Zandunga once but really enjoyed it, especially the botana platter. I don't really know what istmeno food is either, but the platter had little tostadas with toppings I'd never seen anywhere else.

I never intended this blog to be a diary--I already have a diary and it is not online--but it seems appropriate, at the end of my four months in Oaxaca, to answer some personal questions I know people are going to ask.Will you miss Oaxaca?To be honest, I didn't love Oaxaca. I think the places we most love are the places where we have happy memories. Oaxaca will always be the place where I went to think, to be alone, and thus to be lonely. Being lonely when you're traveling has a different flavor than being lonely at home. You feel strong and brave, like someone who is doing something no one else has ever done before. The mere act of eating, of reading, of walking through the streets feels full. Everything is bright. You can almost look at your loneliness in your hand and marvel at it. This is why you left, to be alone. But it's still not a happy, giddy feeling. I'm grateful to Oaxaca for being a wonderful place to be alone, with people so warm and generous I never felt like a solitary freak. I'm overwhelmed by all I've learned about Mexican and Oaxacan food, more than I ever would have learned during a two-week vacation. But I miss New York more than I ever thought I would, and I would kill for some sushi.What are you going to do now?I'm going to Spain! I'm flying back to NY next Wednesday for about a week, to witness the nuptials of a good friend, and then I fly to Spain for 7 weeks. I'll travel with friends for the first 3.5 weeks, through Madrid, Barcelona, and a couple towns in Andalucia. Then I'm on my own. I'll probably wend my way up the western end of Spain, through Salamanca and Santiago de Compostela, ending up in the Basque Country and San Sebastian, a small, coastal city with as outsize a reputation for great food as Oaxaca. And then what?And then I go back to the U.S. to spend Thanksgiving with friends, and then I'll spend the month of December in Korea with my parents. I'll be back in Brooklyn right after New Year's 2008.But seriously, what are you going to do when you get back?Ha ha ha ha! Ask me in January, por favor. Rather than look forward, I'm going to post a very subjective \"Best of Oaxaca\" guide over the next couple of days.

Zandunga, or, How Rebecca Saved Me from Loneliness and Boredom

In one week, I am leaving Oaxaca. It's just as well, as I am running out of things to blog about. I've been lonely and bored, and the fact that I am getting tired of Mexican food has seriously affected my number one way of combating loneliness and boredom. Thankfully, my friend Rebecca is in town for a last-minute visit, and her enthusiastic and happy food-loving personality has reignited my enthusiasm for Mexican food. And of course, I am just thrilled to have her here. One of the things I have realized most during my four months here is how much I love my friends and how lucky I am to have them.With Rebecca's open mind and stomach, I've even been able to try things that I wouldn't have been able to eat on my own, like the appetizer sampler plate for two at Zandunga, a restaurant on Garcia Vigil near the corner of Carranza that specializes in food from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec in Oaxaca state. Even I could not have handled that bountiful platter of food alone.Anthropologists are fascinated by the Isthmus because of its matriarchal society; folklorists are interested in the colorful huipiles or traditional clothes worn by these powerful women (often worn by Frida Kahlo) and its festive atmosphere and music. But for me, not surprisingly, the most powerful attraction is from its delicious and unique food. One day, I would love to go on a tour with Susana Trilling , eat more of the food I tried at Zandunga, and dance with the zandungas themselves, women \"who radiate beauty, enthusiasm and pride.\"We had actually only come to Zandunga because La Biznaga was closed for the week for renovations, and I was apprehensive, worried that I was going to waste one of Rebecca's meals in Oaxaca on something not-so-good. But soon after we sat down, we knew everything was going to be just fine. They immediately brought out a small plate of perfectly fried tortilla chips, a little bowl of dark, intense salsa, and another small plate of meltingly tender, crumbled ground beef. It doesn't sound like much, but when we had eaten all the chips, I started just spooning the ground beef up with my salsa-laden spoon. (Rebecca is a very good friend--I have no shame around her.)We quickly decided on the appetizer sampler, which included the following: 1) 3 garnachas, small fried tortillas with a mound of tender meat, fresh cheese, and a tomato sauce, served with pickled cabbage, our favorite. So good we carefully split the third one in half, neither of us able to pretend we didn't want it;2) 1 tamal de cambray, made of a masa that seemed sweeter, almost as sweet as American cornbread, and stuffed with a picadillo of shredded meat with cinnamon and raisins;3) 2 molotes de platano, little torpedos of mashed plantains with a dark, fried crust;4) 2 empanadas, darling little fried turnovers stuffed with meat and served with a garnish of cabbage, crema and salsa;5) 1 generous bowl of ensalada de pica de gallo, which was the tomato-onion-cilantro mixture we're used to seeing as pica de gallo, but with dried shrimp that made it deliciously fishy; and6) 1 generous bowl of carne horneada, which were big hunks of beef that seemed to have been cooked very very slowly in a red, spicy rub.It was accompanied with a stack of totopos, the tortillas made with corn unique to the Isthmus, flat and crunchy like a cracker.The garnachas, the tamal de cambray, the carne horneada and the ensalada de pica de gallo were superb. Everything else was very good. Rebecca was happy, I was no longer bored nor lonely. It's universally known, there's little in life that can make you as content as sharing a plate of riquissimos antojitos, appetizers, antipasti, whatever you want to call it, with an old friend.

Itanoni, Flower of Corn

***CONTENT
Yesterday, as I ate the most delicious tortillas of my life at Itanoni, a casual restaurant that seriously celebrates corn, I thought about Mexican Independence Day, which begins tonight at 11 pm with \"El grito de independencia\" or the shout for independence in the zocalo. As the cheese and poblano peppers, with their slight yet sure spiciness, oozed out of my rolled-up taco, as I scooped up the last bit of chicharrones, or fried pork rinds, in red salsa with my bare fingers, I pondered all the ways in which Mexico is so different from the U.S. When I bit into my tetela, the pre-Hispanic triangular corn turnover filled, in this case, with an intense black bean puree, enhanced by crema, queso, and the anise-scented hoja santa, I sighed and longed for some culinary delight that would link me and my country to a history spanning more than 250 years.Mexicans domesticated corn 9000 years ago. They've probably been eating tortillas for almost as long. Although the Spanish brought smallpox, death, and destruction to the indigenous peoples, Mexicans are still eating the tortillas the conquistadors were given when they arrived 500 years ago. I imagine most Mexicans take this for granted. Itanoni doesn't. Its full name is \"Itanoni, Flor del Maiz,\" meaning \"Flower of Corn.\" It declares with pride that all its antojitos are made out of maiz criollo, meaning that the variety is indigenous and native to Mexico. (Criollo also means a Mexican of Spanish descent. Confusing and yet revealing, no?) Each plastic table, under its plastic tablecloth, displays a sweet story about the ant that revealed to the god Quetzalcoatl the secret of maiz, thus ending a famine. Although Itanoni has a heightened sense of purpose, it tries to look like yet another little storefront selling memelas, tacos, and other small treats based on masa or corn dough, with its tin roof and casual, cheap resort furniture. You only begin to notice how self-consciously it seeks to be traditional when you see the menus, artfully designed with wholesome corrugated cardboard and brown paper, the aguas served in old-fashioned, thick glass bottles, and the sturdy construction of the wood-burning, outdoor stoves. Whatever Itanoni is doing, it works. My tacos, my tetela, were the best anything made out of masa I have ever eaten anywhere. They reminded me that like a sandwich, a taco can be elevated by tasty fillings, but it can never be sublime without a great base. They had subtle layers, as flat as they were, almost like roti but without a hint of grease. They were unsalted and unsweet, tasting purely and cleanly of corn. The outer layers were toasty, while the inner layers remained soft and pliable. Is there anything that smells more innocent and more comforting than something toasted? Octavio Paz says that Mexico believes in a continuity between its indigenous past and its post-Revolution, independent state, broken only by a couple hundred years of New Spain. Unlike the U.S., whose Founding Fathers plotted for independence without a thought for the Native Americans, the Mexican struggle for independence began with a Catholic priest calling to action angry indigenous groups, mestizos, and criollos, Mexican-born Spaniards who didn't have the power and status accorded to Spanish-born Spaniards. However false and however strange, as Paz implies it is, to see modern Mexico as a restoration of what existed before New Spain, it's what Itanoni celebrates, a sense of gastronomic and cultural heritage stretching back thousands of years. I envy it, if only because the food is so delicious. What would we similarly celebrate in the U.S.? Corn-on-the-cob? Roast turkey, when they're bred to be so big-breasted the poor things end up with sad, sexless, artificially inseminated lives? (Apparently, Mexican Independence Day is now being celebrated in California. Really, illegal immigration is just Mexico's revenge for having lost California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas to the U.S. only 150 years ago.) Calvin Trillin is probably right, the best thing that ever happened to America food-wise was the Immigration Act of 1965. When I get home, I am going to comfort myself with a big platter of sushi.

You can find good nieve almost anywhere in Oaxaca, a random street corner in Colonia Reforma even. This melon had a lovely creaminess to it that didn't keep it from being light and fresh with the flavor of real melons.But possibly the most beautiful place to eat nieve is at the ice cream \"jardin\" at the base of the Basilica de Nuestra Senora de la Soledad. The ornate façade of the cathedral faces west an open plaza ringed by walls. Just beyond that plaza to the east are five or six nieve vendors set up with wrought-iron chairs and café tables, as well as bright striped metal parasols. A few steps above and to the north is an even larger plaza with giant steps leading down from the street. This plaza is reputed to be a popular place for dance groups to rehearse, though the only thing I've ever seen is a pick-up soccer game but that itself was good entertainment. Sitting on the giant steps and facing south, you can see palm trees and then past them, the mountains to the south of the city. It's not the most majestic view, definitely not the most breathtaking, but sitting there, looking out at the mountains, the church, and even the slightly dingy plastic tarps and parasols of the nieve sellers, it's easy to feel a sense of peace.If you have a little cup or cone of nieve, of course, you can feel glee as well as peace. I've only tried one, El Niagara, but have been told they're all more or less the same. My little cup was filled with durazno, or peach, on the bottom and then cajeta, or goat's milk dulce de leche, on top. They're more like sorbet than the super-fatty, super-creamy ice cream I love most, and yet I never feel like I'm missing something. The durazno had little chunks of peach! Nothing ever tastes false here.

There is Korean food in Oaxaca, and it is very good. But the Korean woman who makes the food and her Italian husband are perhaps even more remarkable than the fact of the food's existence.Gya is married to Sandro, short for Alessandro, who is Italian. They have two children, a daughter named Aruna and a son named Govinda. Since these names are neither Korean nor Italian, and knowing what I do of their story, I imagine that both names are Sanskrit.The family lives high on a hilltop in San Agustin Etla, about 30 minutes outside of Oaxaca City. Of the pueblos I have seen, Etla is the prettiest. The various towns that comprise Etla are all nestled in little dips among green hills, among skies that seem to draw close enough for you to touch. You can walk 50 feet in any direction and find a beautiful view, a buenavista. Gya and Sandro have named their home, \"Alegria de Angelis,\" or \"The Happiness of Angels.\" Here they grow organic vegetables in plots they themselves built, and run a small restaurant by appointment that serves Italian, Korean, and a few other Asian dishes, like momos, the Nepalese dumplings. They grow sweet basil, Napa cabbage, the vegetables essential to their food. They also sell their food at the organic market in Oaxaca at El Pochote and in a newly opened take-out store in San Felipe. Their children swim in the pond with the carp and the turtles. Gya used to be a dancer, specializing in classical Indian dance. As she says, she was \"loca\" for dance, completely crazy, and one day, she found herself in France trying to decide whether to buy a ticket for Spain to study flamenco or for India to study classical Indian dance. She finally decided to flip a coin, and the coin told her to go to India. But as she sat on the plane, she realized that it was not chance, but fate that was taking her to India. \"Flamenco is a dance of love, but Indian dance is spiritual, and I knew then that I needed to learn a spiritual dance.\"Sometime later, Sandro was traveling through Mexico, with plans to go on to India. A friend of his asked him to go to a particular store in India and buy a dance costume for her. When he got to the store, Gya opened the door. Sandro immediately knew that they would be married, and told her so. Gya told him he was crazy.So Sandro went into the Himalayas to meditate on whether he had had a true revelation. In the mountains, he met an old man who took him into his home. The old man opened a large wardrobe and took out everything, and in the end, there were two ancient rings. The old man said he would give them to him if Sandro gave him everything he had in return, all the clothes he was wearing and all the money he had on him, save what he needed to get back. When Sandro went back to Gya with the two rings, they were married.I've seen the photos of their wedding in India, Gya with her face beautiful, smooth and calm, color smeared on her forehead, and Sandro, looking handsome and inimitably Italian, even with the topknot of hair he wore and the smear of color on his forehead. (As much as I love the improbableness of their story, I must note how lovely they both were and are. If a troll were to tell me we would be married, no matter how enlightened he was or I was, I imagine it would be difficult to say yes. Whereas if someone who looked like Sandro showed up, with all the power of the Himalayas behind him...well.)Sandro and Gya initially wanted to live in India, but found that they, as foreigners, would be restricted in their ability to own land or start a business. So they came to Mexico, traveling from city to city until they stopped at Oaxaca, where it felt right. They have now been in Oaxaca one year. They plan to stay for five years, and then see what happens.The whole thing seems too ethereal to be true, like you're dreaming by a pond in the mountains of Oaxaca, but they are very down-to-earth-people. Best of all, their firm attachment to the pleasures of this earth is manifest in the food that they serve and the joy with which they serve it.I almost wanted to cry as I spooned my bibimbop into my mouth, as I bit down on the sharp, spicy, almost raw kimchi. It's strange how much Mexico seems to reveal to me, almost everyday, how much I miss my mother. There was a slightly foreign note to the spiciness, not dissonant, but not quite familiar, and then Gya explained that she has to combine Mexican hot peppers with the bit of Korean hot pepper she's able to buy in Mexico City.Yet the food was authentic, in the best sense of the word, with love and respect for its traditions. Each component of the bibimbop had been grown, washed, and sautéed just until its flavor became brightest it could be. The fried egg gleamed. Gya had never cooked until they moved here. She had been a dancer, and in Italy, had eaten Sandro's mother's cooking. But, as she said, she remembered the taste, it was in her memories. And so they recreate the taste of the Korean and Italian food they know and love, here in Mexico.

When dining out alone, there are several things you can do to feel a little less conspicuous. None of these techniques actually hide that you are eating alone, but done with sufficient brio, they can at least help you forget that you're eating alone.Lots of people like to take a book to read, but I often find it hard to keep a book open on the table while holding a fork and knife at the same time. If I'm going to have to let go of my utensils, I'd rather take my journal. I fancy that maybe I look like a serious restaurant reviewer, or a travel writer, or best of all, a writer, period. Ever since I read \"A Moveable Feast,\" the only Hemingway book I truly like, the romance of sitting at a café table with a glass of wine, a notebook, and a pen has sustained me for many a solo meal. But eating lunch at El Escapulario last week, I realized the absolute best way to distract yourself from your solitude is to go to a foreign country and practice your foreign-language skills by eavesdropping on conversations next to you. I'd passed El Escapulario maybe a hundred times since I got to Oaxaca. It's on the second floor of a building on Garcia Vigil, just across from the Iglesia de Carmen Arriba, with a little cut-out of a window on the corner that makes it look almost magical. No matter that escapulario doesn't mean \"escape\" but \"scapulary,\" or a religious garment. Lina had recommended it, too, but I never seemed to find myself in that part of town during comida time. I wasn't impressed walking up the stairs, which were dingy and dark. The first thing I saw at the top of the stairs was a kitchen and a storeroom, and I didn't really want to look at either too closely. I am definitely of the \"see no evil\" school of restaurant hygiene. But then I saw the room with the window I had admired for so long. The room was painted white, with art on the walls, and the tablecloths were bright, colorful, and clean. The best table, the one right by the magical table was taken by a gringo and his Mexican friend, so I positioned myself the best I could to catch some of that window view.The waitress took my order with such a sincere smile, the menu del dia with sopa de conde, barbacoa de cordero, an agua de guayaba, and a free beer! I opened up my journal and started scribbling my thoughts on the restaurant, the day, but I soon realized there was so much more to occupy me, right there in the restaurant.The gringo at the window was truly a gringo of gringos. Even sitting down, he towered over the Mexican man eating with him, and being blond, buff, and dressed in a tank top and army green pants, he couldn't be anything but American. His Spanish was exactly like mine, exceedingly earnest with a capacity for quite a wide range of verb tenses, though far from fluid. Because he was trying so hard, he spoke a little louder than he might normally, and I could hear him perfectly from my table. He said two words for every word his lunch-mate said, probably because, like me, he had been thinking so long about all what else he could say in Spanish, he had whole conversations planned out in his head. I found out that his name is Sky, \"Like cielo,\" he said, that this was his first vacation in years, and that he had worked really hard for the past couple of years. He asked his friend if he liked the weather, if he liked the beach, that he had heard some Mexicans don't like, \"Hmmm, como se dice 'sand'?\", and so they don't like the beach. I understood every word the Mexican man said, but I can't remember a thing because he said so little. Knowing that my Spanish sounded as good and as bad as Sky's made me depressed. Thankfully, I could drown my sorrows in the excellent food at El Escapulario. The sopa de conde was a pureed black bean soup, with chunks of queso fresco simmered in it and garnished with strips of fried tortillas. It was really really really good. I've now cooked black beans 4 or 5 times in Oaxaca, and it never ceases to amaze me how much flavor there can be in a handful of black beans. The waitress brought me a little cup of spicy avocado salsa, and though I don't know if it was intended for the soup, it made it taste even better. Barbacoa normally describes goat or other meat wrapped and roasted in banana leaves until the meat is deeply tender. This barbacoa was a lamb chop, and it really did fall off its little bone, almost dissolving into the sauce of guajillo chile and avocado leaf. I suspected that the sauce had been cooked with hoja de aguacate, and I felt so proud when the waitress confirmed my suspicions. The little pile of rice accompanying the barbacoa was perfect, each kernel surprisingly plump. There was even a little postre, or dessert, a syrupy canned pear, its slices arranged in a sweet fan on the plate. I hate canned fruit, but it wasn't too sweet and I enjoyed it. By then, Sky and his friend were also done with lunch. I lingered to listen to the last scraps of conversation, sipping at my little baby bottle of beer. It wasn't that their conversation was so fascinating, really. It's just that when you're learning a language, anything you can understand becomes instantly riveting, just because you're so happy you understand. Even though I still have trouble with casual conversations, I can generally understand anything that is announced, and I'll watch, rapt, commercials for shampoo and baby formula. What a fantastic meal. I'd had a delicious three-course meal, with drinks, for 35 pesos plus tip, about $3.50, and been entertained while eating it.

One of the things I love most about my friend Mimi is that she does not believe in hiding one's light under a bushel. Hanging around her, it has started to rub off on me, and I can say, without hesitation, that I made a fantastic black bean soup the other night, and that I also made tacos of chicken and Mexican greens in a tomatillo-serrano sauce were both complex and soothingly delicious.Of course, I have to admit that neither was very hard to make. Both recipes came from Rick Bayless's \"Mexican Kitchen,\" and involved little more than patience and a good blender, though the availability of authentic ingredients like avocado leaves and Oaxacan chorizo was no small matter.The black bean soup involved so little work, it's almost embarrassing. I put Mimi to work picking out the ugly beans, while I roughly chopped a small white onion and peeled the casing off of three fat, round links of Oaxacan chorizo. I also toasted 4 avocado leaves very briefly on the burner, watching with fascination as dark spots spread almost instantly and completely across the leaf. Everything got simmered together for about two hours, until the beans were tender, and then salted to taste. I blended the soup in batches, and we ate it garnished with fried tortilla strips and crumbled queso fresco. There was no stock! And yet so much flavor came from the chorizo, the beans, and the unique anise-like scent of the avocado leaves. It was slightly spicy, in a deep, dark way, and utterly warming.The chicken in tomatillo sauce had a completely different flavor, all brightness and verve. I began by roasting tomatillos and 2 serrano chiles on a metal comal, directly on the stove, until they had big, dark, soft spots. In the meantime, I sautéed half a white chopped onion until deep golden, adding some chopped garlic to cook for a minute more, and then blended the onions and garlic with the roasted tomatillos and chiles. This puree got fried in oil for 10 minutes, getting darker and richer. When it was done cooking, I stirred in 3 tablespoons of chopped cilantro.In the meantime, I was simmering three chicken legs in plain water. I had been nervous about buying unrefrigerated chicken in the markets, and had wandered around for 2 hours looking for a rotisserie chicken, but in the end, I felt so lucky I had had a chance to cook those marigold-yellow chickens in the market. I didn't put in an onion or a carrot, peppercorns or thyme, too lazy to try to make a real broth, and I even pulled off the skin in a fit of fat-consciousness, but nothing I could do could make the chicken taste bad. To think I just boiled the darn things! And yet they were meaty with flavor. Now that I think about it, chicken in the U.S. so rarely tastes like meat, it just tastes like filler or a flavor vehicle. When I think of all those people who only eat chicken, and even then only white meat, I have to blame them for creating a market for flavorless gum.While the chicken finished poaching, I added thin strips of amaranth leaves, or quintoniles, in the tomatillo-serrano sauce, until they were only slightly bitter. I almost felt like they took on a bright tartness of their own. When I added the cooked, shredded chicken, the richness of the meat rounded out the tartness of the greens and sauce. All it needed was a little crumbled queso fresco. We also had a salad of jicama, mango, and avocado, with some red leaf lettuce to bulk it up. Mimi and I ate most of it, as Alex didn't even notice we had a salad until he was full of soup and chicken. (Thanks to them both for the glamorous close-ups; I was too frazzled to take photos.)

I'm tired of Mexican food. It became unavoidably obvious during Mimi and Alex's visit, as I tried to show off Oaxaca's culinary highlights. Until they had come, I'd been punctuating my big Mexican comidas with a simple pasta for dinner or even just a slice of wheat toast spread with peanut butter. But as we ate beautifully light tamales, the best fried pork in the world, steaming bowls of pozole, mole negro of course, an unbelievable dish of chicken stuffed with plantains in a guava-chile mole sauce, another unbelievable Biznaga creation of chicken in a chile poblano sauce, even simply cooked fish and octopus, one after the other, something in me rebelled. I knew I had reached some desperate point when my body steered me towards 100% Natural, a self-described \"healthy\" restaurant on the south side of El Llano. My friend Lisa had told me about this place months ago, and how much she loved it, but since Lisa is allergic to my top ten favorite things to eat, I didn't rush off to try the food there. But suddenly, I felt almost pregnant, like my body had cravings I couldn't control. I had to eat something that wasn't, well, special. As we walked there, I kept apologizing to Mimi and Alex in advance. I had the awesome responsibility of making sure they ate well in Oaxaca, and what was I doing? As we waited for our menus, the informational cards on the table describing 100% Natural's philosophy and advice for healthy living seemed to confirm my worst fears. \"They tell you to eat lightly for breakfast, lightly for lunch, and then lightly for dinner! When are you supposed to eat?\" I giggled as I read out loud the advice for how to get ready for bed, which included the suggestion that if you do not have the energy for intimate relations with your partner, you should say goodnight through loving words and kind caresses. Maybe you'd want more sex if you weren't so weak from fasting! But it wasn't really funny. There was a real chance the food would be seriously undersalted, especially since I didn't see any salt on the table.There were two menus, one full of fruity and veggie drinks to which you could add a shot of wheatgrass or yeast or whatever else health-food people like to drink. I didn't look at it too closely, though I was very happy with my big goblet full of agua de jamaica, which is hibiscus flower, combined with watermelon juice.The other menu listed many, many food items, and believe it or not, there were several dishes that appealed to me. I thought about getting Mexican-flavored health food, whole-grain tortillas made into enchiladadas or chilaquiles, but I couldn't deny that my heart was drawn to a dish that containing tofu, bean sprouts, broccoli, and sesame pasta. I couldn't stop thinking about the tofu, even as I wondered what kind of tofu could possibly be available in Mexico, even as I knew I was violating every rule of ordering in foreign countries. Tourists who eat sushi in Mexico deserve to eat bad sushi.The anticipation and the fear were abated a bit by the bread basket that arrived soon after we put in our orders. There was, not surprisingly, no butter, but there were three little ramekins filled with a green salsa, a tangy white cream sauce, and pickled vegetables. The bread, also, was excellent. It was moist and tender, wheaty and flavorful, with a real crust to contrast to its soft crumb.And then the food arrived. Mimi was happy with her shrimp, Alex with his turkey sandwich, and I, I was thrilled with my tofu-sesame spaghetti. It did need a little salt, and luckily, it turned out the big shaker on the table full of something that smelled nutty was actually sesame salt. The tofu, however, had been marinated generously, and the broccoli and other vegetables were cooked not too long, not too short, just right. The pasta, gracias a Dios, was almost al dente. I turned to Mimi and Alex and bestowed the best compliment I could: \"I think I would eat here again.\"

We ate at 100% Natural two nights ago, and were very pleasantly surprised.Sopa Cristalina of onions, setas and rice noodles and fresh spinach; then a grilled vegetable plate with a fresh basil vinaigrette for me; vegetarian tacos for my wife. She could only eat one, she was so full. I ate the other two for lunch yesterday and they were quite good.We also would go there again.

I take back everything I said about the bread being bad in Oaxaca.Two Saturdays ago, I'd mainly perused modern bakeries, selling traditional breads in part, but very different from the bakers in markets with their goods on trays or in deep woven baskets. My experiences with the breads in the markets had been mixed--good pan de yema in hot chocolate making class, but sort of stale and dry at other times, and then other moments that were so lacking I can't even remember what I ate.But last week, I wandered up to Mercado Sanchez Pascuas to buy some fruit and decided it was time to take the plunge. There were several bread vendors there, on the white counters near the west end of the market. I chose the man furthest north, a few meters down from the vegetable seller. I would eat the bread with the pink sugar on top. And then for good measure, I asked for another plain, dark and wheatier looking roll. 4.5 pesos, total.Well, let's just say I'm not going to be wasting any more of my hard-saved money on \"European artisanal bread\" at Pan & Co. Mexican bread is good enough for me! The crust on both was hard but not tough, and the bread inside chewy yet soft and flavorful. The roll with the pink sugar on top had a sweet glaze all over the top that made my plastic bag sticky immediately, but it was a pleasant combination with the plain texture of the roll inside and more soothing for an early morning meal than something like a cinnamon roll or a muffin, which are both sweet and heavy with butter. The roll also had a big hollow inside, the tell-tale sign that yeast had been given time to do its thing. The other roll, with its sprinkling of sesame seeds, was even better. It perhaps could have used a tad more salt, but it had no need to be embarrassed that it was otherwise unadorned. It didn't rise to the level of a great French baguette, but then, very few breads do, even in New York. This flat little roll had more flavor than most of the bread in the U.S., and probably most of the bread in New York, too. Two days later, I went back and got another flat, plain roll with sesame seeds and then something that looked like a brioche with its little topknot. This time, sadly, the roll was a tad stale, but with a strong enough flavor to stand up well to slices of avocado with salt and a bit of pepper, a simple and filling breakfast I learned from Erin. The brioche, though, blew my mind. There was whole wheat flour in it, but not enough to keep the crumb tender, and then surprising ribbons of cinnamon and dots of raisins. This vendor is clearly something special. When Mimi and I went back to get a bag of bread, hoping to soothe Alex's stomach with something relatively bland, we bought a few rolls from the woman next to him and then a big brioche roll and a little flat roll with sugary sesame seeds and crushed nuts on top. The big bag of bread from the other baker was fine, but this guy's stuff just shined.I'm so glad. I hated not liking a whole category of Mexican food.

Actually, I usually mash the avocado with the salt and pepper and some lime or lemon juice, then spread it on toasted bread, and if I'm feeling extra virtuous sprinkle some flax seeds on top. You are really indirectly responsible for the development of this as my default breakfast, however. It wasn't until that year we lived and cooked together in Bernal Heights that I really became a true Californian and embraced the avocado, largely because you were always doing something delicious with them.

I was really excited to try these. I just loved the idea of \"Oriental tacos.\" I didn't expect flying carpets or Buddha figures, but I'd read a little bit about \"tacos arabes\" in Puebla on Chowhound, and I'd imagined a beautiful collision between shwarmas and tacos to create something completely, fabulously new.So after three months of thinking about them, I couldn't help but be a bit disappointed when I finally got to La Antequera in Colonia Reforma, on Calzada Porfirio Diaz a few blocks north of Belisario Dominguez. The menu listed quesadillas, tortas, and two types of tacos, \"arabes\" and \"orientales.\" \"What's the difference?\" I asked.\"Arabes are larger, orientales are smaller.\"A truly unexciting answer. Still, I ordered one of each and a side of \"cebollas,\" imagining unctuous, rich, sautéed onions.When they arrived, they just sat there like limp rags. The \"arabe\" taco had, instead of a corn tortilla, a slightly thicker bread around it. It wasn't quite like pita, a little chewy, a little floury. The bread had good flavor, and the meat inside it was salty and flavorful also, but there was nothing else going on. It came with a side of tart red salsa, and I sprinkled it on liberally, but there was nothing else to help it gain some dimension. The onions turned out to be quite pale, not at all caramelized as I'd hoped, and watery to boot. The \"orientale\" was a smaller version, with a tortilla wrapped around. Just like the waiter said.I think the experience could have been different in a group. I can imagine a happy table of friends sitting around a plate filled with meat, another plate stacked high with hot pita-like breads, drinking beer and making tacos one after the other. But my two sad little tacos and even sadder bowl of chopped onions wasn't that.If you are meat-lover, you are more likely to fall head over heels in love with the \"carne frita\" or fried meat of pork at El Biche Pobre.

TACOS ARABES IS A ONE OF A KIND TACO LIKE NO OTHER IN THE WORLD . I UNDER STAND THAT MANY WILL SAY THAT THERE ARE BETTER BU SIMPLY THE FLAVOR OF THE MEAT ... AND #1 THE HOT SAUCE SHOULD TASTE LIKE NO OTHER . THAT AND CEMITAS WOULD BE THE FIRST ENTREES ID ORDER WHEN I ARRIVE IN PUEBLA FROM CALIFORNIA. AMERICANS ONLY THINK OF CUANTITY WHEN ITS QUALITY WHAT PUEBLA KNOWS.

Ok if you want taco arabes that are different then head to El Beduino of xalapa. it is about 2 hours from puebla going east to veracruz. they use differnt method of cooking and ingredients. Everything is made by hand right down to the \"pan Arabe\" they also have falafel like no other, they even make their own Tahini...try it is is out of this world. They are located on Callejon diamante.

All the tacos arabes I tried outside Puebla were not excellent. Maybe some were good but the majority were rubbish. You need to try them in Puebla. They are not \"complicated\" tacos, they don't have that much inside (like the plazeros or al pastor) but the deliciousness is in the meet and the sauce.

I agree most tacos arabe are really bad outside puebla....but El Beduino in Xalapa is absolutely the best I have ever had. I have been to puebla many many times and there is only one place that the tacos arabes are what they should be and more. El beduino en callejon diamante in xalapa is absolutely the best i have ever had...try the falafel also.

This is for my sister, who can happily spend a day looking in bakery windows and display cases, maybe tasting a mouthful or two, but really just happy to see rows and rows of sweet things.Mexican sweets and breads are a mystery to me. There are so many varieties, each with their own name, and I have yet to find a source that will give me all the information I crave. In the markets, a stall may specialize only in pan de yema, an eggy bread with a light anise flavor, or in a chewy, flat roll with a hard crust and pink sugar sprinkled on top. Then there are sweet sellers, with little stacks of honeyed, sticky cookies and cones filled with white cream. By the doors of Mercado Juarez and on corners around Oaxaca, there are several women selling alegrias, \"joy\" bars made of amaranth and piloncillo, the brown sugar sold in little cone-shaped cakes, and similar bars made with peanuts or pumpkin seeds, as well as round flats of pecans embedded in a crumbly brown sugar. I've seen several street vendors sitting around with cases filled with bright gelatins and little flans, clearly specializing in anything that can quiver. Then there are those women with the huge glass jars of stewed fruits in syrup. I haven't even begun to describe the more modern bakeries and their enormous range of offerings. And apparently, if I go to Puebla or San Cristobal de las Casas, I will find sweets that can't be found here in Oaxaca, trays of caramels and candies and things I cannot even dream of. The only thing I have really grasped so far are \"nieves\" and \"paletas,\" the sorbet-like ice creams and popsicles that taste proudly and intensely of fruit. To be honest, I've been reluctant to really try and taste, as I will generally pick eggs over pancakes, a slice of pizza over a cookie, a piece of levain bread over a tart. And if I do have something sweet, I want it to be small and perfect, like a piece of very dark chocolate or a scoop of ice cream from Il Laboratorio del Gelato. I hadn't gone out of my way to try more than the few desserts that had come my way, as there was so much mole to be eaten and I feared wasting time eating things that were sugary and sub-par. But considering that I've been going around saying I don't like Mexican desserts and breads, without trying more of them, I realized was being quite unfair. I've been missing my sister so much, I wanted to do what she would do, if she were in Oaxaca.So I decided to spend Saturday afternoon perusing 3 different bakeries in a 2-block radius around the zocalo. I found two more bakeries in this area on my way home, but decided to save them for another day, as my hands were full of bread. I had also started frequenting the enormous bakery, Pan Bamby, on Porfirio Diaz at the corner of Independencia, and so I'm adding that to this post, too. I only bought one pastry or bread at each bakery, so I can't really speak with authority, but at least I am starting to get a sense of what is out there.Pan Bamby is the largest bakery I've seen in Oaxaca. In the evenings, it's full of people piling their trays high with bread, buying 10 or 20 rolls, loaves, and pastries. It sells what is expected, the same stuff I see at the giant supermarkets and the smaller weekend markets, but in greater varieties and quantities. So they sell bolillos, the torpedo-shaped white crusty rolls, for a peso a piece; conchas with their swirl of crumble on top, numerous kinds of flaky pastries filled with chocolate or jam or just dusted with sugar.Their bolillo was terrible, even though it was fresh and warm and the crust crackled promisingly. It just didn't have any flavor. But then I had a sweet, soft croissant-shaped roll, with a very tender crumb and such an appealing, lovable flavor, like Hawaiian bread or Portuguese sweet bread. I also had a very good bandilla, a long, rectangular pastry of flaky layers, topped with sugar, a perfect light cena with tea. My neighbor had left me a bag of their garlicky breadsticks when she went back to Iowa, and they were strangely addictive, as well as scarily durable. Fidel Integral, which specializes in whole-wheat breads, is on the same street further south, except that at that point, Porfirio Diaz has become 20 de Noviembre. Located between Hidalgo and Trujano, just north of Mercado Juarez, Fidel isn't as large but I could get a sense of what breads must be available by seeing what Fidel chose to make in whole wheat form. Fidel also sells bolillos and conchas and bandillas. They also make a fantastic whole wheat roll, just a simple dinner roll that has great flavor, so great that it's oddly addictive for something so plain. I also tried something a hard, crumbly sweet bread, shaped like a long, oblong stick, because it looked so much like these \"butter sticks\" in Korean bakeries I used to love. It tasted just as I had imagined it would, sweet but with a real wheaty flavor, and very good with a cup of coffee in the afternoon.Walking south from Fidel, if you turn a left at the next corner, you will find yourself in front of Tartamiel. It definitely has the cutest logo, a smiling yellow bee with the tip of its tongue sticking amiably out of its mouth. It calls itself a \"pasteleria frances,\" and it did seem to be aiming for a different tone. The English language is poor in only having one word, \"bakery,\" to describe a place that sells baked goods, when Spanish and French both distinguish between places that sell breads, panaderias or boulangeries, and places that sell cakes, pastelerias or patisseries. There was no way I could buy a cake to taste, but I did buy a little \"tartaleta de queso,\" and it was really quite good. The crust wasn't so noteworthy, though it was sturdy and correct, but the cheese part I liked a lot. It was firm, like NY-style cheesecake, and it clearly wasn't relying just on sugar to make itself appealing. The last bakery, at least for this post, is Vasconia on Independencia, between 5 de Mayo and Reforma. This place is a little different, selling slices of creamy cake in a window swarming with bees, as well as empanadas with various savory fillings, bread rolls filled with chorizo and cheese, and your usual conchas and donas or donuts. I bought a little empanada filled with champinones, which weirdly is the Mexican way of describing basic button mushrooms, calling them by their French name to signify their high-class ways. \"Hongos\" describe the gorgeous wild mushrooms you can find in the Sierra Norte during the rainy season. I got excited when I took it out of its bag when I got home, because the top almost caved in as I pressed it, it was so delicately flaky, but overall, I liked it the least of everything I ate today. It felt right and looked right, but the flavor was a little off, probably because Mexican butter just isn't great, and this was probably made with margarine anyway. I think it must be easier to get away without high-quality butter if the pastry is sweet rather than savory. The mushroom filling was pretty good, though, mixed with tomato sauce.So it was a very good day! But I miss my sister more than ever.

Did you like \"La Luna\", which I think is also on Independencia? It has a huge selection, although I've tried very little of it.We got our second loaf from Pan y Co yesterday. While it's good, it's not THAT good and I question whether the price of over $30 pesos is worthwhile for a loaf of Pain de Canpagne. The taste was good but the internal structure was uninteresting.The Olive Foccacia looked spectacularly laden with olives. Can they be good olives, or just lots of olives? Roquefort and Pear Foccacia was interesting, but we didn't buy any.I'm of the opinion that bread should taste of grain and proper fermentation and baking. Leave the cheeses and vegetables to the side to be enjoyed with the bread; not in it.

I don't think I ever tried La Luna. At a certain point, I just gave up. Pan y Co was definitely for me a little expat luxury, something I wouldn't have bought as a tourist, but something I needed. It's like a friend of mine said, \"Don't eat the sushi in the zocalo. We have to, because we live here, but you can survive four months without it.\"

One of the things I love most about Mexico is how good food can just happen to you, right when you least expect it.Last Wednesday, I got in a car at 7:30 in the morning to go with two Puente staff members to a town far, far away in the mountains, one of the communities they work with. They were going to check in on how the amaranth was growing, give advice to the farmers, and then lead a cooking with amaranth workshop. It was gorgeous country, but for the first time in my life, I felt carsick with every U-shaped curve. So when we stopped in Ayutla, a larger town on the way to Tejas, they asked if I wanted some breakfast. I stumbled out of the car, thinking, \"Okay, something hot to drink might be good,\" but that there was no way I could actually eat anything.And then we sat down at a fonda that declared, with multiple exclamation points, that they had \"caldo de pancita.\" It smelled so good, suddenly my nausea went away and my appetite returned. I tried to figure out what \"pancita\" is, and in the end, I decided it must be some kind of beef belly, as it was lovely and smooth, soft and chewy at the same time. Garnished with some raw chopped onions, spicy chopped \"chiles de canario\" that were bright yellow with black seeds, and a spoonful or two of salsa, the soup made me instantly feel better. (But I don't have photos because I felt too ill getting out of the car to think of documenting anything.)On the way back, they asked again, \"Should we stop to eat or just go home as quickly as possible?\" Again, I wasn't really hungry, but then one of them said, \"Mmmm, tacos de tripa, que sabrosos,\" and the question was answered. I started with two, one of tripe and one of \"suadero,\" which isn't in my dictionary,\" and then couldn't resist and ordered two more, another suadero and one of \"maciza,\" which I think is some sort of thigh meat of beef. I don't know if it was the cool mountain air, but they were so good! This time, I had my camera, but I kept forgetting to take a picture in my eagerness to eat. I finally managed to remember to take a photo of my very last taco.It's funny, Pola the agronomist asked me if I was vegetarian, because nearly all the volunteers are vegetarian. Ha ha ha ha! Given the type of American who comes to Oaxaca, Oaxacans must think all Americans are liberal, Bush-hating vegetarians. And even I am two out of three.

Mimi and Alex have arrived in Oaxaca, and they are like putty in my hands. I understand that kind of mind-meltdown, the joy of being on a vacation where someone else makes all the decisions for you, and I am happy to be that person. So off we went to \"Marco Polo\" on Sunday afternoon for a big, big lunch.We started with a \"cocktele de jaiba,\" shredded crabmeat in a icecream sundae glass, and tostadas de cazon, or shark. Both weren't particularly memorable, but we all loved the chopped salsa of raw onions and hot fresh peppers. When we had arrived, the waiter had whisked it away, so I was glad I had asked for it back. Shark turned out to be a shredded meat, firmer than most fish, almost with the texture of Korean dried squid, but with not much else going on. Not bad, just not as exciting as you think shark is going to be. And the crab cocktail was a little too sweet, even after I squeezed lime after lime into it. But everything else was delicious. We had something called \"vitaminas al vapor,\" which turned out to be a seafood soup stuffed with all kinds of squid, octopus, fish, and shrimp, as well as bits of soft egg and a flavor to the tomato broth that we couldn't quite identify. The broth was sweetish, but in the way fresh seafood can be sweet, not annoying. It actually did taste kind of nutritive, so maybe \"vitaminas\" is a reference to that?We had red snapper \"al horno,\" and then an order of pulpo, or octopus, cooked in butter and garlic. It was simple, meaty, and wonderful.And finally, the bananas baked in the oven I had been wanting to eat for so long. This is one order, believe it or not, of one platano macho, or plantain, split in three parts, and then served with a little trio of rompope or Mexican eggnog, condensed milk called \"leche Nestle,\" and crema, which is more like crème fraiche than heavy whipped cream. The bananas had that tart flavor that I love about bananas and plantains here, that made the rich, creamy, roasted taste more striking by contrast. We ate so much even Alex wasn't really hungry for dinner.

This tostada is on my top 10 list of things I love to eat in Oaxaca, and pretty high up, too.I've raved before the Mercado Organico at El Pochote before, but I will rave again. On the far wall from the entrance, next to the lovely Korean woman selling baked goods, there is a husband-and-wife pair that sells tostadas with a wide range of topping choices. A tostada is a crunchy taco, but not those U-shaped boats we all ate growing up, made by Taco Bello or Dos Pasos or whatever they called themselves. It's flat, a little ripply usually, and not as hard-crunchy as a tortilla chip, thinner and crisper.There are an array of topping choices, sparkling with different colors. Each tostada starts with a thin base of black bean puree, and then, you have to start making some decisions. There are nopales, cactus paddles, one that is spicier than the other, but both deliciously tart and fresh. There are sauteed mushrooms, and one type has small kernels of corn, too. There's spicy chicken tinga, shredded white chicken breast, and then two kinds of requeson, a fresh ricotta-like cheese. One has green specks, herby, and the other is spicier and redder, but not actually hot. Just fragrantly spicy. You can thin avocado sauce drizzled over everything, as well as salsa. No matter what combination you get, one topping or 3, it's 15 pesos. You feel almost righteously healthy eating so many vegetables, but you're not making any sacrifices.Probably my favorite is half spicy nopales, half mushrooms with bits of corn, topped with the spicy requeson, and then drizzled with both salsa and guacamole. It's so simple and yet illustrates so perfectly what I love most about Mexican food, the way fresh, bright flavors and textures contrast and complement each other. (To think, melted cheese over everything represents Mexican food to most Americans!) The slightly tart nopales, the savory mushrooms, the spicy salsa, the creamy requeson, the crunchy tostada. It's hard not to get it all over your face, but it's worth every messy bite.I think the wife recognizes me now, she smiled so broadly at me this weekend. It's my Saturday morning ritual!(This is my 100th post. Can you believe it?)

Hey, Grace, just wanted to let you know how much I've been enjoying reading your blog! Your adventurous, independent-minded spirit comes through loud and clear.In response to:\"(To think, melted cheese over everything represents Mexican food to most Americans!)\"the partial answer is that melted cheese over everything, and simple meat and starches (including wheat tortillas), *is* authentic Norteno food. Take a drive through Baja or Sonora sometime, and you'll begin to regret that cattle were ever introduced to the Americas, with all the queso fundido and machaca that they entail. The older generation of Mexicans in the US, as I'm sure you know, came from the North. One of the best Oaxacan restaurants in LA is around the corner from my office, and yet most of my many Chicano colleagues all turn up their noses at it as \"weird.\" Since I love Oaxacan (and Yucatecan-- yum!) food, as well, let's hope that with the more recent wave of immigration from the South these expectations of what Mexican food \"should\" be will change...
Lina

Yep, I agree. The superfine corn tortillas that you find in Oaxaca are common in Southern Mexico whereas Northern Mexico has the flour tortillas. But I'm surprised that other Mexicans consider Oaxaqueno food as weird considering that even within the country, the state is recognized for its culinary distinction.
AppleSister
2007-08-28 11:36:00
15 pesos is about $1.35. Mmm!That's interesting, about norteno food being melted cheese. It reminds me of this book I read on the history of Indian food and how what the first immigrants brought to England and the U.S. affected what even immigrants from other regions cooked in restaurants. Anna, at least you have Oaxacan restaurants in LA! It was my first taste of mole negro 4 years ago at Guelaguetza that led me to come here...

I wonder if it's a Mexican-American thing. Erin also said that her Mexican-American friends all prefer flour tortillas to corn, whereas I've only had one flour tortilla in my life that I really loved. I hate how they generally get all gummy in your teeth.

Mercado Hidalgo is considered a little \"fresa,\" which literally means \"strawberry\" but is also Mexican slang meaning \"snobby.\" It's located in upper-class Colonia Reforma, on Emilio Carranza on the block north of Palmeras, and its produce does sparkle. I saw stuff that I hadn't seen in other markets in Oaxaca, like huitlacoche and fresh figs. I almost flipped when I saw the figs, as it doesn't quite feel like summer unless I eat some fresh figs. They also had beautiful bunches of quelites, a type of Mexican green, leafy vegetable, which inspired me to actually try one of the recipes from my new Mexican cookbook, \"Alquimias y Atmosferas de Sabor,\" by Carmen Ramirez Degollado, the chef and owner of the beloved \"El Bajio\" in Mexico City. I've been trying to read more Spanish, since I remember more from reading than hearing, but the only thing that really holds my interest enough to get through more than a few pages are cookbooks and food magazines. Unfortunately, reading them doesn't challenge me as much as reading literature or news articles would because I know enough about how recipes are constructed to figure out most of what I read through context. For example, as I read a recipe calling for \"chayotes tiernos,\" I guessed that \"tierno\" meant fresh or tender, didn't bother looking it up in the dictionary, and then was shocked when my Spanish teacher described her ex-boyfriend as acting very gentlemanly and very \"tierno\" on their first date. It turns a man can be as tender as a vegetable.Rick Bayless translates \"quelites\" as \"lamb's quarters,\" and recommends substituting it in his recipes with chard or collard greens in the U.S., some green with strong flavors. But I'm not sure that he's describing the same thing I bought, as my \"quelites\" were more like spinach, just better. They had a similar sweet flavor, and reminded me a lot of Korean spinach with its leggy stems, but without the furry aftertaste of a lot of American spinach. Also, I know that the word \"quelites\" is used to describe a whole category of Mexican greens, including even amaranth leaves which are also called \"quintonil,\" and amaranth leaves are distinctly stronger and more bitter, more like chard.But I digress. The recipe was very simple, a rice with greens dish, calling for the rice to be fried with pureed raw onion and garlic. Then broth was to be added with the bunch of raw quelites, two parts broth to one part rice. Like most Mexican recipes, it assumed a lot of knowledge on the part of the reader, and I wondered, \"Stalks and all? Should I pulverize the leaves and make it a green rice? Should I throw the leaves in whole?\" Finally, I decided to just destem them, chop them roughly and throw them in with the broth leftover from cooking my pork shoulder.Well, I put in way too much broth, forgetting the leaves would emit a fair amount of water themselves, and I ended up with a rice with greens porridge. I mistakenly thought I could avoid burning the rice this time by adding more broth earlier on. I also think there's a reason chicken broth is normally used to cook rice, not pork broth, because although the flavor was richer than it would have been with water, it wasn't rich in quite the right way. But the quelites didn't turn turd green, I got to try cooking with them, and I still enjoyed my rice mush very much. Thank God I had my shameless solitude.

So my maniacal devotion to Rick Bayless continues, and I am going through his Oaxaca list of recommended restaurants like a pilgrim on the trail to a sainted relic. Monday was my day to eat fish, to give my body just a bit of a rest from the picadillo I ate on Sunday and the big pot of quinoa, chorizo, potato, and carrot I made on Saturday. So off I went to Marco Polo.The restaurant has several locations, but it's generally accepted that the best one is on Pino Suarez, the east side of El Llano or Parque Juarez, as it's known on all the maps and to no one else. Given how far inland Oaxaca is, seafood is very popular, and the restaurant was crowded at four in the afternoon.My first regret, as I looked at the menu, was that I was alone. So much I wanted to try, and yet how much could one woman eat? Shark (cazon) quesadillas, shark tostadas, shark all kinds of things, not to mention a whole section for cebiches and pulpos. I took a deep breath, told myself I could come back, and calmly ordered one dish: a filete de pescado al horno, or a filet of red snapper baked in their outdoor, wood-burning oven.Honestly, when it finally arrived and I had already eaten half the bread basket, it didn't look like much. But then I took my first bite and smiled. The fish had real flavor, its own flavor and more. I could taste the fire in which it had been cooked, the slight bite with the ground chiles sprinkled on it, and when I smeared a bit of chipotle mayonnaise on it, the fish just took off into outer space. It wasn't at all undercooked, and of course, it wasn't overcooked, just the perfect texture to give you something to chew, even as it melted away.The little mound of rice it came with was very good, too, and I was sorry there was so little of it. Instead of tortillas, there was a dry bolillo, or torpedo-shaped hard roll, that did nothing to change my mind about Mexican bread, and then some flat tostadas, crispy and perfect for dipping into the darkly spicy salsa.Sadly, because I had scraped every last bit of fish off its foil, I was too full to try the platanos baked in their oven, drizzled with a little crema. I am going to strong-arm my friends Mimi and Alex, who arrive this Saturday, into going with me again.

The Mercado Sanchez Pascuas, just a little north of Quetzalcoatl with its bright green entrances on both Porfirio Diaz and Tinoco y Palacios, is probably my favorite everyday market in Oaxaca. It's not as overwhelming as the Mercado Abastos, or as colorful as Mercado Juarez, and it doesn't have the steamy meat market-slash-taco stands of Mercado 20 de noviembre, but it feels like a neighborhood market, and increasingly, like my neighborhood market. It's smaller than the ones closer to the zocalo described in the all the guidebooks, and on a weekday afternoon, you might even think it was half-empty. But every Saturday and Sunday morning, it's bustling with people buying fresh blandas, flowers, tamales, all kinds of produce, various jugos, and even some barro verde, the pottery with the dark green glaze. Unlike the surly people at Mercado Juarez, the people at Mercado Sanchez don't mind if you handle and pick your fruit yourself. Because it's smaller, you can also see more clearly where people are clustering to buy their chicken or pork and gauge which carnicerias have the freshest meat. It's also easier to notice who has criollo tomatoes, those heirloom tomatoes that have so much more flavor, or even criollo avocados with their enormous pits and a high, clean taste, if somewhat less rich and creamy in flavor. (You can find some fantastic photos from Planeta.com.)This past Sunday, after a fortifying breakfast of chocolatle atole and empanadas, I enlisted my Spanish teacher and friend Lety to help in sussing out the best places to get the ingredients for the picadillo pork tacos I planned to make that afternoon. She pointed in one direction to indicate her favorite carniceria, but from across the market, I misjudged where she was pointing and had already started talking to a woman in a very smelly stand when she came over and whispered, \"I meant that one.\" I murmured my apologies, pretending I wasn't quite sure what I wanted, and we quietly scurried all the way to the other end of the meat section. I didn't know if I could literally translate English phrases for pork cuts into Spanish, if pork shoulder is \"espalda\" or \"pierna\" or something completely different, so to our new butcher, I just asked for the cut of meat that had a lot of \"grasa\" or fat. \"Ah, espaldita!\" he said. He proudly showed off the layer of fat glistening on the piece of pork, and Lety nodded with approval. Later, when I asked her if I should trim some of the fat off before we cooked it, she said, \"But that will remove the flavor!\" God, I love Mexico.After seeing the \"picadillo\" recipe in Rick Bayless's cookbook last weekend, I had spent all week just thinking about it, when and where I should buy the meat, whether I should cook it on Saturday or Sunday. I had read the recipe over and over, charmed by the thought of taking shredded, cooked pork shoulder, and then browning it, scraping it up as it stuck to the pot, with chopped onion, a handful of raisins, a handful of chopped almonds, a little cinnamon, an even smaller pinch of freshly ground cloves, and a roasted tomato-pasilla oaxaquena sauce. But I'd never even tried it, so I was thankful to have Lety there to say, \"Oh, it looks a little dry,\" or \"Add a little sugar.\" The picadillo was as easy as promised, even though it took about 2 and half hours to make, to simmer the pork shoulder with all its fat, to grind the cloves in a little molcajete, to chop and toast the almonds, to make the sweet smoky salsa, and then to cook it all together. But it was very laid-back cooking, though there was a moment when I realized trying to understand Spanish and chop almonds at the same time is the kind of multi-tasking that is yet beyond me. But otherwise, we chatted easily as she told me about the terrible people at her workplace and I told her about the horrible blind date I went on before I left New York. Lety even showed me how to make horchata:1) Carefully clean and wash about 1 cup of rice. Let it soak in water about 2 inches above the rice with some broken canela, the equivalent probably of 2 American cinnamon sticks. Let it sit for about 2 hours, until the rice gets soft enough that you can pinch a kernel in half.2) Blend everything in the blender as smooth as possible. 3) Strain into a pitcher, reserving any rice-cinnamon paste for \"atole de arroz.\" (I only had a strainer, but I imagine a cheesecloth would be better.)4) Add water and sugar to taste. Make sure to stir it up immediately before pouring it into a glass, as some sediment will sink to the bottom.Incredibly clean and pure. I can totally see myself doing this in Brooklyn on a hot summer day. Other recipes I've seen say that you should add ground almonds, and I imagine that would be wonderful, too, as well as some pureed bright red, tiny cactus fruits with their prickly armor of skin.I chopped up some jicama, radishes, avocado, and pickled jalapeno for garnish and heated up some of this week's pot of black beans while Lety warmed and wrapped the tortillas in a towel. With the bright pink pitcher of horchata and a little leftover mezcal, we had a very colorful feast.And the picadillo I liked as much as last Sunday's supper of greens, onions, and cheese tacos. It wasn't at all spicy--which Lety assured me was normal--but it had such a range of flavors, from smoky to rich to slightly sweet and nutty. It was complex and yet easily appealing, almost as warming as Lety's company. Definitely one to add to the taco buffet dinner I intend to host when I get back to New York.

Don't let people tell you that \"estofada\" is one of the seven moles of Oaxaca. It isn't, as delicious as it is, not according to people I trust. According to Susana Trilling, moles always involve cooking the meat separately from the sauce, while an estofada translates literally as a stew, the meat cooked in it. Soledad Ramirez agrees that estofada is not a mole. I thought by getting a mole sampler at Los Pacos, I would finally try all seven, but they only had six and it included estofada.Counterclockwise from the bottom darkest one, we were told they were negro, amarillo, verde, chichilo, estofada and rojo. The people at Los Pacos were nice, and even gave Erin a bib to eat with, but I can't wholeheartedly recommend the restaurant because the high prices weren't justified by the food, which could be had in equal quality elsewhere. Also, I'm now thoroughly confused because I can't figure out the difference between rojo and coloradito. Los Pacos's rojo tasted just like coloradito to me. Googling recipes online doesn't help, as there's no consensus, but again, according to Susana Trilling, only coloradito and negro include chocolate. So what the hell are the people selling at Chocolate Mayordomo as prepared rojo mole paste? It may be that I haven't had both, just one, I just don't know which one.At least I know I had chichilo for sure, as I ordered it expressly at Casa del Tio Guero, or \"Uncle Whitey's House.\" It was the day my camera died for the first time, so there's no photographic record. In addition to burning chiles, a tortilla is burnt, making chichilo even smokier than mole negro. It's generally served with green beans and vegetables, as well as meat. It had a fruitier, tarter flavor, while being bitter at the same time, and frankly, I didn't like it, but Susana Trilling says it's very good, and I imagine it's the kind of thing where I need to try a better version.Sadly, manchamantel, or tablecloth stainer, remains elusive.

Delicious pork fat at El Biche Pobre

As I ate lunch on Wednesday, I thanked God that I had run 2.5 miles uphill towards Monte Alban earlier that day. My judgment may have been clouded by drink, as I started drinking my Bohemia beer and eating tortilla chips like a madwoman before my food came, but I have never tasted such delicious pork fat in my life as I did at El Biche Pobre.I had spent nearly all morning in the kitchen at Puente, trying to make amaranth-corn tortillas from scratch. I had boiled dried corn kernels with limestone the day before and let it sit overnight, and then rinsed carefully and rubbed away at each husk, almost individually, as per these instructions (which turned out to be wrong since the corn kernels need to be cooked 15 minutes or more). Rather than take a handful of corn and amaranth to the molino, I'd lugged my molcajete to work on the bus and decided to grind away by hand. One of the staff laughed and said I was \"una mujer de campesinos,\" or a peasant woman. The temperature in the office is cool, even in the kitchen, but I started to get so hot as I mashed away at that corn, and when I tried to grind the amaranth, I had to deal with the sticky paste that stuck to the mortar, the pestle, me, and everything else it came in contact with.For all that work, since I hadn't made very much masa or dough, I got 6 measly little tortillas. (They had good flavor, but they were too inflexible to be tortillas, memelitas maybe.) I ate one of them, and other than a banana, nothing else from breakfast to 3 p.m., when I left work. I felt like a crazed, hungry animal.I'd never heard of \"El Biche Pobre\" until that day, but I caught a mention of it in a TripAdvisor thread and when I Googled it, it turned out to be one of Rick Bayless's favorites. As I am becoming increasingly maniacal in my devotion to him, that was enough to get me lurching towards Calzada de la Republica 600, at the corner of Hidalgo, just two blocks east of El Llano park.\"El Biche Pobre\" calls itself a \"comedor familiar,\" which I assume means \"down-home food.\" They're particularly famous for their botanas, or bar snacks, and instead of getting a proper meal of soup, rice, meat, and tortillas, I opted for the botana plate for one, one of all of the above. Of course, since I was eating bar snacks, I had to have a beer.Immediately, I knew I was somewhere special. The chips that came in the plastic basket were perfect, crispy, completely dry and without grease, with so much flavor they didn't need salt, maybe just a dab or two one or the other of their salsas, green and red, and their guacamole. I was also given a little bowl of pickled dried peppers, onions, and garlic. I sucked the garlic out of their little papery jackets, licking my fingers and not caring what I looked like. That was probably the beer. I'd had pickled garlic before, but not like this, where they had been softened by cooking and then marinated in a vinegary sauce, like an escabeche. The dried peppers were also fantastic, smoky and intense but not so hot that I couldn't taste anything else.When my plate came, I honestly felt the slightest bit of disappointment. I'd read that their botana plate for one was huge, and this, while ample, wasn't actually incredible. And then they brought out the second plate.On the first plate, clockwise from the top: a fried taquito with guacamole; a piece of cold pork with avocado, tomato and pickled jalapeno; a quesadilla with cheese and epazote; a chile relleno; some pieces of pork milanesa; a bocadillo de papas or potato croquette; and the piece-de-resistance in the middle, \"carne frita\" or fried meat.On the second plate, clockwise from the tamal: a tamal of frijoles sitting on top of another piece of cold meat; a memela with lard and crumbled cheese; a tostada with potatoes; and another tostada with beans, cheese, tomato and avocado.I will only touch upon what truly moved me.When I put a small piece of the \"carne frita\" in my mouth, I almost shouted, \"What is this?\" When I asked the waiter, all he could say was \"meat of the pork,\" \"meat of the pork,\" so I still don't really know what made it so delicious. I am not normally a huge pork fat eater. I love fat for the way it conveys flavors, not so much in and of itself, but this made me realize that just plain old fat could be wonderful. It wasn't like carnitas that melt in your mouth, or the porchetta-like roast I made last winter that practically collapsed in its own fat. It held itself together, with a good chewy texture, a lovely crispy exterior, and a melting layer of fat in the middle. Such a tiny piece to pack such a punch.The chile relleno was my second favorite. Instead of using a fresh chile, they had taken a dried pasilla chile and filled it with more pork, shredded this time. It had a slightly sweet flavor, but almost the flavor of sweet hot peppers rather than a more straightforward, insipid sweetness. The memela was very simple, just a crunchy, almost tough, corny little oblong, brushed with nothing more than \"asiento\" or lard and garnished with a little crumbled cheese. Its simplicity was its charm, like eating a perfect baguette with butter from French cows.I loved the pork milanesa, more than any other I've had here, because the breading was greaseless and well-salted. Is \"milanesa\" really mean that it's from Milan? And is \"milanesa\" preparation related at all to Japanese fried pork cutlet, donkatsu? Sometimes, I'm embarrassed to say all my lefty politics goes out the window when I think about the food benefits of globalization.Everything else was very good, except the bocadillo de papa which was just boring.I staggered out of the restaurant almost dazed. I had to get home as quickly as possible so I could lie down, but having woken up at 6:30 in the morning to go running with my neighbor and her friend, my legs hurt. But I still stopped for a cantaloupe paleta at Popeyes.

Playing with amaranth

***CONTENT
You, dear friends and family, know that the word \"macrobiotic\" makes me itch. It is only slightly higher than the bottom-rung words \"raw food\" and slightly below \"vegan\" in my hierarchy of words that describe things I want to eat. I love quinoa, I love those Heritage Flakes made by Nature's Path made of \"ancient grains,\" even as I'm tittering at my cereal box, but amaranth is, in the U.S., the province of people who need gluten-free foods, and although I would never sneer at other's misfortune, I've never felt a need to share in their misfortune. So I'd never tasted amaranth beyond what was put into the aforementioned Heritage Flakes until last Monday. And now I'm eating amaranth until it comes out of my ears.¿Por que? It's my volunteer job to cook it, play with it, and of course, taste it. It's the best volunteer, nonpaid job I've ever had, even more evidence that the gods are smiling on me. Amaranth, or amaranto en espanol, is one of those forgotten plants that seem to promise everything. It has incredibly high amounts of protein, calcium, and other essential nutrients, much more than corn, and these nutrients manifest themselves in a form more easily digestible and absorbable than in other foods. When combined with corn or other grains, it even forms a complete protein. It's native to Mexico and Latin America, but amaranth was significant in religious rituals for indigenous peoples here, and so was stamped out by the Spanish. Puente's work in community health in rural Oaxaca therefore has a simple, straightforward message: eat more amaranth. They're working with farmers to grow it, especially since it commands four times the price of corn, and they work with women in the communities to develop new recipes incorporating amaranth into their diet. Malnutrition in Oaxaca is more the result of a lack of variety in the diet rather than a straightforward lack of food; in fact, obesity and diabetes are leading causes of death here. Although the organization has already developed a fair number of recipes using amaranth flour, amaranth leaves, and puffed amaranth, which is usually sold in Oaxaca in honey-amaranth bars called \"alegrias,\" meaning \"joys,\" but they haven't done much experimenting yet with the seed or grain itself. So everyday, I think about what typical foods in the pueblos could incorporate some amaranth grain without being too strange, without requiring foreign or expensive ingredients. That means most American hippie-gluten-averse-health-nut recipes are out, and even a fair number of ingredients that I think of as Mexican but aren't really available to poor rural Oaxacans, like cheese or tomatillos or chicken. In any case, since this is my first time actually trying to create recipes, it's a relief not to have the whole world at my disposal. They don't expect me to perfect recipes, just to see what works and perhaps more important, what absolutely doesn't work, before they encourage the women in their communities to experiment themselves. So I started by just cooking amaranth straight, trying to understand what basic properties it had, what basic flavor it had, and thinking about how it would complement the flavors in existing rural Mexican food. The moment I tasted my first mouthful, I learned something very elemental: wash it first. It was so embarrassing to eat gritty, gummy amaranth, even standing alone in the kitchen. I did eventually find a better way to cook it: either to boil it, covered, in twice as much water as amaranth for 15 minutes, or to boil it uncovered in a lot of broth, like rice or pasta soup, for 25 minutes. This way, the grains stayed distinct, even if they still stuck together, and they retained a pleasantly nutty flavor. At this point, though, I don't know how well the flavor and texture are going to go across with the communities. As the program director put it, while tasting the chicken soup with amaranth, you'd have to be okay with having millions of tiny little grains in your mouth. (My friend Sharon, who has a fear of small, round things, would absolutely die.)One of the best things about this job is that I'm forced to get over my fear of cooking really basic Mexican food. I thought amaranth, even when gummy, would taste pretty good mixed up with nopales, or cactus, and diced tomato, lime juice, and cilantro, like the salad I'd been served when I visited a community with the executive director a month ago. So I went out and bought cactus paddles, already de-spined and cleaned, at the Gigante grocery store in the neighborhood. Most Mexican recipes for nopales don't even bother telling you how to cook it, they just say, \"Cook the nopales and then...\" So I had to Google some English-language recipes. Although Rick Bayless says they're best when grilled, I thought I should cook it in the way they would most likely be cooked in the pueblos and boiled them with some water and salt for 15 minutes, until tender. I rinsed them carefully to minimize their slimy tendency and was surprised to find they had a tart, bright flavor of their own, separate from the lime juice and cilantro I was ready to add. Nopales are usually sort of slimy anyway, and the gumminess of the amaranth wasn't too weird in combination. This was successful enough that a couple of Puente staff had it for lunch with salsa and tostadas. But most exciting of all, I'm being forced to make tortillas from scratch! Tortillas, tamales, and atole all come from the same base, dried corn kernels that are boiled with limestone to remove the tough outer husks and then ground very finely and combined with water to make a dough for tortillas or tamales, or added to boiling water and sometimes chocolate to make a filling hot drink, like champurrado. Puente would love to know if a handful can just be thrown into the pot to make masa. My first attempt was okay, tasty the way a whole-wheat, crunchy piece of bread can be tasty, just not tortilla-like at all. I had another pot sitting overnight, so we'll see what happens today with a different ratio of corn to amaranth.

Beginning my explorations in Colonia Reforma: Ecatepec

The walk from home to Puente takes over 30 minutes each way, and not all of it is pretty, but I'd rather walk than take the bus because it's the only exercise I get, and because I can take mental notes on places to eat. The office is located in Colonia Reforma, an upper-class, semi-suburban neighborhood, a litte north and east of the historic center. This means that in addition to your usual tortas, tacos, and other street food antojitos, of which there are still plenty, there is also a spiffier Gigante grocery store and the original branch of Pan & Co., a bakery that makes the only bread I've really enjoyed, as its schtick is European-style artisanal bread. Seriously, their ciabatta is amazing, and even better with a bit of passion fruit-coffee jam from the organic market. Colonia Reforma is not a tourist neighborhood, so I have no guidebook to review, just my eyes and my nose. It's intoxicating.I left work yesterday with a mission to get to the tacos arabe place on Calzada Porfirio Diaz, strongly recommended to me by a sister of a friend, as I thought pita bread would be a nice change from tortillas, but on my way, I saw that Ecatepec, a restaurant I had assumed was too expensive for me, had a 40-peso \"comida corrida\" or set meal for lunch. Located on the corner of Belisario Dominguez and Colegio Militar, it has a proud, whitewashed look, very spick-and-span and middle-class. It also declares that it is both a restaurant and a \"galeria,\" and true enough, there were some folksy mixed-media paintings on the wall of indigenous subjects.I chose the sopa de lentejas, or lentil soup, and the rice as my \"sopa seca.\" Mexican menus generally won't describe what's actually in a soup or on a plate, unlike the American trend of telling you not only about the provenance of the vegetables, herbs, and meat that went into the dish, but also how the salt was harvested and the how freshly the pepper was ground. So when I got it, I was pleasantly surprised to find it had been cooked in a fish broth, with small chunks of a grayish-white fish. It had the particular briny flavor of all fish broths without being fishy, which I'd never tasted with lentils before, and I liked it a lot. Mexican rice is generally considered a \"dry soup\" because the rice is basically boiled in broth until the liquid evaporates, rather than steamed. It's very smart as the stoves won't turn down low to simmer. Also good, and simple with bits of carrot and corn kernels. I love American corn, but sometimes, I like Mexican corn even more, the way it doesn't assault you with its sugary sweetness. For my \"guisado,\" which literally means stew but also \"main dish,\" I had a hard time choosing between the chicken in cacahuate sauce, or peanut sauce, and the \"coliflor relleno de queso,\" because I was so curious about what cauliflower stuffed with cheese would look like. Well, it turned out to look just like a knish, except it didn't sit like a brick in my stomach. It was actually really good, the simple smoothness of the steamed cauliflower with the sharp saltiness of the queso fresco, with the whole thing was just coated in a light, fried batter. I was also pleasantly surprised to find the coliflor came with sliced avocado, sliced tomato, and a delicious salad of nopales, or cactus, in a chunky, tomato salsa. I didn't know until I cooked nopales myself for the first time last week, but nopales when just cooked have a tart, tangy flavor of their own, separate from any salsa or lime juice you might add. The salsa was a good way to mask how slimy nopales can get. I like nopales, even when they are oozing their okra-like slime, but it's a little disconcerting when you can see the thread of slime stretching between your fork and the plate.But best of all, ironically enough after my quest for tacos in pita bread, were the tortillas. They were large, about the size of a dinner plate, and revealed multiple, thin layers when you tore one in half, almost like Malaysian roti. Like perfectly cooked East Asian white rice, their blandness was their banner of pride, because then you could taste how perfectly cooked and almost nutty it was.Dessert was extra, and I was stuffed, so I walked on towards the Oaxaca Lending Library to return my books, but by the time I got there, I'd digested enough to want a pecan popsicle at Paleteria Popeye. Seriously, why don't we have popsicles with real flavors in the U.S.? This popsicle had even the slight bitterness of real nuts. I've had probably 10 popsicles in the past 2 months, compared to maybe one in the previous 10 years, and will probably have 10 more before I leave. God, I'm so lucky.

Tlamanalli in Teotitlan del Valle

***CONTENT
So I went to Teotitlan del Valle to look visit some rug workshops and eat at the famed Zapotecan restaurant, Tlamanalli, but ended up instead just eating at Tlamanalli with three guys who went to business school in London together, and who are now taking a roadtrip through Mexico, a la \"Y tu mama tambien,\" but without the drugs and the hot older woman. Life is so funny when you're traveling alone.This whole past week was a bit of an adjustment. I've started volunteering at Puente a la Salud Comunitaria, an organization that promotes amaranth as a way of fighting malnutrition in rural Oaxaca. Although it's been good to have some structure in my life, I'm now at the phase of my adventures where every friend from ICO is gone, Erin and Elena are gone, and I now have to face what it really means to travel alone. The upside is that life is really cheap when you have no friends. The downside is that you have no friends. Luckily, the one thing I am good at doing alone is eating. I feel so awkward at a bar by myself, and a club would be my worst nightmare, but give me some utensils and something to eat, and my hunger will squash any feelings of embarrassment. I had asked my neighbor if she wanted to go to Tlamanalli with me today, but she already had plans to visit a mezcal factory. I thought about waiting to make the trip until Mimi and Alex get here, but then I thought, what if it's so good, I want to go again?Teotitlan del Valle is one of the small towns surrounding Oaxaca, and its cottage industry is its handwoven rugs. They're quite expensive, as Oaxacan handicrafts go, but at the prices they charge, they still only get paid $1/hour for their labor. Some of them are garish, more than a few inexplicably incorporate Matisse's blue woman collage cut-out, but most are beautiful, with expensive colors that come from natural sources, like the cochineal bug, which produces a deep, rich red. I've been tempted to buy a rug or two, but I recently decided that if I buy a rug at all this year, it will be in Morocco.So what really drew me to Teotitlan del Valle was Tlamanalli, a restaurant that makes a mole negro that Rick Bayless describes as \"what dreams are made of.\" It's a foodie pilgrimage site, raved about in the NY Times, Saveur, Chowhound, with even a Culinary Institute of America podcast of Abigail Mendoza, the owner and chef demonstrating how to make mole negro. The fact that you have to get out of Oaxaca only makes it more magical to the kind of people who like to drive around the French countryside eating at restaurants with Michelin stars.But when I got there around 2, prime comida-time, the restaurant was empty, save for a table of three guys in their 30s. They were speaking excellent English, but with a peculiar range of accents, from slightly European to slightly British to slightly American. When they realized I was there alone, they pulled up a chair and invited me to join them. They turned out to be Luis and Alberto, two Mexicans from the Yucatan who had studied with Jeff, the American, in London last year, and who were now on vacation together. Jeff, despite his absurdly American name, had the most un-American accent of them all, and it turned out he had grown up all over the world, including high school in Madrid, and was now living in Finland working for Nokia. He looked like a Scandinavian Boy Scout, too, a clean-cut blond with pale-blue eyes, while Luis looked like a kindly investment banker losing a bit of hair at the top of his head but not his sense of humor. Alberto, the dark, good-looking one, looked like the kind of guy that goes to business school but doesn't think he belongs there, with a piece of jade on a red cord around his neck and talk of his surfing gear that he was taking to Puerto Escondido. They had the easy camaraderie of old friends--Jeff and Luis even had a story about having once bribed their way out of a Russian jail--and a \"kitty\" out of which they paid all their expenses. They had one whole day in Oaxaca before heading out to the coast, and they had driven out to Teotitlan del Valle to eat at Tlamanalli because they heard it was really good. They thought it was funny, but not strange, that I had come out there by myself to eat, that I had come out to Oaxaca by myself to eat, though Alberto did remark that I was too skinny to be such a big eater. It was the kind of encounter that only happens when you're traveling: easy, of-the-moment, with no expectations. There was only the mildest undercurrent of flirtation, and more out of politeness than design, like the way gay men will sometimes flirt with straight women. (I think they were straight.) They were good conversationalists, and they knew about the kinds of things I was interested in, like San Sebastian, Spain, and pig-farming and the onset of industrialized poultry production in Mexico. Usually the words \"business school\" trigger all kinds of prejudice in me, but they were the kind of people I might meet in New York, unlike the hippie retirees I keep meeting, and I felt almost a homesick attraction to them. Of course, in New York, I would never end up eating with three strange guys in a random town in upstate New York and then get in their car when they offered me a ride back to the city. Only in Oaxaca.So how was the food, you ask? Wonderful. It's a homey place, with not-so-homey prices, but everything is done with great pride and care, as in the highest of high-end restaurants. I started with a complimentary shot of mezcal that was fiery but clean. It was good the restaurant was dark, as I was wearing a sundress and I could feel my Asian flush creeping up my neck and face. I skipped the soup to save room for dessert, and went straight to the chicken in mole negro, which was thinner than any mole I've had before, just barely coating the chicken. Just slightly sweet, very black, but not bitter, which now that I know how to make it, just amazes me that you can burn the hell out of the seeds and then balance it so that you only retain the smoky complexity and not the bitterness. Again, it was a piece of breast with actual flavor. In the U.S., my only hope in cooking white breast meat is to keep it tender and moist, as it's the only way to make it palatable. Here, it can even be on the verge of dryness and yet still be flavorful, something you actually want to eat. Sadly, they didn't have the flan of elote, so I settled on a café de olla and a nieve of zapote negro, a fruit that Luis said looked like a green apple but with a black interior. Luis said he grew up hating it, that it gets made into a pudding in the Yucatan, but Alberto insisted that the ice cream tasted different than the zapote negro they'd eaten growing up. Jeff and I, with no childhood associations to burden us, decided it tasted like rich, sticky fig, made it into an icy sorbet. It wasn't cheap, among the more expensive meals I've had in Oaxaca, but definitely one of the most amusing. I know that I would get tired if life were only a string of encounters like this lunch, with nothing more permanent to give me ballast (sorry, what a horror of a mixed metaphor), but it's nice to be reminded that surprises like this only happen when you're eating alone.

My sister wanted to know where I was living, and I don't have much to report food-wise, as all I've been eating is amaranth (more on that to come).I've moved to a smaller apartment, further into the building on Calle M. Bravo and away from the street, and it's changed my life. My friends who were living in other apartments in the same building didn't understand at first why I complained about the noise. \"Our place is noisy too,\" they would say, until they spent an hour or so in mine. The landlady refused to lower the rent, even though my new place is half the size of my old place, but I didn't care. I thought briefly about getting worked up, about being righteously angry or strategically firm, but even just thinking about it took more energy than I wanted to expend. In any case, I do like the new apartment so much more. It's not just the noise, it's the space. There must be good feng-shui. It's always been a beautiful building. Like many old-fashioned buildings in Oaxaca, the apartments are built around a central courtyard. The outside is a feeble sort of peach color, but the inside is a deep brick-red with very clean, fresh white columns and ceilings. Inside the courtyard, you can find a slim yet tall lime tree, an empty fountain, a dark pink bougainvillea just directly across from the front gate, and a riot of potted plants. I find my landlady so frustrating, it's hard to reconcile her with all the plants gracing her courtyard, but nearly every courtyard I've seen is overflowing with plants so perhaps a love of greenery is a general Oaxacan characteristic, and not a sign of individual character.Onti, the man who owns the sporting goods store facing the street, lives with his family in one group of rooms on the eastern side of the courtyard. There a bit of a tin roof over his portion, which makes me so happy every time it rains, and it rains everyday. The rest is divided into 6 apartments, three in front and three even further back, quieter but not directly on the courtyard. Since Calle M. Bravo slopes steeply westward, the three in front on the western side of the courtyard are on a raised platform. These apartments were obviously designed to be short-term tourist apartments, as none are big enough for families and all are decorated to accord with Western ideas about home décor, but they're lovely, if spare, with Mexican tiles in the bathrooms and kitchens and solid, dark wood furniture. My apartment is just two rooms, a kitchen with a mini-fridge, a little table, and a small couch. You walk up three little steps to the bedroom, which has a built-in desk and a closet and then just enough room for a full-size bed with a little space to walk around it. It's very small, just big enough for me, but it makes me feel more secure than the other one. If I were a dog, I'd be the kind that likes to hide under the bed. All the souvenirs I've bought as gifts and for myself fill the apartment and make it homey, while they just rattled around in the cavernous rooms of the other apartment. I like having a little table instead of a counter and barstools. I don't mind having less counter space, I don't even get mad when I see ants walking on the little counter space I have. I just kill them calmly and drink my tea. The woman living here before was complaining how she had requested 3 separate rooms, but she's clearly from California. If it were in Manhattan, it would be advertised as a one-bedroom (with closets!) and the rent would be $1600.And now that I'm not so pissy and edgy from the street noise, I can actually appreciate how charming the courtyard is. Every morning, I go outside with my breakfast and drink my coffee sitting in the big green chair by my door. The mornings are so beautiful here, with enough sun to warm you without a jacket, but with just enough breeze to make you almost, just almost wish you had one.

Fighting malaise at El Tule

Last Sunday, eating an empanada de mole amarillo in El Tule, I realized that as long as I have an appetite, I will always be able to cheer myself up. There are those times when even I lose my appetite, like when No-No dumped me and I stopped eating for a week. But general malaise, pshaw!, I can easily get rid of just by going someplace I've never been in search for something good to eat.Sunday morning, my last friends from ICO, who were also my neighbors, left Oaxaca. It had been a difficult, emotional time for them, and even watching them leave as a bystander was so exhausting, I considered forgetting my plans to go to El Tule and just getting in bed with \"Black Lamb and Gray Falcon,\" the book that will not end. I felt a little sad about being alone in Oaxaca and a little sorry for myself. But after I'd mopped the tiny footprint of my apartment, I was hungry, and I thought I should seize the opportunity to go try one of the famous empanadas de mole amarillo of El Tule, only available on Sundays.El Tule is otherwise famous for its giant cypress tree, over 2000 or 4000 years old depending on who you talk to. I don't know how tourism from the tree can be so lucrative when the entrance fee is 3 pesos, but the town seemed to be profiting well from the tree, as the buildings in the center were fresh and brightly painted, almost like Disneyworld, right down to the white-maroon-and-blue church.I walked right by the entrance booth and around the church, looking for the empanada place recommended to me by my homestay mother, Patty, as \"muy limpia.\" I don't know if it was the right place, but it was clean and airy, and I could imagine my middle-class homestay family eating there. It was little more than a straw-roofed shack with plastic tables and chairs, with an arcade attached to it playing loud American rock music, but it a pleasant place to sit on a sunny Sunday afternoon. There was a surly girl working the comal and an older woman swatting flies away from the chicharrones and a sweet-faced man watching a soccer game on TV. I sat down with a bottle of grapefruit soda, in a really good-looking bottle, and waited.It was my fourth taste of mole amarillo, and if not the best, it was very very good. Instead of cilantro, it had the herby scent of hoja santa, the heart-shaped leaf. The mole sauce was thicker than at Iglesia de Carmen Arriba, but spicy, the kind of spiciness that doesn't hit you right away but grows in the back of your throat. The tortilla vehicle was perfect, hot and toasty. I was so happy, I ate another empanada, of flor de calabeza and quesillo. I didn't like it as much, but it didn't matter.I walked through the Mercado de Antojitos, or \"Market of Appetizers,\" across the street but was too full to eat anything else, but next week, I am eating barbacoa, or barbecued goat, for sure. Why don't we have markets of appetizers in the U.S.? I'm sure it would do a great deal for depression.

Impressive, no?The chile-turkey is sitting on top of a refrigerator case of sodas at Tacos Alvaro on Porfirio Diaz at the corner of Quetzalcoatl. They serve quite good tacos, from 2 pm until late at night, which I would describe in greater detail, except I can't quite remember whether I ate \"buche\" or \"trompa,\" which my dictionary both translate as \"mouth\" or \"maw,\" but I'm sure the waiter said one of them was some sort of innards, \"como tripa.\" Erin and I had the \"al pastor\" and \"carnitas\" each, and one was very good and the other very strange, so strange to be inedible even to us, but I can't remember which was which either.We were tired after being in the sun and rain all day for Guelaguetza, and on our way to our all-night bus ride to Puerto Escondido, please forgive me.

The al pastor was the very good taco, the carnitas was the oddly inedible one, to our palates. It was definitely a different cut of meat than the carnitas I'm used to- the meat was so full of cartilage it was crunchy. And I'm pretty sure you had the trompa, not the buche.I just ate a chicken mole tamal from the Civic Center farmer's market for lunch, and while it wasn't bad, it made me yearn to be back in Oaxaca eating the real deal with you!

I had never tried mole coloradito until I got to Oaxaca, but there have been times when I have wondered if it's possible that I like it even more than mole negro. After my cooking lesson with Sra. Soledad, that question was answered forever: a good mole negro is king. But mole coloradito continues to run a close second in my affections, and I was thrilled when they honored my request for it at my second cooking class at Seasons of My Heart. I loved the group at my second class: a contingent of students from a culinary school in Nebraska, two Episcopalian priests married to each other from Texas, their son from Brooklyn who has been working his way through \"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\" while finishing his dissertation on French literature, two girls from UC Davis who \"came to Oaxaca to eat,\" and a woman from Cincinnati who didn't get mad that I got a little bossy about the mole coloradito. Instead of a market tour in Etla, we started with a cheese-making demonstration by Sylvia in the morning, a woman who grew up in Puebla but met and married a man from Etla and joined the family business of cheese-making. Reyes Etla is famous for its cheese, and even though it is only 30-45 minutes away from Oaxaca, vendors in Oaxacan markets will brag and sometimes even lie that their cheese is from Etla when it's not. Susana Trilling says you can tell what's not from Etla because it's sold in plastic rings, not in the woven straw corsets, nor in the wooden rings that are made from the wood of the tree under which Buddha found enlightenment. (It's amazing, she says things like this in such a matter-of-fact, wry way.)Even though Sylvia is from Puebla, she prefers Oaxacan cheese. All three Oaxacan cheeses come from different steps in one, long process. You start with a piece of dried cow stomach for the coagulant, treated with lime and salt and dried on the roof to keep it away from the dogs (though that doesn't quite make sense to me since people here seem to keep their dogs on their roofs). The cow stomach put in the whey and allowed to release its enzymes for 2-3 days. Then the whey is mixed with cow's milk. When the curds start to separate from the whey, they look at first like silken tofu. Sylvia just stirred the massive bucket with her hand, waiting for it to get crumblier. When it was ready, maybe 15 minutes later, she passed it through a cheesecloth and squeezed out the whey. Without salt, the curds form the beginning of requeson, the Oaxacan version of ricotta, as rich and as delicious with honey as ricotta can be. With salt, the fermentation stops, and it becomes queso fresco, the crumblable cheese that can be found in so many Oaxacan dishes. When boiling water is poured on fermenting cheese curds, it becomes a smooth, tacky mass, the beginning of quesillo, the string cheese that is found in the remaining dishes of Oaxaca.We were each given a small ball to pull and stretch. Mine broke almost immediately, so I ate it. The others were able to pull them sufficiently and them wrap them into tidy little turbaned bundles. It's harder than it looks, to wrap it up just so. And then we rinsed our hands in the warm whey, which instantly made me want to bathe in it. It's probably better for your skin than your fanciest $100 moisturizer.While Susana explained what we would be making, we ate our almuerzo, a brunch to fortify us as we cooked, of \"salsa de queso\" or hunks of queso fresco simmered in a spicy salsa, accompanied by black beans and tortillas. The queso almost took on the texture of cooked tofu, the firm kind this time, with a textured skin and a chewy interior that was cheesy without being gooey. The menu of our main meal, the whole point of the class, was truly Oaxacan this time, with regional specialties I had never tried before.The \"tetelas de juxtlahuaca\" were little turnovers made of masa that looked exactly like hamantaschen, the Jewish cookie made traditionally for Purim, except they were savory rather than sweet and filled with a red bean puree. From the Mixteca Baja region of the mountains near the coast, they were cooked completely on the comal, the circular, slightly concave clay pan that is used to cook tortillas and anything else made of masa, as well as toast chilies and roast tomatoes. They had the wonderful, chewy, toasty exterior of all masa cooked on a comal. Served with a drizzle of Mexican crema, which is like crème fraiche, and then served with a spicy tomato-chile bravo salsa, it was the perfect botana to eat with our beers. Like all good appetizers, it stimulated our appetites for more.The soup was a pureed soup of garbanzo beans, from mountainous areas like Ixtlan in the Sierra Norte, and simmered with mint, it reminded me so much of Middle Eastern soups, though there wasn't any cumin. Not so much an exciting soup as a comforting one.The salad was a happy mélange of green cactus fruit, guavas, red onion, oranges, avocados, pomegranate seeds, and toasted pumpkin seeds, as well as queso fresco, the kind of salad I would throw together without much thought, fruity and tart with lots of crunch. It was fairly complicated, as salads go, if not particularly revelatory, but still a good example of how every good salad should be fruity and tart with lots of crunch.The accompaniment for the mole coloradito was a rice with \"hongos del bosque,\" mushrooms with no real English-language equivalent, so the school calls them \"little brown mushrooms.\" Prosaic, but accurate. The little wrinkly, dried buggers were delicious, and cooked to the point that they were still chewy, a good counterbalance to the tender rice. And the mole, oh the mole. It's one of the hardest things in the world to describe what mole tastes like. But that day, I heard a description that made wonderful sense: if you can taste any one ingredient, you haven't done it right. Like mole negro, the coloradito required substantial toasting of chiles on their comal outside, though this time, just two types, guajillo and ancho, and no full-on burning of chile seeds, which instantly made it more feasible for a Brooklyn dinner. We also toasted the garlic cloves, the whole peppercorns and cloves, a stick of cinnamon, and the white onions. Everything else got cooked separately on the stove inside: the tomatoes and oregano in one pan, and the fried bread, raisins, sesame seeds, and almonds in another pan. Instead of taking it to the village miller, we used the kitchen's amazing two-horsepower blender to puree each component separately, and then pushed everything again through a food mill. That blender was both awesome and frightening, like the first time I used a power tool at a Habitat for Humanity construction site. The pureed chili went in first, a thick, gorgeous mixture that started to get shiny as it started cooking in the cazuela. Susana taught us to look for the \"ojo,\" the eye that would appear as the sauce bubbled up and then broke on the surface. Then the onion-spice mixture, and when that was ready, the tomato mixture, and when that was ready, the plaintain-bread-raisin mush, and then finally the sesame-almond mixture. Like a good Thai curry, you could taste it grow and evolve with each added ingredient, but the best part was possibly near the end, after almost an hour, when we added a great deal of stock, which not only thinned it to the right consistency, it filled it with even more depth and flavor. Finally, we added the chocolate, and salt and sugar to taste.In the traditional way, the chicken had been simmered separately to create the stock and was added to the mole when plating. I got a piece of white meat that I just couldn't understand--it was chewy, but not dry, with real flavor. When I got home, Rick Bayless provided some illumination: Mexican chicken, which is generally free-range without self-consciousness, can handle long-cooking, unlike our \"leaner, less-developed American birds.\" Ha! I love how he makes it sound like American chickens are just puny, flabby things that haven't put in sufficient time at the gym. Now I know why I've enjoyed the white meat I've had here so much.Dessert in Mexico always feels like an afterthought, and I had actually quite hated the boozy mango dessert we had last time, but for once I loved the dessert, a Mexican chocolate boudin. It probably helped that it was made by the teacher leading the culinary school contingent, and even though she told us it would have been better if the bread had been allowed to soak longer in the crema de café mezcal and get softer, I loved the almost tough, chewy texture of the outer edge, contrasted with the smooth, silky interior and the chunks of strawberries embedded inside. (Koreans just love chewy, jjolgit jjolgit textures.)It's almost too much, you know. To make mole negro with Sra. Soledad, to make mole coloradito at Seasons of My Heart. I'll never be able to complain about my life again.

This is a very typical story about traveling in Mexico:Erin and I had decided to take a short two-day hiking trip into the Sierra Norte. Oaxaca state is rich enough to have both pristine surfer beaches and mountains with some of the greatest biodiversity in the world. My Spanish teacher, Lety, used to work with the World Wildlife Federation in the Sierra Norte, and heartily recommended that we go visit Ixtlán de Juarez, a town of about 8,000 people, that communally owns the forest around it and provides guided tours through their tourism office, Ecoturixtlan. When I visited their office in Oaxaca, a tiny one-room office with a woman who probably got a visitor every other day, I was assured that I could easily take a colectivo taxi to Ixtlán any time of day. Colectivo taxis are red and white sedans that shuttle people between the city of Oaxaca and various pueblos outside Oaxaca, for as little as 8 pesos, or about $0.75. The drivers want to fill up before they leave--three in the back, and two in the front next to the driver, but since they're not spacious cars, the person in the middle in the front can end up sitting with the gearshift between their legs. Since Ixtlan was in the mountains and about an hour away, I expected to pay about 50 pesos each. Erin and I got up fairly early and made our way to the sitio, the site from which the Ixtlan colectivos would leave. There was an immense line of 20 or so people, but I wasn't too perturbed, since I'd never had to wait more than 10 minutes or so for a colectivo to leave.After waiting 40 minutes and seeing one car come by, I finally decided I had to do something. No one else seemed perturbed, but I turned to the old woman next to me and asked, \"Is it normal to wait so long?\"\"Oh yes, I've waited one, two hours before.\"\"Ohmigod,\" I thought. \"Is there any other way to get there?\"\"Yes, you can take a special taxi over there, but they charge 50 pesos each.\"This isn't an exact translation, as what she really said was that there was something \"especial aqua.\" \"Aqua\" is a Mexican form of \"aqui\" or \"here,\" but since it's a Mexican word, it means it has a very broad meaning. \"Here\" doesn't mean \"right here,\" this little spot right in front of us. \"Here\" can mean \"right here\" or \"close to here\" or \"sort of here.\" For natives, \"here\" has a vast circumference.Maybe 50 pesos was too much for her, but it wasn't for me, and I wandered over in the direction she had gestured, leaving Erin sitting on a stump calmly reading the Moon Handbook for Oaxaca. But I found nothing that made sense. There were some colectivos with \"Ixtepeji\" on the side, indicating a town between Ixtlán and Oaxaca, but nothing else. I asked the woman selling snacks, \"Is there another way to get to Ixtlán?\" And she told me about a bus that would arrive in an hour, but nothing else.I went back to the old woman and asked again, \"You mean over there? Do you mean the cabs going to Ixtepeji?\"\"Yes, they're special, they charge 50 pesos.\"I went back to the two cab drivers who had been standing around for awhile. \"How much to go to Ixtlan?\"\"250 pesos.\"\"For the car?\"\"For the car.\"Well, at this point, Erin and I were definitely willing to split that to get to Ixtlán. But I thought I might as well ask, \"Does anyone want to go with us?\", and three women popped up, including the woman who had told me I could hire the Ixtepeji car!How is it that the non-Spanish-speaking foreigner organized the \"especial\" car to Ixtlán?!?!?! And why didn't one of the cab drivers, who were literally 20 feet away, come by and offer to take five people for 250 pesos? More than anything, Mexico makes me realize how much I as an American assume that if there is money to be spent, it should be easy to spend it. Mexico is a wonderful country in which to de-New York-ify. You can't control anything, and if you just relax, everything will work out in the end. And to think, I've been huffing and puffing for so much of my life, waiting on a subway platform for a train that broke down.The ride was absolutely beautiful. The road was smooth and well-paved but it turned and turned, in lovely serpentine curves. And when we arrived, we saw a proud little town, so clean and so lovingly maintained. It may be desperately poor, but it didn't look it, with its fresh paint and its sparkling basketball court right next to the central square.The Ecoturixltan office seemed to have our lost our reservation for a cabaña, but no matter, they had one available. At 11 a.m., they said it was too late to start for a long day-hike, but after much repeated, slowly-spoken Spanish on the part of the patient receptionist, we agreed to pay for a full-day hike with a guide the next day and to spend the first day walking around the town and the cabañas in the woods.Yet again, we saw Mexican marketing at work, which is to say it was nonexistent. The receptionist tried to draw us a map, but like most locals in small towns, she had no idea how many turns there were in the roads in her town. We were looking for a \"mirador,\" a look-out point that most people drive to, but the only existing signs were irregularly placed, and not necessarily at every fork in the road. Erin has traveled in Latin America before, and she's just a wonderfully patient person anyway, so neither of us really cared that we were stumbling through cornfields and walking through someone's backyard. We never did find the mirador.But when we got back, we had the sharp, clean hunger of those who've walked in the mountains, and we sat down with easy anticipation for our lunch in the \"Cafeteria\" next to the Ecoturixtlan office. There were two choices, enchiladas or chicken, and we both ordered the chicken.My God, it was so good! It was served in a spicy, brightly flavored, tomato-colored sauce made of guajillo chiles and hoja de aguacate, or avocado leaves, which impart a taste that reminds me of fennel and mint at the same time. You would never have expected it, something so tangy and delicious at a tiny restaurant in the mountains serving two dishes a day, and that only made it even more delicious.The other food revelation of the day was tasting our first \"mango pina.\" The lady at the market told us to peel a bit of the skin at one end and then just suck the juice out. When we arrived at our cabaña in the mountains, we tried to peel it and cut it into chunks, but soon realized it was too stringy to do anything other than squeeze and hope for the best. It really did have the fragrance of a ripe pineapple, somehow grafted onto a mango. She was also selling insane, giant orange mushrooms, and one of my greatest regrets in Mexico is that I didn't buy any.When we fell asleep that night, we sank into the most comfortable king-size bed of our lives. If you are ever in the cabañas in Ixtlán, be sure to ask for Cuarto #4, as you will end up sleeping in the Presidential Suite, the room in which President Vicente Fox stayed, as we were told the following morning. But Mexico wasn't done surprising us. When we woke up the next morning, we had no idea if anyone was going to come and get us. We were 4 kilometers, a little less than 3 miles, outside of town, and we hadn't gotten any real directions about how and where to meet our guide. Around 9:30 a.m., a young man showed up and told us that there weren't any guides available for a hiking trip, but did we want to go on an automobile tour?No we did not. I, thankfully, did not go all-NY on him, but I did say, in an insistent voice, \"But we paid for a guide to take us on a 7-hour hike. That's what we were told yesterday.\"I should have known better just to trust. When we got back to town, we found Eduardo, our guide, and Julian, a Swiss agronomist traveling through Mexico who spoke excellent Spanish. (It's not fair how easily Europeans learn languages.) And we went on our 7-hour hike, through three different kinds of forests, including \"el bosque de nubes\" or the cloud forest, with its ghostly lichens and mists. Sadly, we didn't see any jaguars, but we did see some amazing, perfectly round, perfectly red mushrooms, both poisonous and edible. We also saw the prettiest little meadow on our way back to town, which made me want to twirl and burst into song: \"The hills are alive....with the sound of music!\"We knew as we got closer back to town that we might not be able to catch another colectivo back to Oaxaca. It was past 6:30 pm, but we found the sitio easily enough and got on line. We waited and waited, ate a banana or two, tried to stay out of the afternoon rain, and waited and waited. The people at the Ecoturixtlan office told us a bus would leave at 8:30 p.m. from the gas station, you know, just straight from the central square. After 8:15, the entire line of 8 remaining people got up. \"Where are you going?\", I asked a smiley guy who had tried to find a truck to take all of us back earlier. \"We're going to the bus!\" When we got to the gas station, though, we found a van that had been stopped by the military checkpoint that was also going to Oaxaca, and we decided to hop on board. Everyone in the van was tired and annoyed, and one woman repeatedly kept shouting, \"I'm a lawyer! I'm a teacher! What is the problem?\" Erin and I, however, tried to stay inconspicuous and friendly, as we got thoroughly searched as well. By that point, we knew how to relax. As the young photographer from Mexico City shrugged, \"Asi Mexico,\" \"That's Mexico.\" There was a moment when we thought Erin's backpack with its Camelbak-style plastic waterbag would get confiscated; it was so completely alien to the soldier rifling through her bag. Erin asked me later, \"Do you think that soldier was flirting with us?\" And I answered, \"I don't know, but given how close his gun was to us, I thought it was best to smile a lot.\"We got home in the end, even after finding another military checkpoint right outside the city. The entire van rose up in chorus, \"But we were already searched back there!\" I felt like we'd seen everything there is to see about Mexican transportation--resigned patience, good fortune, and military checkpoints. And we got to eat great chicken and fantastic fruit, and sleep in Vicente Fox's bed! How lucky we were, ique suerte!

\"Bueno.\"\"Bueno, hi, I have reservations but we went to your old location and we are running late. Where is your restaurant located?\"\"Mumble-mumble Louis Vuitton store.\"\"Uh, what is the name of the street? At the corner of what?\"It wasn't a very auspicious beginning to our dinner at the imposingly named Aguila y Sol, meaning Eagle and Sun. Neither Erin nor I are big on white tablecloth restaurants--A) we don't have the money, and B) we're too busy slurping saucy foods in places with plastic tablecloths. But Erin suggested we check out one of the nueva cocina mexicana restaurants in Mexico City that are all the rage, and Aguila y Sol had gotten rave reviews. It also turned out she was plotting to treat me to dinner.Nueva cocina mexicana refers to the trend of young chefs in Mexico City taking Mexican dishes and playing with them, perhaps adding a non-Mexican ingredient or two, but ultimately celebrating the existing complexity of Mexican food traditions, or at least it seemed that way at Aguila y Sol. It reminded me a bit of trendy dim sum in Hong Kong, where the chefs keep the cuisine dynamic and alive, but without creating a gross fusion mess.For those of you who know Seoul, Polanco reminded me exactly of Apkujongdong. Unlike Rodeo Drive or Fifth Avenue, Polanco isn't filled with gawking tourists, just very wealthy Mexico City residents who have the option of shopping at Louis Vuitton one moment, and then going upstairs to eat at Aguila y Sol the next. Everything was new and glassy. The dining room at Aguila y Sol felt a little chilly, with slate-blue velvet high-backed chairs and cube-shaped vases that looked they were going to tip over. Erin reflexively tried to right it as soon as we sat down. The vase glowed with a mysterious, lime-green light, and when it was removed, the mystery was solved--each table was lit from underneath. It wasn't a hip young place, despite the cutting-edge reputation of nueva cocina, and I felt out of place in my sundress and espradrilles. Everyone else seemed to be hosting American business partners. I eavesdropped on the American catty-corner from me and felt sorry for the waiter, as the American clearly just wanted an Omaha steak.But then the food started to come, and it stopped feeling quite so removed from the Mexico I knew. The busboy grinned at us, conspiring with us in staging photos of the food, and the margaritas started to relax me. Rimmed in pink sugar with a carnation just sitting on top, they were presented with thought but with more happy festivity than the cool modern design of New York.Similarly, our cebiche came in a bright red pail with a jaunty chile stuck in it, perfectly crispy and non-greasy potato chips, and a little anthill of red salt. Tender, delicious, slightly picante. Our other appetizer would have tasted just like high-end broccoli-cheese casserole, but for the mind-altering salsa de chile pasilla. They were little buttery turnovers made of huauzontle, a long stalky green vegetable with broccoli-like florets. It made Erin nostalgic for the food of her Midwestern youth. It made me realize how much chile pasilla could improve broccoli-cheese casserole.And we ate too much of the bread basket, but how could we resist trying each of the six different rolls? One was filled with mole negro, another the softest, most comforting white bread with pink sugar on top, another spicy, another cheesy. The entrees were, surprisingly, the most impressive, though sadly we were too full to give them due respect. We had a filet of huachinango or red snapper in the spicy Veracruz-style, with peppers, onions, and slivered almonds. Perfectly cooked, every grain of rice in place in its pyramid.But the best was the \"pollito en leche\" rubbed and served in an achiote sauce. It was a small little bird, probably squab, that may have been marinated in milk, giving it an almost creamy tenderness. Achiote paste, according to Rick Bayless, is \"spicy-complex without chile,\" and \"not spicy-hot,\" being made only of achiote seeds, allspice, black pepper, oregano, cider vinegar, garlic and salt. I can't compare it to anything, because it was unlike anything I'd had before. It was a crime that we could eat so little.The tortillas, though, almost outshone the entrees. They came multi-colored and multi-flavored, with the perfect balance between toothsome chewiness and toasty crust. The tortilla basket included the only flour tortilla I have ever truly loved.Erin was leaning against dessert, but I persisted. The special was a mousse of cajeta, the goat's milk dulce de leche, and the waiter assured us it was \"pequeno.\" Ha! It came in a freakin' glass mug nestled in a spray-painted gold cornhusk. I loved how over the top the plating was, and even more how light and fluffy, and yet rich the mousse tasted.It really was too much. And then, good God, we had our petit-fours plate. By then, I was drunk on both the food and the tequila. I think I just mindlessly popped whatever they were, corn cookies and tamarind jellies, in my mouth. We took some gleeful photos with the busboy, who forced the very correct waiter to join in, and then we rode away into the night, feeling like beached whales that had somehow gotten into a taxi in Mexico City.

Sometimes, it feels like there's nothing left to discover in New York. I know it's not true, but given the number of people who care and the number of people nosing around, the odds are nothing really wonderful can stay a secret for very long. So it was a quiet relief to spend my last day in Mexico City just wandering around, relying on some tips, but mainly just eating what I found. Despite or perhaps because of memories of \"Introduction to Art History\" with Vincent Scully, I'd decided I didn't need to go with Erin to Teotihuacan to see the Pyramid of the Sun and the Pyramid of the Moon. Erin had the camera, but even that was a relief, too, just to eat. I decided to go back to Coyoacan, the artsy neighborhood and former home of Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, Leon Trotsky, and Octavio Paz (the photos are from our trip there 3 days earlier). Acting on a chowhound tip, I started at the Pasteleria Esperanza right outside the General Anaya metro stop, planning to walk and eat my way west to the Miguel de Aquevedo stop on the other side of Coyoacan.I ate a sugary dona, or donut, that wasn't as light as I'd hoped, but it kind of grew on me. It was a Monday morning, around 9:30, but nothing was open and the streets were quiet with people walking their dogs. Coyoacan is what makes Mexico City seem so much like LA to me--a city that is completely oblivious to pedestrian needs (I almost had a car run over my toes at a busy intersection with no pedestrian traffic lights) but with quiet, well-off neighborhoods filled with sidewalk cafes and pink and orange bougainvillea flowing over the walls.I found a branch of the popular coffee shop, Cafe El Jarocho, and sat on a bench with my café de olla reading Carlos Fuentes's \"The Death of Artemio Cruz\" while watching people drive up, just like in LA, for their morning coffee. Coffee isn't a religion in Mexico, certainly not in Oaxaca, but El Jarocho has good, cheap, strong espressos and cappuchinos.I wandered on to Plaza Hidalgo with its adjoining smaller plaza and the fountain I love so much, two dogs playing in a spray of water. I saw a man and his grandson buying roast chickens on the northwest corner of the plaza, at a big grocery store called \"America,\" from a nice young man with a goatee. The sign in the window advertised empanadas de atun, empanadas de bacalao. I don't know why, but whenever I see the word \"bacalao\" for salt cod, I have to eat it. This empanada turned out to be a flaky turnover filled with salt cod and onions. Yum.Then I wended my way back to the Mercado to eat cebiche de jaipa or crab at El Jardin del Pulpo, \"The Garden of the Octopus,\" in a sundae glass with saltines and fresh wedges of lime. Nothing particularly memorable to report, but I love that name, the Garden of the Octopus.I had eaten so much, it was clearly time to walk some more. I took the subway back to the center of town to the Mercado Artesanias and bought more souvenirs that I'll struggle to carry home. As I walked back to our hotel near the Zocalo, through the part of town dedicated to selling bathroom fixtures, I saw a little plaza with some crowded food stalls. All weekend, I'd been seeing street food that I hadn't seen in Oaxaca, antojitos typical of Verucruz or Michoacan or the Yucatan. I walked back and forth dragging my tin mirrors behind me, and finally decided to eat a huarache, because the man already standing there looked so happy with his. Besides, they were advertised as \"Rico Rico Rico Rico.\" I have to take precise note of where it was, on Ayuntamiento near the corner of Aranda, a block from the major street of Lopez, next to the bank on the south side of the street, because the huarache was so good! I'd had huaraches before in Red Hook, Brooklyn, and knew them as long, flat tortilla-like things with taco-like fillings, but this oblong huarache was different, crispier, chewier, with a texture of masa ground more coarsely. The huarache got good and toasty because the cook repeatedly brushed both sides with oil. I ordered one with bisteck, a thin slice of beef he cooked separately on the grill, then added to the huarache already bubbling with red salsa. Topped with crumbled queso fresco, it was heaven. My fingertips burned as I tried to eat the unwieldy thing without getting it all over my face, but it was worth it.And we still had dinner ahead of us at Aguila y Sol.

My religion is mole negro, and Soledad is my guru

I've been telling everyone that if you want to be Zen, there's no need to go to an ashram in India, you can just come to Mexico. You can't plan anything, but everything works out in the end. And to make the metaphor complete, I have found my guru.Even though I told everyone before I left that I was going to Oaxaca to learn to make mole negro, I didn't really believe I would. I knew that it was an intensive, all-day process, and it seemed like the kind of thing you could only really learn in a Oaxacan home, from a Oaxacan grandmother. How was I, an American tourist who speaks broken Spanish, going to find that woman? It was too much like something Paula Wolfert would do for me to imagine that I could do the same.But Mexico continues to surprise me at every turn, not only in what is possible, but also what is possible in me. I met Senora Soledad Ramirez Martinez easily enough, at the cooking class at ICO, and immediately fell in love with her. But with my pessimism, I didn't even plot to learn with her. I just innocently asked in class, as the workshop drew to a close, \"Where could I learn to make mole negro?\", and the answer came so readily, \"You can come to my home and I'll teach you.\"Sra Soledad is like that in every way. She's no-nonsense, very straightforward, and very firm in her opinions: the best chocolate in Oaxaca (Chocolate Mayordomo), whether the vendors advertising \"metate-ground\" chocolate are lying (they are), whether Mexican families make their own salsa (claro!). Coupled with an incredible generosity of heart, she overwhelms you, and she's not even five feet tall. My paternal grandmother died before I was born, my maternal grandmother when I was 15, but I didn't know how much I was missing a grandmother in my life until I met her.Soledad lives near the archeological site of Monte Alban, in a steep little town with an awe-inspiring view of the city. Her home sits on three terraces, the garage and the rainwater reservoir on the first, the outdoor wood-burning kitchen on the second, and the main living area with its indoor kitchen and patio on the third. She and her husband, Carlos, have four children, and I think two of them live with her, along with their youngest grandchild, five-year-old Carlita.As Soledad spread out the twenty or so ingredients that make up mole negro, Erin and I sipped hot chocolate and gazed in wonder. The key chile, the hard-to-find chilhuatle or chilhuacle with its inflated, smooth look, is expensive, 400 pesos or $40 per kilo. Then there are the mulatos, which are dark, wrinkled and round; the pasillas mexicanas which are dark, wrinkled and long, and the chipotles mecos, which are tan, wrinkled, and somewhat triangular.The sweetness comes very slightly from sugar, and mainly from the plaintain, the raisins, and the tomatoes, as well as the Oaxacan chocolate. A subtle, nutty flavor is added by sesame seeds, pecans, and almonds, as well as the eggy and fragrant pan de yema. As if all these flavors were not enough, mole negro requires just a few cloves and fresh peppercorns, a small stick of Mexican canela or cinnamon, and just a spoonful or two of Mexican oregano and thyme, as well as the tartness of tomatillos and the heady dimension of white onion and garlic. Everything gets mellowed and smoothed by chicken broth--sorry, vegetarians. Her recipe is enough to feed 30, as the laborious process of mole negro is honored by and reserved for fiestas, weddings, and other important occasions. Obviously a blend of Spanish-Moorish ingredients and New World flavors, the word mole, appropriately, comes both from the Nahuatl word \"molli\" for sauce, and the Spanish verb \"mollinar,\" to grind or blend. We began by deseeding and deveining the chiles, and then toasting them on her comal in her outdoor, wood-fired kitchen until they were dark but not burned, and stiff. While they soaked in water, the next very important and very strange step was to burn the reserved chile seeds on the comal until absolutely black. This is the part I can't imagine doing in my Brooklyn kitchen, as I can't roast a chicken without setting off the smoke detector. Hopefully, my neighbors won't report me when I set up an illegal Weber grill on my makeshift deck. The seeds were then rinsed in water. The pecans and sesame seeds were toasted last.In the meantime, the tomatoes and tomatillos were simmering in water on the indoor gas stove for about 20 minutes. We fried the plaintain and the slices of pan de yema, and then the onions, raisins and pecans. We added cinnamon, in a big loose stick, and thyme and oregano. The chicken got simmered separately, creating a light broth for later use. It was time to go to the neighborhood mollino or miller. It was like Mexican Sesame Street--let's go visit Mr. Miller! All four of us walked down the hill, Erin, Soledad, Carlita, and me carrying the big bucket, and watched as the miller washed out the corn he had ground in the morning so he could push our mole through.The hard part was over. All we had to do now was put it in an earthenware cazuela and cook it on a wood fire with a little oil for an hour, stirring constantly. It was amazing to watch it change in color from a chocolate brown to a dark, shiny black. (According to Susana Trilling, if your mole negro isn't quite black, people will talk.) As we stirred and the fire smoked, the rain started to come down, and the steep slope of their street became a brown river. We tasted at 30 minutes, then 50, then 60. We added Mexican chocolate, the key thing being to use chocolate without milk, just a few spoonfuls of sugar, and then the chicken stock. Soledad asked us what we thought, should we add more sugar? And I was amazed to taste a mole so balanced, more sugar would have made it gawdy and cheap. I felt like a witch stirring a magical brew, because it was. I've written mainly about the ingredients and the steps because at this point, I don't know how to express in words what else happened that day. If you could see me, I would wave my hands and clutch my heart as I told you how Soledad and her family welcomed us into their home. We paid 350 pesos each, or about $35 for the all-day class, but there's no price that can match what we found. Carlita, like the confident, well-loved child she is, chattered to us, pretended she was a bull, and served us rice soup in little plastic bowls from her toy kitchen. Carlos, her grandfather, showed us their photo albums with photos of their second wedding when they renewed their vows and their daughter Patty's quinceanera or Sweet 15 party. Soledad told us how her father had found a big heavy slab of stone and carried it home to be her mother's metate. They told us more stories while we ate full-flavored chicken in the best mole negro I've ever had with perfect rice. It's not just that they were hospitable, but that their hospitality was almost without thought, it came so naturally. The heavy rains came early that day, and Carlos wasn't able to find fresh blandas, a type of tortilla, to sop up our sauce, but although Soledad apologized more than once for having only tostadas, there was none of the nervous anxiety that comes with having guests. They made Erin and me feel like family friends, like we had become part of their lives and their memories. We could have sat at their table forever. If you are ever in Oaxaca, or have friends who want to learn to cook in Oaxaca, please contact me, as I have her phone number and she would be happy to teach anyone who is a friend of \"Ae-rin\" or \"Graciela.\" I left Christianity because I hated proselytizing, but with Soledad as my guru, her religion is one I would gladly spread.

Hi Grace,I've just discovered your blog which is so heartwarming and fun to read. I'm currently in Oaxaca for a holiday and am about to start a few days lessons with Susana Trilling. I read your posting about learning to make mole negro with Soledad and was wondering if you could give me her details? I can understand a reasonable amount of Spanish although I can't express myself very well, but I'd still love to have a lesson with her. The language of food tends to be universal!I'd really appreciate any help and information that you could provide.Many thanks and keep writing!Jennifer

Hello grace!I discovered your post what researching how to make mole negro. I am sooooo intrigued.I am planning a big dinner party and want a complex dish for my new posting. But my main concern is that I have never had mole negro. I am doing research. Can you tell me what it tasted like (in comparison to, let's say, mole poblano or any other mole). I would appreciate it!Thanks!

I did it--I cooked pasta in my kitchen in Oaxaca that wasn't terrible. Bacon (that had the consistency of ham), plum tomatoes, mushrooms, and the parmiggiano-reggiano Erin smuggled from San Francisco. I think it was the parmesan that did it. It was my third try. Don't ever try replacing sweet basil with any other kind of basil in an Italian tomato sauce. You'll regret it.

Two weeks ago, when Erin and I were staying in a hotel in Mexico City, I watched vivid footage of buses burning in Oaxaca, as anti-government protests turned dangerous leading up to the planned \"official\" Guelaguetza 2007. I watched a group of five or six policemen pushing a man down to the ground and then begin kicking him, oblivious or careless of the news cameras trained on them. Finally, two policemen in different uniforms came in, grabbed the man, hugging him to their bodies, and hustled him away, possibly to beat him in private.July 23rd marked the first day of Guelaguetza, Oaxaca's indigenous folk dance festival and its biggest tourist attraction. Also called \"Lunes del Cerro,\" translatable as \"Mondays on the Hill,\" the official performance celebrating Oaxaca's distinct regions and cultures takes place annually on two Mondays in July, at the Cerro del Fortin on the western edge of the historic center, with a beautiful view of the city and the valley beyond. Normally, these two Mondays frame a week of fun, as street food proliferates all over town, crafts vendors set up even more stalls throughout the zocalo, and tourists from all over Mexico and the world pour into the city. To gild the lily, the annual mezcal festival is held at the same time. If you threw a stone, you would hit a marimba band or a dance troupe, on stages around the Ex-Convent of Santo Domingo or just in the streets. To me, it feels like there's always a fiesta or saint's day celebration going on in Oaxaca, complete with deafening fireworks, but Guelaguetza just multiples the everyday feel by ten.Last year, when APPO took over the center of the city in protest of the state governor, the official Guelaguetza was cancelled, for the first time in its history. This year, even as the governor spent millions in promoting and marketing \"Guelaguetza 2007,\" Ticketmaster promised a full refund if the shows didn't happen. APPO called for a boycott of the official one, hosted its own on July 16th, and graffiti sprouted around the city, quite well-designed stenciled images with exhortations like, \"The art of the pueblos for the pueblos!\" In the end, all scheduled performances went on, even in the pouring afternoon rain, and at least during \"Lunes del Cerro,\" the protests remained peaceful.There's no question there have been gross human rights abuses here. But I have no expertise with which to analyze the pros and cons of the boycott, the protests, the demands of APPO. (Erin and I bought tickets to the official one before I realized how fraught the mere act of attendance could be and watched for an hour before we got rained out.) Yet I want to report on what I do know, what amazed and moved me at the two smaller, local Guelaguetzas I saw at Reyes Etla and Tocuela. And that I ate a jicama popsicle.Guelaguetza is not just for tourists. More than any other folk dance I've ever seen, it is truly a celebration for the communities here. The town of Reyes Etla was deserted on July 23rd because the entire town had gone up to their cerro to watch the four-hour show. I was possibly the only tourist at the performance in Tocuela, probably the only non-Mexican, and definitely the only Asian person. I felt like I was at a community talent show or a high school concert, with all the personal warmth the audience felt for the performers. I had been invited to see the show at Tocuela on July 30th by Senora Soledad, my cooking teacher, as her son was the director of the show, so I sat in the VIP section right next to the stage with her family. Everyone around me wanted to know who I was and where I was from and how long I was in Oaxaca (and of course, whether I was married), and this really beautiful baby was fascinated by my digital camera. Each dance celebrates a specific region, with the performers wearing gorgeous traditional clothing. There's a specific repertoire that makes up the Guelaguetza, and everyone ends with the \"Danza de la Pluma\" and the pineapple girls, but having seen three Guelaguetzas, I can attest that each director puts his personal touches on each show. Soledad's son clearly loved playing with the bullfight motif, charged with male-female conflict, as his girls charged the boys waving red handkerchiefs so vigorously, the stage became a Laurel-and-Hardy show of boys tumbling and girls chasing.But to truly celebrate the region, the performers will throw samples of the regional specialties to the audience, which might be light little things like straw woven fans and dried gourds for drinking mezcal, or dangerous projectiles like mangos and pineapples. Many of these girls do not throw like girls. I only got hit once, in the face with a tortilla, though I did duck a mango or two. Luckily, the region known for its turkeys merely dances with a turkey, rather than throwing one out to the audience. So at the end of every number, there were arms waving frantically in the air and children running up on stage to wheedle more closely. At Tocuela, the people around me got deeply invested in making sure that I got many \"recuerdos\" or souvenirs, and kept yelling to their daughter/cousin/niece, \"Maria Cruz! Maria Cruz! Over here! Over here!\" I came home with two little clay bottles of mezcal, two mangos, a little basket, two tlayudas, one totopo (crispy tortilla from the Isthmus), one passionfruit, three rolls of pan de yema, a piece of sugarcane, a hollowed stick of wood for drinking mezcal with a cord to wear it around my neck, a weird little bar of fruity, brown sugar dessert, and an inedible dessert that seemed to be made from a wedge of sugar cane soaked in a toxic liqueur.Oaxaca is the most indigenous state in Mexico, with over 30% speaking an indigenous language. People are generally considered indigenous if they speak an indigenous language, like Zapotec or Mixtec, rather than by the color of their skin. Oaxaca is not necessarily representative of Mexico in this regard, but the intense pride I saw in their indigenous heritage at Guelaguetza was overwhelming. I know that indigenous populations are among the poorest in Mexico, and that Guelaguetza may be only a shallow form of recognition, but coming from a country where we don't even pay lip service to our indigenous cultures, I was so moved by the sense of connection to a deep and rich history. I'm a big believer in the importance of national principles and ideals, even if they're only aspirational, because how much worse is it not even to aspire to them?And I finally ate a jicama popsicle! They were selling them at Reyes Etla, big thick slices on a popsicle stick, with so many different containers of colorful powders and spices. I had trouble understanding the vendor, who was very curious where I was from, so I ended up just asking for \"lo mejor,\" and got something that was spicy and tart and sweet, as if it had been dusted in those chili powder and Kool-Aid. I also ate molotes, little fried torpedos of masa filled with potatos and chorizo, at the performance in Tocuela, but I think they made me sick. God probably wanted to strike me down for the arrogant way I've been bragging about how I never get sick from street food. (For an agnostic, I'm kind of obsessed with God, no?) I'll spare you the gory details, but I finally had to open my bottle of Pepto Bismol. It was too bad, as they were so perfectly fried. But for once, the food was not the point. (Special thanks to Erin for the National Geographic-worthy photos from Etla!)

I am not a fan of Mexican bread. It's often too dry or too sweet or not sweet enough. I've had nothing approaching the heft of a hearty, levain-type bread, what MFK Fisher likes to call \"honest bread,\" or the delicate crackle of a perfect croissant, or even the homey, soothing quality of super-soft Korean white bread. Most Mexican breads improve greatly upon being dipped in hot chocolate, which is almost always served with any sweetish bread, or \"pan dulce.\" Still, one can only drink so much hot chocolate, and I miss the excellent toast I normally have for breakfast every morning in NY, along with my favorite butter from Sahadi's. (When I found little diner packets of Lurpak butter, which isn't even my favorite, at El Cafecito in Puerto Escondido, I emptied the entire basket into my purse.) Still, I wanted to see the Pasteleria Ideal in Mexico City. Another old-school place in the Centro Historico, it opened in 1927, but with more gilt-edged elegance than the Churreria \"El Moro.\" You enter into a large room with majestically high ceilings. You could be in a faded ballroom, except there are trays and trays of donuts, muffins, pastries, and rolls lined up in arrays before you. On Sunday morning, there were wheeled racks of breads being rolled around, nearly blocking the grand staircase, but the sign unequivocally declared that the second floor was the exhibition room for cakes.Nearly every cake was at least 3 tiers tall--wedding cakes, baby cakes, First Communion cakes. Shrek was clearly, peculiarly popular, as were other cartoon characters. Nearly every cake also had icicles of hardened frosting dripping from each tier. One cake was almost twice as tall as Erin. Mona and Leslie, who make hand-made cookies and truffles that look like they came from a machine, must be rubbing off on me, because all I could think was how sloppy they looked. Erin took some fantastic pictures and I'm glad I went, but I can't even remember what kind of bread I ate. All the chowhounds who are in awe of Ideal should get on a plane to Korea and go to the basement food wonderland of any upscale department store.But Mexican ice cream, or nieve, that I truly love and respect as something I have never had before and will likely never have outside Mexico. The Roxy Neveria in Condesa is a legend, too, with the look of an American soda shop, with its striped awning and white-lettered list of flavors, except American shops generally don't have the Virgin Mary hanging behind the counter. It was clearly beloved by the Mexican families who double-parked to jump in for a cone or a cup. It was so beloved by me, that after eating my first cone of \"nuez de macadamia,\" I went back and had a second cone of \"rompope.\" The macadamia was wonderful, so nutty and rich but also pure, like fresh milk. The rompope, which I ordered because I didn't know the flavor, a Mexican eggnog spiked with rum, I didn't like as much, but it was surely not regrettable.I hesitated for a bit before my second cone, but I felt it was the only fair way to treat my body, as I had just had a very bland meal at a health food store/restaurant across the corner. It was the kind of health food that used to plague America--so tasteless, even a vigorous shake of the salt on the table couldn't save it. When I ordered my second cone, the boy at the counter urged me to go back to my table and sit down, as he would bring it to me directly. People can be so sweet when they realize how much you love to eat.

El Bajio

***CONTENT
Ferran Adria says El Bajio is the best restaurant of traditional Mexican food in the world. And now, I have a higher opinion of Ferran Adria than I did before.El Bajio is as far from the carrot-foam of El Bulli as I can imagine. It's the kind of food I love most, traditional food prepared with love, care, and great pride. It's the kind of food I seek most when I eat out, because I hope that the more I eat and learn from people who cook in this way, the more I will be able to make and serve this kind of food in my own home.But I came very close to missing it completely. Erin and I were in Xochilmilco far south of the city, and we knew we could only get to El Bajio by taxi. Despite appearances, I'm quite cheap about food, and I doubted that any restaurant would be worth a $20 cab ride. But lucky for me, Erin quietly insisted.Owned by chef Carmen \"Titita\" Ramirez, the restaurant now has three branches, including one in super-posh Polanco, which chowhounds have described as glassy and very-Polanco, at least in decor. But the original, the one we went to in Azcapotzalco, is decorated in warm, rich colors, with high-quality Mexican folk art. The restaurant is acclaimed by such foodie luminaries as Rick Bayless and Diane Kennedy, in addition to Ferran Adria, but it wasn't filled with tourists, just happy Mexican families enjoying a big Sunday meal. The presence of multiple flat-screen TVs didn't even bother me, it seemed somehow appropriate, or perhaps I was just happy I could watch the Argentina-Brazil final of the Copa America while we ate. We ordered a hodge-podge, one platano empanada stuffed with beans; one quesdilla with huitlacoche, that prized corn fungus; a quarter of a kilo of carnitas in the Michoacan style; a clean and simple salad of jicama, nopales, tomatoes, and chayote; and a bowl of mole de Xico which we practically slurped up.A quarter-kilo is a lot of meat--I forgot that one kilo is 2.2 pounds, and not the other way around--but we still ate almost all of it, fat, gristle, and all. It was almost too much to slather the pork with the mole, somewhat richer than Oaxacan mole negro but otherwise equally complex, but it was a meal of happy excess, and the pork was an excellent vehicle. When faced with the prospect of dessert, Erin chose a refreshing nieve sorbet, while I, glutton that I am, chose the requeson with honey. Requeson is a ricotta-like fresh, rich wonder cheese, and when I added it to Erin's nieve order, our waiter Raul definitely wasn't expecting it, and so he gave an almost imperceptible but definite nod of approval and respect. The entire restaurant seemed to be curious and pleased at the amount of food we ate and documented with Erin's digital camera. As we left, Pablo, the manager, came forward with a smile to ask how we had heard about the restaurant. We chatted about how we had read that it was Rick Bayless's favorite Mexican restaurant in the world, and then he gave us laminated brochures for \"recuerdos\" or souvenirs. When I asked if they had the cookbook for sale, Alquimias y Atmosferas del Sabor, he said I could find it at Sanborn's, a Mexican department store, and then proudly showed me the restaurant's own dog-eared copy. (I then spent the next day going to 4 different Sanborns looking for the damn book.)Despite all the fuss I made about the $20 cab ride, I considered going back the next day, while Erin went to Teotihuacan. Who needs ancient Aztec pyramids when you can eat a fabulous Mexican breakfast at El Bajio? In the end, I decided to save my stomach for the dinner Erin and I had planned at Aguila y Sol, but the next time I'm in Mexico City, the first thing I'm going to do is jump in a taxi to El Bajio.

I happened to stumble into this comment by searching for El Bajío on the internet and read it with great pleasure and pride.Being a Mexico City born expatriate, not having lived in my home town and after discovering El Bajío only a few years ago, I will always find the time to make the \"pilgrimage\" to Azcapotzalco to treat myself to the delight of this magnificently genuine eatery.As a matter of fact, I will be flying to México tomorrow morning and am already savouring this impending meal.I admit to never having visited El Bulli (despite having sought reservations for two years), but I have enjoyed marvelous meals around the world and El Bajío is amongst them; both in quality and warmth. It just \"hits the spot\" for me.Being somewhat of a purist, I am likely to give the super-posh Polanco location a miss and head out for the original location, which is just shy of a $20 cab ride from where I will be starting my journey.Fair, excellent and truthful review AppleSister. I thank you for this tidbit in cyberspace.

Our first visit to El Bajío was for lunch, at the original location. We were very happy with our meal. (We also got to meet Carmen Ramírez Degollado, the owner-chef.)The next visit was for breakfast, at the Parque Delta location, and it, too, was excellent. I wasn't terribly endeared with the ultra-moderno design, especially the wide screen t.v's on the walls, but it was easy to ignore their distractions.Next Sunday, we're returning with friends to the Parque Delta locale. We'll see how the comida compares with the original, somewhat out-of-the-way place.

People are so kind. I've met so many warm Mexicans since I got here--Soledad my cooking teacher at ICO, Hector the architect professor at the Museo de Anthropologia who invited me to tour the city with the Pratt professors he was showing around, Eduardo our guide in the mountains of the Sierra Norte in Ixtlan de Juarez--but one of my favorite memories will always involve the waitress at the Churreria \"El Moro\" who wanted to make sure that we knew what kind of hot chocolate we were ordering.\"El Moro\" at Eje Central Lázaro Cardenas 4 in the Centro Historico is open 24 hours, so that you can satisfy your churros and chocolate craving any time of day. Open since 1935, it has a sense of worn, well-loved history, from the faded old-school menus to the stained glass window and old Mexican tiles to the baby-blue diner uniforms the waitresses wear. The menu consists of churros, slim tubes of fried dough dusted in sugar, and hot chocolate or coffee, nothing more, nothing less.Erin and I are never perturbed by not knowing what something is, and we blithely ordered one \"espanol y 4 churros\" and one \"frances y 4 churros.\" Five minutes later, the waitress came back, anxious. \"Do you know the espanol is very sweet?\" \"Uh, no. How sweet are the others?\" \"Especial is a little bitter, espanol is very sweet, frances is sweeter and mexicano is normal sweet.\"\"Especial is a little bitter?\"\"Yes.\"\"I'll have the 'especial,' please.\"She smiled, glad that we understood.Later, we realized \"espanol\" must be the Spanish style of very thick, almost sludgy hot chocolate, which can be very good, but I was happy with my \"especial\" which was made of strong, delicious bittersweet chocolate, especially since I've been craving dark chocolate since I got here. Bracing and fortifying, it almost made me forget that I hadn't had my morning coffee yet.The churros, sadly, weren't on par with the hot chocolate, since they were too greasy. But I did love seeing them piled up in giant coils in the window, next to an equally giant pan of sugar. And at least we had been guided towards impressive chocolate!

The riches of the Yucatan at Coox Hanal in Mexico City

Oaxaca is a culinary wonderland, but other than an Italian place or two, it has too much hometown pride to move beyond Oaxacan specialities and favorites. So Mexico City was my chance to eat food from Veracruz or the Yucatan or Puebla. And Erin being a big Yucatecan food fan, off we marched to find Coox Hanal, at Isabel la Catolica 83, in Centro Historico. We walked by it almost twice, since it's on the 3rd floor, above a billiards hall. But once you're at the door, you know you're there because Coox and Hanal are there to greet you.All the words on the menu were so foreign to me! Sablutes, sopa de lima? My heart beat with anticipation. We ordered 3 plates of antojitos and sopa de lima, despite our chicken soup breakfast, and I had a Montejo, a light Yucatecan lager, nothing more or less than a middle-of-the-road lager.But I was happy to have my beer, as the food turned out to be greasy bar food, and I mean that as a compliment. The panchutos, tortillas stuffed with beans and then fried and topped with pork and cabbage, were better at Seasons of My Heart, but I still ate more than my fair share. The sablutes turned out to be fried tortillas, a little thicker than usual, with pavo or turkey, and they cut their grease with shredded lettuce, chopped tomato and avocado. I thought the tacos of cochinita pibil were smooth with fat, though Erin with her experience of cooking cochinita pibil herself thought they were a tad too dry. (Erin, care to comment on what goes into pibil?) All of it was accompanied tartly and brilliantly by the pickled red onions that seem to be to the Yucatan as kimchi is to Korea.But the most impresionate, para mi, was the sopa de lima. I wish I had the kind of sensitive palate to sniff the soup and say in a tone of authority and only polite doubt, \"Ah! Is it cardamom?\", but I don't. The recipes I've found online vary greatly, some requiring just a bit of dried oregano to add some mystery--which I find hard to believe would recreate what I had, despite the particular strengths of Mexican oregano--while others call for a battery of spices. Clearly, something unusual is going on with the \"limas agrias\" or bitter limes. The soup also had the look of coconut milk, if not the taste, and with its complex tartness, it reminded me of the careful balance of great Thai soups. You could also find shredded chicken and some dark green bits that were bitter when I bit down. Could they have been bits of lime rind? Like a fine wine, the flavors kept shifting in my mouth, from smooth to tart, bitter to warm.It's good for me, with my lack of religion, to have some sense of mystery in my life.

Re: the pibil, I thought the flavor at Coox Hanal was much better than the version I'd tried at home, but the meat was definitely more dry. When I made cochinita pibil, I followed a recipe in All About Braising which calls for packaged red achiote paste, toasted and ground cumin seeds, raw garlic, and salt to be pounded into a paste. You smear the paste on an enormous pork roast (boston butt is probably the best cut to use), wrap the whole thing in banana leaves, let it marinate in the fridge for 24 hours, then slow cook it in the oven for 6 to 8 hours. It was damn good, but after reading your Rick Bayless cookbook I realized that it would be fairly easy to make my own achiote paste, as long as I can find somewhat fresh annatto seeds. I will definitely try that next time, because I think that's why the flavors at Coox Hanal had way more depth.

Mexico City at night, like so many colonial Latin American cities, is particularly beautiful at night. The grey stone of the buildings and monuments gleams golden around you, and when mariachi bands in tight spangled uniforms walk around asking if you want a serenade, it actually feels like magic. It's not a quiet, romantic magic at the Plaza Garibaldi, where every taxi seems to be unloading yet another mariachi band with even more elaborate costumes. It's the kind of magic that's buoyed by the loud cantinas around the plaza, the men hawking stacks of sombreros twice as tall as themselves, the laughing Mexican and non-Mexican tourists carrying Giant Gulp cups of booze. I saw a teenage girl being bullied by her mother and aunt into standing in the middle of a serenading band, with a sombrero plunked on her head; I saw a woman holding a bouquet of roses and a mylar balloon with tears in her eyes as her personal mariachi band sang to her under her husband's instructions. We found the same kind of magical, uncomplicated happiness at Xochimilco two days later, as we floated down the river in a painted barge. Mexico City used to be next to these enormous lakes, now drained. Because there wasn't enough land to grow food, the Xochimilca people planted arificial islands rooted by trees in the lakes, creating a system of canals. Xochimilco means \"garden of flowers\" in the Aztec language, and is the only part of the city that remains to remind us of the canals that existed before the Spanish came. It was a sunny day as bright as our boat. Erin and I ended up rolling around in our enormous boat alone, except for 60-year-old Miguel \"de los manos,\" our punter who suggested that we take photos with him so that he could strenuously pinch us. But nearly every other boat we saw was filled with Mexican families celebrating, dancing or feasting or chasing each other around. We said hello to everyone, everyone said hello to us. Smaller boats drifted by offering cold beers, grilled corn, whole meals with rice and beans, plastic toys, and of course, mariachi and marimba music. For 70 pesos, a boat full of mariachi musicians pulled up to our boat, attached theirs to ours somehow, and then launched into full song. They barely knew the words or tune to \"Como fue,\" but it was one of those days where nothing could go wrong.How happy I was, to be drinking beer on a barge in Xochimilco. How lucky I was, to eat posole and spicy, warm birria, or goat stew, next to the Plaza Garibaldi.

It's our last day in Puerto Escondido. Erin has already left for the airport, and Elena and I are spending the 5 hours before our bus in the most profitable way--doing nothing on the rooftop terrace of our hotel. Elena is in a hammock reading, or maybe even napping, and I'm sitting with my laptop facing the bluest ocean imaginable. It's almost too mean to say out loud to my friends, who are going back to lawyer jobs in San Francisco, but I've been on a vacation from my vacation.In this blissed-out town, I haven't been doing my usual nosing around for superb food, and perhaps for my Zen acceptance of life, I've been rewarded with some of the most memorable food adventures I've had so far.Playa Carrizalillo is the best kind of surprise. It's a bit further west than Playa Zicatela, with its wide expanse of glassy waves that look like the purest and cleanest of blue-green Japanese ceramics as they break. Carrizalillo is not as obvious, if only because you have to descend a long flight of stairs to get there. The steps are solidly constructed and pretty, with flowers and suitably tropical plants at every angled turn, but the best part is only a few turns from the top, when you immediately see before you the perfect, deep blue, baby bay. Little thatched palapas and restaurants line the beach, selling beer and shrimp cocktails. The restaurants aren't particularly noteworthy, though I'm impressed they don't mark up the beer more, and there are fewer vendors who come by, probably because of the steep steps. There is, however, a leathery, old man selling mystery mollusks that were tender, almost buttery, and salty from the bucket he just caught them in. He called the bivalves \"callos de margarita,\" which after some Google research, Erin and I have decided they are some type of scallop. The conches he called \"caracoles,\" which I thought meant \"snails\" in Spanish. The callos had a pebbly, almost spiny outer surface, and a deep purple ring around the pearly interior. He husked them right on the rocks, rinsed them in the murky seawater in his bucket, sliced them thinly and expertly, and served them back in their shells, with a fresh squeeze of lime and some hot sauce available, though it turned out for us to be superfluous. It was better to eat add just a bit of lime and taste the sweetness of the meat.In classic Mexican fashion, he didn't assume that Erin and I, who were standing over him almost panting with eagerness, wanted to buy a mollusk or two. We were finally moved to explicit action when another woman started negotiating a price for all the mollusks he had left. The fact that I might never taste a \"callo de margarita\" again is okay. It seems so fortuitous, so blessed, that we got to taste them at all.We even had more nieve de coco, this one purer and cleaner, the more innocent version compared to the more sophisticated salty-sweet coconut ice cream we'd had on Playa Marinero. I am glad I don't have to judge which was better.We had thought nothing could top Playa Carrizalillo, but two days later, we went to Mazunte. About an hour east of Puerto Escondido, Mazunte is a small town that seems to take the overflow from the hippies and nudists in Zipolite. The whole town consists of four or five streets in a loose grid, only two or three of them paved. It's not much of a surfer town, and it feels even more laid-back than Puerto Escondido, which I hadn't known was possible.We stayed all day on a little semicircle of a beach that had no umbrellas, no lounge chairs, only a lovingly ramshackle beach hut selling sandwiches, juices and tropical cocktails. We had brought a light picnic lunch with us, based on the tostadas de corozo I had gotten obsessed with after our lagoon guide, Lalo, told us about them. They were flatter and darker, a little thicker, and not ripply like your usual tostada of corn. When I tasted them, I knew immediately they were worth the long, hot walk to the market in town and dealing with the surly woman who sold them to me. They were just sweet enough, rich with the milk of coconuts, but completely dry and non-greasy. Topped with ripe avocados, fresh lime juice, and criollo tomatoes, crinkly like heirlooms, they whet our appetites for more.It was so easy to walk just a few feet backwards to Babel, the little drink hut, run by a group of young, attractive South Americans, who were so at ease with their good fortune. The entire area was little more than 15 by 15 feet, with a few chairs, two hammocks, and an astonishing view of the ocean. Their mix tape was clearly a beloved one, as we heard the same Bob Marley song twice. We put our feet up and drank big, soda fountain glasses of \"cucu melon,\" 1 for 35 pesos, 2 for 50, which were made of freshly squeezed honeydew, a bit of mezcal, crema de coco, sugar, and crushed ice. So simple and so good. I kept thinking about it for the rest of the day, absentmindedly murmuring, \"Wouldn't that be a good drink for a summer dinner party?\" I know it would console me back in Brooklyn, when I finally have to go back home.

You're welcome! It's nice for me to remember it, too, back in NY.

Mexico City, in some ways, reminds me of other big cities I know, New York, Seoul, Los Angeles, and yet is unlike them in so many other ways. At 20 million people, it makes New York feel airy. Walking through the Centro Historico was like Times Square times 10, except with graceful old buildings, relatively few tourists, and no flashing lights. You could, however, still buy pornographic DVDs right on the street, next to hair barrettes and tracksuits. And it has the energy of New York, the feeling that anything could happen, and people outside Mexico City talk about \"D.F.\" or the \"Distrito Federal\" the way people outside New York talk about NY: \"It's another world.\" The inhabitants of Mexico City can't imagine living anywhere else, while Mexicans elsewhere can't understand how anyone can live there.But the biggest difference between Mexico City and New York City, at least to this tourist who was in Mexico City for 4 days, is that New York is a city of people ignoring each other, while everyone in Mexico City is trying to get your attention. People are constantly trying to sell you something, with more vigor than your most vigorous Senegalese seller of fake Rolexes in Chinatown. After living in relative obscurity for a month and a half in Oaxaca City, I was shocked to find how Erin and I were subjected to constant catcalls and whistles, including one man, who said in English with much careful deliberation, and in an accent eerily remniscent of Arnold Schwarzenegger, \"Wow-oo, you are so bee-you-ti-fool!\" I have to admit, I was proud of myself the next day for understanding the declaration shouted at me in Spanish from a man who had been driving his van at our walking pace in Condesa: \"I was just looking at your beautiful legs!\" He had such a genial smile, I shouted back, \"iGracias!\" Sadly, the only men who ever compliment me are men in the street and tollbooth operators, but I'll take my compliments where I can get them. I am also now aware exactly how short my red dress is.Our first morning in Mexico City was also otherwise overwhelming. I had arrived at 7 am on Friday morning, after an overnight bus ride from Oaxaca, and found Erin almost bouncing off the hotel bed in her excitement to try some of the restaurants she had highlighted on her map. An hour later, we were wandering around La Merced, one of the largest markets in Mexico and possibly the world. And the Cathedral in the Zocalo is the largest cathedral in the world, right next to Templo Mayor, an archeological site some electricians found right smack in the middle of the city. And of course, there are Diego Rivera murals all over the city, all bigger than life, and most spectacularly in the Palacio Nacional.You can't throw a stone without hitting something with Frida Kahlo or Diego Rivera on it in Mexico City. Either they are truly are as emblematic of Mexico as foreigners think they are, or Mexico City has responded to tourist demand with a complete, almost-innocent enthusiasm. I don't find the work of either artist particularly moving, but in Diego Rivera's large murals, the triteness I sometimes see in his work gets absorbed into a larger earnestness that appeals to me and my fatigue with NY-cool. And I did love the kitchen in Frida Kahlo's Casa Azul, with its large, glossy pottery and bright colors inexplicably balancing each other. Her home made Leon Trotsky's poor little fortification, just blocks from hers, feel even more austere and Soviet.Thankfully, for all the marching we did around Mexico City that first day, we had had a substantial breakfast of caldo de gallo, or soup made from rooster stock, near La Merced. Being Korean, I think nothing of eating rice and soup for breakfast, but I was impressed by the way Erin tucked into hers. All Mexican soups are essentially the same: simple, happily dependent on the rawness of the last-minute garnishes, and restorative. Of course, nothing is restorative like caffeine, and I sucked down every drop my first <a href=http://www.gourmetsleuth.com/cafedeolla.htm \">\"café de olla. \"Olla\" means clay pot, and a \"café de olla\" is made and served traditionally in a little clay pot and sweetened with cinnamon and piloncillo, a Mexican unrefined brown sugar. Strong and sweet, it gave me the strength to enjoy everything Mexico City could throw at me.

I believe God or the fates have impressed upon me the great responsibility of declaring and describing with exactitude how riquíssima are the empanadas and tacos in one corner of Oaxaca City.Lina had told me about this little stand of empanadas and tacos near the church on Garcia Vigil. \"You'll know it because of all the cars double-parked around it every morning.\" But it took me over a month to finally get there. The fateful day was Thursday, July 12th, the day after my cooking class at Seasons of My Heart. After my enormous day of eating, I had gone to my Spanish teacher's apartment to watch the Mexico-Argentina Copa America game with her. I was already so full, but Lety had prepared all this food, and when I woke up the next day, I felt the food equivalent to a hangover. I didn't even want to get out of bed, but I realized I had to call my mother before I got on the bus to Mexico City that night, and I dragged myself out with the intention of going to an Internet place with Skype and having a light breakfast of fruit at a wireless café. But my usual Skype place was closed, and I had to trudge my way to the other one on Garcia Vigil. As expected, the connection was painfully slow, and I barely managed to communicate to my mother that I was alive and well. I left frustrated and tired, but then, there it was, the famous food stand outside of Iglesia Carmen de Arriba. I wasn't expecting much. I knew the empanadas de amarillo were famous here, but I had tried mole amarillo at Patty's and not liked it much. But when I took a bite into this empanada, what we would probably call a quesadilla, I swear the heavens opened and angels sang. It was so toasty, just off the comal, and hot enough to satisfy the most scaredy-cat street food eater, but so good I had to ignore the burning of my tongue. The amarillo sauce was enlightening, the perfect example of the maxim my friend Mimi and I firmly believe, \"If you don't like a food, you just haven't tried a good version.\" Spicy, saucy, assertive, thinner than the sauce Patty had made, and a perfect complement to the shredded chicken. Mexicans know how to cook chicken breast. Every once in awhile, I'd find a bite of bright cilantro. Oh God, it was so good.I took a bunch of pictures of the church around it, so that any of you, should you find yourself in Oaxaca, will be able to find it. I particularly love this picture of their grill, with the fat sausages roasting underneath the comal.Like every other empanada and taco stand I've seen, they make their tortilla base right there. There's a big mass of masa, with a giant press for making the giant tortillas. The tortillas, either for empanadas or tacos, are first cooked separately on the grill. When they have the telltale dark spots showing that they are crispy and ready, they're filled with amarillo and chicken, or squash blossoms and string cheese and folded over to become empanadas, or they're rolled up with various meaty fillings and salsa.I hadn't even been hungry, but the empanada just whet my appetite for more. I considered my options and finally chose a taco wrapped around a chile relleno and had my second revelation. And to think I didn't like chiles rellenos! The chile relleno was small and skinny and packed with ground meat, and so juicy and flavorful I was sad when there was no taco left, but there was no one to blame but myself. So once again, the stand is tucked next to the gates of Iglesia de Carmen Arriba that are facing the street of Garcia Vigil, near the corner of Carranza, south of Quetzalcoatl. There are other street vendors nearby, selling fruit or some such, but only one stand selling empanadas and tacos, unless of course, it's Lunes del Cerro, but that's another blog post.
