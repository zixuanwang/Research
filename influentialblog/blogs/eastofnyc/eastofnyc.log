In Port Jefferson, a new restaurant has sprouted up and is ready and eager to help you enjoy that fantastic setting. The Catch [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2925], a new venture from Eric Miller, the same owner of Cavo [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1806] in Astoria, Queens is offering great seafood dishes, waterfront dining as well as Clam Bakes on the beach. We can't think of a better way to spend an evening or the entire summer. Review to follow. 631-64CATCH

The brainchild of Danny Wu, a technology expert-turned restaurateur, this shining star has been open for about a year now and seems poised to take charge in this ever-expanding and slightly bloated market.

Cosi in Great Neck: Friday Night Flatbread Pizza Night

I just came back from a casual dinner at Cosi [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=cosi&section=eat] in Great Neck, one of my favorite mass produced sandwich shops around. I used to go to Cosi all of the time in the city when I lived there and was happy when they opened in Great Neck and then in Plainview out here. I saw on the window a special that on Friday nights after 5pm you can order one flatbread pizza and you get the second one for free. Here's the catch though; you have to mention it at the time of your order or you don't get it. I happened to notice it only when I was being served my pizza and they told me that the conditions are set, and I'd have to return another time for my run at a free pizza. I should've told them that they could keep their pizza and that I'd head on over to Kentucky Fried Chicken [http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahshow/20090430-tows-kfc-coupon-download] instead.

What better way to spend this time than at The Breakers [http://www.thebreakers.com] in Palm Beach, Florida [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_beach,_fl]. Known as one of the magnificent hotels in the country, The Breakers is as lavish as it is relaxing and the grounds, accommodations and on-site dining set the standard for vacation stays today (and in years past). [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f883301157039707d970b-150wi] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f883301157039707d970b-popup]One of the few privately owned hotel resorts in the world (the descendants of the original builder still own the property), The Breakers is set on 140 acres of prime waterfront property. With a beach to rival any other resort that comes to mind, The Breakers is a destination unto itself. Originally conceived as a stop along the Florida East Coast Railway way back in 1896, this self-contained property is so well thought out and appointed that once you arrive, you won't have to ever leave until check out. Two previous hotels that stood on this property both burned down in the early 1900's and what we see now on this spot is the latest incarnation (and hopefully the final) that was rebuilt in mere months in 1926.

Open for the better part of the last three months, Mumon is a bright star in the local asian cuisine arena on the island. Owned by a distributor of seafood up and down the east coast, it seems a likely fit and an assurance that Mumon will receive the finest seafood available on a continual basis. Our visit was early on a Friday night, around 6pm. Because it was so early the restaurant was mostly empty with a few tables scattered throughout with small parties. The dark bar/lounge area in the front of the restaurant was mostly vacant as well. The design of the restaurant is glamorous, with reds and dark woods strewn throughout. You certainly feel as though you are in the middle of a elegantly designed asian restaurant and many of the interior spaces feel very private as a result of the different wood dividers and hidden spaces.

When our friend sought out a local spot to hit up for her birthday dinner with a few select friends, she hit the nail on the head in picking Besito in Roslyn [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2701]. The second Besito on the island (the original [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=274] is located in the village of Huntington [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=huntington&section=eat]) and one of the restaurants owned by local restauranteur John Tunney (also the owner of Honu [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=296] and America Roadside Burgers [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=american+roadside&section=eat]) this restaurant achieves the sophistication of the palate and of the design that you would expect from this powerhouse owner. Located on the North Shore and in a shopping center with Kotobuki [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2918], a high-end Japanese restaurant, the crowd is as high-end as the food and drink offered. The Tequila list is as long as the menu and is the hallmark of the restaurant/bar. Margaritas, specialty drinks and great cervezas round out the full bar menu as well. Since we were early, we hopped up to the bar and sampled the drinks of the house. We ordered the frozen Pomegranate Margarita; served from a frozen machine and also ordered the red wine Sangria while we awaited the other 7 people in our party. The bar is long with soft pendant lighting above. The bar area is in the front of the restaurant and since the weather was warm on this Saturday night, the front doors were open to patio seating and we were greeted to a warm breeze off of the exterior. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f88330115703985d2970b-150wi] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f88330115703985d2970b-popup] Once we were all assembled and ready to be sat we all huddled together at the front desk (they won't seat you until the full party is within eye-shot of the hostess) we weaved our way to the back of the restaurant where they had set us up with a table for 10 in a quiet nook. To our left was a huge wall made up of what must have been more than 60 votive candles providing us with soft light. The atmosphere was very earthy with the ceiling made up of individual tree limbs (or something that resembled it) and light colors transporting us to a local village in Mexico. Baskets of tortilla chips and bowls of salsa were generously placed on our table before we ordered. The salsa was fresh with a nice bite to it. Even though it was popular, the salsa was tossed to the side and largely ignored once the guacamole was placed. We ordered two bowls of guacamole, each expertly prepared table-side by a waiter and custom tailored to our tastes. We ordered one bowl mild with cilantro and a medium bowl without cilantro to appease all of the different tastes at the table. Since there were 10 of us, I won't go into detail about what everyone ordered, but will share with you the two dishes that my wife and I chose. I chose the Bistec con Mole Chatino,a grilled New York Strip Steak topped with chayote squash, queso fresco. My wife ordered the Salmon Manchamanteles,a roasted wild salmon with crispy bananas, pineapple pico de gallo and mole manchamanteles. My steak was perfectly seasoned, well cooked and was on par with any steakhouse where I have eaten. The salmon was as fresh as could be, full of flavor, light and tasty all around. The crunchy banana was a nice juxtaposition on the softer salmon and aided in the textural enjoyment of the meal. After dinner Churrizos (fried dough with sugar)were dropped on our table fresh out of the fryer and in a paper bag. Similar to the chocolate cookies that are served at the sister restaurant Honu these were a great end to a long dinner and left us satisfied, yet not entirely full. Verdict: This isn't your mother's Mexican restaurant, and we're glad that it's not. With two locations to choose from on the island, we look forward to more Tequila, enchiladas and flavors that we have yet to experience. * All costs associated with this dinner were paid for by East of NYC

This post is from our sister-site, Eating Long Island [http://www.eatinglongisland.com]. I know plenty of people who either live in Great Neck [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11021&=Search&section=eat] or near this quaint little village on the north shore. Countless times I've heard them speak of Naru Sushi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2782] and the great sushi that they have. It took about three years of listening to finally try it. Thank goodness I did. Out to dinner with my dad, we took it upon ourselves to branch out from our familiar Great Neck haunts and try Naru, which is located on Cutter Mill Rd. just opposite the Inn at Great Neck [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=sleep&id=55]. It was rainy and cold, even for April's standards so we exited the car and ran inside. We entered the restaurant and were the only two people in the small establishment. We looked at each other cautiously and decided to still go for it, seeing that even though there wasn't anyone dining in, the sushi chefs were furiously making rolls to be sent out into the rainy night. Great Neck is such a small town that most of their business is from take-out and delivery so we we really had no worries. An interesting aspect of this restaurant is that their sushi is available in white, brown or black rice varieties. I went for the usual white rice but as soon as I got home later that night my wife yelled at me for not having the black rice, which is her favorite from when she went to Naru. There's always next time. The sushi was great. I ordered a Princess Roll which consisted of spicy tuna on the inside with tuna and avocado on the outside (topped with tobiko and scallions as well). I also ordered a shrimp tempura roll which was warm and crunchy at the same time while the eel sauce on top brought a great sweetness. My dad, who has no need to venture into the sushi world past cooked shrimp and crab rolls decided that he would instead opt for a dinner Bento Box which housed chicken terriyaki, shrimp and vegetable tempuras, fried dumplings, a california roll and rice. I was surely impressed by the freshness of the sushi and the sheer variety of special rolls that were offered. Verdict: I'll visit again, and this time, I won't wait 3 more years to return. 516-504-4462 Naru Sushi 25-5 Cutter Mill Rd.

By Sam Jacobs [http://www.eatingbrooklyn.com], Brooklyn Correspondent Hey all. It has been quite a while since I've last posted on East of NYC. I've been concentrating most of my efforts on Eatingbrooklyn.com [http://www.eatingbrooklyn.com], Crabapple [http://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com], and the creation of a new online literary journal with a friend of mine based on the Parapluie: Creative Series she's been running over the last two months. However, this has not stopped me from eating in Brooklyn, and other points East of NYC. Just today, I posted a recount of a meal I had while in London, UK at a restaurant called St. John. You may recognize this from the episode of Anthony Bourdain: No Reservationswhen he was in England & Scotland. It was truly one of the best meals I've ever eaten. You can read my review and view my photos by clicking here [http://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com/2009/03/27/food-the-bestest-meal-ever/#more-829]. I promise that as the weather warms and the economy allows me to travel east to eat, etc I will post more. But for now, please enjoy. ~Sam

But I'm not going for the hibachi at this meal, I want to experience the great lunch special. In what I could only describe as one of the largest lunch specials that I have ever had, Benihana in Westbury [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=271] had me almost waddling out of the door. I sat down in the sushi-bar area and ordered the Chicken Teriyaki lunch boat. First to arrive were my salad and soup. Then came the real food. A wooden boat sailed into my table and on it had a real variety of treasures. The chicken was there is one corner while edamame, salmon and tuna (sushi) sat in the other. Also on the boat was shrimp and vegetable tempura and rice. In this location (there's another in Manhasset [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=270] with a larger sushi area) the sushi-bar is in the front of the restaurant, and although small, it is just right to have a great experience. The sushi chefs will often send over a small crabmeat salad that has cucumber, red pepper and fish eggs while you are waiting for your meal, so that is a great perk. 516-222-6091

When The Mixing Bowl closed in Bellmore a few months back, the building that housed it sat vacant along Merrick Rd. as it was begging for someone with a vision to come in and return it to its former glory. Paint is being applied, signs are up and the area is buzzing that Greek Delight will be arriving soon. If you'll remember, Mixing Bowl was featured on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares. Along with their television spot, they got a revamped interior design. I'm interested to see if they keep it or go in their own direction. More details to follow.

Our local partner LENNDEVOURS [http://www.lenndevours.com] is in the running for being one of the wine-bloggers of the year. This post originally appeared on LENNDEVOURS. \"It's that time of year again in the wine blogosphere. Yes, the American Wine Blog Awards [http://fermentation.typepad.com/fermentation/2009/02/2009-american-wine-blog-award-finalists.html]are back and this year I'm honored to learn that LENNDEVOURS has been named a finalist in 2 of the 7 categories, \"Best Single-Subject Wine Blog\" and \"Best Overall Wine Blog.\" Some of my favorite blogs have also made the final round, so congratulations to those bloggers as well. As I said, it's an honor just to be nominated (not that I'd mind winning mind you) not only because it is great to be recognized by peers and wine blog readers, but also because it truly shows the power that wine blogs can have. To have a wine blog that focuses on New York wines be named a double finalist really shows how blogs can help level the playing field for lesser-known regions. Personally, I'm proud that a blogger like me -- someone not from California (the enter of the U.S. wine world) and someone with a day job outside of the wine world -- has apparently earned a place alongside people who write about for a living. That's the power of blogs afterall, isn't it? Citizen journalism and all that. I would also be remiss if I didn't give much of the credit for this blog's success to Nena, who has supported me and pushed me to post more and better throughout the years. And, in the last year or so, I've been able to bring several great writers on board to help bring new voices and perspectives to the blog. So, if you enjoy what read here on LENNDEVOURS, I'd encourage you to vote for us [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=cbDBdGxl4wEkLiL2r1FyOQ_3d_3d]. Voting ends at the end of the day on March 4. Vote today. [http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.aspx?sm=cbDBdGxl4wEkLiL2r1FyOQ_3d_3d]\"

Zim Zari [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2913] has washed ashore with a big splash in Massapequa. A sister-restaurant to Mercado a few stores down, this California themed restaurant (complete with surf-board menus, palm trees painted on the wall and free-living lifestyle pictures all over) will have you chowing down on fajitas, salads, tacos and margheritas. We chose the Wa-Ha-Ka Tuna Tacos and the Chipotle BarBQ Chicken salad for our lunchtime meal. They were full of flavor with minimal cost to our wallet; a perfect combination. Keep this joint in mind when you need to let loose and enjoy a peaceful, zen-like moment or two. 516-809-6960 Click here [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/MassapequaZimZarimenu.pdf] to view their menu.

Kid Stuff for Less!

By Dina Shingleton, Suffolk County Correspondent If you have children, you know they grow out of clothing and toys at light-warp speed! Aside from having to purchase fresh wardrobes for every season, there's also the matter of storage! What to do with the clothing that no longer fits and the toys that no longer grab attention? Kid Stuff for Less in Lindenhurst solves both dilemmas. Kid Stuff accepts gently used children's clothing, shoes, toys, and furniture for resale in the store. They retail these goods for a fraction of what they would normally cost at retail. During a recent trip, I was able to unload some of my daughter's summer clothing from last year. While waiting for the clothing I brought in to be evaluated (Kid Stuff won't take anything stained, color faded, or harshly worn) I took a look around and was surprised at some of the high-quality clothing I saw on the racks, much of it new with tags! Even the brand-new merchandise if offered at excellent prices- a great money-saving resource when having to stock up on a whole season's worth of clothing for your little one! I purchased two adorable sun dresses by high-end brand Tea Collection for $8.50 each (they original retail for $27)! Before blowing your budget on summer wear, try Kid Stuff for Less- they might have exactly what you're looking for! 290 N.

Although pricier than your typical kids store, these are the stores to see and be seen in as many well-heeled residents often visit with their children in tow. Even Jennifer Lopez has been known to visit some of the more well-known stores in the center. Today we'll be letting you into two different stores that we had the pleasure of going to today: Tutti Bambini and Funky Monkey. Tutti Bambini (pictured above) is a kids clothing store that originated on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. With a store on 77th and 1st, they're known for their trendy selections and expensive wares for both boys and girls. Ed Hardy, for example, was one designer on hand in little sizes. Dresses, onesies, sweaters, hoodies and more are all available. At this time of year there are sales of up to 70% off and you can find great deals for next year's use (or even beyond). The shop itself is very kid-friendly with a flat-screen mounted on the wall with Dora the Explorer as well as a big toy for toddlers to play with on the floor. My 15-month old was very occupied while my wife was exploring every item of clothing available. 516-621-1490 Three stores down from Tutti Bambini is Funky Monkey [http://funkymonkey.meitech.com/display/3996/0/]. A dedicated toy and book store for kids, there are some great toys that you might not be able to find somewhere else. Although we've seen some ofthe more well-known toys available for cheaper at some of the big-chain stores, this is still a great place to come for gifts for your child or someone else's. Toys start from birth and go all the way to the teen years. 516-484-0966

This post originally appeared on our sister-site Eating Long Island [http://www.eatinglongisland.com]. Where's the recession? If there's a recession then Ciao Baby [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=ciao+baby&section=eat] in Commack missed the memo. At 6:45pm on a Saturday night this location was hopping and a line was formed along the wall. This surge in clientele could have a few reasons. First, Ciao Baby has been well known on the island for many years for their larger than life portions, trendy décor and pretty reasonable prices. Next, Ciao Baby has carried over their prix-fixe menu from Restaurant Week [http://www.longislandrestaurantweek.com]. For $24.99 per person you get an appetizer, entrée and dessert. The prix-fixe runs all day 6 days per week and until 7pm on Saturday nights. Depending on the location that you visit, the decor differs slightly. We've been to their locations in Carle Place and Commack and they share one central motif; Sopranos posters and various other Italian memorabilia. This Commack location is smaller than their counterpart in Nassau County, but is equal in service and style. The waitstaff will wait on you in teams and there is never someone out of your reach should you need anything. Sometimes it can feel too crowded though with staff and be warned that if you sit in the bar area as we did, you are bound to have them hanging out behind you. There were times when I felt as though I was involved in their conversations. For our meal, we chose the prix-fixe option rather than ordering off of the regular menu. In terms of value, this is certainly the way to go. Had my wife and I both ordered an appetizer, entree and dessert we might have been paying as much as 50% more for the same meal. For our appetizer we devoured the Fried Calamari (voted best calamari on the island for the past three years by another unnamed local publication). It was a heaping portion served with two sauces; a Fra Diablo and a marinara. For entrees we chose the Ricotta-stuffed Rigatoni as well as the Chicken Scarpariello, which was served with spiced sausage, potatoes and peppers. In the picture below you'll find what was left after we ate until we were stuffed. We had no complaints on any of the servings in our meal with the exception that we wished there was more chicken in the chicken dish. While dessert is a favorite pastime of mine, we were just too stuffed and needed to get those to go. Since we were a party of two, we were entitled to take two desserts with us, which we happily agreed to. Maybe we'll have more on that later...631-543-1400 204 E. Jericho Tpke.

This closure saddens us for the fact that when we moved to Long Island this was one of the first coffee shops that we would spend a lot of time in. We had the opportunity to mix it up with the owners and play board games, trivia games and also the occassional poker game. We'll need to find ourselves a new place to order up a latte with the friendliness that they offerred.

I was there this past Thursday March 12th 2009. All I can say is that the entire staff was not trained correctly and is poorly train and do not know what they are doing. Also they did not have enough glasses so 2 of the bartenders, male and female were taking used glases off the counter and reusing them without washing them. All thy would do was take them from one customer when the glas was empty and put ice and liquor and hand them to another customer. The health inspector should go there and close the place down. It is disgusting!!!

It will take place on Tuesday, February 10th from 6-8 PM at Farmingdale State College’s Roosevelt Hall. The event, which is being sponsored by Moderne Communications, is an opportunity once again for local advertising agencies and in-house corporate marketing executives to start developing the next generation of creative talent by offering paid internships to Long Island college juniors and seniors majoring in Advertising, Graphic Design, Marketing, Market Research, Communications, Broadcast, Public Relations and Journalism. The best part about this win-win program is that the students almost always gain a permanent position from their internships, while the agencies and businesses gain access to some of the region’s best and brightest young talent. Austin & Williams Executive Vice President and Chief Creative Officer Rick Chiorando, a LIAC Board Member and among the creators of ICAP, noted that even in the current economy, Long Island still faces a serious brain drain. “The cost of living on Long Island and limited affordable housing continues to cause our college graduates to leave the region in search of a more affordable lifestyle,” said Chiorando. “The statistics show, however, that 80% of graduates who start working right away on Long Island, stay on Long Island. And, 75% of all interns are invited to stay on as paid employees. The ICAP program capitalizes on this data.” These findings were confirmed by Austin & Williams Graphic Designer Andrea Regruto, who gained permanent position following her summer internship at Austin & Williams. She had secured internship at the first ICAP event, and began working right after graduating from Farmingdale State College with a Bachelor of Technology in Visual Communications. “All of the career fairs I saw advertised were for other professions such as accounting or nursing, and many of the internship ads were for positions in Manhattan,” said Regruto. “The ICAP event was specifically targeted for students in the creative fields and the positions were with agencies right here on Long Island. Working locally is not only convenient, but I have been exposed to some great people and clients, and have the opportunity to work on some really good campaigns. The experience is definitely an incentive to remain on Long Island.” Chiorando noted raising awareness of Long Island agencies was another reason why LIAC initiated and is continuing ICAP. “In our (advertising) industry, there still remains the lure of Madison Avenue where some of the world’s largest agencies exist,” said Chiorando. “While the primary goal of ICAP is to help mitigate the brain drain and create employment relationships for students and companies, a secondary goal is raise the awareness of Generation Xs and Ys as to the high caliber of advertising agencies this side of the Hudson. Long Island advertising agencies routinely win accounts from Madison Avenue agencies and are the recipients of some of the industry’s most prestigious awards.” ICAP is open to all Long Island agencies and business marketing departments and all juniors and seniors majoring in one of the advertising or marketing disciplines. Students are encouraged to bring their resumes and portfolios for review by agency and marketing executives. Regruto had some additional words for students hoping to land an internship. “The more prepared you are for the ICAP event, the greater the chance of getting offers for internships,” she said. “At ICAP, I had many ad agency representatives and marketing executives from other businesses stop by and flip through my portfolio. Many even took the time to offer advice on how to organize my portfolio and enhance it in order to better showcase my skills. It was really good advice.” For more information and to register to attend or offer an internship, visit: www.liac-icap.org [http://www.liac-icap.org] or call: 516-944-0100.

We can't think of anywhere better than to do so out in East Hampton [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=east+hampton&=Search&section=eat] at Matto [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2907]. Now open Thurs - Sunday nights, dinner in winter has never looked so good. From 5pm until close you'll be treated to a three-course prix-fixe menu of $26 per person. Three days a week may not seem like a lot, but to East Enders who miss their favorite restaurants off-season, this is certainly welcome news. 631-329-0200

While everyone at home was hunkering down and hanging by the fireplace due to the coldest temperatures of the season, we were headed to Key West, Florida for sunshine, relaxation and plenty of sight-seeing. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536ce5d52970c-150wi] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536ce5d52970c-popup] Leaving form Boca Raton where we have family, we arrived roughly 5 hours after setting sail by car into the lovely Key West. The drive was great; scenic as we drove over miles-long bridges and through every Key until we came to the end, mile 0. The water was shallow, blue and everywhere as far as the eye could see. For accommodations we stayed at the Key West Marriott Beachside Hotel [http://www.beachsidekeywest.com], which at the time of our booking was owned by another hotel group. The Marriott itself was an amazing hotel (and had free parking). Located at the east end of Key West, it was off the beaten path from downtown and where all of the touristy action is and quiet enough that we enjoyed the sanctuary that it offered (to view our flickr set on the hotel click here [http://flickr.com/photos/10306745@N00/sets/72157612452460676/]). The private beach had two hammocks and a few chairs spread throughout the sand. The buildings formed a courtyard that had the pool, hot-tub and beach, very similar to the hotel that we stayed at during our Road Trip Series to Anguilla [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/2008/06/road-trip-serie.html] over the summer. We even jumped into the outdoor hot-tub late at night to relax and wind down after our long travel day (it is open 24 hours so long as you are not rowdy). With our one-bedroom suite (full kitchen with a Sub-Zero fridge and all!) and its own private beach and pool area, we didn't have to leave the hotel. If we didn't leave then we drove four hours to relax in a nice hotel room, so we mustered up the motivation to get out there and explore. The hotel had its own restaurant, Tavern in Town, where we had the breakfast buffet on day 2 of our visit. The restaurant turns into a great Tavern and restaurant at night and is a great service to the residents of the area as well as visiting tourists. To get to the action we took the free shuttle that was offered from the Marriott every hour and it dropped us off at the heart of Duval Street. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536c3fb4e970b-150wi] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536c3fb4e970b-popup] The first night of the trip we were looking for a great spot to have a romantic dinner and found our way to Seven Fish [http://www.7fish.com] (Eating South Florida [http://eatingsouthflorida.com]'s write-up can be found here [http://eatingsouthflorida.com/2009/01/13/seven-fish-in-key-west/]) located a few blocks off of Duval Street, the main tourist strip of Key West. An acclaimed restaurant that has been open since 2000, we were lucky to find a table in the small space without a reservation. While we were dining we saw many parties turned away because the restaurant was so small and the establishment so popular. Located in a single story structure, the restaurant was minimalist in decor and the lighting was very low and romantic. Waitresses buzzed about the dining room tending to the occupied tables with specials and fresh catches of the day. We took them up on their appetizer; a spicy tuna sushi roll. It was incredibly fresh, spicy and tasty. It certainly went quick. Other restaurants that we ate in were Fogarty's on Duval and 915 on Whitehead Street (named after one of the early founders of Key West). We wandered up and down Duval, cutting in and out of the different specialty shops, restaurants and art galleries to kill some time. We found Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville [http://www.margaritaville.com] (the original restaurant and shop that opened up in 1985) to be one of our favorites and we bought some cheesy memorabilia there, to always remember the occasion. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536c4b43a970b-150wi] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536c4b43a970b-popup] Key West is a great area and is also the Southernmost point of the United States (well, not officially the lowest point, but it is the lowest public point). The Naval base on the island as well as a private Key located about 9 miles away are the two lowest points that you can not step onto. The buoy, which is also one of the most visited Key West attractions, is a great place to take a picture, and one of the things that you can tell everyone you know that you experienced. People were swimming in the waters just off the tip and enjoying the sunshine. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536ce5bfa970c-150wi] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.a/6a00e5508e739f8833010536ce5bfa970c-popup] Located a ten-minute walk from the Southern point is the Ernest Hemingway Home and Museum. Hemingway lived in Key West for about 7 years is the 1930's with one of his many wives. In this time, he wrote approximately 70% of his lifetime's work in the small studio over the converted garage and the house is kept the way that it was when his ex-wife vacated the property. We took a great tour with a knowledgeable tour guide who kept us entertained and had us learn all at the same time. At one-acre, it is currently the largest private residential property on the island today. Another fun fact about the house is that it is located just near the lighthouse (which is located on the 2nd highest point of the island) and local legend has it that Hemingway chose this spot so that he could always find his way home after a drunken night at Sloppy Joe's. We also got to play with some of the 50 cats on the property, who are descendants of the cats that Hemingway kept while living there. I read a lot, but I have never read an Ernest Hemingway novel. After this tour, I can't wait to get home and tear into any one of his famed works of literature. Sunset is one of the major draws at Key West with one of the best views in the world. We stood shoulder to shoulder with dozens of other tourists at Mallory Square, darting our eyes between the street performers and beautiful sunset. There was a cruise ship that was making its way out again to sea and it was blocking the sunset for the first twenty or so minutes, but luckily they were out of port by the time the real beauty set in. Standing there in the warmth of the fading sun was one of the best experiences that we had over the entire trip. All in all, if you're a fan of the Florida weather and have a few extra days to relax and want to just have fun, relax, eat and drink, Key West is probably for you. The mood is so casual throughout the entire island that you never have to get dressed up beyond your flip flops and shorts and the most convenient mode of transportation is either bike or go-ped, both of which you can rent by the half-day or full-day. There are plenty of water-sports to keep you entertained as well, although we didn't have time to go parasailing or for a sunset cruise. There's always next time.

If you've been to Manhattan (which I'll assume that everyone reading this has), you may have had the pleasure of tasting one of the magical cupcakes from Crumbs Bake Shop [http://www.crumbsbakeshop.com]. Those who listen to the Howard Stern show may recognize them as the cupcakes that are delivered every Wednesday, and they also sell the \"Artie Lange\" cupcake for charity. That magical cream-filled goodness is set to expand out here on Long Island with new locations coming into Woodbury and Huntington (in addition to their existing location in East Hampton). Both bake shops are slated to be open by the end of January, 2009. To view their large varieties of cupcakes, click here [http://www.crumbs.com/menu/].

Moving out to Long Island, we had thought that unless we traveled back into the city we would never experience that kind of joy again.We don't have to look any further as we were treated to a variety of cupcakes recently fromCupcake Contessas [http://rs6.net/tn.jsp?t=poohxvcab.0.0.eqhmmecab.0&ts=S0368&p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cupcakecontessas.com&id=preview],based out of Huntington. Made from only the freshest ingredients available our party of six tried the Red Velvet, Carrot Cake, Samoa and Peanut Butter Cup cupcakes and were more than impressed on the level of quality. Each cupcake was soft, cream-filled and obviously made with love. If you're looking for that special something to bring to your next get-together or to liven up your office, we can recommend that you get a dozen cupcakes. Everyone will be smiling as if they are ten years old.631-549-2727

With several incoming luxury Condominiums and other developments on the way, this little village is positioning itself to become Nassau County's version of Huntington Village. The courthouse is close and the LIRR station across the street offers plenty of parking after-work and on the weekends. Situated on the corner of 2nd Street and Mineola Blvd., mo' joe [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2899] is open early for breakfast and throughout the day with a selection of breakfast sandwiches (served all day) and wonderful coffee. There's free wi-fi so you can bring your laptop and hunker down for a few hours while refilling that large cup o' joe. As you walk through the space, there are tables and sofas spread throughout to offer a comfortable place to sit. Even the bathroom is unique at mo' joe's with a video game in the large space (right next to the toilet.) From our recollection it wasn't on during our last visit. Along with the coffee available, there are sandwiches, cupcakes and more. This is exactly the kind of place that we like to go to on a regular basis to relax and concentrate on......well, not concentrating. 516-294-0714

Bedouin Tent on Atlantic Avenue is about as close as you can get to authentic middle eastern cuisine this side of the Mediterranean. The front looks like a simple pizza shop, but walk to the back dining room and you'll be transported to another time and place reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark,minus the poison dates. We started with hot mint tea with honey and a plate of some of the best stuffed grape leaves I've ever tasted. Kristina got the lamb platter, and I (looking to not eat red meat for the 4th time in a single week) got the grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken was seasoned with a blend of curry and other spices, stuffed into a hot pita dripping with yogurt mint sauce. When we'd finished our meals they served us complimentary semolina honey cake - which has the texture and density of corn bread, but the sweetness of baklava. They also offer takeout and delivery. Next time I may try it at home sitting cross legged in my living room...or maybe I'll just eat it at the table. ~Sam 405 Atlantic Ave Brooklyn, NY 11217 (718) 852-5555

We found this dining event taking place at Oysterman's Restaurant and Pub [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2191] in Sayville on the blog Triumph Gluten Free [http://blog.triumphdining.com/glutenfree/archives/gluten-free-gourmet-meal-on-long-island]. According to the post: \"Attention all celiacs! I’d like to alert you to a fabulous one-time opportunity to eat your heart out at a restaurant on Long Island. Oysterman’s Restaurant and Pub [http://www.oystermans.com/index2.html] in Sayville, NY generally serves New American cuisine and seafood. On December 9th, they are inviting gluten-free chef Joseph Felicetta to cook a six-course gluten-free gourmet meal for $75 per person. Chef Felicetta learned three years ago they had celiac disease and felt compelled to quit working at restaurants out of fear of cross-contamination. This was quite a loss to the eating community considering that he was an important chef at the former Octopus Garden in Port Washington, Fusion Grill in East Setauket, Allegro in Bay Shore, Casa Rustica in Smithtown and the Bayport House in Bayport. Here is the menu Chef Felicetta is planning:Assorted hors d’oeurves Sparkling rose N.V., Calvados, Spain Ceviche Peruviano (wild-caught Montauk striped bass and sea scallops with fresh lemon, lime and orange juices, cilantro, jalapeno and sweet peppers, with wasabi tobiko and pickled red onions) Sauvignon blanc, 2007, Casa Patronales, Chile Autumn bisque (seasonal roots and lilies, herbs and asafoetida, Blue Point oyster garni, basil oil) Bordeaux blend, 2006 organic Ranch House Red, Napa Valley Intermezzo sorbet Filet tournedo, Gorgonzola crown, pinot noir demiglace with jumbo scampi garni, LI potato galette, asparagus Polonaise Adobe Clayhouse Vineyard red, 2006, California Flourless chocolate torte, fresh whipped cream, cherries montmorency garni Deco chocolate port Run, don’t walk, to the phone and dial 631-589-7775 to make a reservation. After all, we really should support other members of the gluten-free community. It only requires a little sacrifice on your part. Enjoy!\"

By Dina Shingleton, Suffolk Correspondent Since becoming a mom, the ritual of weekly manicures seems to have taken a back seat to mommy-and-me programs. This past Saturday, I decided this didn't have to be, and walked over to Amityville's own Nails by Lois. Located in Amityville's historic Triangle Building, on the fork of Broadway (Rt 110) and Park Avenue, Nails By Lois is a true hub of activity. It's fitting, as the Triangle Building, built in 1892, was Amityville's original town hall. Every staff member is friendly and inviting, immediately wanting to know everything about you. By the end of your manicure (or pedicure) you've become a regular! I'm sure if one sits long enough, they would know all the major goings on in town! Nails by Lois offers a variety of services including eyelash extensions (I saw a woman walk out with recently finished eyelash extensions and they were stunning). Their spa manicure and pedicure menu is extensive and features a complimentary beverage (for example, the Sex in the City pedicure comes with, what else, a Cosmpolitan). Last Saturday I had a basic manicure. The paint job is superb- as of this blog, I don't have one chip and it's been almost five days! If you are in the area, it's worth paying Nails by Lois a visit. Your fingers and toes will thank you! Nails by Lois 167 Park Avenue Amityville, NY 11701 631.598.5702

In recent months we have sang the praises of Waterzooi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1251] in Garden City [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=garden+city&section=eat]; a Belgian bistro specializing in their wide varieties of beer as well as their pots of mussels. We've been here quite a few times and on one occasion we have had the pleasure of sitting down for brunch with our family in tow. Along with their choices of moules (mussels) you will also have a choice of appetizers such as Sweet Maine Lobster Bisque, Sashimi seared ahi tuna and Fondue. Entrees will range fromburgers to salmon and french toast. Waterzooi is a nice restaurant that you can take all members of your family to as well as friends. It is laid back and can get hectic at times, but Sunday brunch seems to be a bit quieter than later at night. The list of beers may seem a little overwhelming when you sit down but we encourage you to make your way through their extraordinary beer list and sample many varieties. 516-877-2177 To view their brunch menu click here [http://www.ilsny.com/mysite/viewfile.php?id=465].

The Jake Walk in Brooklyn
***AUTHOR

***DATE

***CONTENT
By Sam Jacobs, Brooklyn Correspondent There is a trend around NYC when it comes to drinking. Ten years ago, when I first started frequenting non-college bars the trend was to start with vodka, add some sort of juice, soda, olive juice, or Red Bull, drain, and repeat, look cool, vomit later. Thankfully we've started to move away from that as a society. The new trend is to bring back the old fashioned way to drink. Bar tenders have learned to make real drinks again - drinks that require more than two ingredients - drinks that have layers of flavor - drinks we sip, and sometimes enjoy with small plates of food. There are a number of new(er) bars or restaurant/bars on Smith Street (where I tend to stay) and surrounding neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Of the more notable of these along with Char No. 4, the Clover Club, and Brooklyn Social is The Jake Walk at 282 Smith Street on the corner of Sackett. I wandered in on Friday night after my delicious sushi. I was pleasantly pleased to find out that The Jake Walk is under the same oownership as my favorite neighborhood wine shop, Smith & Vine and my favorite neighborhood cheese shop Stinky. As you may have guessed, The Jake Walk serves a wide selection of wines, and has a small food menu comprised mainly of cheese plates and fondue, plus chicken pot pie, sausages, and skirt steak among other savory dishes. They also have a large selection of scotches, bourbons, and cordials. I opted for a mixed concoction called The Jakes Leg made with Rye, Sherry, Ginger Liquor, and Whiskey Barrel Bitters garnished with a large slice of lemon rind. It was ice cold, and served in a fancy little glass reminiscent of the dishes my mom used to use to make chocolate pudding. My friend Karyn drank a Champagne Julep made with sparkling wine, cognac, and mint. And speaking of chocolate pudding, we also shared one of those topped with cream, and served in a scotch glass. Normally I'd stop there, but I really feel like I should give a shout out to ownership who I've always found to be friendly and accommodating while shopping at Smith & Vine and Stinky. One of the most important things to me about living in thie neighborhood for 7 years has been the connections I've made with some of the shop and restaurant owners. It's important, especially when you write about this stuff, like I do. AND I also feel the need to point out certain points about the decor. They have these awesome, barn wood floating shelves, and a ginormous* old fashioned mirror behind the bar. I'm happy about this trend towards real cocktails, real customer service, and real comfortable environments. You can keep your vodka sodas in another borough. ~Sam *Ginormous was for you, Karyn The Jake Walk 282 Smith Street Brooklyn, NY 11231 347.599.0294 www.smithandvine.com [http://www.smithandvine.com] www.stinkybklyn.com [http://www.stinkybklyn.com]

If you have spent more than a few hours in the city, you'll know that next to Starbucks and the Gap you're likely to find a Hale & Hearty Soups. Those long lines move fast and before you know it you're out of there with your soup and your bread and enjoying the fruits of your wait. They're moving out east and hitting Long Island now, and you'll be able to find their only location on Glen Cove Rd. in Carle Place [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2895]. Daily specials are ongoing and you can find varieties such as Sloppy Joe (served over rice,) Fall Harvest Vegetable, Turkey Dinner and more. Personally, we work about 5 minutes from this location so this will be a great addition to taking away those \"missing the city\" blues. 516-535-1000

With a name such as Vintage Port [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2894], we have a sneaking suspicion that you'll be steered in the right direction at this; Long Island's newest Wine Bar. Taking over the old space that used to house Northwinds Coffee Shop, Vintage Port is aiming for customers with a sophisticated palate. On the small side, this is an intimate establishment with food on the menu to complement the wine available (don't worry, there's beer too!) Perhaps our friend Lenn Thompson [http://www.lenndevours.com] can join us over there and let everyone know how they fare against the competition out east. That's a meetup that we can look forward to. Location is brand new, so we will update with pictures and phone numbers when we obtain the information.

By Sam Jacobs, Brooklyn Correspondent My fiancee doesn't eat sushi. Yeah, I don't get it either. This is why, when she decides to have dinner with the girls, and I'm left to my own devices on a Friday night I like to call my friend Karyn who never (rarely) hesitates to say yes to sushi. Ki Sushi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2893] opened a few years ago and has been reviewed as one of the best sushi restaurants in NYC. They're not kidding. We shared a plate of steamed vegetable dumplings, and Jalapeno Yellowtail Sashimi. They were both fantastic, and the yellowtail was so fresh I knew I'd be in for a real treat when the rest of the food arrived. For our main course we split three rolls - yellowtail and scallion, which was fresh and delicious, but fairly ordinary. The TNT Lover - chopped bluefin toro, caviar, tempura flakes, scallion & asparagus, topped with tuna and served with truffle soy sauce. Again, fresh and delicious and...WOW! And third we had the signature Ki Roll which is tuna, salmon, and yellowtail topped with spicy crunch king crab, avocado, caviar, and gold leaf. Yup, real gold leaf. Why anyone would or should eat gold leaf is beyond me, but the roll tasted amazing! Ki is priced moderately, and is Zagat and Michelin reviewed, available for dine-in or take-out. 718-935-0575 ~Sam

Original Brooklyn II [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2869], a restaurant in a non-descript shopping center in North Babylon caught us by surprise. We have never been to the area, and had stopped by for a trip to the Arches Outlet Center [http://flickr.com/photos/10306745@N00/sets/72157609145950661/] in Deer Park. A small restaurant, it is broken down into two areas; a smaller counter area and a dining room separated by a half-wall. When we stopped in there were about four or five different types of pizza available on the counter. We chose a spinach pizza, chicken cutlet and a plain slice. We were all pleasantly surprised with the great taste and simple delivery of the pizza. Not too much cheese and not too doughy. In the past few months we have had a lot of pizza and this was near the top of our list. 631-242-4262

By Dina Shingleton, Suffolk County Correspondent I finally got a chance to check out bubble by jdella [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=shop&id=663] at the corner of East Main Street and Deer Park Avenue. At first, bubble appears to be a typical high-end children's boutique stocked with beautiful and unique clothing and shoes with a few pieces for mom thrown in. However, once I talked to the extremely friendly staff (seriously, one staffer actually got my ornery two-year-old to stop fussing) I realized bubble is also offers mommy/daddy & me classes too! Another mom that was shopping swore by the music class and I will definitely be checking it out with my daughter. Of course, I couldn't resist the absolutely darling sparkly gold flats for Maddie (I only wish they came in my size). They look far more luxe than the $24 they were (and they also come in silver). I'm happy I checked out bubble, and happier that the merchandise and classes they offer are different than typical big-box offerings. I'm making extra effort to do my holiday shopping at local shops, and with bubble, it will be easy to do! 631-587-0050

Who says that hotel restaurants have to be frequented only by those who reside at the hotel overnight? Some of the finest dining experiences are housed in the establishments that cater to the well funded visitors to this island. Although an extravagance, the ultimate luxury this weekend will be your visit to the Garden City Hotel's Sunday Buffet Brunch [http://www.gardencityhotel.com/dining_and_entertainment/sunday_brunch.cfm]. At $64 per person ($32 for children 12 and under,) this luxury won't come cheap. But you're worth it, aren't you? Besides the unlimited Mimosas and Bloody Mary's you'll be treated to stations full of sushi, shrimp, lobster, salads, fruit, meat and pastries. Start fasting now so that you can really get your money's worth when you arrive. And please, don't sneak lobster and shrimp out in your empty purse; that's tacky. Reservations strongly recommended. 516-877-9352 Hours: Sunday Noon-5pm

At Maxxels [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2515](526 Jericho Tpke. 516-294-3604), he’s put a pork osso buco on the menu for $25. The long-braised, cross-cut shanks are served, in the traditional Northern Italian manner, with a saffron risotto and topped with gremolata, a lemon-parsley garnish that Iannucilli enriches with some breadcrumbs. At pastaVino (149 Mineola Blvd., 516-294-1715), Iannucilli has instituted a “super-affordable” $20 two-course prix-fixe menu every night except Friday and Saturday. The menu changes daily but the first courses might well include Caesar salad, tortellini in brodo or baked clams; main courses might be rigatoni alla Norma, pumpkin ravioli, spaghetti and meatballs or lemon-rosemary chicken.\"

We've all been in the situation where we need to \"go\" and haven't the foggiest idea of where to do so. Now you can see bathrooms wherever you are, since the framework of the site is built over the Google Maps API. As time goes on, you and everyone else on the internet will be expanding the different bathrooms available, so there will soon be bathrooms all over the place that you will be aware of. As soon as we saw that you can access the site over your iPhone or Blackberry, we realized that this will be a huge success. Here's to finding a place to sit....or squat.

Waiting for a meeting tonight I wandered past a good thirty or so restaurants; looking at menus and then moving on before choosing this local Italian goodie. What made me go into Pizza Plus [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=916] was the casual atmosphere, large menu adorning the walls and the clean and bright décor, highlighted by the light woods and faux brick wall. True to its name there are plenty of options for your meal. Pizza, of course is the most popular while salads, chicken entrees and pasta dishes are also widely scattered througout the huge menu. Service is offered for those that eat in the restaurant while all delivery and carry out meals are ordered at the large counter that occupies a majority of the interior space. This was a very quick meal as we were in and out in under 20 minutes. It's a great place if you're in a rush. 718-768-5327

But you don't have the time to prepare food from scratch. This is the beauty of Dinner My Way [http://www.dinnermyway.com/locations_info.cfm?locid=350931] in Bellmore. They do all of the dirty work with food preparation and leave you with the time to enjoy your friends and family at home. We recently took the plunge to see what it's all about. Offering a set menu, you can pick up all of the pre-assembled ingredients with detailed instructions on how to prepare the meal. We chose the Chicken with Gnocchi. At home the next day, all we had to do was take the pre-packaged ingredients out of the freezer, prepare as per the instructions and 15 minutes later we had a full meal waiting for us. It was cooked to perfection and everyone in our house was more than satisfied. We'll definitely try this great service again and encourage all of our users to do the same.

By Dina Shingleton, Suffolk County Correspondent Looking for a great place to throw your toddler's birthday party? Look no further than My Gym [http://www.my-gym.com] in West Babylon. This past Saturday my daughter celebrated her 2nd birthday with 15 of her closest friends ranging in age from 1 to 6. The hour and a half party includes having the entire facility available exclusively to your party with staff. Tablecloths, napkins, balloons, forks, plates, invites, and thank you cards are also included with the price. The only thing we had to bring the day of the party was cupcakes, juice boxes, and pizza (and to make the party SUPER easy, there is a pizza place right next door.) The facility was super clean (they should open a cleaning service) and the staff was super friendly. The party was tightly run with just the right amount of activities, songs, circle time, and free play. I was amazed that the staff got 15 kids to sit around a table and eat pizza and cupcakes without incident! But the best part of the party? Going home with a happy two-year old and not having to clean up after 15 kids! My Gym also offers classes based on age. After my experience with the birthday party, I am definitely looking into enrolling my daughter because I know she'd love it! 631-669-4043

We both had our inception way back in 2006 and are both growing with leaps and bounds! During the first year of the LIRW, we were a proud sponsor and helped to get the word out to all of the Long Island residents and visitors who could partake in this great offering. LIRW really serves two purposes. It is a great way for you to try a new restaurant which might be out of your price range on a normal day and it also helps all of the restaurants where their traffic might become a little sluggish during the winter months. $24.95 will get you a 3-course meal at any of the restaurants that have joined. Saturday night, the prix fixe lasts until 7pm. Please take our advice and make your reservation as soon as you have a chance, as this is a very popular offering and tables will go fast. Enjoy!

We love it that much more when that book has its setting on Long Island! If this sounds like you as well, then you'll want to take the opportunity to attend a book launch for this new novel entitled Dead Ed by Mike Polizzi.

But, when Ed's life is suddenly taken, the \"rest of him\" falls into the hands of a madman. Resurrected by science, Ed finds himself in a desperate struggle to save his soul from the Devil himself. You can attend the book signing at BC Pub [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2858] in Bellmore on October 30th from 7-11pm or you can skip the signing and buy the book here [http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Ed-Mike-Polizzi/dp/0615213235/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1225247569&sr=8-2].

The first of these meals was dinner Saturday night at Robin Des Bois [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1629], a French Restaurant on Smith Street situated in an old shoe store. The place is decorated with a combination of random provocative French posters and calendars as well as a statue of The Virgin Mary looming high above one of the tables. Kristinas parents, the good Catholics they are paid little attention to the decor and concentrated on the food. We shared a plate of saucisson and a bottle of Cote Du Rhone. Her dad and I each had a skirt steak with a peppercorn sauce and a side of potatoes au gratin. Kristina and her mom each ordered the half chicken with green beans and mashed potatoes. We sat in silence for the next 20 minutes - our chewing and occassional wine slurping the only sounds at the table. Yeah, it's that good. We finished up, and went for an ice cream at Uncle Louie G's up the street. This is a mini chain, and is absolutely fantastic! I became a regular at the Smith Street location over the summer, and got to the point where they were saying hi to me and recommending flavors they knew I hadn't tried yet. It was around this time I realized I needed to lose some weight. The following morning we ate breakfast at the Carrol Gardens Diner...more on that another time though. 718-596-1609 ~Sam

This is exactly the path that Joshua Kittenplan of the newly formed Law Office of Joshua Adam Kittenplan, P.C. [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=services&id=35] has taken. After spending years with many high-profile (as well as low-profile) clients he's decided that the time is right to open up shop and start fresh with his new small business located in Melville. Handling all types of law and litigation (and with heavy experience in the field of family law,) Joshua will bring his years of experience to the table and offer all of us on Long Island the highest quality of professional service. As a member of the Web 2.0 community, he's also started a law blog, which is updated quite frequently. You can view that blog by clicking here [http://kittenplanlaw.blogspot.com/]. 631-629-4287

I've been very busy with other things including getting engaged (thank you, thank you), work is busy (for now), and I've started a new diet and exercise program that I'm hoping will help me lose close to 20 pounds (ha!). Needless to say I haven't been dining out as often as I'd like to, but that's not to say I haven't at all. The truth is I only started the diet a week ago, and if you try hard enough you can find healthier options in most restaurants if you try hard enough. However, prior to my turning over a new leaf I tried the new Smith Street hot spot, Char No. 4 [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2835]. The space lay empty for the majority of the six years I've lived on Smith Street. Char No. 4 opened to rave reviews from foodies and traditionalists alike. They boast a menu [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/charno4menu.pdf] of hundreds of kinds of whiskey ranging from $2 glasses of higher than Jim Beam quality, to glasses over $100. They also cure their own bacon. Whiskey and bacon...get more manly, I dare you to try. Char No. 4 played a significant part in my newly engaged life as Kristina and I, and her parents and mine converged on the restaurant a rainy Saturday morning in September to celebrate and meet (the parents) for the first time. Our dads got along like old war buddies while our mom's thought up nifty things to do for the wedding. I concentrated more on my poached eggs over ham with bacon gravy and biscuits, a side of their house cured bacon (best! bacon! ever!), and a Bloody Mary made not with vodka, but with a smoky bourbon. The bacon (did I mention it is the best ever?) is crisp and just smoky enough. And if I haven't mentioned smoke enough, the place smells slightly of grill smoke (which lingers in the air and on your clothes even after you've left.) Char No. 4 is a welcome and delicious addition to the Smith Street family of restaurants and bars. ~Sam

Harbes Farm, Mattituck: Kid AND Parent Friendly Day Trip

***CONTENT
By Dina Shingleton, Suffolk County Correspondent A beautiful day with nothing planned! What could be more intimidating for the parents of a toddler? Determined to savor the last few weekends of autumn before the weather turns too cold, my husband, daughter, and I made the 50+ mile drive out to Mattituck to check out Harbes Family Farm [http://www.harbesfamilyfarm.com]. We decided upon Harbes as it met a few of our last-minute requirements: u-pick pumpkins, hay ride, and petting zoo. The Harbes Family actually have three locations to choose from, but the Mattituck location on Sound Avenue fulfilled all three of our day-trip requirements and then some. A concession offered roasted sweet corn, fresh squeezed lemonade, candy apples, and other autumnal treats. The sprawling farm stand had a variety of fresh produce, seasonal flowers, cheeses, jams, and pumpkins for sale (just in case you didn't want to brave the pumpkin patch). The hay ride was adorable and featured Farmer Stan, a bona fide, 81-year-old retired farmer, schooling us \"city-folk\" on the ins-and-outs of Long Island farm culture. A banjo player entertained the kids with folk renditions of children's songs; he even had the adults clapping and stomping along. Sheep, goats, and chickens waited patiently in the petting zoo; the nearby concession stand had bags of feed available for $2.00. My daughter got a real kick passing bits of feed through the fence to the sheep and goats. After the hay ride and petting zoo, our daughter played in the play area with the other children. Although not large, it has an adorable wooden tractor with slide off the back. All the kids got a real kick out of it, and were very patient waiting their turn to go down the slide, even my almost 2 year old! Too tired out from the play area, we decided to purchase a pumpkin from the farm stand rather than force march our daughter through the fields in search of the perfect pumpkin. The stand had plenty of pumpkins to choose from and we settled on a 22 pounder for our front porch! The leaves are just starting to turn out East, which made the scenery extra pretty! If you haven't gotten your pumpkin yet, I highly recommend a trip to Harbes' farm. If you're sans children, you can check out the Wine Barn (we, sadly, didn't get to) and also check out Martha Clara Vineyard [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=18] which is nearby.

By Nathan King - Suffolk County Correspondant [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/18/webimg1.jpg] On October 25th and 26th the Greater Sayville Chamber of Commerce will be holding their annual Fall Festival. It's hard to sum up everything that will be going on, but I'll try my best. Starting at 10am, Sayville will be divided into five stages/areas where you'll be able to catch eight live bands including Testing for Echo, Miles to Dayton and Ed Travers (Sunday). [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/18/bbq.jpg] Perhaps the most interesting and unique event over the weekend festival is the BBQ competition. Get fired up as the Kansas City BBQ Society sanctioned contest takes place. BBQ teams from all over will demonstrating their skills. Watch the pros at work and maybe even pick up some tips. Saturday is the grilling competition and Sunday is the BBQ competition. You'll also be able to catch a children's carnival, local food such as roasted corn, apple fritters, kettle corn and pretzels, jack-o-lanterns and more. Some artists and photographers will have work on display... you won't be able to stop! While you're in town, there are some great shops in town to check out.

We started this site about 3 years ago and from day one we've seen a steady incline in unique visitors as our site made its way around Brooklyn, Queens and Long Island. In the last few months however, we've seen an explosion of traffic that has given me the incentive to keep pressing on and letting you know about all of the fun things happening on this side of the city. I'm not alone however, as we've recently taken on a few contributors who write for the love of where they live and their need to share it with you. We want to keep seeing our little site grow and grow, and we can easily do that if you keep telling everyone that you know about it. If each of you forwards us to ten of your friends / family members, our servers will be shaking, and that would be an issue that we would be glad to deal with. We look forward to keeping you up to date with the best of the area and thank you again for checking out our little bubble on the web.

Gordon Ramsay may be many things, but he's not a miracle worker for those in bad financial situations. Maybe they should have kept the early bird specials after all. Thanks toScott R. for the tip.

Worst Dining Experience Ever! I need to do your subscribers a favor. They come to you for guidance and value your opinions and experience. I have never taken the time to write a review- good or bad- but felt that for the good of the people they need to know not to try this restaurant out. The lightest complaint i have is being told that your table would take 10 minutes to get seated and in reality it taking 45 minutes. The real issue with the place is that once we got seated it took 3 hours to get served- the food was horrible- the waiter told us that they ran out of food and had to go shopping at the supermarket below. Worst experience ever. The bill was over $300 for four people. Horrible experience.

[img:http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/images/2008/10/05/jamesport_cinq.jpg] [http://lennthompson.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/05/jamesport_cinq.jpg] This post has been reproduced from our friends over at LENNDEVOURS [http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/2008/10/jamesport-viney.html] I love when I taste a Long Island red with complexity and substance... especially when I find out later that it's only $16 at the winery (and no-doubt available for under $15 at shops). One such wine is Jamesport Vineyards' East End Series Cinq. It's a kitchen sink blend of merlot, cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, syrah and pinot noir that surprisingly doesn't taste like a bunch of leftovers thrown together. Medium crimson red in the glass, there are nice, fairly effusive aromas of black cherry preserves, blackberries, black pepper spice and even a subtle smoked meat component that is interesting. Medium bodied with soft tannins and just a little acidity the flavors are very similar to the nose with maybe a bit more smoke and oak apparent. It's not a mind-blowing wine. It's not going to set the world ablaze or knock you over the head... but that's a good thing. This is a good every day local red.

Road Trip Series: Fort Lauderdale, Florida

By Mark Levine [mailto:mark@eastofnyc.com], Editor Like most New Yorkers, we have a lot of family that live in the state of Florida. This is great for us, as we travel there a few times a year and get to take little road trips each time. This last trip we took a night and headed out to Fort Lauderdale, stayed at a great hotel and then traveled around locally to see the best of what it had to offer. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/10/05/flg.png] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/05/flg.png]Located on the inter-coastal, the Fort Lauderdale Grande [http://www.fortlauderdalegrande.com] has just recently gone through a $70 million rehab project that has revamped both their public spaces and interior rooms. A trendy and modern hotel filled with white decor along with splashes of colors here and there, this was a perfect place to rest our head for the night. September / October is still considered the Hurrican season, so we were able to scrape by on a severely reduced rate for the night. A mile and a half away from the hotel lies the beach and the restaurants and shops that make Fort Lauderdale a great day trip destination. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/10/05/chinagrillfl.png] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/05/chinagrillfl.png] In the hotel is a new outpost of China Grill [http://www.chinagrillmgt.com/chinaFL/main.cfm?pp=0], notably owned by Jeffrey Chodorow [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeffrey_Chodorow] (Rocco Dispirito's nemesis on NBC's failed series, The Restaurant.) While we only dined here for breakfast on our day to check out, I thought that the Belgian waffle with home-made whipped cream was among the best that I had ever had. A great touristy spot that makes Fort Lauderdale a great destination is Las Olas Boulevard [http://www.lasolasboulevard.com/]. Perpendicular to the beach, the Boulevard runs East/West and is home to some of the area's finest restaurants and shops (and sportscars and women.) If you've ever watched MOJO [http://www.hojohd.com] (an HD channel,) you may have seen Pressure Cook [http://mojohd.com/mojoseries/pressurecook/], featuring Ralph Pagano (also a runner up on Season 1 of Hell's Kitchen.) Since I had found out a while back that he was serving as the Executive Chef at Mancini's [http://www.mancinis1.com/] on Las Olas, I had wanted to try it out. Unfortunately when we arrive at the restaurant we were informed that he was no longer there. Albeit slightly disappointed, we still ate at the restaurant and have a lovely dinner outside. The weather was beautiful, palm trees were swaying and coming from a colder NY we had nothing to complain about. Side trips to consider when heading to Fort Lauderdale: [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/10/14/img_3638.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/14/img_3638.jpg] Seminole Hard Rock Casino & Hotel [www.seminolehardrockhollywood.com] in Hollywood, FL: Recently expanding to allow house games such as blackjack and craps, the Hard Rock (recently known as Anna Nicole Smith's last hotel stay) has been well known in the area for the selection of restaurants, nightlife, poker room and slots. An Indian Casino, this is located approximately 25 minutes from Fort Lauderdale. Miami, FL: Approx. 30 minutes from Fort Lauderdale Beaches, restaurants and swanky hotels litter Collins Ave. and A1A at this haven for warm weather lovers. Lincoln Boulevard in South Beach is well known for fantastic shops and outdoor eateries; including Cafeteria [http://www.cafeteriagroup.com/] and Sushi Samba [http://www.sushisamba.com] which are both transplants from NYC. Light up the night at the Delano Hotel [www.delano-hotel.com] and their poolside lounge, which is often frequented by Jay-Z and Lindsay Lohan. When we stay in Miami Beach, we always take up residence at the Clinton Hotel and Spa [http://www.clintonsouthbeach.com/], which offers great location and design and an affordable price. Within a few months time a Kimpton Hotel [http://www.kimptonhotels.com] will be opening up in the area as well.

Long Island Kid Friendly Activity of the Month: Hicks Nurseries in Westbury

[img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/10/14/img_3671.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/14/img_3671.jpg] October on Long Island is a great month. We're starting to cool down from the summer heat and as the leaves start to change colors, so do the decorations in the stores, to black and orange all over. Pumpkin picking and apple picking are everywhere on the east end, but we live in Nassau and wanted somewhere that would be easy on our gas mileage and be kid friendly and a great time as well. We chose to go to Hicks Nurseries [http://hicksnurseries.com/] in Westbury to satisfy all of our requirements of a great Sunday out. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/10/14/img_3674.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/14/img_3674.jpg] Hicks was packed with families and little kids so excited to see the animated tale of Otto the Ghost and the subsequent walk-through of glow in the dark scenes that tell his story. Also hugely popular was the small animal farm where you and your little ones can feed the goats and various other animals through the wire fence. Hay rides, fresh cider, a huge assortment of flowers, plants and shrubs, pumpkin picking (large and small!) and a gourmet shop with honey, jams and other foods were available for purchase. Moving past Halloween, they also had their Christmas decorations available, progressing the year just a little faster than we had wished. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/10/14/img_3679.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/10/14/img_3679.jpg] With only a few weeks left to go until Halloween, the parking lot was beyond a madhouse, so we can recommend that you go early to find a close spot to the store. 516-334-0066

Liki Sushi in Amityville

By Dina Shingleton [http://dinainsuburbia.wordpress.com], Suffolk County Correspondent What's better than a sushi restaurant opening within walking distance of your house? A sushi restaurant that actually serves decent sushi, with attentive staff, and trendy atmosphere within walking distance to your house! OK, so maybe Liki Sushi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2842] in Amityville [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11701&=Search&section=eat] isn't within walking distance for everyone, but ample parking and it's location on Merrick Rd make it the perfect go-to spot for a bite after work when you're too tired to cook. Last night my husband, two year old daughter (yes, they're kid friendly too), and I sat down in a private booth with beaded curtains and chowed down. We started out with the Jalapeno Yellowtail appetizer. Certainly a nod to the famed dish at Nobu, it was just spicy enough without going overboard. The yellowtail was just slightly too thick, but maybe I'm used to the paper thin shavings at Nobu that seem to melt away. Of course, Liki doesn't charge Nobu prices, so to hold them up to that standard is probably unfair. We ordered Edamame as well, mainly for Maddie (our two year old). If you haven't yet given some to your little one, give it a try! Maddie pops 'em like candy! A miso soup and a bowl of white rice rounded up Maddie's meal. We dump about half the rice into the soup and let her have at it. She thinks it is delicious, and we're happy to oblige! The husband and I tried some sushi rolls. I had the Fire Dragon Roll (spicy tuna, cucumber on top with tuna, avocado, and spicy wasabi sauce) and a Negi Hamachi roll (yellowtail and scallion). The Fire Dragon Roll was done well. Not too much rice, excellent texture, and not too cold (I don't like eating ice cold sushi). My only complaint was that for a roll called Fire Dragon it didn't seem that spicy. Fire Dragon is a pretty dramatic name, and I was expecting dramatic spice. It fell a bit flat, but nothing extra wasabi couldn't solve. My husband had the standard spicy tuna roll and a Boston roll. He said both were rather tasty. I tried his spicy tuna and thought it lacked spice, but he didn't agree, so maybe I was just having a bad taste bud day. All in all I think Liki Sushi is a great go-to sushi spot. I know we'll certainly be back either to dine-in or to take-out.

An ultra modern design and one of the area's best light shows are just a few of the things that have the locals buzzing over this newly opened hotspot. Formerly Mirage and now named GLO [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1397], the reinvented space should cater to a variety of clubgoers looking for a late (and loud) night out. Wednesday nights are always free for ladies. The club is open only Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights. Westbury might seem an unlikely spot for a happening late-night bar/lounge, but rest assured, you won't leave feeling a bit disappointed. 516-794-8022

Recap: Kitchen Nightmares on Long Island: Trobiano's in Great Neck
***AUTHOR

***DATE
2008-09-25 20:43:00
***CONTENT
Update: This location has closed [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/2008/10/closed-actually.html]. To our huge surprise, we sat down for our weekly Kitchen Nightmares [http://www.fox.com/kitchennightmares/] on FOX recap tonight and saw a familiar face. Way back when, in high school, I was really good friends with tonight's restauranteur, Anthony Trobiano. Last I had seen him he was headed to Johnson & Wales while working summers over at Carlyle on the Green at Bethpage State Park. That was then and here we are now. The namesake of Trobiano's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2022], Anthony and his girlfriend (and future in-laws) have opened up shop in one of the most popular Long Island dining destinations, Great Neck [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=great+neck&section=eat]. Chef Ramsay is stepping in just in time as Anthony's future in-laws are roughly $500k in debt from this venture. Chef Ramsay arrives at the restaurant to find Anthony, a young and (slightly....ok, very) arrogant owner who has been in business for the last two years. His girlfriend and parents are there and are happy that Chef Ramsay is taking the time to talk to him and ask why he would open up an italian restaurant if he had never had any experience working in an italian kitchen. Sleeping seniors and chopped salads await Chef Ramsay as he is eating during the \"Early Bird Special\" that Trobiano's is offering, beginning at 4:30pm. Reminiscent of Florida, Chef Ramsay jokingly comments how it must be hard to eat with a knife, fork, spoon and straw. Chef Ramsay quickly sends back his first two dishes (shrimp in chicken and salmon.) With the early bird service over pretty early, the dinner hour is quite empty. Chef Ramsay berates Anthony on his choice of cuisine and leaves the restaurant to return the next day. One of the best parts of Kitchen Nightmares is the inspection of each restaurant's kitchen and the inevitable mess that he will find. This restaurant was no different as there were mouse droppings, food caked-on the floor and the appliances hadn't been cleaned in what looked like, forever. Gordon was horrified and took all four of them to the kitchen to show him what he had found. Gordon proceeds to walk out as Anthony won't take responsibility for the mess that has been sitting there. Anthony ran after Chef Ramsay and proceeded to tell him that he wanted to make the restaurant better and to help bring them out of debt and the restaurant profitable. Chef Ramsay got it through to Anthony that he needs to be humble and to not be as arrogant as he is. Anthony has given in and will now do whatever it is that Chef Ramsay suggests. To set Trobiano's apart from every other restaurant, Chef Ramsay takes them to their new cows, which will help to produce their new fresh mozzarella cheese. They proceed to milk the cows on their first step to fresh ingredients. Back at the restaurant, Gordon shows them the process to making fresh mozzarella. Another change is the Early Bird Special. Gordon has wiped that off of the map. Dinner service starts off well with customers liking the mozzarella, but Gordon is unhappy that he is not tasting any of the food that he is giving out. As a result of this, many customers are sending it back to the kitchen. An hour into the dinner service and plates are backed up and the pressure is showing on the staff who is fumbling with their service and as a result set off a fire and the fire alarm. Overnight, Gordon's staff took the decor of the restaurant and turned it over to a new and fresh look. The owners loved the new look of the restaurant and were ready to head into the relaunch that night. The new menu was also changed as it was downsized and the portions were made to be smaller. The relaunch was made ever more exhilarating with the editor of Bon Appetit Magazine joining the dinner service. The presence of the critic scared the family as well as making it an exciting evening. Early reviews from the customers were glowing as they were very happy with the appetizers. Anthony began to taste the food before it went out and with a frenzy in the dining room, the entire staff was being pushed to their limits. Barbara Fairchild from the magazine had finally showed up and the pressure to make the perfect rissotto was on. Nervous about the critic, the entire family feels the weight of the this critique on their shoulders. The critic's table passed around the dishes and said that they were satisfied, when they were asked. As one final gift from Gordon, he gives Anthony a ring to give to Tiffany to bring back the most important thing back to the forefront of his mind. After this, Anthony goes on to ask Tiffany to marry her. Thankfully, she says yes. Gordon then goes one step further and proclaims that they are going to get married that very night at the restaurant. A new dress and tuxedo (and some friends and family) help to make the wedding very special.

Across the Border: City Crab in Gramercy Park

***CONTENT
One little block on Park Avenue in the Union Square / Gramercy Park area is littered with restaurants and bars. Between 19th and 20th Streets there are Angelo & Maxies [http://www.angelo-maxies.com/], City Crab [http://www.citycrabnyc.com], Sugar Cane, Sushi Samba [http://www.sushisamba.com] and L'Express [http://www.yelp.com/biz/l-express-new-york]. With all of these restaurants available so close to one another, you can literally never have to leave this one-block radius. On a recent Monday night, we took our hungry selves and settled into City Crab. I had only been there once before, back in 1998 or so, and have been looking to get back there ever since. Upon entering the restaurant, the bar area is on the left while just beyond that are high tables so that you can eat in the bar area but still enjoy their full menu. There's an upstairs and a downstairs dining room which both have great views thanks to the floor to ceiling windows looking onto Park Avenue. The menu, as the name suggests, relies heavily on seafood (namely, crab.) For our appetizers, we ordered the tuna carpaccio, which was thin-cut rare-tuna drizzled in a soy-glaze with seaweed salad. For entrees we had the Striped Bass and the Twin Lobster Tails, which we chose to have covered with a crab meat stuffing for an extra $12. The dessert was amazing as well, with our huge helping of Oreo Ice Cream covered with crumpled Oreo's. We happened to be there for a special dinner out, but this restaurant was casual enough to just stop by after-work for Happy Hour or with the kids for a great night out. When in Union Square / Gramercy Park, we can fully reommend this seafood hot spot for all of your dining needs. 212-529-3800

Angelo & Maxie's got a brief mention on this post...one of the greatest restaurants to go to - it's more of a \"hip\" steakhouse than \"old school\" steakhouse like Lugers, the Palm or Sparks. I think A&M definitely appeals to the younger generation as far as menu, drinks and atmosphere. It's literally across the street from City Crab and it's also a \"must eat\" in that neighborhood.

Pleasantly surprised would be a perfect description of our visit to Da Ugo [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=421] in Rockville Centre. How could a restaurant that has been open since 1993 still fly under the radar to this very day? We asked ourselves that question when we finished our long meal roughly two years ago on that very windy and snowy night. Looking around the restaurant, it doesn't look like much has changed since that opening day. We had a cozy little corner and shared the restaurant with a variety of patrons from all walks of life. The small and intimate restaurant with its gracious host (who seemed to know everyone!) and his northern italian menu left a mark on our palates and our memories. At the time we weren't yet involved with East of NYC, so the next time we visit we will be sure to sharpen our pencils for a full gastronomic report. 516-764-1900

Innovative for having plasma screens serving as menus and iPod docks at each table, we thought that this restaurant would stay open longer than it did. As the company expands into their next reincarnation to American Roadside Burgers [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=american+roadside&section=eat], I'm sure that we'll see a lot more from them in the future. The rumor mill has it that a new ARB will be opening shortly. More on that to follow.

By Stacey McDevitt, Suffolk County Correspondent [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/18/toast.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/18/toast.jpg] I recently met a friend for breakfast in Port Jefferson [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11777&section=eat] at Toast [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1640]. I had been wanting to visit here since I learned the owner was someone that I had once worked with at a restaurant way back when where I was the chef and he was a young busboy. Needless to say he's all grown up now. Terry and his wife Jennifer run this a great little spot that serves as a coffee house offering creative breakfast and lunch items and then transforms into a Wine and Tapas bar on Thursday, Friday and Saturday evenings. Opened now for 6 years it has a young vibe with and energetic staff, their daughter Sienna was enjoying breakfast at the counter herself, so you know the kids are happy here too. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/18/toast1.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/18/toast1.jpg] I chose a feather light whole wheat waffle with fresh blueberries, bananas and a sprinkling of powdered sugar and yes real maple syrup!! Yum. While my friend did her best to make a dent in her special of the day, an overstuffed omelet with turkey, asparagus and a jalapeno cheese, crispy browned potatoes and thick toast topped off the plate along with what appeared to be a homemade salsa. Steamy hot mugs of bottomless coffee and we were all set. Breakfast is a mix of interesting french toast, pancakes and waffle and omelets. While lunch is an offering of salads, burgers, wraps and not your ordinary sandwiches. Three evenings a week tapas and wine are a popular addition. Take advantage of the fact that now that the summer is over; the streets are a little less crowded, you can find a parking spot and then walk off your indulgences while enjoying this waterfront village. 631-331-6860 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=242+E.+Main+St.,+Port+Jefferson,+NY+11777&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=65.183764,110.390625&ie=UTF8&ll=40.95365,-73.063116&spn=0.019447,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

So on one of my travels to and fro Suffolk to Nassau I discovered this great little spot. Hummus World [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2840], located near the train station in Roslyn Heights [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11577&section=eat] is such a find. It's a postage stamp size of a place with a husband and wife team that keeps things interesting. She's the cook and he's the personality behind the register, that if you ask nicely he'll let you try the sour pickles. On any given day there is a mixed clientele of students from the high school up the street, to businessmen and locals. And the occasional adventurist like me. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/16/hummusworld2.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/16/hummusworld2.jpg] Let me first start off by saying I love falafel, but these are no ordinary ones. These crispy chickpea critters are flecked with coriander seeds and green tinted from parsley. But it is also what is stuffed into the pita that makes them special. Weighing in at a pound and a half, yes I actually weighed it, I had to sit was so heavy. Is a mix of the smoothest hummus, crunchy carrot and red cabbage lightly pickled, an \"Israeli Salad\" of tomatoes and cucumber, topped off with homemade hot sauce if you like and believe me, me like!! There's also a sampling of vegetarian appetizers like eggplant baba ghanoush or platters with chicken shwarma, a highly spiced kosher chicken cooked on a spit much like a gyro. Then shaved off in tender slices. There's also homemade soups \"depending on Esters mood\" as the menu reads, but its an experience just to dine here, if there's a table inside grab it or a spot outside under the umbrellas or if you have time take it to go and head for a nearby park in Roslyn and enjoy the view. Anyway you choose it's a tasty spot for a delicious bite to eat. 516-621-0025

I'm somewhere in the middle. I like being able to go out anytime I want without the fear of being beat up (seen this happen), harassed (victim), or worse (once witnessed a guy try to punch his way out of the trunk of a car). I love the variety of restaurants, chic bars, and retail. If only my office were situated close by, I would probably rarely even venture over the bridge into Manhattan. Smith Street is almost passe at this point. In the last couple of years we've seen a resurgence of Atlantic Avenue. There are new restaurants and bars, as well as plenty of retail to compliment the variety of antique stores that have dotted the landscape for years. Many well known names have even begun to make their way to the neighborhood; most notably Urban Outfitters and now Steven Alan. Alan, made famous with his rumpled dress shirts for men opened at 349 Atlantic Ave to little fanfare. I happened upon it the other day en route to my tailor [http://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com/2008/07/30/a-crabby-endorsement-object-custom-tailor/] to have some pants hemmed. I popped in. They had plenty of the usual rumpled shirts as well as cotton pants, wool coats, and ties as well as vintage RRL pieces, vintage watches, sunglasses, bags, and a small women's collection. Personally, I was unimpressed. The space is boring, and I've always found the merchandise to be overpriced. For what you pay for one rumpled dress shirt (about $120) you can get almost two very similarly styled shirts from J.Crew [http://www.jcrew.com/]. But some people like that sort of thing... ~Sam Brooklyn- Steven Alan 349 Atlantic Avenue Brooklyn, NY 11217 Mon-Sat 11:30-7pm Sun 12-6pm 718.852.3257 www.stevenalan.com [http://www.stevenalan.com/]

The event takes place every Sunday from 10am until 5pm–rain or shine–at Bishop Loughlin High School in Fort Greene (corner of Lafayette and Vanderbilt Ave. We found a wide range of products from vintage collectibles to architectural salvage to food. In all, there are over 150 vendors that entertain and tempt your wallet. Foxy & Winston [http://www.foxandwinston.com] designs cards, tees (for kids) and wood panel prints for your wall that feature colorful animals. Right next to them was an exhibit of limited edition photographs from John Murphy [http://www.shopjohnmurphy.com] (shown in photo below). Another artist that stood out went by the name She Hit Pause Studios [http://www.shehitpausestudios.com] who separates polaroids and transfers the image onto watercolor paper. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/15/brownstoner2.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/15/brownstoner2.jpg] Brooklyn Brownstoner has a great selection of handmade and vintage jewelry as well. Sarah Warner [http://sarahkathleenwarner.etsy.com], one of the artists that stood out, casts her own pieces into interesting shapes. There's something organic and beautiful about each piece. Jewelry by AdornmentsNYC [http://adornmentsnyc.etsy.com] also stood out - the muted color palette and vintage look gave this beaded line a unique look. Parking on the street can be hard to find, so leave yourself time to look around. Fort Greene is a beautiful neighborhood in Brooklyn full of brownstones. Once you're all done, walk over to Dekalb Ave where you'll find some restaurants and coffee shops. We recommend the mexican cuisine at Bonita [http://bonitanyc.com] (243 Dekalb Ave, Brooklyn - 718-622-5300) and the coffee at Tillie's [http://www.tilliesofbrooklyn.com] (248 Dekalb Ave, Brooklyn - 718-783-6140).

Our reservation of about 12 people was about the limit of what they could fit in the small-ish restaurant, but they were happy to sit us at the very back for some sense of privacy. Upon entering, you know that you're in for a low-key meal as the lights are turned low, the woods are dark and the owner is standing there at the door waiting for you. The menu consists of great appetizers such as fried calamari, baked clams and salads. We ordered the chicken parmigiana with a side of angel hair pasta as well as the shrimp marinara with a side of butternut squash ratatouille and thoroughly enjoyed it. The portions were big enough for two people and we left half of our meal sitting on the plate. For dessert we enjoyed the chocolate fudge cake as well as the orange sorbet served inside the orange shell. Everything was served to perfection and everyone in our party had a great time and never had a worry about anything that night. To view their menu please click here [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/lagiocondamenu.pdf]. Verdict: We can happily recommend this restaurant for any occasion. 516-466-2004

Wagyu beef comes from a few select breeds of cattle. What sets this grade of beef apart from the rest is the high ratio of unsaturated fat, which can be seen in the intense marbling of the meat. Because of the special characteristics of this beef and the lack of wide-spread availability,the price is often high. Inatome Japanese Steak House [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2126] in Valley Stream [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=valley+stream&=Search&section=eat] is set to offer two nights of unabated Wagyu love. This special menu will consist of: Japanese Onion Soup Three kinds of \"Otanoshimi\" surprise appetizers salad with Inatome Ginger dressing Teppan grilled Shrimp 7 oz. Wangyu Sirloin Beef Fried or White Rice Dessert This special menu will come to life for two nights only, Wednesday, September 17th and the following night, Thursday, September 18th. Wagyu love doesn't come cheap though. This meal will cost $110. 516-872-0419

You can find a pizza spot on almost every corner in Long Island, right next to a Starbucks Coffee and the Gap. Manhattan is littered with pizzerias that cater to a more sophisticated crowd with interesting concoctions that dive deeper than just your run of the mill dough, sauce and cheese (Mario Batali famously owns Otto [http://www.ottopizzeria.com] in the village.) When San Marzano [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2837] opens its doors tomorrow they will aim to take a little bit of that magic that you'll find in NYC and Brooklyn and bring it to the South Shore of Long Island. We were there to witness their soft opening at last weekend's Merrick Street Fair, and we can tell you firsthand that the pizza looks incredible; crispy and inspiring. Although located in a small space, the ambience and setup work well together and we should see a lot of great things to come when they open tomorrow night. Menu items include pizzas by the pie (the only pizza available by the slice is their Margherita.) Pies include Bianca, Steak & Onions, Buffalo Chicken, Bacon & Egg and Tomato Pesto. Prices range from $7.50 - $13 per pie. 516-546-3300 Click here [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/sanmarzano.pdf] to view their menu.

Recap: Kitchen Nightmares on Long Island: Handlebar in Mt. Sinai

***DATE

***CONTENT
On this week's Kitchen Nightmares [http://www.fox.com/kitchennightmares/] with super chef Gordon Ramsay, we get a peek into the life over at The Handlebar [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2392] in Mt. Sinai. Billed as \"Long Island's First Gastropub,\" Handlebar is a pub with an emphasis on fine food. Lead by the husband and wife team of Billie and Carolyn, Handlebar has been falling apart at the seams. The food is dated, table service is almost non-existent and the staff is no longer excited to work there. Gordon shows up at the restaurant, has his choice of ordering off of any of the four menus that he was presented with and starts the tasting. An emotional Carolyn stood by watching as Gordon took apart their dishes and hated what he tasted. At the first dinner service that Gordon oversaw, the restaurant ran out of vegetables within an hour of dinner service starting. As a result, radishes were now being served along side steaks (yes, we said Radishes!) A subsequent review of the fridge and the back end of the restaurant turned up a horror of dirty and unhygienic areas. Upon confrontation regarding these two issues, Billie walked away from Gordon, and seemingly, from the restaurant. Soon after, Carolyn arrives at the restaurant and picks up from wher Bille left off, hungry to return the restaurant to a positive reputation and good cuisine. An overnight decor change and a refreshed restaurant changed the way that Billie, Carolyn and the staff of the restaurant perceived their home. A smaller menu with an emphasis on the \"Gastropub\" has the entire team revved up for the re-opening. Dee Snider of Twisted Sister was on hand for the first night. Melissa, the chef struggled through all of the orders and quality was sacrificed as a result. Salmon was sent out overcooked and then raw and many re-orders were necessary. It seems as though the third time was the charm, and she was able to send out the food cooked properly from then on. So how did Gordon do with turning around this establishment? He did great. The entire staff (including Billie!) was re-energized by his visit and whether or not the restaurant will be full will be seen in time.

Actually, Buteras moved to a bigger and better location on Sunrise Highway on the border of Massapequa in Seaford right by where Burger King/Taco Bell is (I think it used to be a Chinese restaurant?)

It's true! Butera's is back! If your tastebuds ache for the amazing food you use to enjoy at Butera's in Massapequa, we have great news! After moving to their new location in Seaford and ironing out some kinks, Butera's definitely has their groove back. We used to visit their Massapequa restaurant every Friday night -- the high point of our dining week. When they moved to Seaford last year, they tried some new formulas, and some of us \"old-timers\" weren't happy about the changes. However, two weeks ago, we decided to try them again, fingers crossed. We ordered our old favorites, and what a fabulous meal! It was chef Gary Butera at his all-time best! We returned last night, had one of their specials, and again, every bite was pure heaven! If your family used to wait an hour or more in the old Massapequa location to eat the best Italian food on Long Island, give the new location another try. You will not be disappointed. With more tables there's less wait time, and the food is better than ever!(February 7, 2009)

You had your usual hot dogs, peanuts, and Cracker Jacks (I don't care if I ever get back...). However, with Baltimore's Camden Yards leading the way with others following suit in Houston, San Fransisco, and Pittsburgh to name a few Major League ballparks have begun to offer more variety in cuisine including local favorites and national chains. For example, Kristina & I went to a game in her hometown of Pittsburgh this past Memorial Day. There, they served up the legendary Primanti Brothers [http://www.primantibros.com/] sandwiches...one of three reasons I would ever more to Pittsburgh. Lucky for us New Yorkers, the new Yankee Stadium and Mets' Citi Field are being designed with the same amenities in mind. Citi Field will have Madison Square Park's famous Shake Shack, Blue Smoke BBQ, plus a taqueria, and a Belgian frites stand. But that's next year... For the few remaining games at Shea Stadium I will continue to enjoy the true ball game classic, the Nathan's hot dog. It's what I like to call perfection on a bun. Served hot out of murky water slathered with ketchup and mustard and devoured in less than a minute followed by spells of heartburn it's what makes the ball game experience The Ball Game Experience. Next year I plan to indulge and take advantage of the new choices in ball game cuisine. But for these last few weeks (and hopefully into October) the Nathan's hot dog (and the peanuts, Cracker Jacks, cotton candy, ices, ice cream, beer (here!), and pretzels will suffice. And after Shea is gone they will always hold a special place in my heart(burn). ~Sam www.mets.com [http://www.mets.com/]

Raga: Exotic Indian Restaurant in Brooklyn

***CONTENT
By Sam Jacobs, Brooklyn Correspondent There are few times in a man's life when he can sit in a restaurant and exclaim, \"I'm just so happy right now!\" I experienced that recently during a meal at Raga [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2836] on Smith Street. Kristina and I frequent Raga maybe once every other week. It's a simple Americanized Indian restaurant. It's rarely crowded (which leads me to believe they pay the majority of their rent through take-out), so the dine-in experience is usually quiet - plates served piping hot with friendly service. My first of four courses was a bowl of mulligatawny soup. This is one of my most favorite soups...ever! It was after my first slurp that I boldly exclaimed my happiness. Only Kristina was in earshot. That's a good thing. Next, we split an order of Sag Poori - fried spinach with deep fried, and slightly oily poori bread - reminiscent of funnel cake without the sugar. Still happy... For my main dish, however I decided to try something new. I knew I wanted chicken, but the usual Tikka Masala, Curry, or Tandoori wasn't going to cut it that night. The Chicken Madras seemed to be a good choice. I guess I wasn't listening because the waiter asked me if I wanted it medium or hot, and I agreed to hot. The first bite was delicious - full of flavor and sweet spices, but really hot on the tongue. The next bite still tasted good, but was really hot. The rest of the meal all I tasted was hot. But I finished it. I was determined. I also finished four glasses of water, a glass of beer, all of the rice, a basket of nan bread, and most of the sauce from Kristina's Chicken Tikka Makhuni - a sweeter, mild sauce. At the end of the meal, with what felt like a sack of rocks in my stomach - my scalp sweating Madras, and my shirt soaked with sweat the waiter brought a dish of rice pudding. My mouth still burned, and I was out of beer so I forced the pudding down. It was sweet and mild and helped ease the pain. The moral of the story is if you're an average white guy like me (who's idea of really spicy is the medium option at Atomic Wings), and you're eating in an Indian restaurant, stick to what you know. And if you decide to experiment make sure you listen very carefully, and do not order it hot! ~Sam 718-522-3027

I personally have fond memories of stopping there when I was younger with a friends family as we made our way back from a long afternoon in the city. The Potato Knishes were always hugely popular with my friend, and we always enjoyed splitting a few between us. Fast forward a few years (ok, maybe 15 years is the actual number) while a colleague and myself are in Forest Hills for a meeting. He's Italian and we often do dinner at italian joints throughout the entire metro area. He told me that since we are heading towards Queens Boulevard that he'd like to take in a good Jewish deli for a nice change. Hence, we found ourselves drawn back into this Forest Hills staple. As soon as we walked into the door we were bombarded by the man behind the counter with \"try the soup\" and \"the perogies are just made, you must try them!\" All I kept wanting to say was \"Oye Vey\" but I held myself back. Taking his advice we both ordered up a container of chicken noodle soup, fresh brisket perogi and a Dr. Brown's soda. Our guy behind the counter slipped the soups into the microwave and we were good to go. After finishing off what we had ordered on our first round, we decided to go halves on a potato knish to encounter the true deli experience. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/09/knish2.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/09/knish2.jpg]Knish Nosh has been open since 1952 and is a real testament to the community that it serves. Queens Boulevard and Forest Hills have changed a lot in that time, but Knish Nosh has always been the same as it is today; quality kosher fare and a no-frills atmosphere at a price that can't be beat. The two of us left feeling full and only $21 lighter when all was said and done. 718-897-5554

The view was beautiful, but we weren't on the ocean. Just to the north of Main Street is Fort Pond. Harvest sits right on the edge and has an indoor bar and plenty of indoor seating. We sat outside [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?featureSearch=OutdoorDining&featureSearch2=&section=eat&searchcity=&searchzip=] in their beautiful herb and vegetable garden that overlooks the lake along with the sunflowers and other natural looking views. There are ten or so tables with umbrellas out there - it was quiet and serene. Bring the kids, they'll love walking out on the dock and feeding the ducks. Harvest's menu will seem expensive at first, but their portion sizes are meant to be shared. For a group of two, the staff recommends one entree and one appetizer. Chef John Weston's Tuscan cuisine includes a small selection of appetizers, salads, grilled pizzas, pasta, sides and main dishes. You'll find items dishes like Grilled Salmon with Spinach Mushroom Risotto and Beurre Blanc, a Bacon, Onion, Jalapeno, Tomato and Mozzarella pizza and Garlic Shrimp and Spaghetti. Harvest on Fort Pond had a certain beauty that cannot be replicated elsewhere. This was a perfect end to a perfect day.

Bringing artisan jewelry to downtown Sayville, which already has several other jewelry stores, Silica set themselves apart from the start. Area residents Alison Flodin-Veitch and Jeffrey Behrens created jewelry floor displays from used dressers–cutting out the top and painting them white and green. Wall displays hang like works of art and inventive displays created by all the staff show off what you are really there to see–the jewelry. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/07/silica2.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/07/silica2.jpg] Silica [http://www.silicajewelrydesigns.com] carries the work of over 50 artisan jewelers from all over North America and many local artists here on Long Island. Jeff Behrens is one of these artists. He works with beach glass found locally and has been creating jewelry for almost a decade. You'll find a variety of styles from all the artists as well as a range of materials used. 38 South Main Street Sayville, NY 11782 631.803.6111

Honu Kitchen & Cocktails in Huntington

[img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/07/honu2.png] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/07/honu2.png]Although we live in Nassau County, we wanted to pick somewhere special to eat for an intimate and special celebration. We had a party of ten sophisticated palates looking forward to this get together for some time, so we didn't want to disappoint with a less than stellar choice. Going through our list of prospective restaurants for our event, we always placed the same one at the top of the list. A perfect space for entertaining, with its expansive space and superbly decorated dining room was Honu Kitchen & Cocktails [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=296]. Formerly Blue Honu, this newly redesigned space was perfect for what we were looking for. Owned by John Tunney, one of Long Island's most successful restaurateur's and owner of Besito [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=besito&section=eat], American Burger Company [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=127] and American Roadside Burgers [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=american+roadside&section=eat], his love for high design and art can be seen in every corner of the restaurant. A large bar area, ground level dining area and semi-private upstairs area let us have our choice on where to dine. We chose upstairs where we were joined by only one other small table. Tropical Storm Hannah wreaked havoc on the island this night, but in a way we were blessed by it as the crowds were kept away with the threat of rain and wind greeting you outside. We braved it though, while getting a little wet, and were rewarded with one of the best dining experiences that we have had. Ever. When we approached Honu about this dinner, they were eager to help make this a special event for us and our guests. With the small plates format, the variety of plates that we could experience were plentiful, and we chose to have our guests have one choice of a salad (field greens or a caesar salad,) a choice of a small plate for their appetizer and one choice for an entree from the menu. This worked out perfectly, as we were all couples and had the opportunity to share with our significant others to truly enjoy a wide variety of choices. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/07/honuribbonfries.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/07/honuribbonfries.jpg]Upon sitting down at our rectangular table for ten and waiting for our guests to arrive, we ordered 2 plates of ribbon fries and 2 plates of the garlic edamame. As the ribbon fries were so popular, and gone before half of our party arrived, we ordered two more plates so that our late arrivals wouldn't feel left out. Appetizers included Crispy Shrimp in a Chili sauce, Tuna Soy-Sake (raw tuna with cilantro served on a bed of seaweed salad drizzled in a soy sauce...our favorite,) Gnocchi with Wild Mushrooms and Scallops with Almonds and Honey. Our entrees included Salmon with Carrots and Zucchini, NY Strip Steak, Flank Steak, Red Snapper and Short Ribs. Of all the entrees, the NY Strip and the Flank Steak were the two favorites of the group. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/07/honufigs.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/07/honufigs.jpg]In between courses, Honu was nice enough to provide us with extra tastings. In between our salad and appetizer, we tasted the Prosciutto wrapped figs topped with Goat Cheese. Between our appetizer and entree we sampled the Duck with Scallions and Cucumber, served on a Mu Shu pancake and drizzled in a ponzu sauce. The duck was delicate and cooked to perfection while the cucumber was a refreshing note in the dish. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/09/07/honucake.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/09/07/honucake.jpg]By the time dessert was coming around, Honu presented the table with their signature freshly baked chocolate chip cookies. Warm and crispy at the same time, we almost forgot that we had dessert on its way. Molten chocolate cake and cheesecake were the desserts of the night. Our only wish was that the molten cake was served a little warmer than it was. With our large party, the cake may have been sitting out beforehand a little too long and didn't ooze like we had expected. With that being our only criticism for the night, we can't complain. Drinks of choice from our party were the coconut martini and the peach mojito. Strong and flavorful, the walk down the stairs to the bathroom and the exit seemed a difficult task at times. Overall, what we were hoping to experience at Honu all came true. We had a private dining area, a staff that was attentive to our every need and an atmosphere that served as a discussion point for our large group. Looking down on the main dining room and bar area provided us with a nice vantage point as well. We can certainly recommend this restaurant to all of our users and can (almost) guarantee that your meal will be as incredible as ours was. 631-421-6900 To view their regular menu, please click here [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/honumenu.pdf].

The staff is on their toes, greeting you at the door and giving warm smiles - creating a very friendly atmosphere. The lights are turned down, the music is soft and the decor has a clean look - which suits the small dining area. Chachama Grill's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=364]menu is always changing, which keeps local patrons coming back. The menu consists of a variety of appetizers including soups and salads and entrees such as meat dishes, pastas, fish and more. Don't forget to stop by the bar - their chocolate martini tastes like a fudgecicle - and the deserts are a perfect end to a wonderful dinner. The entire table can get a prix-fixed menu for $38 per person from 5pm-6pm everyday - includes appetizer, any entree, dessert and coffee or tea. Patrons are a bit dressed up for dinner - leave your sneakers at home. Appetizers are priced at $8-10 and entrees range from $18-30. 655-08 Montauk Hwy, East Patchogue, NY 631.758.7640

Water is served in oversized wine glasses and the bread basket consists of a grilled pita with a dish of spicy chickpea/black-beans for dipping. Our favorite dish there is the Tex-Mex black bean burger served with chips and guacamole. Some other menu items include a tomato and avocado salad, tuna, crab cakes and a 'Dream Bar' (shortbread, praline and coconut - fantastic!) The house wine selection is above average and the serving size was more than adequate. The martini list was also intriguing with a pomegranate martini, but that will have to wait until the next trip. 41 East Main Street Bay Shore, NY 11706 631-539-7183

Start off with their hummus or falafel appetizers - two of our favorite dishes. Their gyro sandwich is great, but Pita House [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=915] makes a very good shish kebab with juicy chunks of steak that is just a bit better. Other items on the menu include seafood kebabs, chicken kebabs, vegetable kebabs, a variety of greek salads and soups. Entrees cost anywhere from $8 to $18 depending if you get a sandwich or a larger meal. Their kitchen is vegetarian friendly as well. 680 Route 112 , Patchogue, NY 11772 (Just south of Woodside Ave) 631-289-2262

Not only is Nathan King one of our Suffolk County Correspondents [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/about-our-contributors.html], but he's also one heck of a graphic artist and designer. He was able to whip up our banner in no time at all and we feel that it captures what this site is about. A big thanks to Nathan for his handy-work.

Kitchen Nightmares on Long Island: A Recap One Year Later

***CONTENT
On Chef Gordon Ramsay's FOX show Kitchen Nightmares [http://www.fox.com/kitchennightmares/] last year, he took us to a few spots on Long Island that were having problems. Some of them had management problems, staff issues or the kitchens were just plain beyond help. Tonight, they aired a recap of last year's restaurants and caught us up with them and how they're doing today. Some fared better than others. Here's the rundown on the LI restaurants that were featured. Finn McCool's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2262] in Westhampton Beach was the first to have Gordon back. A year later, Buddy and his family that runs the establishment are working together, proud of their restaurant/bar and business has never been better. The Mixing Bowl Eatery [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=197] in Bellmore had a manager who couldn't run the shop while the husband and wife team that owned the restaurant were about to throw in the towel. If you look closely, throughout the original episode you'll see our \"As Featured on East of NYC\" sticker on the front of the restaurant! Fast forward a year later and Mike the manager has a true handle on the operations, there are no more signs outside, business is up 3-4x and everyone is happy. Peter's Italian Restaurant [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=899] in Babylon had an explosive owner who had a habit of blowing his top on the staff as well as creditors who were coming around. This restaurant was really on its last legs as the staff had just about had enough of their boss's ways. Gordon was able to calm him down and help Peter move forward to becoming a real boss and businessman. A new kitchen, courtesy of the show didn't hurt any, either. A year later Peter seems to have toned down his game a notch, business is up at least 30-40% and all of the employees are happy to work there (with the exception of the two chefs who left after the show.)

Ok, if you think you've eaten the best Key Lime Pie, but you've never been to Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pies [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2818] in Red Hook, then you have never tasted it the way it should be. Steve's pies put all other pie to shame (and my mom makes some pretty good pie). They are not cheap ($25 for a 10\", $15 for an 8\", $4 for a mini tart,) but they are the perfect blend of sweet and tart. Eat a mini tart, chocolate covered frozen bar, or a glass of Key Limeade while sitting on the newly revamped patio area overlooking the Hudson, or bring a 10\" to a dinner party. You'll be the most popular guest! And while you're there say hi to Steve's Jack Russell Terrier, Mango who is usually holding down the fort. ~Sam www.stevesauthentic.com [http://www.stevesauthentic.com] www.keylime.com [http://www.keylime.com]

Or, you might not be in the mood to fight for attention at the cosmetics counter in Bloomingdales [http://www.bloomingdales.com/] or Saks [http://www.saks.com/] on a busy Saturday at Walt Whitman Mall. In the Woodbury Commons (on Jericho Turnpike), Blue Mercury [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=shop&id=653] (also here [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=relax&id=222] in our \"Relax\" section) just might be the sanctuary you've been looking for. The store is a carefully edited space filled with all of the \"must-have\" products featured on the beauty pages of Allure, Vogue and In Style. Interested in joining the cult of the Shu Uemura [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/makeup/fun+tools+&+accessories/shu+uemura+eyelash+curler.do] eyelash curler? Blue Mercury has it for $18. Want to dabble in a little Laura Mercier, Nars and Trish McEvoy? Here, you can find the full lines (read: Nars Multiple [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/brands/nars/nars+the+multiple.do] in Orgasm) - including the skin care! If you've read about the T. LeClerc Banane Pressed Powder [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/brands/t.+leclerc/t.+leclerc+pressed+powder.do] on every \"must own\" list but never knew where to find it, the wait is over! Because their makeup artists are loyal to the store and not to one specific brand, you can trust that you'll leave with the right colors - not necessarily the \"close enough\" color that you might wind up with from a department store counter. You'll also be able to find totally splurge-worthy Diptyque [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/brands/diptyque/diptyque+baies+candle.do] candles, Molton Brown hand soaps [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/brands/molton+brown/hand+care/molton+brown+white+mulberry+fine+liquid+handwash.do], Kiehl's Creme with Silk Groom [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/brands/kiehl's/kiehl's+creme+with+silk+groom.do] and Fresh Brown Sugar Body Polish [http://www.bluemercury.com/product/brands/fresh/body+care/fresh+brown+sugar+body+polish.do]. There is a full spa at the location - perfect for facials, body wraps, waxing, and eyebrow shapings. And, you can get that next \"big night out\" off to a relaxing start with a makeup application. Truthfully, the only thing you won't find in Blue Mercury is the hard sell. The people working there honestly enjoy having fun with the customers who walk in the store, and that positive attitude is what keeps the customers coming back for more!

I had an amazing class at Bonda Yoga. From the time I walked in until the time I finished with class everyone there took special care of all my yoga needs. I will return again and again.

While the Dayboat Cafe [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2815] may only be open at nights (so far,) John Durkin may be onto something. This wouldn't be unfamiliar territory for him though, as he is the chef-owner of Cafe Diane [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2816] in Woodbury and Trattoria Diane [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1064] in Roslyn along with his wife, Diane Turkin. These two make a powerful combination and their previous establishments have long been toast of the town. Look to hear a lot about this restaurant in the coming months, once the Dayboat shifts into the lunchtime hours as well (we hope.) 516-621-2628

We must be slipping because we have no idea how this one got by us last month. Bobby's Burger Palace [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2811] opened just this last July by chef Bobby Flay (wait, did we just say Bobby Flay....as in Iron Chef Bobby Flay? Yes, we did!) Located in the Smith Haven Mall, Flay is now using his clout in the gastronomic universe to try and woo Long Islanders over to the finer side of meat on a bun. He has some pretty stiff competition though, as All American Burger [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=7], American Roadside Burgers [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=american+roadside&=Search&section=eat], The Good Steer [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2812] and Burger 9point5 [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2669] are all gunning to be the champion of the Long Island burger class. We think a THROWDOWN [http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_bt] might be in order. With this level of competition though, we're not sure who would take home the gold. 631-382-9590 To view their menu, please click here [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/BBPMenu.pdf].

My wife and I ate at Bobby Flay's burger place. We weren't so impressed. It was better than fast food, but not much better. The burger was decent but the fries were just ok. In your burger roundup, you don't mention Five Guys, which recently opened in Levittown. It's a chain from the DC/Baltimore area and has great food, including homemade french fries (they even tell you where the potatoes come from).

Nights (as well as lunchtime) are filled with a luxurious bar / lounge area, crowded tables, flying shrimp and the superior knife skills of the hibachi chefs. The back room of this large restaurant is devoted to the sushi bar and non-hibachi dining area. On Wednesday, September 3rd, from 5:30pm-7:30pm Shiro is throwing a bash of sorts. Sake and appetizers will be served to those in attendance. This event has many positive aspects to it but the best part of this event is the price. FREE. But you have to make a reservation. If you're new to sake or you want to partake in a large variety of sakes, some rarely available in these parts, this sampling event is for you. This could be the largest assembly of sake that Long Island has ever seen. Experts will be on hand to guide you through the process of selecting the right sake to accompany your food selection as well as take you through a history of this great alcoholic drink. Appetizers will be passed around to complement the flowing rice wine, so make sure to come hungry as well as thirsty. For reservations please RSVP by calling 516-997-4770. * Attendees must be over 21 years of age and is limited to their Carle Place location.

Catch a Piece of Maine [http://www.catchapieceofmaine.com/] is a luxury item if we've ever seen one. Memberships range from quarterly to yearly and all include fresh lobster mailed home to your doorstep along with clams and complete dinners. You have a personal lobsterman who catches your lobster (in Maine, of course) and you receive detailed maps of where your dinner was caught, personal interaction with your fisherman and the best meals of your life. Entrepreneurial brothers Captain John and Captain Brendan are the two fisherman who started this unique business and have helped local sea-faring workers take part in this great opportunity. They have gained the personal interaction that fisherman used to have prior to the internet and have become a huge success as a result. Luxury like this doesn't come cheap. Quarterly plans run about $799 while yearly Premium Partnerships will set you back $2,995. The $2,995 option will get you your own personal lobster trap. You keep everything that is caught in that trap all year. Although it's a crapshoot on how much lobster will climb in there, you are guaranteed a yearly minimum. Custom orders and one-time orders are welcomed as well. If you find yourself yearning for a fresh lobster meal this winter, check them out and have a Piece of Maine delivered straight to your home. 877-222-4630

The wide and untold variety of ways my fellow New Englanders manage to shear sheep never fails to amuse me. Good for Captains John and Brendan. Lobstering is a hard and filthy job, and they deserve every penny they can wring from it.

Coming soon to Deer Park is Tanger Outlet's [http://www.tangeroutlet.com] newest center on Long Island. Already keeping the masses happy with low prices out east in Riverhead, NYC and western Nassau residents will be very happy to know that their commuting time has been cut by approximately a half an hour. Slated to open October 23rd, 2008, The Arches [http://www.tangeroutlet.com/deerpark/directory/] will feature approximately 120 brand-name outlet stores, a movie theatre and what we would guess as a few dining establishments.

Road Trip Series Double Header: South Norwalk, CT & Boston, MA

By Stacey McDevitt, Suffolk County Correspondent You can tell the summer is almost officially over, the days are getting shorter, the nights are getting cooler and the kids are headed back to school. (Hooray!!!) But in just a short 4 hours drive away, you can escape to a totally different kind of city, Boston, a city that is as rich in history as it is in great food spots. South Norwalk, CT: [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/08/30/sonobakingct.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/30/sonobakingct.jpg]Our first stop was for breakfast of course. Little did we realize that this side trip could be a great destination all on its own. But the mission here was to find the SONA Bakery and Café [http://www.sonabakery.com], located in South Norwalk, CT. Just off I-95 this renovated warehouse space is the creation of John Barricelli, who just happens to moonlight for Martha Stewart on both her cooking shows and magazines. I don’t know where he finds the time, but the display cases are packed full of wonderous baked goods in addition to hot breakfast choices and a café lunch menu. We sample one of the best Pain de Chocolate I’ve tasted since Paris, along with a hot steaming cup of Café Mocha, fresh fruit, house made granola and thick yogurt and the SONA Egg sandwich with eggs, white cheddar and crisp bacon on a freshly baked croissant. It was the perfect way to start our trip. This town is dotted with historical buildings, restaurant and bars, galleries, an aquarium, maritime center and museums. In addition to its waterfront location it is a must return to spot. Boston, MA: But it was onward to Boston and upon our arrival we checked into our hotel of choice, the Boston Park Plaza [http://bostonparkplaza.com/]. Reasonably priced and centrally located, this historical hotel is just a block from the famed Boston Commons Park and the Swan Boats. We found this spot through the informative local websites. (www.bostonusa.com [http://www.bostonusa.com] and www.cityofboston.com [http://www.cityofboston.com]) There are many lodging choices in the area for every taste and budget and tons of helpful information about the area on these two websites. A rather touristy thing to do that is well worth the time and money is to park the car and hop a trolley to get the lay of the land. It works out great because it covers everything from Fenway Park to Faneuil Hall, you can hop on and off where you like, be it for a bowl of New England clam chowder and lobster roll down by the harbor, or for some of the notorious Italian food in the North End of town. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/08/30/koprimeboston.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/30/koprimeboston.jpg]Let’s face it, we really came here for the food right? So here’s a list of a few places that I would recommend. KO Prime [http://www.koprimeboston.com] located in the chic Nine Zero Hotel [http://www.ninezero.com]. The lounge attracts the trendy crowd to sip designer cocktails, while the second floor dining room offers a creative interpretation of a traditional steakhouse. Old meets new of sorts, as you overlook the historical graveyard across the street that holds such famous names as Samuel Adams and Benjamin Franklin’s family. No this is not your typical steak house. I imagine the KO stand for Chef Ken Oringer, who has cooked behind some of the great stoves in both New York and San Francisco. He seems to have a small empire of restaurants in town. Including the award winning Clio [http://www.cliorestaurant.com], with Japanese Sushi Bar, Uni and recently opened Toro [http://www.toro-restaurant.com], a tapas bar in the south end. While at KO Prime we sampled a colorfully arranged salad of beets with manchego cheese, pistachio and greek yogurt. My husband could not resist ordering from the offal part of the menu with dishes like seared foie gras with rhubarb, crispy veal sweetbreads or the a rich bone marrow with oxtail marmalade. Entrees were mostly steak and since it was “retro night,” our protein eating 7 year old gave them a run for the money with the all you can eat Prime Rib. Side dishes were just as tasty and interesting, an earthy mix of mushrooms, included hen of the woods, chanterelles and morels, and an unusually fluffy puree of Okinawa Purple Sweet Potatoes with fried shallots proved to be addicting. We had to pass on dessert though, because we had another destination in mind. Finale [http://www.finaledesserts.com] developed as a project while attending Harvard Business School, this dessert restaurant was conviently located near our hotel. We shared a sampling of 9 different mini plated delicacies along with cappuccinos spiked with liquors and stumbled up to our hotel room and drifted into a sugar coma. There are now several locations around the Boston area. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/08/30/no9boston.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/30/no9boston.jpg]At No. 9 Park [http://www.no9park.com], another local chef that is taking over the city is Barbara Lynch. This hometown girl started with a fine dining spot which has hailed critical acclaim. Unfortunately when we arrived one Sunday night they were closed. But she also has a few more casual spots in her own corner of the world where she grew up in the South End of Boston. The Butcher Shop [http://www.thebutcherspotboston.com] is a neighborhood shop which also features a wine bar that serves hand made charcuterie, antipasti and bistro dishes. While literally across the street she also owns B & G Oyster Ltd. [http://www.bandgoysters.com] with you guessed it, an oyster bar and fresh seafood. A small cookshop with culinary studio offering cooking and wine classes called Stir [http://www.stirboston.com] and a mini fresh market sandwiched in between named Plum Produce [http://www.plumproduce.com] completes the take over of the neighborhood. Boy do I wish I lived on this block with its community gardens and brick stone houses it has a lot of charm. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/08/30/flour.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/30/flour.jpg]Flour Bakery & Café [http://www.flourbakery.com] also located in the South end is a must try local spot before leaving if for nothing else but the sticky buns, caramel baked into rich brioche dough and dotted with toasted pecans, it’s worth the trip. They also make a mean homemade “pop tart” among a showering of others sweets and sandwiches too. All and all it is another great food town, oh and don’t forget to see the historical stuff too maybe you can walk off the extra calories on the Freedom Trail.

Arriving shortly after 10:30am in CT (with help from the lack of traffic from the long holiday weekend,) we weaved our way from the Casino of the Earth on the opposite end of the premises to the newly christened Casino of the Wind. Reporters and gamblers alike were on hand for the unveiling and the room was buzzing with excitement. Not bad for an early Friday morning. Some might say that Mohegan has to keep up pace with Foxwoods and the dizzying amount of casino space that they have on premises, but they're probably as likely to be in competition with the Borgata [http://www.theborgata.com] in Atlantic City to try and bring in all of the visitors from New York. The new casino was beautiful, with a wonderful water-wall, architectural brilliance and the cleanliness that you'd expect from a high-end room. We sat down at the poker tables in the new poker room (Mohegan used to have a poker room but it was closed down due to some employee dishonesty a while back....allegedly) and were excited to be the first people to ever sit at that table, in that chair and handle those chips. The dealers, most of them coming from other areas of the casino such as craps and blackjack were more nervous than the players on hand and frequently made errors and were always turning over cards. This was the first time in my life that I have seen players giving direction to dealers on how to play games and how to break down pots. This game wasn't for the faint of heart. Most of the accents at our table belonged to Red Sox fans, and I was pleased to ask them if they were rooting for the Yankees this year. Eight hours later, and about $100 lighter, we escaped the seats that we had claimed as our own and made our way back to the parking garage and back to Long Island. Flying back was a breeze as we made the trip to NYC in two hours flat. To view a gallery from the new casino, click here [http://www.metrowestdailynews.com/archive/x2045585147/PhOTO-GALLERY-Mohegan-Suns-Casino-of-the-Wind]. The verdict: Not bad for a day trip, even better for an overnight trip. Mohegan Sun also offers enough entertainment for a full-on weekend trip. Enjoy and good luck!

Tickets are $10 when purchased in advance (call 631.727.4161) or $15 at the door. That ticket gets you the opportunity to preview two unreleased wines: Roanoke Vineyard's 2005 Gabby's Field Cabernet Franc and Lieb Family Cellars' 2007 Pinot Blanc. We'll also have Mediterranean-style food to nibble on, discounts on wines by the glass and by the bottle, raffles for Roanoke Vineyards library wines and some 'Sonis Cellars (my own label) wines too. I plan to do some live blogging at the event and will also be recording some video as well. I can't tell you who yet, but there is also a very good chance that a prominent wine industry member (not from Long Island) will be in attendance as well. This is just the first of what we hope will be a quarterly event. Best of all, net proceeds will go to charity each time. Space is limited, so call 631.727.4161 today and buy your tickets today.

If you haven't ever had red mango before, it's similar to Pinkberry [http://www.pinkberry.com], but with a stiffer consistency. We're excited for them to open up their doors and we're sure that you'll see us there quite often. FYI, red mango is kosher, gluten-free and fat-free.

Family and friends were a given. A real bagel, the pizza [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?featureSearch=&featureSearch2=Pizza&=Search&section=eat&searchcity=&searchzip=], and an authentic New York deli. These experiences would be few and far between in my new home. A requirement of anyone coming to visit me from back east was to smuggle me in the goods on the plane, I would greet them like a junkie with a did you bring the bagels? But I would also miss my list of restaurants that I had developed over the years of living on Long Island the places I loved and were unique to the area, a foodie bucket list if you will. From Manhattan to Montauk [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=montauk&=Search&section=eat], and everywhere in between these little hole in the wall, Mom and Pop type places are not necessarily fancy. I’ve have a separate list for that, I like to call it the when I hit the Lotto list.But they were darn good at what they did and they did it well. One such place was Maureen’s Kitchen [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=769] in Smithtown [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=smithtown&=Search&section=eat]. When I first visited this little place a long long time ago. It was across the street from its present location and quite a bit smaller then it is now. It maybe had a few stools and couple of booths/tables. And who do you think was behind the counter running the show, you guessed it Maureen. Imagine my surprise when I recently moved back to New York and went to see if they were still in business. Well they were all grown up and had moved out too, even if it was just across the street. Neither of us got too far from where we originally started, did we?! Maureen Dernbach, her family and the friendly and efficient hard-working crew made this place a winner. This location has an open and airy feel to it, like an old farmhouse, complete with a screened in porch. You feel like you’re upstate somewhere, oh did I mention the cow motif? Kind of kitschy but very fitting, considering the town of Smithtown is named after a guy named Mr. Smith who rode through town on a bull, and there’s even a statue of the bull in town to prove it. Well there’s cows out in front of Maureen’s Kitchen too so you can’t miss it. [img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/08/20/maureen1.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/08/20/maureen1.jpg] But it’s what inside this jewel that makes them line up out the door on most days, and let me tell you it’s worth every minute. Meanwhile you can admire the glass enclosed cow print Harley Davidson motorcycle while you wait. But don’t wait to order the specialty pancakes and were not talking just any old pancakes were talking WOW. Pumpkin, mini chocolate chip and walnut, a crushed Oreo version, very popular with the little people and everything in between with orange, fresh blueberry, raspberry and strawberry, the list goes on and on. There are also the delicious over stuffed omelets, freshly griddled home fries, real bacon, thick sausage links, and eggs every which way. And a thick cut delicious looking raspberry stuffed French toast with a dusting of powdered sugar. I know they do a wonderful lunch too, with homemade soups, sandwiches and gigantic decadent looking desserts too, but to be honest I can never get past the pancakes they are my weakness. I must admit I’m a real big breakfast lover. I look forward to it from the minute I wake up. Along with a steaming hot cup of coffee and a copy of the New York Times I ask you does it get any better then this?! So I recommend that you get there early, read the paper while you wait, make sure you’re hungry and I can guarantee you’ll leave feeling happy and as stuffed as the cows out front. 631-360-9227 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=108+terry+ave.+smithtown&sll=40.849658,-73.204897&sspn=0.023957,0.076475&ie=UTF8&ll=40.860045,-73.16783&spn=0.019474,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

The outside is unassuming save for the two signs leading the way, but inside you get everything you would hope for in a microbrewery/restaurant. Entrees include steaks, pork chops, and chicken, Sully's Famous Baby Back Ribs, pasta, and seafood. There is also a prix fixe menu that includes an appetizer and dessert. I visited last Friday night, and had a cup of creamy New England clam chowder followed by a barbecue chicken and ribs combo, and topped it off with a hunk of apple crisp ala mode. The table also shared a basket of crispy fried calamari. Delicious! But don't be fooled, Southampton Publick House is still best known for their selection of beers brewed on site. The selection seems to change with the seasons. I sampled the Montauk Light, Southampton Gold, and Russian Imperial Stout. All were superb. I may make a trip back in the fall to sample their Pumpkin Ale. ~SJ Southampton Publick House 40 Bowden Square Southampton, NY 11968 (631)283-2800

The first is the convenience factor. We have to be in the car for less than four hours or so to our destination. Second comes affordability and the third arrives with ample activities to partake in once we get to our destination. When analyzing our choices for this trip we had a short list. We ultimately decided on Philadelphia, PA to spend a long weekend exploring. We haven't been there since a third grade trip to this historical city and we were glad to have the opportunity again now that we are a little older and can really take in all of the sites and restaurants that this city has to offer. In case you didn't know, there's a great website [http://www.gophila.org] out there that offers discounted overnight packages (including free parking) in the Philadelphia area. Searching through the multiple listings that had availability for the weekend, we chose to lay our heads at the Hyatt at Penn's Landing [http://www.pennslanding.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/index.jsp]. Located just off I-95 (and only two hours from our house in Nassau County) this was the most logical choice. Newly renovated with sweeping water views, 24 hour fitness center, indoor pool and a great restaurant, this is a great choice for couples, business travelers and families alike. As soon as we pulled into the hotel we parked our car, checked in and got right on out there to see what there is to do in Philly. We immediately saw the Liberty Bell [http://www.nps.gov/inde/liberty-bell-center.htm], walked past the Betsy Ross house [http://betsyrosshouse.org/] and got to know our new neighborhood for the weekend, Society Hill [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_Hill,_Philadelphia,_Pennsylvania]. If we had more time, a Duck Tour [http://www.phillyducks.com] certainly would have been in order. Areas of interest: Rittenhouse Square [http://www.rittenhouserow.org/index2.html]: A great little park in the middle of fine shops, restaurants and hotels. Reading Market Terminal [http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/]: A sprawling market that has been offering up local goodies such as fresh pretzels, bakery goods, fresh seafood and various other cuisines since 1893. We had the best pretzels that we have ever tasted at Fisher's [http://www.readingterminalmarket.org/merchants/view/41] little shop. Philadelphia Museum of Art [http://www.philamuseum.org/]: Create your own Rocky moment before you gaze at some of the finest artworks in the world. Restaurants we enjoyed (And one we didn't get a chance to:) Marathon on the Square [http://www.marathongrill.com/index2.html]: We brunched on the sidewalk at this trendy diner (which happens to have a few locations) right off Rittenhouse Square. Anjou [http://www.anjouphilly.net/]: A French/Asian fare restaurant with an extensive sushi menu. Although it was a great meal, we felt that the portions didn't quite match up to the price. Pizzicato [http://philadelphia.menupages.com/restaurantdetails.asp?areaid=0&restaurantid=28485&neighborhoodid=227&cuisineid=0]: Perhaps our favorite meal of our trip, we had a grilled chicken pizza for an appetizer with the sesame crusted Ahi Tuna for the entree. We were stuffed, but we made room for the chocolate molten cake that arrived with a scoop of vanilla ice cream after our meal. morimoto [http://www.morimotorestaurant.com/]: Next time in Philly we will make a reservation beforehand to see if the Iron Chef lives up to his name. In fact, we might just make a trip there again to eat and then head back home. It's supposed to be that good. Shops of interest: genes [http://www.shopgenes.com]: One of the nicest kid's store that we've ever seen. With a store made up of clean lines and bright colors, genes offered a full line of Paul Frank garments, cribs, seats and other great items that you may not see everywhere else, this store screamed classy without any of the pretentiousness. City Sports Philadelphia [http://www.citysports.com/citysports/]: We bought a new pair of running sneakers at this sports megastore. A knowledgeable staff guided us with the product that we need. No tax on clothing certainly helped us make our decision. The Franklin Fountain [http://philadelphia.about.com/od/shopping/ss/market_st_gems_3.htm]: We stepped back in time while stepping up to this favorite Market Street destination for ice cream lovers. Our waffle cone came loaded with two flavors of hand scooped ice cream (Rocky Road and Chocolate Chip.) The only thing that dwarfed the guilt of our $9 cone was the 1,000 calories that we consumed.

By Sam Jacobs [http://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com/], Brooklyn Correspondent There are few times in a man's life when he can safely say, without a doubt that's he's just eaten the most fantastic, tasty, delicious baked goods in his life. If I get three, I'm going to use one right now. This past weekend I visited Tate's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2606] (formerly known as Kathleen's) in Southampton [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=southampton&section=eat] for the first time. It was Saturday morning. The line was almost out the door, but it moved quickly. I chose a blueberry muffin for breakfast along with a piping hot cup of hazelnut coffee. It was perfection in the form of a muffin. I also purchased two pies to bring to a BBQ - one strawberry-rhubarb, and one key lime. Once dessert was served, the pies disappeared within minutes. Tate's also sells a variety of cookies, dips, sauces, jellies, jams, and preserves, bread, croissants, and bagels. It's worth the 2 hour drive from Brooklyn. ~SJ Tate's Bake Shop • 43 North Sea Rd. • Southampton NY 11968 • 631-283-9830

Kumo Sushi in Plainview

***CONTENT
Located in an extremely unlikely location for a trendy sushi lounge (a strip mall in Plainview [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11803&section=eat]), this new restaurant is a fresh approach on Japanese cuisine. The mood in Kumo [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2638] is romantic and the freshness and inventiveness of the sushi caught us by pleasant surprise on our most recent visit. Special rolls leap out from the menu while the Bento Box offers the best of variety. Think of a Manhattan-ish sushi lounge in the surroundings of suburbia. We highly recommend this new sushi joint to everyone.

Rothmann's Steakhouse in East Norwich

There was a time in our life when Rothmann's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=977] in East Norwich [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11732&section=eat] was the bane of our existence. For every family get together for birthdays, anniversaries and holidays we would make our way into the restaurant (at our favorite long table for 12 in the back room) and chow down on some steak. After about a year of very frequent dining we had our fill. Fast forward roughly six years and we have given Rothmann's another well deserved shot at stardom (especially with our current East of NYC sideline.) The setting is that of the classic steakhouse. With warm woods and elegant furnishings, this is one of the top restaurants on Long Island. After dropping off the car with the valet at the front of the restaurant (which is located within the East Norwich Inn [http://www.eastnorwichinn.com/],) we headed inside to be received by the U-shaped bar and plenty of room to spread our elbows out with a few drinks. Once our entire party had arrived, we headed back to that room where I had spent so much time in my childhood. For an appetizer, my party of 5 settled on the clams orreganata and shrimp cocktail (which were huge.) Entrees ranged from petite filet mignon to Miso Glazed Chilean Sea Bass and the 2lb. lobster. Sides included sweet potato fries and your classic side of broccoli. We attempted to save room for dessert and we ordered the oozing warm chocolate cake, chocolate brownie and the banana cream pie (with a tower of whipped cream on top.) Overall, there wasn't a hiccup in the service or in the food and everyone in our party was extremely happy with all of the food that we were presented with. We're glad that we were able to start with a clean slate and view Rothmann's for what it is, an incredible NY Steakhouse, and not for what it was in the past, a second home. 516-922-2500

By Sam Jacobs [http://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com/], Brooklyn Correspondent One of the best parts about living near Red Hook, Brooklyn (aside from the vendors at the soccer fields and the brand spanking new Ikea) is Fairway. Fairway originated in Manhattan, opened in Plainview thanks to a bankrupt competitor and a family member with a keen eye for location scouting, and just last year opened in an old warehouse by the waterfront in Red Hook.As a man who had formerly shopped in the Plainview location, and was distraught over the lack of good, large grocery stores in the Boerum Hill/Cobble Hill/Carroll Gardens area the opening in Red Hook was and still is a dream come true. My girlfriend and I both love to cook.Fairway carries some of the best selections of meats, fish, fresh produce, international cheeses, and coffees, and has one of the most impressive and delicious in-house cafes.Order the Bada Bing, a behemoth of a sandwich stuffed with proscuitto, capecola, pepperoni, provolone, and sun dried tomatoes, served on a buttery Italian roll.Take it out back on a warm day and eat on the patio among local hipsters, and families with screaming children.It is a sight to behold. ~SJ Fairway Brooklyn [http://www.fairwaymarket.com/index.cfm?Area=locations] 480-500 Van Brunt Street Red Hook Brooklyn (718) 694-6868 Hours: 8AM-10PM Daily CAFE 8AM-8PM Daily

Up until this time, Waldbaum's and Food Towns were all the rage and the mass produced products that were available there became very tiresome. A transplant from NYC, this market is always buzzing with activity during its business hours. Meats, poultry, a sushi bar and bakery all add to your shopping experience.

Apartment 138 [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2530] on Smith Street achieves this and more! Opened a few years ago in what was formerly an apartment at 138 Smith Street, the owners created a place where you could get a tasty, hot meal coupled with a potent cocktail (or coffee or beer, if you prefer) well into the wee hours of the night. There are daily specials and weekend brunch that includes orange infused French toast and banana pancakes. Their regular dinner menu includes simple pressed sandwiches, a skirt steak salad over mixed greens topped with creamy crumbled bleu cheese, burgers, pastas, sliders, and my personal favorite baby back ribs topped with a sweet and tangy barbecue sauce, served with sides of spicy bakes apples and crispy mac & cheese. Last night I indulged in those ribs along with one of the best appetizers I think I've ever tasted - dates stuffed with garlic and wrapped in bacon. I described the flavor to my dinner companion as dirty porn sex - you know you shouldn't be watching (eating), but you just can't stop. We each had a specialty cocktail - mine being a concoction that was the perfect balance of gin, club soda, lemon, and other flavors. The waitresses aren't bad looking either.

Today we'll be focusing on Jordan's Lobster Farm [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2478], which offers quality seafood at low-prices (comparative to other seafood restaurants on Long Island.) As the name points out, the big draw here is the lobster which is served as a 1lb. lobster, 2lb. lobster or you can get \"The Triple\" which consists of 3-1lb. lobsters, corn, coleslaw and chips for two people. Market rates on the night that we dined were $18.95 for the 1lb., $34.95 for the 2lb. and $38.95 for the Triple. Appetizers such as the Baked Clams, Shrimp Cocktail and the Maine Lobster Roll are all big hits as well. We ordered The Triple, sat down outside at the picnic table that we claimed and waited for our number to be called. When we picked up our tray at the counter, we couldn't wait to tear into the foil to get to our new found lobster meal. The lobsters were extremely moist and the baked clams had tons of flavor. Total cost for The Triple, Baked Clam appetizer and a Manhattan Clam Chowder was $65.00. Add in the priceless view on the water and we had ourselves a nice night out. 516-889-3314

The menu is small, but sufficient - highlighting all my favorite New Orleans dishes including fried oysters, sausage-biscuit & gravy, fried shrimp & oyster po boys, succulent steak po boys, bbq yard-bird po boys, gumbo, red beans and rice, and more. They also have a full selection of Abita Beers, the local beer of New Orleans, and Cafe Du Monde chicory blended coffee and beignets which are fried dough topped with confectioners sugar, similar to the Italian zeppole or the American carnival version - funnel cake. On my last visit I indulged in a Half & Half Po Boy with shrimp and oysters, and a lightly sweetened iced tea. I topped the meal off with a plate of the beignets. I left satisfied, but not overly full. The bill for my girlfriend and I was $40, and that included two sandwiches, two iced teas, and the beignets. With an $8 tip it was a late lunch bargain, the likes of which are getting harder to find in the borough of Brooklyn. 718-596-3110 ~SJhttp://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com [http://crabapplenyc.wordpress.com] View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=411+Atlantic+Ave.,+Brooklyn,+NY+11217&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=63.134182,113.203125&ie=UTF8&ll=40.696323,-73.980217&spn=0.019522,0.025835&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

[img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/07/31/orlys_treehouse.png] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/07/31/orlys_treehouse.png]Here's a fact for you. Many people on Long Island are either parents or they at least know a set of parents with young children. We're about to let you in on a little secret that has been slowly slipping out recently. Long Island certainly isn't short on activities for children of all ages. However, not all activities are created equal in this ever-expanding market. Orly's Treehouse [http://www.orlystreehouse.com] located in Westbury has taken the usual formula of playgroups and little gyms for children and has thrown them on their head. Uniquely located in a 20,000 square foot, state of the art facility, this place is huge. Most importantly, the Treehouse caters to kids as well as to moms and dads. The most popular attraction at this colorful spot is the actual Treehouse, designed by the architects of the Long Island Children's Museum [http://licm.org/] and is situated in the middle of the play area. Flanking the play area around the outside of the building are various rooms that are set up as an art room, kids haircut area, gym area and other fun places where kids can be...well, kids. Now let's tell you about the special services that truly make this a getaway for the parents as well. There is an on-site spa [http://www.essasalon.com], gym, exercise rooms and a snack bar for parents of both sexes to enjoy while free daycare is offered for a two-hour period (minimal monthly membership required.) So while your child is stimulating their brains, you can calm yourself with a workout or a nice relaxing spa appointment. This is a little piece of paradise in a very hectic jungle. 516-333- 2277 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=1000+Shames+Drive,+Westbury,+NY+11590&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=63.134182,113.203125&ie=UTF8&ll=40.783141,-73.551922&spn=0.019497,0.025835&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

Businesses that have opened up inside the upper floor of the Great Neck Plaza Shopping Center have not had much luck when it comes to keeping the doors open. First there was a fast food chain similar to Ruby Tuesday's (Bennigan's [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25916757/] perhaps?) and a short-lived piano and jazz bar. This next business seems to actually have what it takes to shake off the curse and stay open for a long time. Capitalizing on the recent success of restaurants like The Melting Pot [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2783] and Taste [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2784], Simply Fondue [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2849] is taking their shot at trying to win over the hearts and stomachs of Long Island's fondue lovers. We wish them luck, and we'll be watching closely when they open around Labor Day to the general public. 516-466-4900 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=24+great+neck+road+great+neck+ny&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=63.134182,113.203125&ie=UTF8&ll=40.795813,-73.72324&spn=0.019493,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

[img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/photos/post_images/toast_after_hours_print.jpg] Toast Coffee House [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1640] in Port Jefferson [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=port+jefferson&section=eat] is more than just your normal coffee house. On Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights after 6PM, Toast transforms itself into an after hours Tapas bar with wine tastings and more. So if you're looking for something more than the run of the mill evening, this sounds like a great place to start. 631-331-6860 Thanks to Terence for the tip.

Every morning on the way to work, we would stop in to satisfy our coffee and muffin needs. The same held true at night when we were looking for ingredients for any dinner that we were preparing. That's why, when driving around the North Shore the other day, we came upon a brand new building being erected, and noticed the unmistakable Grace's logo. At Grace's you'll find fresh fruits and vegetables, pre-made entrees, raw seafood, meats and poultry as well just about everything else that you would expect from a specialty foods market. This location is located just north of 25A on Glen Cove Road in Greenvale. 516-621-5100 81 Glen Cove Rd. Greenvale, NY

Long Island potatoes were famous long before the Hargraves planted grape vines in the early 1970s. Of course, many of those potato fields have been replaced by grape vines, but there are still hundreds (thousands?) of acres of potatoes grown on Long Island. You might think about French fries or mashers when you think potatoes, but Rich Stabile, owner of and head distiller at Long Island Spirits [http://www.lispirits.com/], sees the ultimate raw material for making vodka. \"Long Island has a long history and tradition for producing world-class potatoes. Potatoes also produce the world's finest vodkas,\" he told me in an email last week. The distillery, on Sound Avenue in Baiting Hollow, occupies a restored barn on an 80-acre potato farm. It's there that Stabile uses 9,000 pounds of locally grown potatoes to make a single batch of vodka in two German-made 650-liter copper stills. Eventually, the barn will serve as a tasting room too, Stabile just isn't sure when. \"We are waiting on the State for the tasting room, so I have no firm date on when we will be able to open.\" Continue reading \"Long Island Vodka: LiV Vodka\" » [http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/2008/07/long-island-vod.html#more]

Sometimes located in a seemingly hole-in-the-wall and others occupying full-sized storefronts, there's almost always a line in the summertime. Almost 100 flavors of ices, shakes and smoothies seal the deal to make this one of our go to destinations. *grainy photograph taken and uploaded at night via our iPhone, so please don't hold it against us.

The opposite of \"fast food\", this type of cuisine involves using all local ingredients that lends itself to a more intimate experience with the location where you are eating. A restaurant that takes this cuisine to an art form is The Fifth Season [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=489] in Port Jefferson [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=port%20jefferson&section=eat]. With a menu that is changing week to week, each time you dine here you will have a different dining experience. Having opened in 2004 in Greenport [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=greenport&section=eat] and recently making a move just off the water to Port Jefferson, The Fifth Season is located near some of the island's greatest farming resources, and as such, they always have some of the best ingredients on the east end. The buzz is building, so you may want to check it out before the rest of the island is there with you. 631-477-8500 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=34+East+Broadway+11777&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=49.624204,57.832031&ie=UTF8&ll=40.955465,-73.064919&spn=0.019446,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

One thing that we know for sure is that if they do make the move to Huntington, Samurai Japanese Steak House [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2500] will have a run for its money. As we get more details, we will certainly keep you in the know.

Not very far away from Long Island, but far enough to warrant an overnight trip, is Mystic, CT [http://www.mystic.org]. To get to Mystic, you can take the usual car-ride through CT and wind your way through traffic and semi-trucks on the road or you could venture by sea, by heading all the way east on LI to Orient Point and taking the ferry [https://www.longislandferry.com/Default.asp] to New London, CT. From there you'll be approximately 20 minutes from Mystic. Mystic is a historic water-front town that is known for more than its role in the movie Mystic Pizza [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095690/] (for you youngin's in the audience, this is the film that put Julia Roberts on the map.) There's plenty to do for a weekend trip in this little getaway. You can take a trip to see the sea animals at the aquarium [http://www.ife.org/], take in the old ships and view the life of yesteryear at the seaport [http://www.mysticseaport.org/], take a stroll through town or just relax at your hotel [http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/gonmm-mystic-marriott-hotel-and-spa/]. If you head there the weekend of July 31st, you'll be able to partake in their wine & food festival [http://www.mysticseaport.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=home.viewpage&page_id=16038649-65B8-D398-70A52657377620D3]. Here's a list of a few of our favorite destinations while you're in the neighborhood: Abbott's Lobster Shack [http://www.abbotts-lobster.com/index.html]: Located in nearby Noank, CT, this lobster shack (and it is a lobster shack) is open from Memorial Day until Labor Day. There's always a line to order from their variety of lobster and other seafood dishes. Once you place your order, you wait at any of the picnic benches inside or out for your number to be called. Because of the huge amounts of shellfish that get consumed every day at this local hotspot, the prices are outrageously low. We always prefer to sit outside as it is on the water and you'll have a clear view of Long Island, Connecticut and Rhode Island. It truly is picture perfect. 860-536-7719. Travel time from Mysitc, CT: 10 minutes MGM Grand at Foxwoods [http://www.mgmatfoxwoods.com/]: The newest hotel opened by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, the other being Foxwoods Resort, this resort is reinventing the definition of luxury gaming in the Northeast. With a slew of world class restaurants, shopping and endless gaming, you might find that if you take a slight detour here, you may end up staying a little bit longer than you planned. 866-646-0050. Travel time from Mystic, CT: 25 minutes Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center [http://www.dpnc.org/]: Visit this 300 acre wildlife preserve to enjoy a day of relaxation among nature. 860-536-1216. Travel time from Mystic, CT: 5 minutes

[img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/07/21/img_3301.jpg] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/07/21/img_3301.jpg] Rising costs of everything from food, fuel and airfare has forced us to become creative with our choice of summer trips this year. This can work out to be a good thing as well, as we chose to embark on a nice family-friendly vacation to the Pocono Mountains [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pocono_Mountains] in Pennsylvania. We figured that three hours in the car certainly beats a seven to eight hour day traveling via plane. Instead of the normal hotel / resort accommodations, we decided to rent a house [http://www.homeaway.com/vacation-rental/p186712] in Albrightsville, PA for a true Poconos experience. The great positive about the house that we chose was that it was located in a private community with its own pool and beach on the 192-acre lake for our enjoyment. Had we been more adventurous and without kids, we definitely would have made it a point to canoe and kayak on the lake itself with the equipment that was included in our house. Calm and soothing are two ways to describe the surrounding areas. Everything about our trip screamed \"relaxation\" as we weaved our way through the mountains to our home for the weekend. Everything seemed cheaper as well, with all of the food and drinks that we consumed not hurting our wallets as much as back here in the New York Area. With that aspect of the trip, we were able to relax a little more and indulge in some of the area's finer offerings. So what's there to do in the Poconos you may ask. Besides hanging around the pool with our favorite people and touring through the countryside, you can hike, play skirmish, whitewater rafting or enjoy some of their beautiful golf courses. From our house, we hopped in the car for a ten-minute ride to Jim Thorpe, PA [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Thorpe%2C_Pennsylvania], which had a main street (W. Broadway) that consisted of a few blocks of inns and b&b's, shops, restaurants and touristy things to do. For our meal we chose the least smokiest of all of the restaurants (New Yorkers have been spoiled with our Smoke-free environments), JT's Steak & Ale House [http://www.jimthorpedining.com/], the area's oldest salon with a great bar in the front and a small dining room with tin ceilings in the back. The american cuisine ranged from cheese steaks to macaroni & cheese mixed in with your normal variety of hamburgers. The staff were very accommodating to our party and were eager to cater to our every need. After our 3-night excursion came to an end, we didn't want to go home completely empty-handed, so we made a slight detour to the Crossings Premium Outlet Stores [http://www.premiumoutlets.com/outlets/outlet.asp?id=59] to shop for our favorite brands at the lower prices that you'd expect from an outlet mall. All in all it was a great trip with great scenery and enough entertainment to keep us occupied for the entire weekend. Verdict: We can't wait to go again.

For 30 years, classic Cantonese food...the times changed, but this traditional Chinese-American restaurant never did. Nancy, Uncle Ronald, Joe the drinkmaster, Ducky, Alan, and the rest...we miss you something fierce. I hope that the rumors that the closing was caused by an illness are untrue...in any event, the best to all of you.

Flanked with privacy protection on the exterior, you can enjoy the fine drinks and American cuisine either on their front-side outdoor dining or inside the cozy and romantic dining room / bar area. As we were there for a pre-arranged happy hour, we settled into our time there with pass-arounds such as chicken satay, coconut encrusted shrimp, crab cakes and shrimp eggrolls (nevermind the full bar at our disposal.) The mood struck our fancy as there were dark hues, candles strewn on the walls, and a great looking bar, with great looking bartenders.

Sneaker Bistro [http://sneakerbistro.blogspot.com] in Patchogue retails luxury/urban streetwear and footware in a boutique atmosphere. Carrying brands like DC Life, Nike Quickstrike and Reebok Lifestyle, the products are colorful and fun - often using bright oranges, blues, reds, yellows, etc. Their exclusive sneaker collection is complimented with a few racks of t-shirts, hats and a handful of accessories. SBB didn't hold back on making the store fun - one wall displays sneakers in front of a mural - and from what we hear, they are killing the competition on LI. 580 Medford Ave, Patchogue, 631-730-7132 [http://sneakerbistro.blogspot.com/]

Upcoming Event: Comedienne Judy Gold, July 12th at Guild Hall in East Hampton

On Saturday, July 12 at 8:00pm, Guild Hall [http://www.guildhall.org], in association with the Jewish Center of the Hamptons [http://www.jcoh.org/], presents comedienne Judy Gold at The Jewish Center of the Hamptons. Gold will perform her electric stand-up, which The New York Times calls “fiercely funny, honest and moving” and Time Out declared a \"genuine mitzvah.” An actress, writer and comedian Judy starred in the critically acclaimed Off Broadway show “25 Questions for a Jewish Mother” and was nominated for a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Solo Performance. The show, based on interviews conducted with over 50 Jewish women of different ages, ethnicities, and occupations, tells each woman’s individual story of marriage, motherhood, faith, hope, love, laughter, and acceptance. It is a humorous and poignant portrait of what makes a Jewish mother a “Jewish mother.” Gold is the host of HBO’s “At the Multiplex with Judy Gold,” and also hosted Comedy Central's “100 Greatest Stand-ups of All Time.” She also hosted the GLADD MEDIA AWARDS which aired on LOGO and VH1. Her most recent TV specials include a half-hour comedy special for LOGO and she is featured in the HBO documentary, \"All Aboard.\" Her stand-up specials include “Comedy Central Presents: Judy Gold”, Comedy Central’s “Tough Crowd Stands Up”, and Judy’s HBO half-hour special, which received a Cable Ace Award. She appeared in the smash hit film “The Aristocrats”.

The bulk of their merchandise is athletic gear, but they also offer something special. With all of their merchandise set upon racks with wheels, the displays all move out of the way and free yoga classes will be offered on various days of the week. As they're just getting their feet wet with their new endeavor, more details will follow. On our visit to the new store, we noticed something very different from most of the established stores out there on the island. Everyone on the staff was super friendly, willing to talk with smiles on their faces and offering their help for whatever we needed. It sure was a refreshing visit. lululemon was founded in Canada in 1998 and they have about 80 stores open at this time. 516-741-1525

Stuart Brown, the Chef and Owner (and a graduate of the CIA) has created a wonderful atmosphere where he whips up his creative New American Cuisine to the loyal patrons who stop by 7-days a week. Our first dining experience at this small restaurant was for a private party that took over the entire restaurant. Although we were a huge group for the space, the elegant bar, cozy dining room and outdoor space in the back of the restaurant impressed us. We could imagine that it would be a spacious and special restaurant on those nights where the tables are set up in their normal arrangement. The food itself was magnificent. As it was a private party, the choices that we had for our lunch were somewhat limited, but truly noteworthy. We had the normal selections of a fish (salmon), a protein (chicken) and a pasta dish. We tried the salmon and were singing its praises throughout the course of our meal. We'll certainly revisit for a special night out with their normal menu, so that we can take in the true essence of Stuart Brown's creations.

Our work took us to Cold Spring Harbor today, to walk along Main Street and observe the different restaurants, shops and spas that lined the few blocks that make up the center of town. Located on the North Shore in Western Suffolk County, Cold Spring Harbor is a hidden marvel with a beautiful view, friendly locals and a few great restaurants and shops to pass the time away. The Cold Spring Harbor State Park and the Whaling Museum are all close, so there are no excuses to not pay a visit. We could go on and on about the great establishments in the area, but we think that we'll save that for the actual Town-by-Town guide to hit a browser near you.

In order to help make your searching through our site easier, we have recently added a brand new search tool to the right side of the page. Most of the towns with restaurants on our site have been added so that you can search through easily to find the establishment of your choice faster and with better results. We have also added a link to the Town-by-Town guides which EastofNYC and Short List LI have begun to work on together. We believe that this is truly unique to our area and will be a great tool for you to utilize. Hope this helps!

Like Gilligan and the Skipper, our party of six settled into our three-hour tour with excitement about the long meal to come. Out of the six of us, only one had ever been to a Melting Pot [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2783] restaurant, and this was in the state of Florida. Having the foresight to make a reservation was key for this meal. Be prepared for a long wait if you do not. Weaving our way through, you really get a sense of how large it is and how well-disguised the scope of this restaurant is from the street outside. A corner table, a large menu and a friendly staff all were waiting for us as we were seated in the back. Much like a korean bbq restaurant, all of the cooking takes place on your table (yes, you pay for the privilege to cook your own food, but enjoy it!). There are two electric stove surfaces on all of the larger tables. For the meal, we all decided that we should get the Fondue Fusion (dinner for two, $92/per couple), which came with a choice of a cheese fondue for an appetizer, an entree fondue (your choice of a variety of different cooking sauces and oils) and a dessert fondue. The entree included lobster tail, filet mignon, pork, jerk chicken, ravioli and shrimp. We were warned that we would leave the restaurant very full, and we certainly did. Dessert came around, and while we were all full at this point, we couldn't resist a pot of chocolate. From a choice of about 6 or seven different types of chocolate, we chose the dark chocolate and milk chocolate with peanut butter varieties. Along with the chocolate was a dessert tray that ranged from rice krispies treats, marshmallows and cheesecake. Including drinks and tip, the final price was roughly $73 per person. The verdict: on the expensive side but highly recommended for an expected long night out. 631-752-4242 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&client=safari&q=melting+pot+farmingdale&ie=UTF8&cid=40754720,-73422001,4668773515817992459&ll=41.066928,-73.287048&spn=0.621229,0.823975&z=9&iwloc=A&source=embed]

Work frequently takes me to Queens, past Bell Boulevard, but I've never made the turn onto it and explored all of the restaurants and shops located on those few blocks just off of Northern. Last night, that all changed and I was amazed by the sheer volume of restaurants that were located within such a small area. We stopped by ERAWAN [http://erawan-seafoodandsteak.com/], a classy multi-level, Thai-infused restaurant located just off of Bell Blvd. on 39th Ave. We entered the restaurant at 5pm, before a late night meeting and were the only ones in the restaurant for the entire duration of our meal. With an empty restaurant always comes a great level of attention from the restaurant staff. I ordered the Crispy Lychee Duck (Crispy Duck with Lychee, Pineapple, Cashews in a Lychee syrup) and my dining partner ordered the Koong Kana (Shrimp with asian broccoli and shiitake mushroom in an oyster broth.) Although rushed for time, we were able to enjoy the ambience of the restaurant, with the low lights, many gold figurines adorning the walls and the elegant decor. The food itself was great, pairing ingredients that we thought went well together, and the duck that I consumed (rather quickly) had deep flavor, not a lot of fat and was accompanied by the sweet lychee sauce, as promised. Had we a little more time available to spend here, we definitely would have dove head first into any one of their delicious desserts. 718-229-1620 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=213-41+39th+avenue+11361&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=51.708931,86.044922&ie=UTF8&ll=40.774952,-73.767529&spn=0.019499,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

Buying locally is good for not only the economy, but also for the earth as you'll be buying from suppliers and producers who do not have to waste all of that extra time and energy to deliver a product to you from across the globe. If you're in the area on a Saturday and have a desire for something fresh, this may just be the right place for you.

With so many great restaurants to choose from, you almost don't know where to start, or where to plop yourself down for a great meal. After walking around for a half an hour and going over the various brunch menus that were available that day we landed ourselves in the miracle grill [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=194], a great little Mexican restaurant that served us a fresh brunch filled with Breakfast Burrito's, omelette's and pancakes. We chose to eat inside, but an outdoor eating area, covered by a multi-colored roof makes your dining experience that much more enjoyable. A bar area at the front of the restaurant serves up a variety of drink specials and your standard well drinks. 718-369-4541 [img:/.shared/images/1.gif] View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=222+7th+avenue+brooklyn+ny&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=54.621153,109.6875&ie=UTF8&ll=40.679987,-73.974552&spn=0.019527,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

Although we live a few towns away from Freeport [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=freeport&section=eat] on the South Shore, we've never made it a point to head out in that direction when looking for a nice night. To turn that tide, we traveled the five miles or so to Freeport's Nautical Mile to choose a restaurant/bar that would strike our fancy. Walking up and down Woodcleft Avenue, and noticing many of the noisy and not so noisy outdoor bars, we settled on river house grille [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2244], an inconspicuous gem of a seafood restaurant located on the water. With outdoor street-side dining (which can sometimes get a little loud when the motorcycles blare through), we sampled some of their finest seafood appetizers and entrees. Bacon wrapped scallops, baked clams and calamari were a small selection of their swimming apps. On the entree side we chose to go with the Striped Bass and Lemon infused salmon. The night that we were dining there, there was a 2-for-1 special on all clams and oysters appetizers. Although we chose not to go that route as two dozen baked clams for a party of two seemed a little overboard (pun intended.) The atmosphere inside the restaurant was nice as well with small tables and a small bar located in the front of the restaurant. Open daily for lunch and dinner. 516-608-5226

The mood is romantic with candlelit tables, dark lights, a grey tin ceiling and dark colors on the walls. The highlight of this restaurant, beyond their regular America fare, is the selection of fondues. You can have your fondue as an entree with the cheese variety or you can spoil yourself in the decadence of the chocolate dessert fondue (milk chocolate or white chocolate.) The non-fondue menu includes appetizers such as wings, calamari and baked clams, entrees such as seafood and steak as well as nightly specials for your pleasure. A huge selection of 50+ wines and 30+ beers will make your decision that much harder (you can always ask for a wine sampler if you're having trouble making up your mind.)

From the LI Biz Blog [http://libizblog.wordpress.com/2008/06/04/a-drink-for-ed/] \"A pub crawl is scheduled for June 14 to benefit the great Ed Lowe, the long-time Newsday columnist. The money raised at the event will help defray some of the costs related to Lowe’s rehab tied to a stroke he suffered. Registration and lunch will begin at 3 p.m. at Abel Conklin’s Pub and Steakhouse on New Street. “Ed Lowe is one of Long Island’s most admired journalists as well as a beloved humorist and a good friend to many,” said MJ Pulling, one of the organizers of the event. “He has always been there for various charities and community organizations on Long Island that have asked him to host or speak at their events, and now Ed needs our support.”

Awaking early to a sun-filled and clear sky, our almost private beach was finally visible to us after our late check-in on night one. Located on Meads Bay on the north side of the island, the beach was a secluded area frequented by only those staying at one of the few resorts that lined the beach. At any time during our stay we did not encounter more than 10 other beachgoers. It is truly like having your own stretch of Anguillian beach. Because Anguilla is so small and the government maintains various strict policies in order for the tourism industry to thrive, the land that occupies the beaches is reserved only for commercial development and not for private houses. This was never more evident than when we strolled up and down the coastline to visit the other resorts in the area. These included Frangipani [http://www.frangipaniresort.com/], Turtle’s Nest [http://www.turtlesnestbeachresort.com/] and Malliouhana [http://www.malliouhana.com/]. For lunch we stopped in at Mahi Mahi [http://www.sirenaresort.com/restaurant.php], a great little seafood restaurant located in the Sirena resort [http://www.sirenaresort.com/] a mere 20-minute walk on the water from Carimar [http://www.carimar.com], where we are staying. The seafood was as fresh as could be with lively flavors that are pure Anguillian. At lunch we had a grilled tuna salad with sushi grade fish cooked medium rare over an assortment of mixed greens. Rounding out the rest of the afternoon we spent time bathing in the glorious waters on our secluded beach and then went back to Cap Juluca [http://www.capjuluca.com] for another wonderful dinner filled with Chilean Sea Bass, Angus sirloin and a few desserts which included Crème Brule and an amazing and oozing chocolate cake. To say that Anguilla is relaxing would be a huge understatement. We certainly have never been so relaxed in the recent past. Day three (our final day) was certainly an easier trip back to the airport than our initial day here. Leaving time to spare, we left our adopted home for the past few days to hit the ferry terminal. Once we landed in Marigot in St. Maarten we took the opportunity to relax for a few minutes and eat at Rosemary’s Seafood restaurant that was located a few steps from the ferry terminal. Shrimp, Mahi Mahi, Conch soup, New York Style chicken wings, jerk chicken and other goodies were all on the menu. Our shrimp was served in a mixture of oil, peppers, garlic and onions. Accompanying this was fried plantains, rice and beans and mashed potatoes. Sadly just after our meal we were headed to the airport to start the long journey home to New York. We have a feeling that given a little bit of time to come down from this traveling we’ll be eager and ready to return to the island once again.

To start off, let's explain how we got to our current destination, Anguilla [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anguilla], in the British West Indies. We drove to the airport, took the JFK Airtrain to Jet Blue. We landed in St. Maarten and then took a taxi over to the ferry. The ferry took us over to Anguilla (rhyming with \"vanilla\" and pronounced an-gwill-ah.) Short of a helicopter, we took all forms of transportation available to us today. Mission accomplished in roughly 8 hours from leaving the house. So why are we in Anguilla? We promised [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/2008/04/road-trip-serie.html] to bring you affordable and convenient locations that you would be able to visit with some of your spare vacation/leisure time. The water is the perfect shade of turquoise, the sand looks as though bags of white sugar were thrown about and the people on this island are some of the friendliest and hardworking people that we have ever met. On the way down to the island, we were reading a book that was recommended to us by a friend. A Trip to the Beach [http://www.amazon.com/Trip-Beach-Living-Island-Caribbean/dp/060980748X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1212209071&sr=8-1] chronicles one Vermont couple's love of the island and their attempt (and success!) of transitioning the island from their favorite vacation spot to their residence and their income generating business. They own and operate Blanchard's [http://www.blanchardsrestaurant.com/], one of the island's most popular restaurants, which is located within close proximity to our hotel, Carimar Beach Club [http://www.carmimar.com]. As Anguilla is notorious for blocking outsiders from coming in and establishing businesses as well as regulations on land use, this story is a magnificent triumph of what hard work and determination can pull off. Among the things that we have done today since arriving on the island is to check out Cap Juluca [http://www.capjuluca.com], one of the island's most luxurious hotels. We had dinner on the beach at sunset, buffet style and had one of the most relaxing dinners of all time. Our feet were in the sand, the waves echoed into the deep recesses of our minds and we were able to just let go of all of the stress that we brought with us from the mainland. We'll be spending the next 36 hours on this 16-mile long island and we hope to be able to show it to you through our lenses so that you too can come here and enjoy the sand and sun. Cheers!

This time around, we have four local wineries coming to pour: Medolla Vineyards, Martha Clara Vineyards [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=18], Roanoke Vineyards [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=27] and Wolffer Estate Vineyards [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=37]. I'm excited about this one because these are some of my favorites and we have at least one winemaker coming this time, which is always fun. We should have the food and wine pairings finalized within the next week or so, but I know the wines that are coming and there are some great ones. Tickets are available online and are $30 pre-paid and $40 at the door. I think everyone who attended the last one would agree that it was a lot of fun and I expect to see a lot of repeat attendees. Get more details and to buy your tickets today [http://www.canvasli.com/wine-event.htm]. I hope to see you there.\"

The counter is set up in a familiar way, the menus are huge and the friendly hostesses all seem to be from the local high school. The reason for all of these similarities is that the restaurant is actually owned by the same group that owns La Piazza [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=la+piazza&section=eat] (with locations in Merrick and Plainview.) We have visited this location on multiple occasions and have always found the staff very friendly and the food great. There's a mixture of pizzas (thin crust, regular pie and sicilian all make the cut) as well as a mammoth selection of pastas with meat and seafood variations (whole wheat pasta is an additional $2.50.) On our most recent trip we indulged ourselves with a small salad, the Linguine del Mare, and the Penne con Gamberoni Fra Diablo. Because the restaurant is a casual local eatery, you can feel free to bring the kids or a large group of friends at anytime of the day or night. A variety of domestic and imported beers are available for consumption as well.

Today we headed over to the Long Beach Boardwalk for a little exercise and to welcome the summer on the right note. The weather was beautiful and the boardwalk wasn't as busy as it will be in a week or two. We were joined by many friendly faces and lots of families who were biking up and down the 3 or 4 mile boardwalk. If you haven't spent time in the area, we can recommend that you come here for a day in the sun and then visit any of the local restaurants that line the main strip.

Along the Old Country Road corridor in Westbury [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=westbury&section=eat], you'll find a mixture of restaurants. There's your local versions of the familiar chain restaurants (California Pizza Kitchen and Ruby Tuesdays) an assortment of diners (Ham 'n Eggery, Majestic Diner) and Fortune [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1112], the beautiful space that used to occupy Zen Palate. It seems fitting that this former vegetarian/vegan paradise has been reincarnated like a Phoenix from the ashes into a beautifully decorated chinese restaurant. Benefitting from the design and decor that made Zen Palate a great establishment for a romantic date or a nice Saturday night out, Fortune has staked their claim and show no sign of succumbing to the same fate of its former tenant. Fortune offers a huge menu of your favorite asian classics. Chef specialties such as Crystal Duck, Rainbow Sole and Cho Cho Chicken Caserole round out this well balanced assortment of dishes. 516-333-8686 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=477+old+country+road+westbury,+ny+11590&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=27.699934,60.117188&ie=UTF8&ll=40.755125,-73.591661&spn=0.019505,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

Brooklyn Uncorked: A Retrospective

***CONTENT
From LENNDEVOURS.com [http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/2008/05/brooklyn-uncork.html]: \"Brooklyn Uncorked was a lot of fun this year. And I mean a lot of fun. How could it not be? You have 30 Long Island wineries, a half dozen breweries, a couple cheese shops, several restaurants and a lot of great, food-beer-and-wine-loving people in a great space in Brooklyn. Can it get much better? Well, I guess they could have actually intermingled the restaurants and other food vendors among the wineries so you didn't have to go downstairs to get most of the food, but that's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. Even though this was only the second edition of Brooklyn Uncorked, I'm comfortable saying that it is already the best Long Island tasting of the year. There isn’t a better way to taste over 100 Long Island wines in a matter of a few hours. With so many great drinks and eats, it’d be silly of me to try highlight all of the ones that I enjoyed, but here are a few of the best and most interesting finds. Ever heard of Bouke’ [http://www.boukewines.com/] the North Fork’s newest producer? Neither had I until I spotted their unfamiliar labels from across the room. Don’t feel bad though, Bouke’s founder, Brooklynite Lisa Donneson used Brookyn Uncorked as her label’s coming out party, pouring a dry rose and white table blend. She expects to release her lone red, a blend, in the winter. Bouke’, pronounced the way bouquet is, aims to make affordable wines that can be opened any night of the week, and we dig that here at LENNDEVOURS. Donneson thinks that wine should be an “everyday pleasure for the senses.” Gilles Martin, formerly of Martha Clara Vineyards, makes the wines. The rose ($15), a blend of cabernet sauvignon and merlot, is satisfying and certainly seasonally appropriate. The white ($18), a mélange of chardonnay, pinot gris, sauvignon blanc and Gewurztraminer is floral and citrusy. It seems best suited to ocean- or pool-side duty. Full reviews are coming once I taste them blind here at LENNDEVOURS HQ. Another wine that impressed for less than $20 was Martha Clara Vineyards’ 2007 Pinot Grigio ($16). Fresh, clean and citrusy, it’s a darn near perfect summer sipper. Just don't think too hard about it (it's not that kind of wine) and don’t expect the same boring lemon-water flavors of cheap Italian pinot grigio. This one has more depth and mouthfeel. New winemaker Juan Micieli-Martinez’s attention to detail—both in the vineyard and in the winery—is on display in this, his first release at Martha Clara. His 2007 Viognier isn’t released yet, but it’s a definite improvement on the last vintage as well. One of the more interesting wines of the afternoon came from Roanoke Vineyards. Their 2005 Blend One won’t be released for a while, but it features 52% Malbec (the 04 bottling is heavy on cabernet franc). That Malbec dominates the nose with plum and anise, but by blending it with merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc, some of the heavy, tar-like flavors sometimes associated with Malbec are smoothed out. Red production was a little low for Roanoke in 2004, but this is a wine worth keeping and eye out for. Two more reds from 2005, a meritage-style blend and a merlot, were also impressive at the Osprey’s Dominion Vineyards table. I also enjoyed, in no particular order: Shinn Estate Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc, Macari Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc, Paumanoke Vineyards 2007 Late Harvest Riesling, Long Island Meadery Pear Ceyser, Wolffer Estate Vineyards 2005 Reserve Merlot, Southampton Publick House Abbott 12, Sixpoint Craft Ales Righteous Rye, Sixpoint Craft Ales Nuthouse Brown, everything at the Channing Daughters table, Bedell Cellars First Crush Red. If you didn't make it this year, you should really try to make it in 2009. It's a great, fun event.\"

Whole Foods Market in Jericho

People have actually been known to not move into the area if there isn't one within walking distance. If you've ever been to the Whole Foods in Union Square or in Columbus Circle, you'll know that there's a huge following for their organic and fresh goods. There's never a time when the store is free and clear of people and from opening to close they are always packed. So when they opened up their newest location in Jericho about two years ago we were thrilled that some of that city mentality was making its way out east. What sets this Jericho location apart from its Manhasset counterpart is the ability to dine in as opposed to taking everything to go. Prepared foods are available in droves at this bustling location just north of Broadway Mall. When we're there, we always gravitate towards the sushi bar and the dessert counter. Since our tastes don't always match what they have out in the case, they are always very happy to make our rolls the way that we like them.

With the gas prices hitting an all-time high, we've got the perfect local spot for you where you can spend all day long and never get bored. The Planting Fields Arboretum [http://plantingfields.org/] in Oyster Bay combines many pleasures during the warm season. First and foremost it is one of the area's largest plant conservatories (a former Gold Coast estate sitting on over 400 acres,) offering up a huge variety of flowers, greenhouses and open fields that you could literally walk for days. Our suggestion is to bring a picnic basket, set up shop in one of the expansive open fields and soak up the sun. At night it turns into the center stage for the Friends of the Arts [http://www.fotapresents.org] Summer Concert series, which in previous years has drawn such huge jazz musicians as Sonny Rollins, Charlie Hunter and Kenny G. Jazz lovers will revel in the general seating on the lawn, listening to their favorite musicians, hanging out with family and nursing their favorite bottle of wine. In our opinion, this is the perfect way to end a long work week.

Weekend Brunch on Long Island: SUGO cafe in Long Beach

Because we're often in Long Beach, we feel that we have a knack for the area and what's going on in the small restaurant world there. After three failed attempts to eat at various popular restaurants because they were overbooked, we took a chance on an unknown restaurant (to us) SUGO cafe [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2825], which we had surprisingly never seen before. Upon entrance into the small walkway and up the narrow ramp, we were transported to another land by the all red decor. Billing itself as italian with an urban edge, we knew we were in for a great dining experience. A fabulous brunch awaited us, and it was only $19.99. Included in that price was a fine assortment of breads and home made jams, a main course (french toast, eggs benedict, salad, etc.), a free drink and a side order of potatoes and meat (ham or bacon.) Pleasantly surprised by this brunch, we asked if this was available on normal weekends as well, and much to our surprise, it is there for you every Saturday and Sunday. Our stumble upon is also a great find for you as well. On your next weekend day pay them a visit and see if you agree that this might be the best kept secret on LI. 516-431-7846 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=62+West+Park+Ave.,+Long+Beach,+NY+11561&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=63.39119,114.433594&ie=UTF8&ll=40.59525,-73.663073&spn=0.019552,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

I wanted to take a minute to let you in on a great product that we just received in the mail and have been loving for the past week. Vaja Cases [http://www.vajacases.com/] is a manufacturer of custom cases for a myriad of electronics, including Apple's full line of laptops and our favorite gadget, the iPhone. Our phone is now wrapped in this ultra-luxurious case. Surprisingly (or maybe not so much), we've also received a bunch of compliments from random strangers since putting the case on. Think of this product as the Bentley of the electronics case world. Upon entry to their website you'll be able to pick your product as well as customize the colors of the leather to be used. Their newest iPhone case is customizable with more than a million color combinations. Handmade in Argentina and with a 30 day turnaround time (these are custom designed), these cases will surely turn heads when wrapped around your sexy gadgets. We might even order a few more!

Two doors down from Cosi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1734] is Wild Ginger [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1257]. All types of asian-inspired dishes pop up. Pad Thai, Dim Sum, Sushi and a clever mix of assorted entrees all make an appearance on their large menu. The atmosphere is perfect for a fun and trendy evening out with a group of 2 or 10. On our last visit we tried the Dim Sum Sampler, the Maki combination (wrapped yellowtail, tuna and salmon), Pad Thai and steamed Tofu with mixed vegetables. With the warm weather coming back to our area you'll be able to dine at their sidewalk area tables. 516-487-8288 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=48+Great+Neck+Rd.,+Great+Neck,+NY+11021&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=62.876946,114.433594&ie=UTF8&ll=40.793994,-73.724012&spn=0.019494,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

They put out some tasty food, but the quality of their ingredients is decidedly lacking, and I've had an upset stomach thrice, after dining there. Additionally, they refuse to accomodate any special request. Now, I am aware of how difficult some diners requests may be but as I recall, we asked for greens instead of pasta: something simple like that. I am consistently surprised at how difficult it is to find good food in the GN area....

The first time we visited Nisen Sushi [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchbusiness=nisen&section=eat] in Commack [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=commack&section=eat] we were fooled by the drawn shades that covered the window and left before ever entering, thinking that they had closed shop. Thankfully, the next time we were wrong. A last ditch effort to gauge whether or not they were still around was met with relief as we entered this vibrant, happening sushi lounge. Packed with diners on a recent Sunday night (not an easy feat for any restaurant), we opted to maneuver our party of two to the sushi bar, to be up close and personal to the fish which we were just about to consume. Sitting at the sushi bar has its' benefits, as the chefs more often than not will provide you with a free appetizer to start with that many times will not even appear on the menu. An hour later, we left Nisen feeling stuffed, but very happy with the sushi that we had. The atmosphere was modern and cozy and the 5 sushi chefs that we counted in front of us worked non-stop from the time that we sat down until we left. The tuna and salmon that we ordered was swimmingly fresh and the staff catering to us very friendly and helpful. This sushi palace is highly recommended. 631-462-1000 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=5032+Jericho+Tpke.,+Commack,+NY+11725&sll=37.0625,-95.677068&sspn=28.252954,81.914062&ie=UTF8&ll=40.849203,-73.307648&spn=0.019478,0.025749&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

The Nisen Sushi on Jericho Tpke in Woodbury is also fantastic in case people want to venture a little further west on Long Island.

Leo's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=727] in Garden City has been open since 1942 and is one of the seminal mainstays in the great village of Garden City. Located on 7th Street, and within walking distance to the ever popular Garden City Hotel [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=sleep&id=37], Leo's offers a true local atmosphere where you'll never feel out of place, will always be welcomed with a smile and will be able to enjoy some of the finest grub and libations on tap. At our last outing here, we noticed roughly 10 domestic and local beers on tap as well as the full bar. Now that the warmer weather is coming out, you can enjoy their great food by sitting outside and one of their many tables. If the weather isn't cooperating, the wood-lined interior (with tons of pictures on the wall) will have you feeling as though you've stepped back in time to 1942. Nightly specials ensure that you'll always have something new to try. 516-742-0574 View Larger Map [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=190+7th+st.+11530&sll=40.725234,-73.634408&sspn=0.015286,0.027938&ie=UTF8&ll=40.733535,-73.629856&spn=0.007643,0.013969&z=14&iwloc=addr&source=embed]

To solve this problem, iLounge [http://www.ilounge.com] has put together a great website that will keep you up to date on all Apple, Inc. products as well as any third party accessories offered.

Directly across from The Source Mall and also just down the block from Roosevelt Field Mall, you'll want to stop by before hitting up those other cavernous spaces. Edgy menswear, which includes designers such as Cake, Dubwise, Nike and Rocksmith offer you more choices than most of the big stores in the area. Pimp your wardrobe up and pay them a visit.

The parking lot will tell you all that you need to know. Filled to capacity all the time, there is never a time where you can walk right in and not wait about 3 or 4 minutes to order.

Chef/Owner Matthew Kar presents a wonderful American menu, with local and fresh ingredients, a constantly changing menu, and an intimate and homey atmosphere to enjoy his fine cuisine. Appetizers such as grilled Ostrich, Manhattan Clam Chowder and a tasty pasta dish pleased everyone. Entrees offered ranged from Salmon to Filet Mignon as well as hamburgers for those looking for a quick, yet dependable meal. All entrees come with a salad as well. A healthy selection of local wines round out the offerings. And the best part of this meal, you ask? The price. We escaped with an appetizer, entree and drink for roughly $40 per person. That was the bargain of the day.

After our first flight of wines, we shoved our way back into the limo and directed our driver, Anthony, to Raphael [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=26] in Peconic. Pulling up to this beautiful main building, which is reminiscent of a Tuscan villa, you are suddenly transported to a distant land. Stepping inside is no different, as the enormity of the structure itself can be breathtaking. The most expensive of the four wineries that we visited (if you choose the $8 flight of wine), our party was able to taste three different varieties of wine. Based on the fact that we all took home a few bottles from Raphael, we could deduce that this was the most popular with all of us. The terrace leading out to the vines would have been beautiful and worthy of a stay of a few hours had the weather been a little warmer and less windy. Raphael is on our short list to visit again as soon as summer hits.

We're not used to too much luxury these days, but when a friend asked if he could take us and our closest friends out for a day out east hopping from tasting room to tasting room in a fine limousine [http://www.ultimateclasslimo.com/] to celebrate his wife's birthday, we couldn't resist. After an hour and a half hour ride out east, our first stop of the day was to Martha Clara Vineyards [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=18] located in Riverhead [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=riverhead&section=eat]. When we arrived at the winery, we made our way through the small marketplace area in the forefront of the tasting room and hit the most popular spot of the location, the bar. Saddled up and all ready to go, our party of 10 each chose the flight of their choice and sampled a variety of whites and reds. To the right of the bar is a smaller room that offered live acoustic music as well as large tables should you want to partake in any of the pasta dishes offered. Being that this was an early in the season Saturday, the winery wasn't overly crowded and we were able to enjoy our time without rubbing elbows with hundreds of other enthusiasts. Summers are the best time to visit if you're looking for entertainment. Two years ago they had a special concert featuring Jimmy Buffet, and the future should hold some wonderful acts as well.

Update: This location has closed [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/2009/02/closed-the-grind-coffee-house-in-bellmore.html]. The owners of The Grind Coffee House [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=154] in Bellmore [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=bellmore&section=eat] have created a unique setting in which the masses of local caffeine junkies hang out 7 days a week. With a rotating schedule of entertainment, including open mic comedy nights, musical entertainment as well as the board games that take up a good portion of the establishment's interior storage, you'll rarely find a dull evening to visit. When we visit, we always tend to play Trivial Pursuit and Poker until the sun comes up (ok, maybe not that late!) Along with coffee, a nice sized menu which includes appetizers, entrees and desserts rounds out the full selection of offerings. (516) 409-6633 FYI - Their website is no longer functioning.

This weekend we'll be heading out east to do a little \"work\" at various wineries. Until our investigation shows up here, let's revisit Castello di Borghese in Cutchogue. Last summer when we visited Castello di Borghese [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=winery&id=4], we were treated to the \"Winemaker's Walk\" [http://castellodiborghese.com/events.html] tour of the vineyard, which we loved. Upon arrival, we joined a caravan of cars as we criss-crossed our way through the winery and into the seldom-seen vineyard and processing plant. The tour, given by co-owner Princess Ann Marie Borghese, showed us from start to finish how their incredible wines are created. When all of the rooms of the facility, as well as the barrel room were toured, we headed back to the tasting room to try out a nice variety of the fantastic wines. Needless to say, we walked out with our fair share of white wine to keep us company when we returned from the east end. Find Lenn Thompson's review of Castello di Borghese's 2005 Chardonnay here [http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/2007/04/wtn_castello_di_1.html].

[img:http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/thebuzz/images/2008/04/08/nyck.gif] [http://eastofnyc.typepad.com/.shared/image.html?/photos/uncategorized/2008/04/08/nyck.gif] We've stolen this entry from our friend Lenn over at LENNDEVOURS [http://www.lenndevours.com] because we feel that this is a service that is as unique as it is pleasurable. Below Lenn explains what the club is and why you should join. If you're into wine and like to drink from where you live, we suggest that you give this a shot. \"It's been some time since I've written anything about the New York Cork Club here on LENNDEVOURS. I used to mention it once a month as we were sending out the wines, but I stopped because I wasn't sure if non-members cared. Actually, I doubt they did. But you know what? I love this club and it's something I'm really enjoying working on. And, it's something that I'd like to see succeed, because there really isn't another club like it. There are some other lesser New York wine clubs out there, but they seem to sell their members end-of-vintage wines and wines that are available at least somewhat widely. The NYCC is different. I'm scouring the state for the best, most interesting and most unique wines available. Many of these wines aren't available anywhere but at the wineries themselves...or through the New York Cork Club. I know that several of you have thought about joining but weren't sure about it. If you're not sure, give it a shot for a month or two and see what you think. If you don't like it, you can cancel at any time. If you do like it, I hope you stick around for a long while. And, we're offering these wines at lower prices than buying them direct from the winery now, so that's a bonus. I can't tell you what wines we're sending in April yet (though I can tell you that one is from a new Finger Lakes winery and one is from a tiny little Long Island producer), but I highlight some of the most interesting ones from recent shipments: Osprey's Dominion 2005 Pinot Noir: Quite Possibly the best NY pinot I've ever tasted...and only available in the tasting room until now. Raphael 2002 First Label Merlot: I don't think I've tasted a better Long Island merlot at the price. Paumanok 2004 Grand Vintage Assemblage: Though still young, a great blend that will age well Medolla 2002 Merlot: They only make 500 cases of this (their only wine) and it's a steal. Classic Long Island merlot. Rooster Hill 2006 Semi-Dry Riesling: This was a new winery for me and even though I usually prefer dry rieslings from the Finger Lakes, this one was awesome with Thai. Now, I'm working with some of New York's best known producers to dig deep into their libraries and pull out some older vintage wines that aren't even available at the wineries anymore. Stay tuned for those. Sign up today [http://brooklyn.greenegrape.com/index.php?cPath=1300&osCsid=dv2eevqctclg3smilcdci1cgh5]. I think you'll dig it.\"

Hama Sushi in Plainview

Having visited this Plainview [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchzip=11803&section=eat] location since I was around 8 years old (when it was called Yamato), I was glad to see it reinvented as Hama Sushi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2051]. This is the location where my love of sushi began as my parents introduced it to me slowly, starting with vegetable rolls and slowly transitioning into the fish variety. It's not 1986 anymore, and thankfully the decor has changed along with the times. The sushi bar all the way in the rear of the restaurant is usually filled up with locals clamoring for their fresh catch of the day. Whenever Kumo Sushi [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2638] is filled to capacity and offering a wait of more than 15 minutes, we'll head here to Hama (only 1 minute by car) for sushi that is just as good, and slightly less expensive.

If you or someone you know attends NYU, or lives in the vicinity, you must check out Insomnia Cookies [http://www.insomniacookies.com/]. Started at the University of Pennsylvania five years ago, and now spreading its wings across a variety of college campuses (including our favorite, Ohio State University...go Buckeyes!), Insomnia steps up to deliver what college kids need the most during those long nights with their heads in the books...cookies and brownies! M&M, Oatmeal Raisin, Double Chocolate Chunk, Sugar and \"Menage a Trois\" (a mixture of 3-types of cookies) are just a few of the varieties of cookies that can be ordered. The minimum for delivery is currently set at a cheap $6 for the ooey-gooey goodness. Just make sure not to forget the milk, as they can deliver that too.

Cafe Baci [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=121] in Westbury [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=westbury&section=eat] might hold the distinction of being one of the few Long Island restaurants where weekend nights have offered a 1-hour plus wait to be seated for the past 10+ years. That's okay, because you could choose, as most do, to sit at the bar in the very front of the restaurant and put that hour to good use. This wait says a lot, with the relative attention span of most people, that this italian restaurant is just as popular today as it was 15 years ago. The menu ranges from your standard pasta/seafood dishes to fresh pizzas. The garlic is heavy and aromatic and the dining room can be loud at times. Our favorite part of the meal is the pizza bread in the basket before your appetizers are served.

Road Trip: The Borgata in Atlantic City

You have to take a 5 hour flight just to be in the middle of the action. With the amount of time that it might take for you to board the next flight out of here, you could already be in Atlantic City. Atlantic City used to be a shady seaside town with gaudy Trump-owned hotels and casinos. Times are-a-changing with the development of The Borgata Hotel & Spa [http://www.theborgata.com/] (although the same gaudy Trump buildings are still standing.) In 2003 The Borgata opened it's doors and all at once made the rest of Atlantic City seem out of date and well beyond its years. With Las Vegas style trimmings (The Borgata is a Boyd Gaming and MGM joint venture) and super-trendy rooms, the hotel has been making dreams come true. The dream doesn't stop there though. The hotel has been undergoing a major renovation with construction of a new hotel tower that will feature a plethora of new rooms. In the ground floor portion of this new construction, restaurants from acclaimed chefs such as Wolfgang Puck and Bobby Flay have opened up, to accompany existing restaurants such as The Old Homestead and Specchio, to cement this as the dining destination in New Jersey. What would a trip to AC be without gambling?! The Borgata recently opened up a brand new poker room, which is located in the new wing. The room boasts 85 full-sized tables where tournaments and cash games are running 24/7. The casino also has plenty of blackjack, craps, roulette and various other games in their well appointed casino area. FYI - Also recently opened is The Pier Shops at Caesars [http://www.atlanticcitynj.com/pier_shops_at_caesars.asp] (which has replaced the old Ocean One.) Retailers such as The Art of Shaving, Hugo Boss and Tiffany & Co. have established a base here to offer tourists the high-end retail experience that they are beginning to demand. Just like Vegas, Atlantic City finally has recreational activities for families as well as non-gamblers. Good luck!

A decor that represents the four seasons, winter, spring, summer and fall have never looked better. Calming hues of white, orange, green and blue keep the seasonal areas of the restaurant separate. The bar area is always lively after work with a great-looking crowd as the restaurant is located on the busy Route 110 corridor. Similar to The Fifth Season [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=489], which we wrote about recently, the New American / Seafood menu changes seasonally as well with a complete change every 13 weeks. As happy hour [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?featureSearch=HappyHour&featureSearch2=&section=eat&searchcity=&searchzip=] is always raging, we recommend that you loosen the tie (or unbutton the top button on that blouse) and make your way over to Four Food.

As soon as I showed up and was handed an elastic rope with handles on it, I knew that I was in for something else. In the hour that we were there that morning, we stretched, power-walked, lunged, squatted and pulled a few muscles that haven't been used, well, ever. By the end I was crying Mercy and was so tired that I finally got my wish, a refreshing rest at Starbucks with all of the other mothers and fathers (and babies!) I've felt the pain of the workout since that morning and each step that I take in the house is not a pleasant one at all. So what lesson did I learn from my experience that morning? My wife who just had a baby four months ago can outlast, outwit and outplay me. Touché. About Stroller Strides: Stroller Strides is a total fitness program for new moms that they can do with their babies. It includes Power Walking and intervals of body toning using exercise tubing and the stroller. Taught by specially trained instructors, it's a great workout for any level of exerciser. Please get doctor's permission before starting this or any other exercise.

I am what is known as a Peter Lugers snob. To me the rest of the Luger clones in NYC and Long Island just don't compare......until now. I have had dinner there 3 times in two weeks. Everything about this place is awesome! The huge bar, the big tv's, the high ceilings, the balcony and of course the food. Service is hit or miss at this point and the crowds are getting very large, but besides that I think the south shore has a winner.

Irving, one of the current owners, is a member of one of the royal families in the Long Island restaurant business, as he is the son of Homer. If you'll remember way back to Homer's International (where Stresa East [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=92] is now on Jericho Tpke.), the family had a few restaurants many years ago. When Homer passed away, the kids carried on the tradition and now oversee all of the operations at Kikku. The cuisine is a mixture of Chinese and Japanese (and even a sprinkling of Thai). The small sushi bar sits at the back of the restaurant and it is encouraged for you to sit there while you dine and watch as your sushi is prepared fresh. Private rooms adorn the side and the back of the restaurant should you have a large party or request some privacy. The restaurant underwent a modest renovation a few years ago and the facelift has left the decor to be light and somewhat trendy. Click here [http://eastofnyc.com/images/listings/eat/menus/kikkumenu.pdf] to view their take-out menu. Here's an EastofNYC tip: Monday and Tuesday are half-price sushi all day. That half-price offer also continues on Saturday and Sunday before 5pm.

Since we were on the South Shore, we decided that hibachi style cuisine might work best because of the large tables with ample space for car seats as well as the variety of cuisine that could be offered. We ended up at Shogun [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1965] in Island Park [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=island+park&section=eat]. Shogun is an old-school Japanese restaurant. It's not commercialized like your Benihana's but the food is well-prepared and the variety is plentiful. You can either sit on the right side of the restaurant and enjoy the hibachi, prepared before your eyes, or you can make your way to the left of the small restaurant and enjoy the normal Japanese cuisine from the restaurant. The restaurant also features a \"Tatami\" room, which in order for you to sit at the table, you must remove your shoes. We have sat there before and it always lends itself to a more relaxing dinner. The sushi rolls are creative and those who devoured them in our party were more than pleased with their order. Fear not, because if you're skittish about large fire, oil and a close proximity to the cooking surface, you can ask them to turn the show down a notch.

Paul's [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=610] is a very unassuming restaurant/bar located on Merrick Rd. in Oceanside [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=oceanside&=Search&section=eat]. When we stepped inside, it was for a quick pre-dinner drink before we made our way to the night's restaurant. Had we not made reservations prior, we would all have been happy to sit ourselves down at a table and spend the entire night here. When you walk in, the wood-lined bar makes a great place to enjoy a nice beer on tap or a mixed drink. The full-service restaurant also pulls double duty on game day when the various flat screen tv's make this a great sports bar. You might not leave for a few hours on any given Sunday, but you'll always know that you had a great time.

Once & For All [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2800], which opened in February serves food as well as a large variety of on-tap beers.

A world-renowned chocolatier, Mr. Torres has been hand-preparing some of the finest chocolates and pastries in the area at his Brooklyn (DUMBO) shop [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=616]. Among the long list of items available in their shop is the hot chocolate which is rated as one of the finest in the Metropolitan area. Head on over there next time you're in Brooklyn and tell us what you think. An added FYI: If you're big into chocolate and are in the NYC area, make sure that you don't miss Max Brenner's [www.maxbrenner.com] digs on 14th St. This is perhaps the largest chocolate themed restaurant that we have ever been to.

Don't ever understimate the power and quality of an over-commercialized establishment. This is the lesson that I take with me every time I step foot in this behemoth of a restaurant. I might be a creature of habit (I usually only get the Miso Salmon here) but each time I visit Grand Lux [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2511], I love it. I might be guilty of buying into the whole hype of a mass-produced dining experience that lacks the intimacy of your local mom and pop restaurant [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=804], but they are doing something right to keep me coming back. The bar is warm and inviting, the take-out desserts provided by the Cheesecake Factory (same owner) will have you salivating while you endure your 45 minute wait and the decor is certainly well-thought out and complete. Here's an East of NYC tip of advice: they make sure you know about their \"baked to order dessert\" before they take your order, but we advise against this! Don't order dessert while your stomach is growling! Delay gratification for 15 minutes after dinner if you are still hungry. Don't take the bait! Don't do it! You're welcome.

When we were in high school, we used to escape to the Witches Brew [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1659] on weekend nights to escape the clutches of our parents and enter a world where espresso concoctions and a goth clientele ruled the day. Now that we're actually closer in age to our \"old\" parents than the high school students of our past, we've been itching to go back, sit on the dark and comfortable couches and order up a \"black cat\" and a nice piece of chocolate cake. The hair on our heads may not grow again and the extra post-college weight will stay on, but we can still be taken back to a time that was simpler and very enjoyable. You may not be able to keep those eyes open until the 2am closing time, but a daytime visit may be enough to let those caffeinated drinks take a hold of you.

Luckily for the restaurant, the biggest problems they had were with the management of the business and not the cleanliness of the back kitchen. The menu has been revamped and is now of a lighter fare than its previous incarnation. The decor has also been lifted since Kitchen Nightmares made their unforgettable visit, and we have heard that it is quite busy on the weekends.

With tonight being seasonably mild, we decided that it was as good a night as any to try out the restaurant. The restaurant was quiet while the bar area was seeing some action. The bar actually had 11 flatscreens and 1 giant projection screen with my count. This is definitely the place to watch the game with a few friends on a lazy Sunday. Wednesday nights are lobster nights as a few lobster specials were available to us if we chose. We ended up having the shrimp salad and the grilled chicken sandwich. All in all this was a great restaurant with a lot to offer to young crowds as well as old. We'll be back to sample more of the laid back cuisine before the crazy summer nights begin (and maybe we'll hit up one of those as well!)

Manhattan Prices, Suburban Service

I've been to Brasserie Cassis on three separate occasions, all in the last two months. The food and service went from fantastic, to ok, to bad rather precipitously. At my last meal there,some dishes were presented in a manner not at all like the one described in the menu. Service was slow, mistakes in deliveries (wrong entree brought to table) and the busboys could only be described as inept. I shouldnt HAVE to help them or tell them what to do. After all, it's my night out. If I wanted to hand over dishes and direct their placement, I would have stayed home and let the kids make me dinner. Brasserie Cassis is starting to tank, and tank fast. They need to get on their best game face, and do it in a hurry. Or get ready to fold, because people will not tolerate this level of ineptitude at the current pricing

Featuring movies and tv shows from the above mentioned studios, some of your favorite shows have found their way onto the free website. Although some shows are ad-supported, you'll never miss your favorite episodes of Arrested Development, The Office and Family Guy again. You may thank me, but I'm sure your boss will want to kill me for unleashing this new site on you. Enjoy!

Having moved to the island in 2005, we were longing for some of the same on a regular basis out here, but didn't know where to find it. One day, as I was walking through the fabulous village of Great Neck [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=great+neck&section=eat], I happened to stumble into Entre [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2603], a cute little cafe on Grace Ave. and Bond St. to grab a quick drink. Imagine my delight when I saw that on their menu they have an assortment of tapioca bubble teas as well as fruit teas. For the uninitiated, these bubble teas are prepared cold with the tea and the tapioca pearls added. They are then placed into a machine that violently mixes them together (similar to a paint-mixing machine.) The result is an incredible frothy concoction that is refreshing in every way.

Long Island is one of the best grape-growing regions in the area. The east end is bettering itself every year with new techniques, new wines and an abundance of entrepreneurs who are pushing the limits of their trade. With the spring approaching quickly, you'll probably be like us and spend a large portion of your time in the car and enjoying the nice weather. The selection of wineries [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?section=winery] (38 on our site at last count) will keep your palette busy on a never-ending search to quench that thirst in the coming summer months. We dare you to make a summer out of it and try to hit each vineyard with a tasting room.

User Review: La Villini in East Northport

A great find of a restaurant in East Northport [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=east+northport&section=eat], La Villini [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=2796] is a family style Italian restaurant on Larkfield Rd. I would suggest starting with the antipasta platter and asking for it chopped. No matter what you have the food is always amazing from any kind of pasta, to fish or veal. The food is always enough for at least two people to share. What also makes this such a wonderful place is the staff. They all have such personality that it makes you want to go back. The owner always remembers a face and stops by to ensure you are enjoying your meal. They have two dining rooms and a bar. They cater as well. Review courtesy of Lyn L.

At the most recent LI Pulse [http://www.lipulse.com] party that we attended, Blue Point sponsored the drinks for the night and we finally had the opportunity to try their seasonal Blueberry Ale which we had been itching to try for the longest time. The blueberries infused a subtle fruity flavor into the ale and we were hooked from the first sip. Founded in 1998 Blue Point offers tasting hours Thursday (3-7pm), Friday (3-7pm) and Saturday (Noon-7pm) so that the general public can experience the seasonal and standard brews. On your next free weekend, hop on over to Blue Point and have a try. FYI, Blueberry Ale can now be found at Whole Foods Market.

Il Fornetto [http://eastofnyc.com/details.asp?section=eat&id=1168] is one of those neighborhood restaurants that is good enough to travel to from other areas. When we spent time working in the Brooklyn [http://eastofnyc.com/search.asp?searchcity=brooklyn&section=eat] area a few years back, we used to head over to this restaurant/bar for our lunch break at least once a week. Situated on the water, it is the only waterfront restaurant left (many of the parcels of land have been developed into residential buildings.) On the menu are some of the freshest seafood dishes around as well as one of the best calamari appetizers that we have ever had. Private rooms for catering are available as well as a front-end bar that houses an OTB where food is served as well in a more relaxed environment.

As day turns into night, so does the atmosphere at Waterzooi. The late night crowd is always festive and plentiful. If you have ever wanted to try a specific beer that you can not find anywhere else, this is your place. While you're there, make sure to try one of the several types of pots of mussels (moules) and the Belgian fries (frites). (516) 877-2177 P.S.

East of NYC [http://www.eastofnyc.com] was formed in late 2005 by a group of city dwellers that suddenly found themselves transplanted to Long Island and the quiet surroundings of suburbia. Rather than looking for something to do, they decided to start up an online guide for everyone who at some time or another has been looking for a place to eat, somewhere to go, a hotel to put up their in-laws, or a location to just simply enjoy their time. Our goal is to keep you informed of all of the great restaurants, shops, local finds and events that this large island has to offer all the way from the westernmost point of Brooklyn to the eastern end of Montauk.

Hi, Just found your site & blog this morning...looks terrific...have already subscribed... Live in Glen Cove, office in Great Neck... Some constructive criticism: 1) You already list the phone number in your thumbnail descriptions...How about giving street address right up front so we don't have to click through just to get the address 2) You'll probably consider this a nit-pick, but you should tighten up your proof-reading a bit...(example: in review of Shogun in Island Park, \"skittish\" is misspelled; Location of BBQ reaturant in Long Beach is on \"Beech Street\" not \"Beach Street\")...Not major league boo-boo's, but they detract from your otherwise fine effort. Meanwhile, I look forward to more East of NY info...keep up the good work!

Brooklyn Uncorked: A Retrospective

***CONTENT
From LENNDEVOURS.com [http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/2008/05/brooklyn-uncork.html]: \"Brooklyn Uncorked was a lot of fun this year. And I mean a lot of fun. How could it not be? You have 30 Long Island wineries, a half dozen breweries, a couple cheese shops, several restaurants and a lot of great, food-beer-and-wine-loving people in a great space in Brooklyn. Can it get much better? Well, I guess they could have actually intermingled the restaurants and other food vendors among the wineries so you didn't have to go downstairs to get most of the food, but that's a minor complaint in the grand scheme of things. Even though this was only the second edition of Brooklyn Uncorked, I'm comfortable saying that it is already the best Long Island tasting of the year. There isn’t a better way to taste over 100 Long Island wines in a matter of a few hours. With so many great drinks and eats, it’d be silly of me to try highlight all of the ones that I enjoyed, but here are a few of the best and most interesting finds. Ever heard of Bouke’ [http://www.boukewines.com/] the North Fork’s newest producer? Neither had I until I spotted their unfamiliar labels from across the room. Don’t feel bad though, Bouke’s founder, Brooklynite Lisa Donneson used Brookyn Uncorked as her label’s coming out party, pouring a dry rose and white table blend. She expects to release her lone red, a blend, in the winter. Bouke’, pronounced the way bouquet is, aims to make affordable wines that can be opened any night of the week, and we dig that here at LENNDEVOURS. Donneson thinks that wine should be an “everyday pleasure for the senses.” Gilles Martin, formerly of Martha Clara Vineyards, makes the wines. The rose ($15), a blend of cabernet sauvignon and merlot, is satisfying and certainly seasonally appropriate. The white ($18), a mélange of chardonnay, pinot gris, sauvignon blanc and Gewurztraminer is floral and citrusy. It seems best suited to ocean- or pool-side duty. Full reviews are coming once I taste them blind here at LENNDEVOURS HQ. Another wine that impressed for less than $20 was Martha Clara Vineyards’ 2007 Pinot Grigio ($16). Fresh, clean and citrusy, it’s a darn near perfect summer sipper. Just don't think too hard about it (it's not that kind of wine) and don’t expect the same boring lemon-water flavors of cheap Italian pinot grigio. This one has more depth and mouthfeel. New winemaker Juan Micieli-Martinez’s attention to detail—both in the vineyard and in the winery—is on display in this, his first release at Martha Clara. His 2007 Viognier isn’t released yet, but it’s a definite improvement on the last vintage as well. One of the more interesting wines of the afternoon came from Roanoke Vineyards. Their 2005 Blend One won’t be released for a while, but it features 52% Malbec (the 04 bottling is heavy on cabernet franc). That Malbec dominates the nose with plum and anise, but by blending it with merlot, cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc, some of the heavy, tar-like flavors sometimes associated with Malbec are smoothed out. Red production was a little low for Roanoke in 2004, but this is a wine worth keeping and eye out for. Two more reds from 2005, a meritage-style blend and a merlot, were also impressive at the Osprey’s Dominion Vineyards table. I also enjoyed, in no particular order: Shinn Estate Vineyards 2005 Cabernet Franc, Macari Vineyards 2007 Sauvignon Blanc, Paumanoke Vineyards 2007 Late Harvest Riesling, Long Island Meadery Pear Ceyser, Wolffer Estate Vineyards 2005 Reserve Merlot, Southampton Publick House Abbott 12, Sixpoint Craft Ales Righteous Rye, Sixpoint Craft Ales Nuthouse Brown, everything at the Channing Daughters table, Bedell Cellars First Crush Red. If you didn't make it this year, you should really try to make it in 2009. It's a great, fun event.\"

Well, the time has come. The doors are open and the crowds are starting to slowly trickle in. Coming back from a long day in Central Park, we decided to bypass our usual NYC Pinkberry [http://www.pinkberry.com] or red mango [http://www.redmangousa.com] yogurt stop to try out the new (and slightly healthier) version that we've heard about at brew 7. Here there were three choices for yogurt. You had your plain, green tea and coffee flavors (or you could swirl plain & green tea or plain & coffee.) Also part of their offerings were a full menu of coffee drinks and various baked goods for dessert. We used to have the Midtown Tunnel as our buffer for this frozen goodness, but now it looks like we'll be visiting often for the cool and refreshing yogurt. There is no phone number yet and their website is still in development. We'll let you know as soon as they're up and running.

We're happy to not have to travel to the city anymore to relive this experience as muddworks [http://www.mudd-works.com] has just opened for business. Located in Great Neck on Bond Street, right next to Hinata Asian Fusion, this pottery joint is open to the public and also hosts private parties for kids (and adults) of all ages. The way that it works is you walk in and pick anything on the shelves that you want to paint. You choose all of your paint colors that you want to use, paint the pottery and then leave it for approximately 7-10 days. After that time, you get to pick up a custom-made piece of pottery, designed by you! With over 300 different items to choose from, you'll never leave here with the same two pieces. (516) 305-4900
