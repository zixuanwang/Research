Could there be trouble in Food Studio paradise? Two interesting issues have taken a bite out of the upcoming Speranza Food Studio in Woodbury. First, Four Food Studio in Melville has enacted a lawsuit to bar them from using the \"Food Studio\" name with which they have become known for. In just the past few days, to add insult to injury, the lender that has issued Speranza with their construction loans (according to this bulletin board, anyway), Agape World, has been closed down while an investigation into whether or not the lender is a large Ponzi scheme, accused of bilking investors while getting rich themselves.With all sorts of shenanigans happening before their (unknown) future launch, only time will tell if they are going to survive until opening day.

I was there this past Thursday March 12th 2009. All I can say is that the entire staff was not trained correctly and is poorly train and do not know what they are doing. Also they did not have enough glasses so 2 of the bartenders, male and female were taking used glases off the counter and reusing them without washing them. All thy would do was take them from one customer when the glas was empty and put ice and liquor and hand them to another customer. The health inspector should go there and close the place down. It is disgusting!!!
