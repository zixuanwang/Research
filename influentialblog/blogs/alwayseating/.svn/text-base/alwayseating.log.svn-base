On a recent weekday night I made it over to wine super restaurant Veritas for a business dinner. Veritas had always been a restaurant I heard of, but I didn't know anyone who had been there. They were a top wine destination in the city, but that's about all I knew about the restaurant across the street from Gramercy Tavern.Entering the restaurant we are met with a gorgeous bar, packed with a variety of well dressed men and women, sipping vino and enjoying the newly added bar menu. We sunk into a comfortable booth in the back, with a great view of the somewhat quaint dining room. A party was taking up a good portion of the room as others ordered wine by the glass, with a lucky table donning a magnum. The menu here is prix fixe only in the main dining room, meaning you're not going here for the recession special. On the contrary, you're getting some pretty fabulous food, service and more for about $90 a person, excluding wine of course. Cheap? Nope. But it is fairly priced, something I really only noticed AFTER we ate. The soup amuse, which I surprisingly cannot fully remember, was delicious and a great start to the evening.My courses were comprises of Frogs Legs, Veal Sweetbreads and a Rhubarb Tart Tartin. The Frogs Legs were sauteed with baby chanterelle mushrooms, and served with a fresh garbanzo puree, parsley coulis and fried spring onions. The tiny frogs legs were extremely tender, and at 6 to 7 per dish it was quite the starter. I would have preferred a slightly thinner puree, but that would be my only complaint. My Veal Sweetbreads entree was stellar, the best bite of the evening. Served with a spelt risotto, white asparagus, and morels, it was rich and reminded me of the changing of seasons, from winter to spring. There was a potent rosemary scent throughout the sweetbreads and the sauce was prominent, without overpowering the perfectly prepared vegetables. I would get this again, heck I would get this many times over.My dessert was good, but I found the Rhubarb Tart Tartin overshadowed by amazing petit fours. A serving plate of 6 different tastes graced our table along with a nicely plated cheese plate. Each petit fours was a work of art, with my favorite resembling a remarkably small cream puff. In such a small bite I sampled 6 very unique desserts, a quite impressive end to the meal.To top it all of the wine was as expected, impressive and abundant. From a sparkling rose to the dessert wine, each wine paired well with the courses, with a particularly good Italian red, which stole the show (I'm trying to get the name). In full disclosure, the restaurant treated us well, providing us with a great table and extra attention on the wine front. With that said, it's hard to believe the restaurant not providing stellar service. Some dishes may make you yearn for more, others may merely be okay, but more likely than not you can expect a solid meal worthy of any special occassion, just plan ahead and block of a few hours of your time.43 E 20th St, New York, NY 10003, 212-353-3700, Price - Expensive ($95-150/person), Reservations - Recommended

Tonight, around 9:30 the most outstanding restaurateur award at the 2009 James Beard awards was announced. It was Drew Nieporent. However, the New York Times Diner's Journal blog, had already posted this 30 minutes earlier, along with the winners of a few other prestigious awards (most outstanding restaurant and most outstanding chef). It's disappointing for many people that this happened, ruining the surprise that many of the attendees (excluding myself) have been awaiting since they sat down almost three hours ago, and word has it many people got up before the event even ended since they heard the result. What's more, it shows the negative aspect of live blogging and the urge to share and post information before others in this digital age. On the one hand, is the New York Times at fault for posting this information OR is it the James Beard Foundation's fault for releasing the winners too early. I'm sure this will be debated all night and morning, but it does shed light on the live blogging faults, and it is only one of many I am sure we will see with more and more people using Twitter to share \"breaking\" news. Let's just hope that mistake doesn't come from me next time!See the premature award notice here Diner's Journal: Beard Awards AnnouncedUpdate: and Eater sheds more light on the whole NY Times/JBA debacle last night. Turns out the Washington Post posted the winners a few minutes before the NY Times, but the real culprit here are those behind the JBA's. It seems they released the winners, to a few select papers and asked them not to post them until 9pm. Well, the event ran long, the winners were announced at 9pm and all sort of Twitter and Blog hell let loose. So what does this teach us? Well it means award shows, with sealed results, should remain sealed in the future. Check out Eater's great story here: More words on the JBA spoiler.

***CONTENT
Part 2 of my Houston food tour brings me to my second objective when visiting Houston, BBQ. Now in NY we have had a surge of BBQ spots open over the past few years, some of them bad, others quite good. However, I've always known there is more to BBQ than what I had here. This brings me to my quest for the best BBQ in Houston. I thank a number of people for chiming in, but most of all Alison Cook of the Houston Chronicle (Cook's Tour Blog as well). Thanks to her I found myself driving about a dozen miles outside of the center of Houston, into a relative bare neighborhood with stray dogs and plenty of overgrown lawns. What I found here redefined BBQ as I know it. Words really can't describe the experience at Burns BBQ. This in the middle of nowhere, joint in a rundown neighborhood and it resembles more of a house than a restaurant, but this sure is not simple home cooking. Burns has no seating inside, just a few picnic tables out front, but don't be afraid to eat in your car as many people do. There is minimal space inside, and it gets rather cramped. Order, get your number and stay alert. The menu is simple, brisket, ribs and two kinds of sausage. Sides are limited to beans and potato salad, but these are not your average sides. I ordered the meat platter for 2-3 planning to share with my hungry, Houstonian friend for a measly $23 (photo above, though it doesn't do it justice).Unfortunately they forget to throw in the housemade sausage, but it was an afterthought once I tasted the delicious smokey meat in the Styrofoam container. Brisket piled high, it was the first thing we attacked. Tender, moist, with great flavor and deep smoke rings, it was a surprise it was so lean without being dry. By far the best brisket I have ever had, and I honestly don't expect to find better. Topped with a little house BBQ sauce it was heavenly. The ribs were also a work of art, slightly crispy on the outside, they were tender on the inside with a welcome porkiness. A bit fatty, they were quite greasy, but no complaints here. A side of the house beans, resembling a chili almost, was quite addictive and I understood why someone commented \"you'll wish you ordered a bigger one\" after we sat down with our food. If i wasn't convinced enough that this was good BBQ well, it was good as leftovers, case in point, that brisket was delicious 24 hours later heated in the microwave, achieving greatness that even some northeast BBQ spots cannot with a fresh piece of meat.For some unexplainable reason, we found our BBQ stuffed selves driving back into the city with the goal of eating crawfish. Why? Well, I don't really know why since I probably could have forgone eating for the rest of the day, but eat crawfish we did. It may not have been the premier spot for these little morsels, but Porch Swing, a popular bar, was serving up crawfish across their front porch. We ordered a 6 lb bucket of crawfish, complete with corn, potatoes and a pitcher or two of beer and there went the afternoon. This batch was quite spicy and although there were many little rejects, it was great to just sit outside make a mess and enjoy myself.Later in the evening a dinner wasn't even necessary, but I did find myself at a Jack in the Box drive through on the way home from a number of Houston area bars. Never before had I been to a Jack in the Box, but I have to say, late night I certainly could have been eating worse.The following morning a Tex-Mex breakfast seemed to be the only thing I needed and my friends did not let me down. Maybe not the most authentic of spots, but Buffalo Grille was a great choice, perhaps due to the quantity of food, or maybe just the overall value, but it was a tasty brunch that held me over for the majority of the day. After waiting in a line which extended out into the sidewalk in front of the restaurant we made it to the counter, there was no lunch service, but as soon as I spotted the Huevos Rellenos I knew what I wanted. I ordered up and a few minutes later my name was called. Piled onto my tray were two anaheim chiles, stuffed with pork sausage and cheese, deep fried (of course), topped with two fried eggs, more cheese and a delectable green chile sauce. All of this served with fresh tortillas, refried beans and a vibrant pico de gallo. Now I know, this is not the most authentic of tex-mex brunch meals I could have had, and yes it reminds me of something you may hear about on This is Why Your Fat, but this was a mighty tasty dish. Every ingredient worked individually, but came together nicely, and those tortillas just sopped up all the remaining egg, cheese and green chile sauce. A freshly made dish, that surely sticks to the ribs and doesn't break the bank, that's what Buffalo Grille does best.Some how later that day I made it to Feast where I gorged on more food, like pigskin, stuffed veal heart, blood pudding and more. How I did it, well I don't know, but pretty much every bite of food from the start of the trip to the end of the trip was worth it (with the exception of those fish tacos at Berryhill). I'll remember this trip well and look forward to my next stop there, which will likely include Burns BBQ and Feast to say the least.

It's been awhile since the last post so here is my effort to get caught up. I never finished my recap of Houston, a food-filled weekend a few weeks back. While my meal at Feast was remarkable, there were plenty other bites that are not to be forgotten. With Tex-Mex and BBQ on the mind I managed to score some delicious food. My Tex-Mex craving found me at hole-in-the-wall joint Los Dos Amigos. It was the setting I was looking for, no frills, super cheap, everything homemade. We scoured the menu and came up with a few platters to share as well as a couple of quesadillas to start. The Carnitas Platter, the house specialty, came with a pile of slow roasted tender pork alongside beans and rice. It was by far the best dish, perfectly seasoned and something I had to stop myself from eating. We also ordered the Carne Asada platter and the #1, or a combo platter with cheese enchiladas, a beef taco and a cheese tostada. Each platter came with a bowl of fresh guacamole, and fresh tortillas and chips. The carne asada was disappointing, and was just not a tender, flavorful piece of meat. The combo platter was good, not great, but I did thoroughly enjoy sopping up everything with the fresh tortillas. Overall a great value with a few standout dishes, but I am sure there are better places in Houston.My next day in Houston resulted in a 6+ mile walk, sunburnt arms and plenty of good eating. Stopping by BB's Cajun Cafe, one of the relative newcomers to the Monstrose area dining scene, I was determined to get a po'boy. I know, I know, I'm in Houston, but I had to have the popular southern sandwich and this seemed to be the best spot. The Catfish Po'boy was good, tasty and served on the right type of bread. The fish was fresh, although I've had better numerous times. as a side I ordered some Boudin Balls, delicious little morsels of sausage and rice. I asked for a side of the restaurants famous gravy and I see exactly why people rave about it. The rich, dark, beef flavored gravy is quite addictive and extremely popular poured on the Roast Beef Po'boy. A recommended spot for a small bite of New Orleans.While I was certainly not that hungry anymore I was still in the mood to try more food. I had done the Tex-Mex, but on this gorgeous day a fish taco and a margarita sounded excellent. I had read on numerous sites that Berryhill Baja Grill served some of the best in the area. While the restaurant has a few locations many of the Chowhounders of bloggers seemed to know what they were talking about. Well I have to firmly disagree with all the Berryhill advocates. This was perhaps the worst fish taco I have ever had, not just in Houston, but across the country. The fish is deepfried, generally a delicious idea, but it only tasted like old fryer oil. This greasy, unappealing tasting fried piece was topped with a bland \"slaw\" and lacked any realy flavor. Let's just say, at least I had a margarita.For dinner that evening a trip to the Vietnamese neighborhood, something I eagerly anticipating after reading about the large Vietnamese population in Houston. The BYOB spot called conveniently Vietnam Restaurant, was a bit tacky, in a trying too hard to be flashy kind of way, but the food had promise upon first look. We ordered up a feast of course, complete with Spring Rolls, Charbroiled Beef with Vermicelli, Special Fried Rice and Black Pepper Shrimp. Of the dishes we had the Black Pepper Shrimp were by far the best. The combination of the large, plump fried shrimp combined with the stir fried onions and potent black pepper sauce was quite impressive. Overall a solid, well priced meal, especially when compared to NYC prices.With day one in the books I realized this trip was only getting started. In a 24 span I had managed to visit 4 spots and only anticipated visiting more. Next stop, the best BBQ of my life, stay tuned.

Are you talking about Vietnam Restaurant on 19th in the Heights? It's OK, but there are so many amazing Vietnamese places in town! It sounds like you have great tour guides on hand, but if you're still around, grab some local BBQ at Pierson's, and don't miss the softshell crab at Reef.

For my recent trip to Houston there were just a few things I wanted to do, get some Tex-Mex and indulge in some real Texas BBQ. Never would I have expected that one of my more memorable meals to date would be in Houston, let alone \"Rustic European Fare.\" Feast is a restaurant like no other in Houston, and for that matter I highly doubt there is a restaurant like it in all of Texas. The cuisine is simple, rustic and devoid of frills, highlighting the ingredients on the plate and nothing else. However, that ingredient may very well be veal heart, or beef tongue, but also braised lamb shank or crispy pork belly. Feast has a wide range, from the mostly social acceptable dish to the somewhat fear inducing and that is just one of the reasons this is a special place.After asking around and reading review by the Robb Walsh of the Houston Press and Alison Cook of the Houston Chronicle I was completely sold. (More recently, Frank Bruni of the NYTimes stopped in and gave it a glowing review, hopefully boosting business, but likely making reservations harded to come by.) My friend and I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes before 7pm on Sunday for our reservation, the restaurant was mostly empty, a sad sight of course, so we had our choice of seats. We could have sat down anywhere, as the environment is quite comfortable, in an old wooden house type of way. Having already made up our mind to go with the tasting menu ($49!) we selected a glass of white and a bottle of red to share. The tasting menu is made up of 9 courses, an absolute steal for anyone, and coming from NY quite the bargain.The courses started with delicious housemade bread and a warm Beet and Cumin Soup. The soup was topped with a dollop of yogurt and was a nice beginning to our meal, albeit tame. Following the soup was a course a bit more interesting, Stuffed Pigskin. Most people I've dined with over the years would scoff at this dish, it's a hard dish to get used to since it is served cold, but once you can get by the textural differences it is very tasty. The skin is about a quarter inch thick or less and is soft, not crispy, filled with sausage and herbs and complemented by an orange and radish salad, a very unique dish all around.To this point our service had been wonderful, food delicious and the overall experience memorable, but the heart of the meal, in my opinion, was where the restaurant really shines. A dish of Black Pudding topped with a fried egg was comforting and a hefty serving of English peas and mint kept the richness in check. The Veal Heart, sliced into 4-5 pieces, is served with a refreshing and crisp carrot and coriander salad. The heart itself resembles a minute steak almost, but with much more interesting flavor, it was one of my friends favorite dishes, something remarkable seeing as how he has never ventured into offal or \"lesser-known cuts\" before.Moving along to the heftier courses we were served Beef Tongue with bacon, spinach and lentils. I've had tongue before, but this was a new way for me to try it, almost delicate in its preparation, it was delicious and paired with addictive lentils. We both thoroughly enjoyed this dish and had to slow ourselves down realizing four courses still remained. For our sixth course we took a little departure from meat and offal with a Whole Roasted Rosebud, a small fish similar to Red Snapper. The fish had the head and tail on and was roasted to a wonderful golden brown on the outside, remaining tender and moist on the inside. It was a little challenging to get all the meat out of it, but well worth it, and was served with kale and mashed potatoes. I could have done without the mashed potatoes, and the kale was extremely salty, but the fish was a much needed \"light\" course.Rounding out the savory courses was the Crispy Pork Belly atop a potato cake with red cabbage and apples. This was my favorite savory course of the day, and perhaps the best pork belly I have ever indulged in. A massive portion for a tasting menu, the pork belly appeared fried since it was so crispy, but in fact it was roasted, skin side down to achieve a bubbly, crispy texture. With a great meat to fat ratio it was easy enough to cut and chew, but had all the richness you would want in pork belly. The potato cake was a nice touch, although it was a little overcooked, and the cabbage and apples brought rounded the dish out, with a bit of acid helping to cut through the fat a little bit.A small bowl of Lemon Sorbet served as our eighth course was a nice palate cleanser, and prepped us for the rich Sticky Toffee Pudding served last. The pudding was amazing, served warm, it roughly fell apart with barely any effort and after plenty of fatty, salty bites throughout the nearly 3 hour meal, it was a nice way to end everything. Through it all we drank a nice bottle of red (the name escapes me), chosen from the restaurant's well-rounded wine list. The food at Feast is definitely forward thinking, but not in the molecular way, but more aimed at educating diners on all the delicious animal parts which we as a culture generally shy away from. There are dishes fit for the less adventurous diner, like lamb shank, fish pie and variations on duck as well, making it easy to find something for every palate. The English background is clear in the cooking as well as several Eastern European influences, and to me this is certainly the type of restaurant that every major city should have and embrace. Being able to dine in a no frills atmosphere, with such a high standard of creative, thought provoking food is a joy and I will never forget it. Thank you Megan, James and Richard for my feast.219 Westheimer Road, Houston, Texas, 713-529-7788, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate (40-100/person depending on tasting menu)

true, $40 a person is really not expensive by NYC standards, but I think what is most important is the great value. Huge courses of inventive, unique food and a great atmosphere to boot. $49 for 9 courses is one the best dining deals in the country

I've chatted about Pam Real Thai at some point, not sure when, but it is one of my favorite Thai spots in the NYC area. I used to frequent this place every few weeks when I was in Hells Kitchen more often, but now that I am in Brooklyn I barely see it. Well on a recent weekend I was in the neighborhood and felt the need to revisit my old friend. A super inexpensive spot, Pam Real Thai is cash only and always bustling. Tonight Hung, Top Chef winner from a few seasons back, was there dining with friends. It was great to see him there, but sorry Hung, I was here for the food. My top dish whenever I go out for Thai is Pad See Eiw, occasionally spelled a bit different around the city, but generally the same dish: broad rice noodles, beef or chicken, egg and Chinese broccoli in a sweet soy based sauce (I recommend beef). This was great, but the real star of the night was a dish I'd never had before: Anchovy Fried Rice ($7.50). This rice dish simply had everything, fried jasmine rice, anchovy paste, Thai omelet, scallions, honey pork and tiny dried shrimp. Specked with Thai chilies this dish hit so many notes, the sweet, salty and of course spicy. The dried shrimp offered not only a salty note, but a crunch, adding to the already complex textures. Overall it's one of my new favorite dishes here and something I highly recommend if you are looking for something a little different.404 West 49th Street, 212-333-7500, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($10-20/person)

It was a wet blustery night yesterday, the perfect night to do a cross Manhattan bar crawl, right? Well yes it was and after a start in the dreaded midtown I shifted gears and made it to the East Village. While the midtown bar had surprisingly good nachos, at an Irish pub no less, it was downtown where I was destined to go. The rain was coming down rather hard and without knowing it I was in front of McSorley's, a great spot to dry off on cheap beers without worrying about getting too comfortable. A few mugs (no more than 8 oz of beer each) later and out the door I was, headed to PDT, my desired destination as of about 20 minutes into the evening. Around 9:30pm the place was half full, but the list had them booked through the night. We ordered the Benton's Old Fashioned ($13), a drink I've been talking up all week after I tried it for the first time last Saturday. A delicious blend of bacon infused George Dickel Tennessee Whisky, Maple Syrup, angostura Bitters and orange peel; it's quickly becoming one of my favorite cocktails in the city. Pair it with a Chang Dog, the snappy dog wrapped in bacon and topped with kimchi, and you have yourself a meal for any occassion. Add tater tots with jalapaneo cheese (as I did of course) and you have a 4-star meal. We also sampled the dog with cream cheese, scallions and everything bagel spices. Initially I was reluctant to have a dog with cream cheese, but the fried dog (yes fried hot dog) combined with the creamy spread was delicious. Think the corner bagel spot will hook me up with that if I ask?113 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, 212-614-0386, Reservations - Highly Recommended (or just be prepared to wait), Price - Moderate ($13 - how ever much you decide to drink)

So much has been said about Txikito's lunch menu and burger offering. From Ed Levine at Serious Eats to Josh Ozersky at The Feedbag and NYMag, who originally posted the lunch menu, the food media has been abuzz and I have been itching to get over there. Having already thoroughly enjoyed a dinner feast at the restaurant I had no doubt I would enjoy the lunch, but I didn't know to what degree. The lunch menu is much smaller, with soups, salads, sandwiches, some other plates and sides. I was here for the burger, known as \"el doble\" ($11), first and foremost, so we ordered up burgers and the fries ($4), crispy and dusted with a Basque chili powder. The burger emerged, looking larger than all the pictures do it justice. Two patties are assembled with smoked sheep's milk cheese, pickled guindilla peppers, pickled onions, sliced cornichons, and a special sauce made from mayo and creme fraiche all between a Tom Cat Bakery bun. It is by no means a \"clean\" burger, as the juicy meat, about 20 percent fat, combined with the special sauce drips all over the plate (seen here in the picture), but the bun does a wonderful job absorbing all that meaty goodness. Each bite was delicious, with the combination of flavors unique to me in burger form and quite memorable. It's no Shake Shack burger, but I'm confident in saying it is one of the better burgers in the city, perhaps top five or better. Service is from 12-3pm, Tuesday - Friday, so get over there during the week before it starts getting busy and see for yourself. 240 Ninth Ave., 212-242-4730, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate

Little delayed on the announcement, but if you didn't already know Dine in Brooklyn, a Brooklyn restaurant week, is coming up shortly and the list of restaurants participating is quite extensive. There are some clear standouts, like Rose Water, Grocery, Chestnut, Applewood, Stone Park, Al Di La, ici and many more. For $23 most of these restaurants are likely not making any profit, but some restaurants are even going further and offering dinner for two at only $23, TOTAL. They may not be the finest spots on the list, but for a 3-course meal at roughly $11.50 a person that is a surefire steal. Others are offering this deal during brunch, and the list is a bit more impressive for that. I'll be visiting The Grocery in Carroll Gardens and Aliseo Osteria del Borgo in Prospect Heights and will report back on the meals of course.

Tacos Galore in Sunset Park

This past weekend was beautiful, a small window of spring weather and hope that this brutal winter will soon end. It was a crime not to be outside in some capacity and along with fellow food blogger, NYC Food Guy, I took on Sunset Park's finest. Armed with a list of the top Mexican spots in the area, cameras, a pen, paper and of course an appetite we started down on 60th Street and 5th Avenue with the intention of eating our way as far back North as possible. Our main goal was to try the best tacos in the neighborhood, ones that would put the Manhattan shops to shame, and enlighten us as to what a real taco is, we certainly think the goal was achieved.First stop, Tulcingo Restaurant & Bakery near 56th street. It was barely noon and the place was relatively empty. We plopped ourselves down and with minimal Spanish placed an order for three tacos to share. The restaurant was nothing special aesthetically, but who cares, we were here for the food, which upon landing on our table immediately impressed. Our taco trio consisted of an Arabes ($2.50), Carne Asada ($2.25) and Lengua ($2.25). The Arabes was a ground lamb taco, served with a spicy, red mole. It was phenomenal on so many levels. The mole was vibrant without overpowering the lamb and started us off on a good note. The carne asada was tender and topped with cilantro, onions and a creamy avocado sauce, while the lengua, or tongue, was remarkably moist and reminded me of a more potent pulled pork or shredded beef dish. Of the three, the arabes was hands down the best. By the time we left this spot the restaurant was filled with families.Moving on down 5th Avenue, quite content with our first stop, we walked over to Rico's Tacos (also known as Piaxtla Es Mexico). Even with a rather crowded scene, we were able to score a tiny table for two and quickly order up some pork tacos, the Carnitas Especiale ($3.00 for a large) and Enchilada ($2.00). The latter is a name I usually associate with the dish, enchiladas, but here it was spicy marinated pork. It was a tasty taco, beautiful red color with a nice texture, but I would have preferred some more heat, which was generously added with the containers of salsa on the table. The carnitas, we ordered a small and large taco, were remarkably moist, assisted by the great amount of fat on it, and subsequently very tasty, but there was so much fat we actually had to pull some off before eating.Next stop brought us to a much talked about Tacos Matamoros (we found plenty of Chowhounders talking this place up). It was quite different than any of the other spots we had passed, complete with a wood exterior--this place was classy. Nice tile floors, brand new flat screen TVs and super clean, we were actually hesitant at first about going in. Once in though, it was easy to see we made the right choice. Packed to the gills around 1:30pm, this spot had a similar menu to the previous stops, but the Chorizo Taco ($1.75 for a small) is what jumped out at us here. Along with Chorizo we ordered up the Al Pastor ($1.25), or roasted pork, and dug in. The chorizo was bursting with flavor, spicy, fatty, smoky, it was amazing. The tortillas upped the ante as it seems they were partially toasted giving the taco an added, crunchy, texture. The al pastor was a bit disappointing as it was dry, and lacking much depth, however, it was clear the restaurant was using quality ingredients as everything was bright and fresh.Only a few yards away we came to Tacos Xochimilco, a relatively bare storefront with just a few diners present. Large pictures of the dishes were enticing, but we had heard about a particular dish, the Pambazo Torta ($6.00). The pambazo was a creation we had never heard of, stuffed with potatoes, shredded lettuce, enchilada pork, refried beans, queso fresca, and crema queso all in between two unique pieces of bread. The bread was doused on the outside in a smoky red sauce and then griddled to bake in the sauce. A messy sandwich to say the least, it was remarkable, with so many levels of flavor and texture. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to name it one of the best sandwiches I've had in recent memory and alone, worth the trip to Sunset Park. The great sandwich certainly overshadows the Carne Asada taco ($1.50 for a small) we had, which was good, but forgettable, with it's only unique quality being the queso crema. To top it all off we were served a complimentary glass of Horchata, a sweet, cinnamon flavored milk that paired well with the dishes we had.Wandering around into bakeries with opulent cakes, specialty stores with amazing selections of peppers and spices and passing more taquerias we finally made it to Guerrero Food Center. Mere blocks away from the massive Greenwood Cemetery this spot was unlike all the others. More market than restaurant, we scanned the short but delicious sounding menu, and ordered up a quesadilla, the Flor de Calabaza ($3.00), and sat eagerly awaiting our food. What emerged from the tiny kitchen did not appear to be a quesadilla by American standards, but almost resembled a chalupa (thanks Taco Bell), with its fried outer layer and pocked like appearance. Stuffed with squash blossoms, queso crema, queso fresca, shredded lettuce and a spicy salsa verde, it was delicious. A slightly crunchy exterior with a chewy interior, the fillings all merged together nicely. It wasn't a taco, but I am sure glad we ordered it.Making our way towards Park Slope we stopped at a bakery and grabbed a doughnut. It was nothing special, but it made me yearn for the baked goods we had passed earlier on the tour, back in the 40's and 50's on 5th Avenue where everything simply smelled and tasted better. After the 70 or so block walk it was clear that there is a whole new world of food right here at our fingertips, so close, so cheap, so good, yet underappreciated. I can't wait to get back to Sunset Park for some tacos, tortas, churros and whatever else I can get my hands on.Tulcingo Restaurant & Bakery - 5520 5th Ave nr. 56th Street, Brooklyn, NYRicos Tacos - 505 51st Street nr. 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NYTacos Matamoros - 4508 5th Ave nr. 46th Street, Brooklyn, NYTacos Xochimilco - 4501 5th Ave nr. 45th Street, Brooklyn, NYGuerrero Food Center - 722 5th Ave nr. 23rd Street, Brooklyn, NY

There are a few restaurants in this city which people say \"you have to go to\". Everyone has their own opinion, I certainly have mine, but I always hear Little Owl on the top of peoples list. It may not be a 4-star restaurant (it's 2 actually), but that quaint little spot on the corner of Bedford and Grove has been abuzz since it opened and there is no sign it is falling out of style. Head Chef Joey Campanaro has received plenty of press for his contemporary comfort food style. It's hard to nail down the exact cuisine of food he dishes out with dishes like the famous meatball sliders, sliced duck breast, crispy chicken with brussels sprouts and the remarkable pork chop (more on that later). Little Owl is a neighborhood spot by definition, but people flock to this place, heck they make reservations from 5pm-11pm just to eat here everyday of the week. We may hear about Babbo and Ko as the hardest tables in town, but Little Owl is surely up there and its capacity of 28 or so doesn't make it any easier.Moving on, the evening was special for two reasons. It was my first trip to the Owl and my three year anniversary with my girlfriend, of course the latter is more important. We were both equally excited to dine here and could not have received better service and treatment. We scored a prime table, at 7:30pm, right in the corner of the restaurant looking out onto the street. A very private spot; it was perfect. Scanning the menu I knew we already had chosen at least two of our dishes for the night: meatball sliders and the pork chop. Everyone has likely heard of Little Owl's meatball sliders: tender pork, veal and beef meatballs nestled between delicate Parmesan buns. A two-biter in my opinion to really appreciate the quality of the meat, the sliders were done rather quickly. It's not that they are so complex that you are blown away by their quality, but I think it's the fact that they remind people of their favorite childhood meatball. They offer a glimpse into an innocent past in every bite. Not to be outdone, the scallop appetizer was quite good and offered a nice balance to the heavier sliders. Seared perfectly, they were served with a spinach and caper salad that was refreshing and in a way peaceful.Following our delicious starters, we ordered up the pork chop and crispy chicken. The latter was quite good, reminiscent of the chicken I had at Market Table not too long ago, but not as good. The chicken was still superb--tender, moist and amazingly crispy without being burnt--but the sides were a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was a great dish, one I would recommend time and time again, but the real standout entree here was the pork chop. I was happy to have ordered the chop as it meant more for me. This giant slab of pork, charred all around, but tender as can be on the inside, was served atop Parmesan butter beans and wild dandelion leaves. The beans and dandelion provided some roughage as I tackled this behemoth and I enjoyed every last bite. There was a sweetness, a saltiness, a well-rounded flavor that even at the last bite was going strong. I'm completely comfortable in saying this was the best pork chop I've ever had and it's hard to believe a better one exists.With that said I could have stopped the meal then and there. Left on a high note, full of porky goodness and the lingering salty taste in my mouth, but no there had to be dessert on this special night, it wouldn't have been complete without it. Beignets with raspberry filling and a Nutella dipping sauce were a sweet, tart and decadent end, and the apple crisp with hazelnut gelato was creamy and refreshing. Each dessert was quite different, but both shared one thing: simplicity. Nothing was over-the-top, it was all about delicious food, presented properly. We, quite happily, finished every last bite, and swigged the last bit of our Nero D'Avola. A clean glass of Muscato finished off the meal and as the food finally settled in we realized it was time to go. A simple, delicious, three-course meal in the books, completely attitude-free. By no means can I make this a weekly stop, even a monthly stop could be somewhat over the top, but I'll be back soon, perhaps for lunch for that all-too-popular burger.90 Bedford St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 741-4695, Reservation - Highly Recommended, Price - Moderate-Expensive ($50-75/person)

The much hyped about, much blogged about, much anticipated sandwich spot, Defonte's is here. Landing on Manhattan soil last week with a somewhat shiny new storefront in the Gramercy area and dishing out those giant sandwiches that put Chipotle's burritos to shame. The sandwiches here have become legendary, but most of us who either living in Manhattan, or just plain too lazy to trek out to Red Hook (I'm in the latter) have not been fortunate enough to sample them. Well, on a brisk weekday I made the walk from work over to Defonte's pretty much knowing I wanted sandwich #20, or the \"famous\" roast beef with fresh mozzarrela, fried eggplant slices and beef jus. Walking up to the restaurant you can see the crowds, the line snakes through the tiny store out the rear door and onto the sidewalk. At first glance it seems a bit imposing, you may even question if it is worth it as I did, but the line moves quickly for better or worse. Orders are yelled to the Defonte's crew from every angle so be ready and state the number of the sandwich. If you want anything special done to it make it clear because you won't see that sandwich until it's in wax paper, at least during a busy lunch hour. As I mentioned before, I already knew which sandwich I wanted, but I took a recommendation from fellow food lover and blogger NYC Food Guy, and requested my sandwich be piled onto a garlic bread roll. What I recieved was different than the picture on his site, mine was more of a toasted garlic soft roll, whereas his appears to be a hero turned into garlic bread. Either way it was a solid choice since the sandwich fillings, or innards, were surprisingly bland. The combination of the garlic really adds a lot, although I did have to add salt and ground pepper before eating. Another thing to be aware of, hot sandwiches are not always hot. The #20 was room temperature while the eggplant parm, a beast of a sandwich by the way, was warm. With prices hovering in the $8-11 range for a sandwich it is on the pricey side, but for smaller eaters, or those simply with self restraint, any sandwich can be made into two meals. If you do want to eat on-site be forewarned, there are maybe 4-5 seats and they are full during lunch time. With a few kinks to figure out with the line and the temperature of the food a trip to Defonte's is worth it, especially if you work or live in the area. Also don't forget, for those big breakfast eaters, Defonte's offers a variety of hearty breakfast sandwiches. For those looking for dinner, be careful and try to order on the early side or at least call ahead, once these guys run out of food they close, no matter what time it may be. 261 3rd Avenue at 21st Street,New York, NY 10010,212-614-1500, Reservations - Not Needed/Accepted, Price - Inexpensive

I've talked about Amorina in Prospect Heights before, claiming it the best pizza in the nabe, and easily the holders of the best slices. It's hard to resist their slice special, two square slices and a Boylan's soda for $5, one of the better deals I've found in Park Slope or Prospect Heights. Well, with the lack of good slice joints near my apartment I thought it only necessary to order in Amorina's sheet pies for a little scotch and poker get together. The sheet pies are priced higher than the smaller, personal, round pies at $18+ each, but they are huge and worth it. 9 slices make up the pie with its slightly thicker crust and any topping is available, although some are better on the square than others. We ordered a plain and a caprissioca, a sausage, olive, artichoke pie that on the recommendation of the chef we had with a little red sauce (it usually is white) to keep it moist. The latter pie was $26, but considering we had 6 people to feed it was a steal and I highly recommend it. Just give the folks at Amorina a heads up before ordering since they usually only make enough square pies for the takeout special. Enjoy.624 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11238, Phone: 718-230-3030, Recommendations - Not Required, Price - Inexpensive - Moderate ($15 - $30)

Jim Lahey's new spot, Co. (or Company) has been the talk of the town for the past few months. A delayed opening, continual packed dinner service, Jean-Georges backing it, and the good and bad first takes. Recently opened for lunch, walking into Co. during the day is a breeze. None of those lines around the block or bad service and \"we're out of dough\" scenarios I've heard of in the past. Lunch offers a serene, casual atmosphere and the opportunity to try some of the great new pizza in the city. There are certainly stumbles here and there, but I'll get to that.The space reminds me of Ssam Bar or Ko, minimalist decor, with a heavy emphasis on modern wood paneling. Large windows allow plenty of sunlight, and the dreary views of 9th Ave, while a small bar offers seating for close to 12 people. Sitting in the corner at a large 5 top, we had a great view of the space and quickly settled in and scanned the menu. The offerings have changed a few times since the spot first opened, but for the most part there are always 7 pies with a rotating special. Fortunately for us, being a large party allowed for the opportunity to try a number of pies so we quickly ordered up. To start we had two salads, the Butter Lettuce and Escarole salads. The Escarole salad came with bread crumbs, anchovies, capers, lemon and olive oil, while the Butter Lettuce came with roasted butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, lemon and olive oil. I was glad we ordered these salad to help provide some greens in our lunch diet, but neither was remarkable and at $7, they were quite similar and small.We came here for pizza and that's what we looked forward too. Each pizza came out at a different time, not too sure why, but it worked to our benefit, allowing us to enjoy each creation straight out of the oven. We first attacked the Flambe, a gooey, cheesey creation with plenty of large bacon chunks scattered atop it. The bechamel, parmesan and buffalo mozzarella melded perfectly with the sweet carmelized onions and salty bacon. The Flambe, in my opinion, is enough reason to visit Jim Lahey's Co.. Next on the docket was the special pie, topped with sausage, leeks and breadcrumbs (the other details escape me) and a pretty intense char around one side of the pie. Despite the char, which for the most part I enjoyed, the pizza was good, but just missing something. A little salt would have gone a long way here, but the combination of ingedients did work well. Halfway through our pizza fest the much talked about Ham and Cheese pie was plopped down in the center of the table. A gorgeous pie, blanketed by paper-thin slices of proscuitto, you could actually see the charred spots through the delicious strands of pork. Beneath the meat was pecorino, gruyere, buffalo mozzarella and caraway seeds, which added a creamy, sweet and salty note to the pizza. The fatty ends of the proscuitto melted into the crust, a beautiful sight we quickly gobbled up.The tail end of our lunch featured the simplest pies, the Amalfi and Margherita. The Amalfi, described as having green olives, anchovies and chilis was remarkably underwhelming. It was presented by Chef/Breadmaker/Pizza Guy Jim Lahey with the comment \"we tried something a little different here\", but we were never really told what was different. Regardless, the pungent anchovies we longed for were hiding somewhere we couldn't find them and the chilis overpowered every flavor of the pie. The Margherita, the standard to which I hold all pizzeria's against, was unfortunately dissappointing. A slightly different dough preparation than the others, which by the way were all very delicious, crispy and thin, this dough was a bit more pillowy. The dough wasn't the problem though, an overly sweet and watery tomato sauce left pools of liquid scattered over the pie and the lack of sufficient cheese left half the pie relatively naked. The saving grace was when we bit into a cheesy, basil topped bite with a thin layer of sauce, but these were few and far between.Overall Co. offers some superb pizzas, albeit expensive, the restaurant has plenty of promise. Service during lunch was good, attentive and kind, and when split amongst a few diners it is easy to keep the cost down and try a number of items. Ordering wine quickly rises the price, but it's all about the pizza here, and of the five we had, two of them were amazing, one was good, one mediocre and one quite poor; not bad for only a month old. I expect to be drawn back for those two great ones and with Lahey's creative mind it is no doubt there will be other delicious creations on the menu soon. If you are looking for a comparison to other pizzerias don't try to compare it to the big name slice or traditional joints, think more L'asso or Frannys (which in my opinion Co. is much better than), the creative, contemporary pizza spots with plenty of high-quality ingredients. Enjoy, and keep eating. 230 9th Ave, New York, NY 10001, 212-243-1105, Reservations - Not Available, Price - Moderate

Valentines Day is cause for many to gather the cash (or credit card) and book a table at the hottest, most romantic recipe in the city. But that's just the problem. Valentines Day is an overpriced, overhyped day of spending which brings out some of the more sappy menu items seen all year. Some restaurants offer great deals and book up fast, others, well others fill there menus with oysters, lobster and champagne, charging a premium and reeling in unsuspecting diners. This year was different with more couples (or hopeful couples) dining at home than ever before. With everyone saving more money these days it is no surprise. For me, a home cooked meal was just the plan, as it generally is, but this year was special. I had landed a complimentary rack of American Lamb, meaty, fresh and already \"Frenched\" so this was the centerpiece of the meal. The three course meal went as follows:1. Roasted Beet Salad with Frisee Lettuce, Toasted Walnuts, Goat Cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette2. Pistachio Pesto Crusted Rack of Lamb Wrapped in Bacon with Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and a Kale White Bean Saute3. Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake with a Cinnamon Graham Cracker CrustThe salad, a common menu item at restaurants around the country was simple and only required a light vinaigrette of champagne vinegar, good olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and honey.The rack of American Lamb recipe was adapted from a Ferran Adria recipe on Food & Wine. Adria may be known for his molecular gastronomy at El Bulli, but this shows another side of his cooking (and genius). I took Adria's lead, but made my own changes, choosing bacon over pancetta, adding some lemon juice into the pesto, making extra pesto and choosing to prepare the scallions a slightly different way. Regardless, the combination of the fresh herbs, delightful pistachios and fatty bacon melded perfectly with the lamb and made for a great lunch the next day. The rack was cut into double chops and served with roasted fingerling potatoes (cooked with thyme, cayenne and garlic)and a saute of kale, white beans, lemon juice, nutmeg and vegetable stock. To wrap up the meal my beautiful girlfriend decided to make a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake complete with homemade cinnamon graham cracker crust. The cake was appropriately sweet with hints of slightly sour raspberry and an addictive crust (my favorite part). We paired a Pinot Noir with the American Lamb which kept up with the bold flavors while a Port from Portugal helped us wash down the cheesecake. All in all, one of the best Valentines Day meals I've had in or out of a restaurant.

This past week two places opened up in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Cornelius the new scotch/bourbon/vodka bar in the old Noona space and Cataldo's the Italian-American, red sauce spot next to Le Gamin. Both very different, targeting different locals and only days old. I've been excited about both, seeing a new watering hole and a hopeful step up to the poor slice joints (Antonio's and Gino's) within a short walking distance from my home.First stop, Cornelius, the handsome bar/restaurant on the corner of Pacific and Vanderbilt. Formerly the home of Noona, a modern Korean spot from the owners of Soda and Le Gamin. With a few decorative and structural details remaining from the previous restaurant Cornelius is a very warm, inviting, comfortable space. A long bar extends through more than half of the restaurant with banquets and a rear, slightly elevated, space rounding out the seating. More importantly, the bar is a drinkers dream. Stacked with bottles upon bottles of all varieties of scotch, bourbon, whiskey and vodka you could go for months without trying the same bottle twice. Our final count was 90 whiskeys, scotches and bourbons, but that didn't even include anything below the counter or in storage. A cocktail menu is also impressive, not as much as the neighboring Weather Up, but these drinks still hold their own and at $10 they are reasonably priced for the quality. A booklet with all of the drinks appears endless and prices for the most part stay under $16 for everything, but the super high-end pours and flights are available for everything on the menu.When it comes to food I had high expectations. Former sous-chef from Freemans, Michelle Hanna, offers a menu originally clad with fried chicken, burgers, pulled pork sliders and more. I saw a new weekly spot in the making. Much to my dismay not only did they change the menu right before opening, but the food was just not executed that well. I ordered the burger ($10) which came with cheddar, housemade pickles and fries, but what I got was sadly embarrassing. A brioche bun (housemade and quite dry) hid my burger from sight and was coated with the thinnest piece of yellow cheddar, so thin I was able to see right through the cheese. It is a pet peeve of mine when a bun is bigger than the burger. I do not order burgers for bread, but for meat, so why would someone give me more bread than meat? Fries were matchstick, fast-food type fries that were just boring. A salad of roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, figs and arugula was simple, pleasing and more satisfying than the burger, which by the way was over cooked. Although my first food experience was disappointing I will give the food another shot, perhaps the pulled pork sliders or mac and cheese, and even if the food fails I know there is now a new watering hole, one with an amazing amount of unique, well-priced alcohols that will surely keep me busy.Just a few yards away is Cataldo's, a new Italian-American red sauce joint next to French spot Le Gamin. Cataldo's was a welcome addition in my eyes, a new option for red sauce that won't run my wallet dry. They don't sell slices, but when you want a chicken parm or other similar sandwich or platter it's always good to have a solid option, especially one that delivers. Walking in I was a bit caught off guard. The restaurant is rather small when it comes to seating, but more importantly a giant counter full of hot steam trays contains the pasta's, meatballs, lasagna and more. I was a bit confused, not expecting to see this outside of a dining hall, cafeteria or even hole in the wall joint with a lack of retail space. Here we have a rather large restaurant that has a huge steam counter taking up valuable seating. Oh well, I don't know the details, or blueprints of the place so moving on.I was immediately deterred from ordering any pasta or chicken/veal/meatball variety as it appeared nothing was made to order so pizza it was. A wood-fired pizza oven, decorated with a unique stone pattern rests in the back. Pizza's were pulled out every so often and they looked quite large. Ordering up two pizzas, an artichoke, mushroom and olive pie, and the sausage and broccoli rabe pie. Excited for both, that excitement quickly faded when the pies were brought to the table. The first pie, with the artichoke and mushrooms, was full of canned vegetables. Canned artichokes, canned mushrooms (seriously?!), canned olives and what tasted like a canned sauce. It was bland, limp and overall a disaster. The sausage and broccoli rabe pie was a bit more enjoyable, but still fell quite short of being good. Low quality sausage topped extremely bitter broccoli rabe (a little acid would have gone a long way here) and again the bland sauce and limp crust appeared. Making it half way through the two pies (each are 12\") we gave up, no longer hungry or enjoying the pizza. Disappointing, very, but I hope the place does well. In these troubling economic times I wish every restaurant success. Even if I did not enjoy my experience, others may, but I will be taking my money elsewhere.Cornelius: 565 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY, 718-398-6662, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($15-30/person)Cataldo's: 554 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 718-857-6700, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($10-20/person)

So here it is. Right around the corner. The Super Bowl is here, this Sunday as a sports fan it is one of the biggest days of the year. As a food lover the occasion is also something I always look forward to. Super Bowl Sunday has historically been a day to let loose, eat junk food and drink some beers while screaming at the television. While I've shared some of those moments I like to change up the food a bit, step away from the ordinary and put a bit more effort and quality into the spread. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of cheesy, spicy, meaty items to be had and I love pizza, wings and chili.The media around the country has been rounding up the best \"dude foods\", healthy snacks and the best delivery places. NYmag has a great roundup of massive subs you can order. Serious Eats recommends RUB's chicken wings for your party. Chow writes up a \"playbook\" with recipes and suggestions. Food & Wine has a number of suggestions, like Michael Symon's recipes. There are plenty of great resources out there, but the biggest thing is not to overdue it. I'm generally one who goes a bit too far, maybe an extra dish here or there, but this year, the goal is prep as much beforehand as possible so that the game can be enjoyed.Without any stadium dip (this is just insane and impressive) or team colored cookies I am expecting to have:Cheese and Charcuterie PlateGuacamoleBlue Cheese Walnut DipCheesy Artichoke DipHomemade Pita ChipsBuffalo WingsFrench Dip Sandwiches with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Au JusChocolate Chip or Snickerdoodle Cookies (made by my girlfriend the talented baker)It may seem like a lot, but a good portion of this can be made the day before or the morning of letting me kick back, relax and watch the game (and maybe some of the commercials). Expect pictures and a full recap after the food/beer/football hangover subsides.

This past weekend was food filled, from a cooking class and demonstration to a serene, lengthy meal; plenty of great tastes and memorable moments:Al Di La: One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn and throughout the city, Friday was a feast like no other. Beginning with the restaurants addictive and bold tripe slider the meal was in full swing. Following was a menu to remember with escarole and pancetta salad, grilled chard stems with an anchovy rub, perfect tagliatelle la ragu, rich and comforting squid ink risotto, calf's liver with onions and grilled polenta and a trio of gelatos including fennel and black pepper. A remarkably prepared, seasoned and presented meal it raised my already stellar opinion of Al Di La.Rosa Mexicano: On Saturday Rosa hosted a Real Men Cook Mexican: Official Guide to a Mexican Super Bowl Party demonstration and luncheon. Among the items cooked and served there was a delicious black bean and ground skirt steak chili. Packed with spice and flavor it was served with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Interestingly enough the black bean stock or liquid from the cans was used in the soup, something I never would have thought to do. To top it all off, the class was FREE for all guys.Market Table: Without skipping a beat Mikey Price always seems to move seamlessly between seasons and this meal was no exception. A bevy of food was ordered, but the homemade parpadelle with braised lamb shank was remarkable. Meaty, perfectly seasoned and comforting, the dish is only a special, but may find its way onto the menu soon. A butterscotch pudding, light, airy and with an ideal balance of sweetness finished the meal accompanied by a smooth Muscato.

James, the relative newcomer to the Brooklyn dining scene, will roll out a bar snacks menu starting tonight. No menu was available yesterday, but expect their addictive fries, marinated olives, bruschetta's of some kind and more. Not a bad idea considering the bar area is gorgeous and can seat close to 10 people. I'm sure more restaurants with bars will begin to do the same over the coming months.605 Carlton Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, 718-942-4255

The understated exterior of Taro in Park Slope may make you think twice before stepping in for sushi, but push through the ugliness of Flatbush Avenue and into the cramped, yet cozy, restaurant for some fresh seafood rewards. Many locals argue that Taro offers the best sushi in the neighborhood and I certainly don't disagree that it is one of the better options. What's most important about dining at Taro is being adventurous, deviating away from the standard spicy tuna or California roll for something not commonly found at places like this. With the likes of big shot Blue Ribbon Sushi down the street on 5th Avenue and the always popular neighborhood spot Geido, Taro finds away to offer something different without really trying that hard.The restaurant is cramped, with a small counter seating close to 8 and a number of 2 and 4 tops bringing the total occupancy to around 25. The menu initially appears rather normal, with the standard rolls, pieces and kitchen entrees, complete with entertaining photos of each dish. However, there is much more to the restaurant than what the initial menu gaze provides. Look further at the special menu, there are occasionally two of these for some strange reason. Items like monkfish liver with it's susprisingly light, creamy texture is apparently the \"#1 appetizer\", an interesting claim, or the variety of omakase offerings. Even the fish selection is unique with butterfish, giant clam, trigger fish, bonito, horse mackerel and more available with new options coming in seasonally. I have thoroughly enjoyed the scallop and uni special, served as a split raw scallop topped generously with uni and a sweet soy-based sauce which was quickly hit with some heat from a blow torch. The light, smooth textured bite was one I'll never forget.On a recent visit I ordered the 6 piece omakase complete with miso soup with a number of succulent clams. The omakase came with fatty bluefin tuna, ruby red tuna, horse mackerel, bonito, sweet shrimp and uni. To top it all of the kitchen fried up the sweet shrimp heads (fully edible) and topped it with a ponzu like sauce. All of the fish was delectable, each remarkably fresh with my favorites being the fatty bluefin and horse mackarel. For the money, you can't find a better selection of fresh fish in the area and perhaps beyond.Although I recommend experimenting at Taro you certainly don't have to. Staple rolls and those two bite behemoth rolls are done very well here and are priced quite reasonably. The Mountain, filled with tuna, yellowtail, avocado and tobiko rises tall from the plate and is quite a hearty, tasty bite. The dragon roll with eel, cucumber and avocado is always delicious as are the variety of spicy rolls. You won't find anything overly ambitious or creative in the roll department, but rest assured the fish will be as fresh as can be. Don't forget to wash it down with a 21oz beer and what appear to be endless pitchers of green tea. Taro brings superbly fresh fish and seafood to an unlikely location, and what's more remarkable, it is packed almost every night. Kind service, comfortable albeit tight quarters, reasonable prices and superb product is their recipe to success.446 Dean St, Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718) 398-0872, Reservations - Recommended On A Busy Night, Price - Moderate ($20-30/person)

This past Saturday was a doozy, freezing outside and just completely uninviting. Enter Momofuku Milkbar, the space was cozy, warm and hopping around 4pm. I've never been during the day and have always had to order the sweets, not that I'm complaining, but now I had a chance to have some of the savory items. We ordered up the english muffin and the pork and egg bun. The english muffin is the standard to which all english muffins should be held to, fried in pork fat with a crispy exterior and soft chewy interior it was delicious. I would have liked a bit more meat in there with the wonderful runny egg, but it was not a deal breaker. The pork and egg bun stole the show. Not just based on taste, but on the sheer size of it. This beast of a bun is easily twice the size of a normal Momofuku pork bun and when filled with a runny poached egg a mess quickly insues after the first bite. However, the combination of the fatty, unctuous pork belly, sweet hoisin, crunchy cucumbers and rich egg yolk makes this a heart-stopping, can't miss breakfast (or any meal for that matter) sandwich. I'll just have to wait till I can have one again so my body can bounce back.

Two new openings in my neighborhood, Prospect Heights, are official. Cornelius, in the former Noona spot on Vanderbilt, is now a bar serving burgers, mac and cheese, bbq pork sliders, fried chicken, creative cocktails and high-end booze. Check out the menu here from Thrillist. Just down the block, a new Italian joint complete with a wood-fired oven opened on Monday, it's called Cataldo's. This spot has been long in making, but hopefully will offer a nice change of pace from Gino's and Antonio's, the poor Italian spots nearby.South Gate will be hosting a series of events dubbed, Studio at South Gate, \"a consecutive five-week series of culinary classes, offering an inside look at the restaurant's unique epicurean elements.\" Classes are $35, a relative deal considering the normal restaurant prices, and range from a fish tutorial (purchasing, preparing, etc.) to wine buying for any occasion. For more info call the restaurant or check here.In a only mildly surprising move, Alto, Michael White's upscale Italian spot, has waved their corking fee. Now we know restaurants are doing whatever they can to keep business coming, but for a place with such a notable, pricey wine list this may be the start of a new trend. Will more restaurants become BYOB spots? Check out the NYPost for more on the story.L'Artusi, the newly opened West Village spot from the Dell'Anima guys, will be hosting wine events led by Beverages Director (and wine prodigy) Joey Campanale. The events are not cheap, but offer unique, intimate opportunities to sample delicious wines along with food pairings from Chef Gab Thompson. More info here.With the economy struggling, spending for a food event may seem a bit excessive. Enter the Village Voice and there affordably priced Choice Eats event. At $35 the price is right for an opportunity to taste Christina Tosi's delectable Milkbar creations, the always popular BBQ from Fette Sau, Peter Hoffman's grub from Back Forty, tacos from Pinche Taqueria, pizza from Motorino and much much more. For more details click here.To the shock of no one, restaurant week will likely be extended through February. Thanks Crain's for the hot tip.An unfortunate review of L'Artusi from Alan Richman of GQ. He provides a detailed recap of his experience, but to sum it up - he hates it. A far cry from the three delicious meals I've had there, but I doubt it will hurt the restaurant.Metromix posts a fun and delicious slideshow on pasta making. I would have liked less fluff and more tactical information, but it was enjoyable to say the least.The obligatory Winter Restaurant Week conversations continue. Chowhound for one has a rather long one going on as we speak.

On Saturday Jimmy No. 43 hosted a delicious event, the Cassoulet Cookoff, complete with a bevy of area cooks, chefs and cassoulet lovers. The event provided food and drinks (not free of course) to food lovers looking to keep warm as the temperatures hovered in the single digits. Seven total cassoulet's were served ranging from the traditional with beans and sausage to the less traditional vegetarian version. All proceeds helped the greenmarket and all sausages were from greenmarket vendors. A full run down of the competitors are below with pictures:#1: Cathy Erway, Not Eating Out in New York - an extremely sweet version complete with maple-cured sausage, ham hocks and apple cider. A great aroma the dish was just too swett for my taste and lacked the meat I was looking for.#2: Andrew Field, Rockaway Taco and Rice - this vegetarian option through me for a loop, but I went in with an open mind. Unfortunately the lack of any meat left it bland and more like a vegetable soup.#3: Chef Phillip Kirschen Clark, formerly of Wd-50 and Pegu Club - unfortunately I did not have any of this cassoulet and it was the one I looked forward to more than anything. Either it was so good it ran out quickly or the chef just did not plan ahead and made too little.#4: Melissa Rebholz, cook, former greenmaket manager - there definitely was some meat in this cassoulet; sausage, ham hocks, and lamb breast which employed a rich flavor, the one I had been craving. Unfortunately the beans had been overcooked and reduced to mush ruining the texture of a delicious dish. I did enjoy the taste of this so it falls to 2nd or 3rd in my book.#5: Jimmy's No. 43 - the housemade cassoulet had a great smokey essence to it, but was just a little too thin for my taste. A good balance of meat and beans it would have benefited from a little pop in the oven uncovered to help dry it out a bit.#6: Kelly Geary, Sweet Deliverance - the bread crumb topping on this offered a nice bit of texture and although it was overcooked and a little dry the flavor was spot on. Since it was overcooked the beans and meat all seemed to share the same texture, but it was hearty, meaty and definitely comforting.#7: Chef Mark Bello, Pizza A Casa - well rounded, with bold flavors, the combination of duck confit, sausage, cannelini beans and the toasted bread crumb topping made this the winner in my book. Great texture, not too dry and everythig I wanted on this freezing cold day.Overall the event was a hit, plenty of good eats, great crowd and quality music. There will be more events like this throughout the year so stay tuned and check Jimmy's No. 43 for more information. Full menu below.

El Gran Castillo de Jagua has always intrigued me. This corner restaurant just off Flatbush Avenue in Prospect Heights has an old, ugly facade and whenever I walk by all I smell is grease. It's not the most welcoming image or smell, but I knew one day I would stop in, I just didn't know if it would be a one time thing. A recent dinner turned into a lazy thrown together meal and a rotisserie chicken was needed. El Gran Castillo has plenty of these and they are cheap so I figured why not.Stepping into the restaurant you are immediately confronted with smells of roasted meats and a strong, impenetrable aroma of grease. In the restaurant it is slightly more enjoyable than walking on the sidewalk towards the Crunch gym across the street, but I was still hesitant and kept my low expectations. Ordering up a half chicken I was surprised to see the bill come to a ridiculously low $5.80 or so, a meal for two potentially for less than $6, that's a steal. Okay, it's cheap, always a good thing, but is it good? Well there are definitely some complaints: too much salt, too greasy, a bit fatty, but for the most part it was pretty good. A nice fall back meal during uncertain and unstable economic times for anyone in the surrounding neighborhood. I decided to go back and on a recent visit and ordered up the cubano. Again keeping my expectations in check this was a bit more disappointing. In cubano's I expect two things, tender roast pork and crunchy flattened bread. The other ingredients, while important, don't play as large of a role. In this case I actually had to make some improvements back at home to make the sandwich more enjoyable. In retrospect it's nice to be able to pick up a cubano so close to home, not too many spots nearby can even offer this. Perhaps visiting on the earlier side would result in more succulent roast pork.My experience on both occassions wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but I certainly will give El Gran Castillo de Jagua another shot. Perhaps for the pepper steak, or the oxtail or maybe again for the chicken on one of the lazy weekday nights. With the economy the way it is any budget-friendly dining option is a welcome addition, especially when they churn out so many different dishes at an alarming pace.345 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn 11238, Reservations - Absolutely Not, Price - Inexpensive ($6-15/person)

Somehow I lucked out this past Saturday. I brought a friend down to Difara's after building it up for years. He had never been and was eager to sink his teeth into Dom's famous pizza. I was concerned the wait might turn him off or that we would fall victim to the occasional burnt pie that Dom forgot about in the oven. I opted for an early arrival, convinced that with the incoming snowstorm we may be in luck if we get there by noon. Well we certainly lucked out. Walking in there were perhaps 6 others waiting for pizza with a pie already being sliced up and handed out. Before we could even place our order Dom looked up and asked \"anybody want a plain pie? Anyone?\" Quickly realizing it was completely up for grabs we claimed the pie and were seated with the beautiful pizza within 5 minutes of arriving at the pizzeria. Our wait for the square with sausage (amazing by the way) ended up being close to 1 hour, but the mere fact that we got a whole pie so quickly made up for any wait time. The pizza gods certainly were looking down on us.

It's been a crazy year for me, including everyone in the city and around the world. The food world seems to have peaked in the middle of the year before the economic crisis, but looking back 2008 should mean more than just economic troubles. There were plenty of good times, dishes and trips. It's now been 1 year since I started this blog and I've seen it evolve (for the better) in many many ways. It will still change, still improve and most of all still continue to feature great eats from NYC and beyond. Thanks for reading and lets look forward to a delicious 2009.

2008 was quite the year for NYC restaurants (and the country for that matter). Great new spots like Momofuku Ko, Convivio, Eighty One, L'Artusi, Corton, Allegretti and many more opened up with throngs of foodies dining, drinking and talking about their experiences. Now that we're fully into 2009 I've formed a list, that will of course be ongoing, of places I aim to visit throughout the year. Some may be brand new, others may be older, but necessary. I'm embarrassed about a few on the list, not because they are bad restaurants, but more because it's shocking I've never made it there yet.Always taking suggestions and please comment if you feel a spot on my list is not worth the time, money or even space on the blog.

Some hate restaurant week, others love it. I fall somewhere in the middle. It has it's place, I get it and for the most part I happily participate in the good offers. However, there are may people taken advantage of, those who haphazardly book tables at good or even mediocre restaurants are are served even worse food than normal. A few words of advice when booking your spots, be smart. If the restaurant already offers a special prix fixe menu close to or even less than the Winter Restaurant Week menu then skip it. Call ahead if you can and ask about the menu otherwise you may be subjected to the chicken, pasta, salmon options and sorely disappointed. I've had some success, and one failure, dining out during restaurant week, below are a few suggestions:Anything from Danny Meyer, the man knows how to treat customers and doesn't skimp during this promotion. Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe, Blue Smoke and The Modern are all participating to some extent.Jean-Georges spots generally list the menu ahead of time, but also some of them offer prix fixe menus year round. Look into, but don't run for Perry Street and Mercer Kitchen, with a strong recommendation for his elder Jojo. Steakhouses can be hit or miss, sometimes they are worth it, other times a huge waste. A few recommendations (in my opinion), but none of them are can't miss: Angelo and Maxie's, Delmonico's, Primehouse, Porterhouse, Smith & Wollensky, and the still uber-popular The PalmA few of my can't miss suggestions: Anthos, Aquavit, Artisinal, Bar Boulud, Bar Stuzzichini, BarBao, Bread Bar, Cafe Boulud, Convivio, Del Posto, Devi, Dovetail, Eleven Madison Park, EN Japanese Brasserie, Esca, Gotham Bar & Grill, Gramercy Tavern, Jojo, Lupa, Lure Fishbar, Matsugen, Morimoto, Payard, Tabla, Telepan, The Modern, Tribeca Grill and Union Square CafeEnjoy!

It's true. When it is super busy at a restaurant because of events like \"Restaurant Week\", most restaurants limit selection and prep more than usual to meet the expected demands. Mass feedings are just that- not interested either.Dat Todat@restaurantjobboard.comhttp://www.RestaurantJobBoard.com/Blog

Lunch Feast at Don's Bogam

***CONTENT
With the work week shortened by the New Years eve celebration and the office relatively empty, a trip up to Koreatown for lunch seemed logical. The great decision could have quickly gone wrong had we stumbled into the wrong spot, but through prior experience a friend of mine brought us to Don's Bogam, a sleek, somewhat dated, Korean spot slightly off the beaten path and beyond the many, more familiar spots on 32nd street.Entering the restaurant there was a small bar, filled with empty decorative wine and sake bottles and a festive (and funny) marshmallow wreath. Beyond the front bar, the restaurant requires a step up to enter the many bbq booths complete with modern, copper accented exhaust systems. With a full view of the kitchen, where all the chopping, frying and cleaning is only feet away, the seating is comfortable albeit a little awkward to get into. Don's Bogam offers an unbeatable lunch special. It's easy to keep your budget down and fill yourself up for the day, nothing really exceeds $14 during lunch.As with many Korean spots a littany of small plates (or banchan) comes to the table before anything else arrives. Sometimes these plates are rather dissappointing, something that may have been created earlier than need be, but plates at Don's Bogam were delicious. The tiny crispy fish were addictive, as were the spicy, smokey, thinly sliced squid and the vinegary bean sprouts. The kimchi was good, but not phenomenal, and the other 3-4 dishes were forgettable. A seafood pancake, stuffed with oysters, also arrived, I personally wasn't a fan, but the table enjoyed it.Main dishes really impressed, a delicious trio of bibimbap was ordered, including the spicy seafood, marinated short ribs and the spicy pork and chive. Each served in a piping hot clay bowl with the delicious crispy rice just waiting to be eaten. The seafood variety came packed with shrimp, mussels, octopus and squid as well as an assortment of vegetables, it was rich, fresh and my favorite of the three. We also ordered the \"bo\" special, marinated short ribs on a scolding hot platter over sliced onions with rice and soup. The meat was seasoned nicely and being a short rib lover it was hard not to enjoy the rich, tender and comforting dish on this cold snowy day. Washed down with a few OB's (Korean beers), the food was for the most part, spot on, affordable and worth coming back night or day. While the decor may leave something to be desired, the food is worth every penny.17 East 32nd St, New York, NY 10016, 212-683-2200, Reservation - Not Needed, Price - Moderate ($15-25/person for lunch)

There always appears to be a scramble when making plans for New Years Eve. So close to the holidays and so many options, but this year the plan is to be more frugal. Dining options are anywhere from $350 (Le Cirque) to straight a la carte, but more and more people are staying home or going to apartment/house parties. Here are a few options in case you have been procrastinating (thanks to all the online sources for helping compile this list):A night at Hill Country is always a good time, and this year they are offering a nice package for tonight's celebration. Eater has more details, but with an open bar, live band and a variety of drink packages, this is sure to be a hopping spot.Per NYMag, Motorino in Williamsburg, one of the hottest pizzerias in town, is offering a $30 prix fixe and BYOB. Splurge on the black-truffle pie if you dare. Although L'Artusi is offering a $175 package, which includes a multi-course meal and drinks throughout the evening, they are also offering an 11pm-2am drink only package available for $60. Considering Joey Campanale's affinity for choosing great wines that is a pretty good deal.Newcomer this year, Almond in the Flatiron district, will be offering a reasonably priced 4-course menu for $65/person. The menu sounds quite delicious and considering it always has a festive atmosphere I expect the place to be very festive. More on the Feedbag.Pamplona is offering a $70/person 4-course menu which includes cava and some of Alex Urena's delicious celebratory creationsAll of the Rosa Mexicano's are offering a $55 multi-course meal with multiple seatings and a DJ and party favors to help ring in the New YearTaboon on the far westside is offering a $65 5-course menu complete with champagne before 9pm. Go for the addictive housemade flatbread then walk down the street (if you dare) for the insanity in midtownFor a free show far away from the madness that is Times Square, visit Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza for fireworks and a musical performance. Show starts prior to midnight and continues into 2009. Brown bagging is a popular thing to do (although I would never advocate such a thing...)Happy New Year Everyone! Speak to you in 2009!

Warm and Cozy at the Spotted Pig

***CONTENT
On this rainy and cold Christmas Eve I ventured downtown to Spotted Pig for my first meal at the famed gastro-pub. It has been on my list for years, but for some reason I never managed to get my act together and make it to April Bloomfield's much heralded spot. The lunch crowd was thin, being that it was a holiday and disgusting outside so we were immediately ushered upstairs to a quiet table. I already liked the place, a hodge-podge of decorations, pictures and other assorted attic finds, it was my kind of spot. Besides the backless stools I was a fan. More important though was the food, and by the looks of the heaping plates of fries and other dishes I wasn't too worried.Unfortunately my trip hit a minor speedbump. Always one to appreciate and gravitate towards a good burger in the city, I had planned to order the burger for lunch. No dice. They were apparently out of the burger, something I simply cannot wrap my head around. To make matters worse, as I sat there in my confused and dissappointed state the \"last\" burger was served just feet away to another diner. After a few minutes I pushed on, helping to select the last of our dishes, all of which we would be sharing. Some deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, a hearty bowl of the haddock chowder, the famous ricotta gnudi and the cubano (taking the place of the burger). We also ordered a bottle of rose wine, a nice sweet compliment to our rather heavy meal.The deviled eggs and chicken liver toast arrived first. The eggs were good, not amazing, but good and something I would recommend to any egg fan. The toast on the other hand was delicious. It was rich without being too heavy and was served atop grilled or toasted country bread making for a wonderful combination of textures. Topping it with some olive oil was also a nice touch.The entrees arrived and we could hardly contain ourselves. The gnudi was the first to be attacked, drenched in a brown butter and sage sauce, these little morsels were wonderful. The fresh and light sheep's milk ricotta filling was remarkably addictive and we found ourselves all but licking the bowl clean of the brown butter. The chowder was thick and chunky, just how I like my chowders and the perfect food for a day like today. A variety of vegetables mingled with the chunks of haddock and the homemade oyster crackers added a nice crunch to the dish. I was impressed by the cubano, not something I would generally expect to find on the Pig's menu, but it was delicious albeit a bit expensive. Nice crusty bread, pressed around a decent amount of roasted pork, it didn't beat the cubano at say Milanese or another Spanish restaurant, but was a nice upscale alternative. I would have preferred more pickles, or cornichons in this case, but overall a nice sandwich. For the most part the meal went smoothly, nice service, good food and good company. I was happily surprised to find the bill at about $35 a person for food, wine, tip and tax, but still find it a bit expensive for what the food is. Regardless, I'll be back and when I am I won't need a menu, just that elusive burger.314 W 11th St #,New York, NY 10014(212) 620-0393, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($20-50/person)

***CONTENT
On a rather quiet and boring stretch of 25th street, Milanese with it's dark red awning is an escape from the bland sandwich shops, subpar sushi spots and forgettable fast food joints. Here at Milanese you do not come for the ambiance, but the food. Delicious, cheap and served in generous portions, this Spanish restaurant is a savior for many of us working in the area. Entering the restaurant you are smacked in the face with bold smells and a bustling scene. A counter serves the regulars to your left and seating is in the rear. Waitresses are slinging food to diners left and right with a quick smile before moving onto the next task. Everything slows down though when you get that first bite of food in your mouth. Milanese offers a breadth of Spanish staples with a few Americanized dishes as well. Lunch specials range from stewed chicken to the more interesting goat meat and even spare ribs. Each lunch special comes with rice and beans or plantains. Other dishes include breaded steak, ox tail, a range of soups and a nice selection of sandwiches. On this blustery winter day I shared the stewed chicken with yellow rice and black beans, stewed goat with fried plantains and the cubano. The chicken was moist and tender, not to mention a heaping portion. The accompanying rice and beans were delicious; the beans were stewed with a onions, peppers and spices imparting a rich, addictive flavor. The goat served as chunks still on the bone was good, but a tad inconsistent. Some pieces were succulent and fell of the bone while others needed some more cooking. Regardless the sauce was quite good and the fried plantains we ordered, served halved, were well prepared and could easily feed a few people. The cubano may have been the defining dish of the meal, perfeclty prepared and well priced (around $6) it was worth coming back for many times over. Each ingredient played a role in the overall taste of the sandwich and it was clear the restaurant does not skimp on their cubanos. I look forward to getting back to Milanese for a leisurely, inexpensive and most of all delicious lunch sometime soon. With this weather, it's also important to know that they do deliver within the neighborhood. 168 w 25th st, (212) 352-0755, New York, NY, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($6-15/person) Update: After a recent visit, and subsequent food coma, I tried a few more dishes. The bistec, or minute steak with red onions is delicious and works well as a sandwich or platter. Spare ribs are rather large, but unfortunately produce limited meat, albeit super tender and moist. Tostones are a bit disappointing but dip them in some of the meat juice and you are good to go.

A New Reason For Me To Go To The UWS

***CONTENT
I'm not one to generally travel to the UWS. It's a far trip from my Brooklyn home and for the most part I can get everything I need food wise downtown and in Brooklyn. This year there has been an UWS renaissance of sorts with restaurants opening left and right. Bar Boulud, West Branch, Shake Shack the new Kefi, to name a few, and now Salumeria Rosi. I made my way up to Salumeria Rosi not too long ago looking forward to delicious cured meats courtesy of Parmacotto and Cesare Casella, but what I found was much more than a meat counter.Upon entering the space you are first met with dozens of different cured meats. For any carnivore it is a beautiful sight and the neighborhood seems to have quickly embraced the new restaurant. To the right of the restaurant there are approximately 25 or so seats under a gorgeous and inventive sculpture of Italy. The place was bustling when I went, but we were fortunate enough to get a table after a glass of wine. With servers moving rather seamlessly around the restaurant and Casella greeting everyone he could see, I found the restaurant extremely welcoming. In looking at the menu you will see there is much more than just meat, with extensive offerings ranging from Spanish mackerel to braised brisket.With a group of four hungry eaters we ordered up a feast which included many small plates and plenty of highlights. Always a fan of brussels sprouts, the Cavolini is served with pancetta and garlic a classic combination. One of Casella's signature dishes, the Insalata Pontormo is a must for anyone visiting the restaurant. A mixture of soft scrambled egg, pancetta and market greens, it is quite addictive and remarkably simple. A leek and pancetta tart was absolutely delicious and a nice homey dish. I was a fan of the butternut squash risotto's , Cavolfiori Gratinati, creaminess and beautiful orange color. A few of the meat dishes were ordered, like the braised brisket with polenta, stewed tripe and pasta with cured pork and we found a common theme. Everything was prepared perfectly, but with a tad too much salt. I tend to believe we were just unlucky though as on subsequent visits fellow eaters have not been faced with the same issue.Of course I can't talk about Salumeria Rosi without mentioning the cured meats we samples, and we sampled a good amount. Ordering up the Selexione del Salumeria, or grand selection pretty much, we had the opportunity to taste Prosciutto Arrosto, Mortadella di Bologna, Prosciutto di Parma, Coppa, Finocchiona, Speck Alto and the Arista. The proscuitto's were superb, wonderfully seasoned and sliced paper thin. I was a huge fan of the smokey speck and the boldy flavored Finocchiona seasoned with fennel. These two also had a great ratio of meat to fat (of course plenty of fat). For anyone visiting the Salumeria, do yourself a favor and order up a plate of the meats, best when shared with friends so you get a few bites of each.After all of the cured meats and shared plates we felt it only appropriate to order dessert and the standout of the bunch was the poached pear in red wine, Pere al Vino Rosso. It was delicious, tender and quite soothing, especially on this rainy weekday night. The restaurant also offers an extensive wine list, including after dinner drinks and if you did not get a chance to try some of the meats just grab some to go as they slice to order whatever you need. Overall a very enjoyable experience and perhaps the final reason for me to get up to the UWS more frequently.283 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10023, 212-877-4800, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate ($30-50/person)

***CONTENT
It's that time of the year, where foodies reminisce about what they ate in 2008 and the media selects their favorite meals, dishes, bites, etc. It's been a great year for food (with the exception of the current recession) and for New York City dining. I've had some great meals and some terrible meals, but there are a number of dishes that just stood out above the rest. In no specific order my top 10 are included below:Momofuku Milk Bar/Bakery - I'm cheating a bit here, but there is a tie between the Passionfruit Chocolate Cake and the Candy Bar Pie. Both are remarkably unique desserts, delicious in their own way and sure to be fan favorites for a long time. Looking forward to what Christina Tosi introduces us to in 2009.Al Di La - A somewhat recent addition to the specials menu, the tripe sliders pushed the boundaries when it comes to sliders. Stewed tripe, with tomatoes and onions, is scooped into a hollowed out sourdough roll and briefly toasted making this dish a must for any Al Di La visitor. It's not always on the specials menu, but occasionally they can make it for you.Txikito - This tiny new spot from Alex Raij burst onto the scene without much notice and quickly became one of my favorite tapas restaurants. Chef Raij's Basque cuisine is simple, with bold flavors and the Arraultza, a canape of sorts with sofrito, chorizo and a fried quail egg was so good I had to order seconds (and considered thirds).Dell'Anima - Grilling their sweetbreads to employ a delicious, charred flavor and appearance, these are by far my favorite sweetbreads in the city. Remaining tender and moist, they are served with a parsley root puree, blackberries and a bit of lemon juice. A well-balanced plate, these little morsels are a must for any sweetbread fan.Momofuku Ssam - I'm a huge fan of duck and Ssam Bar serves it perfectly, long island sliced duck breast, braised thigh meat, brussels sprouts, dijon spaetzle, pear puree and top quality cheddar. It is a busy plate, but everything works well together, making this a truly addictive dish.Blue Ribbon Bakery Market - Of all the Blue Ribbon locations I especially love the market. It's homey, welcoming feel, the amazing smells and most of all the bacon red onion loaf. This tiny house made loaf is perfect on it's own, toasted with butter or even as a bun for a burger.Terroir - It was the year of the wine bar in many peoples eyes and one that clearly stood out was Terrior. From the hit makers behind Hearth and Insieme this tiny spot offers some of the more eclectic wines in the city and delicious bites. The fried sage wrapped lamb sausage is hard to beat as a bar snack in NYC or anywhere for that matter.Blue Hill Stone Barns - One of the more revelatory meals I had all year, the best plate of my 3 hour meal has to be the head to tail heritage pig plate featuring loin, belly, cheek, boudin blanc crispy fried jowel. The combination of textures and tastes made this a standout among many other fine dishes.X2O - Xavier's on the Hudson - This gem of a restaurant in Yonkers, NY is helping to revitalize the area and bring some might tasty food to Westchester County. There are plenty of solid dishes on the menu, but the short rib and foie gras ravioli with truffle butter is a picture of pure indulgence. I remember each bite as if I had it yesterday.Degustation - Somehow this restaurant manages to fly under the radar, but that's fine with me. Wesley Genovart's food gets better everytime I visit and his slow poached egg with smoked cheese foam, prosciutto and sesame crusted asparagus rose among many stellar dishes as my favorite. The contrasting tastes, textures and aromas made these simple ingredients superb.Runners up: Momofuku Ko's Deep Fried Short Rib, Market Table's Turkey Club Sandwich, Bussaco's Pretzel Bites, Taro's Scallop and Uni Special, Scarpetta's Spaghetti with Simple Tomato Sauce, PDT's Chang Dog, Hill Country's Moist Brisket, Flatbush Farm's French Dip, Sichaun Cafe's Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Elettaria's Fried Quail, Peter Luger's Porterhouse and Beacon's Roasted Bone Marrow.Looking forward to what eats 2009 has to offer. Happy holidays and New Year!

Nestled among a variety of sketchy stores along 8th street, Elettaria offers a unique, enjoyable dining experience and cuisine. Entering the space you are greeted by a warm, open bar space. Banquettes to the right and a sizable bar on the left complete with well dressed bartenders and a quite reliable cocktail service. The lighting resembles a lounge, except when you gaze into the rear of the restaurant where a bright, stainless steel open kitchen resides. The restaurant quickly filled up on this somewhat rainy weekday evening. The after drink crowd was slowly replaced by the dinner crowd around 7:30pm and the kitchen really started to move. Led by Craft alum Akhtar Nawab, one of the rising chefs in Manhattan, the menu changes frequently and is heavily influenced by South Asian cuisine.During my visit it only seemed best to order a variety of starters to share, one of my favorite ways to dine. With each starter in the $10-16 range, it's easy to indulge without breaking the bank (entrees can be a bit more pricey with some nearing $30) although it is easy to spend a fortune hear quickly. To start a plate of warm flatbread with a light raita, or similar dip, was served. A great way to start the meal and definitely something you will want to save for some of the latter courses. Emerging first from the kitchen, the fried quail is perhaps one of the better \"bar foods\" in the city. Beer battered, fried and topped with pomegranate seeds, the quail is wonderfully moist and meaty (ironically) and served with a deep fried quail egg which upps the anty even more. I've made my love of sweetbreads clear and Elettaria serves up some nice ones. Accompanied by an apple puree, honeyed endive and pink peppercorns they were delicious. Not the best I've had, but a worthy dish and one I would recommend.Our next batch of dishes began with the infamous pork ribs. I've had these before and found them a tad dry on my most recent visit, but boldly flavored and another dish I'd recommend. Served with cucumbers, lychee and yogurt they are a nother wonderful melding of eastern and western cuisines. The next two dishes to be served were specials that evening, one a turbot served with almonds and concord grapes, the other lúgao, a congee style rish dish made with arctic char and paper thin slices of beef tendon. The turbot was very nicely prepared, with perfectly crisped skin, but a rather bland concord grape sauce. On the other hand, the lúgao was quite impressive, boldly flavored and like no other dish I've had before. My favorite part being the paper thin slices of beef tendon which were previously braised and formed into a torchon before being sliced. It is a special, but hopefully will served for awhile as it is surely a dish worth returning for.We opted not to order dessert and instead chose to have a few drinks, beers, wine and a cocktail. The variety was quite nice, with prices as I expected for a place of this caliber. Service could not have been better, with a warm greeting, humorous bartender and kind goodnight. Although not brand new, the restaurant is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and likely still undiscovered by many.33 W. 8th St., New York, NY 10011, 212-677-3833, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($40-60/person)

If you have never sampled the treats at Kyotofu there is hope. Opening soon at Bo-Concept in Chelsea, Kyotofu will have a kiosk offering their popular sweets making it easy to indulge in miso chocolate cakes or green tea macaroons. Last night there was a little soiree to support the opening with passed items such as the aforementioned miso chocolate cakes, a spicy version of the cake, green tea and yuzu macaroons and savory items like chicken tofu sliders, smoked salmon rolls and quiches. I'm a big fan of the sweets, but the savory items have potential and seem to be getting better every visit.144 W 18th St, New York, NY 10011 5465

Just sampled the few day old Baoguette and there is hope for those in the Flatiron area looking for something beyond tired turkey sandwiches and expensive lunches. I'm not crowning Baoquette as the new lunch spot of the area, but there is promise here as long as they work out a few kinks. The menu is limited to sandwiches and pre-made salads, with noodles, spring rolls and specials on the way. The space, a former Blimpie, seats 10 at a counter and is snug to say the least. Don't expect a Chinatown size sandwich here. No $4 or less double stuffed sandwiches, but everything is under a reasonable $8. The food is quite good with the standard \"baoguette\" filled with shredded pork, pate and terrine, a suitable substitute for a Lenny's, Toasties or other corner sandwich spot, especially at only $5. The BBQ chicken doesn't resemble BBQ chicken at all, but tastes quite good and is filled with a bit of chicken liver adding a welcome richness. The problem with the sandwich isn't the filling at all, all the vegetables are fresh and condiments tasty, but the bread. A supremely stale bread was served today, making that first bite painful and I hope for their businesses sake, and the roof of my mouth, that they fix it. With that fix and the soon to be expanded menu I see Baoguette becoming a new lunch staple, one that I would frequent quite often. 61 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10010, 212-518-4089, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10/person)

Bigger, Bolder, Better?: L'Artusi Has It All

***CONTENT
Opened just a few days ago, L'Artusi, from the guys behind Dell'Anima is sure to be a hit for many reasons. With Dell'Anima's success, late night hours and continual praise from top journalists one would think that the team would simply open a similar spot and have immediate success. Well L'Artusi is a far cry from Dell'Anima, it may share owners, a chef and beverage director, but beyond that the two are very different restaurants.L'Artusi seats over 120 people easily, a far cry from the 30 or so at the team's other spot. The space is two floors, with a massive open kitchen and three different bars (crudo, cheese and of course alcohol). Gorgeous marble bar tops contrast nicely with the dark blue walls and the light fixtures add a nice touch of class. Chairs and booths may remind you a bit of an aquatic theme, but they work, adding a nice color contrast and keeping with the welcoming, relaxed decor of the restaurant. There were plenty of staff members working the night I went, but I expect this to continue as there are many stations to operate and customers to serve. Heading upstairs you will find a more intimate, quieter room. About the size of Dell'Anima, the space is recommended for a meal where conversation is important. Additionally, there is a private space up here, which will is surrounded by a temperature controlled wine room expected to hold hundreds of different labels.While the space is quite welcoming it is the sight and aroma of the food that is what I gravitate towards most. With an extensive menu broken into crudo, verdura, pasta, pesce and carne sections the variety easily surpasses that of Dell'Anima. While there are a few tweaks to be made to the menu and its layout, I expect the offerings to be a hit. The dishes all range between $7 and $20 so far with the average plate running around $14. Portion size, is for the most part, generous. Of the dishes I tasted I would recommend almost all of them.However, there were a few standouts, including the beef carpaccio topped with rye crisp studs and horseradish crema. The carpaccio was paper thin and perhaps one of the better carpaccio's I have ever tasted. Under the verdura section I found the Anson Mills polenta particularly good. With a unique texture and rich taste, it was a great side dish.The pasta's are most certainly a strong suit of L'Artusi and Chef Gabe Thompson, as I was a huge fan of two of them. The spaghetti and meatballs, a comfort food favorite, is brought to a new level without being too gourmet; the addition of pancetta adds a wonderful depth of flavor and richness. The pizzocheri, wide buckwheat noodles, is served with sage, fontina and brussels sprouts and has all the making of a deconstructed lasagna, but better.Of the carne courses the roasted sausage stuffed quail was delicious, but was put to shame by the spectacular involtino di manzo, a beef braciole. The involtino was tender, moist and rich, served with a side of sauteed greens it was one of my favorite dishes of the evening. While the portion on the quail was a bit small (it is a quail) the involtino was a rather sizable portion, perfect for 2, 3 or even 4 people to share.I generally crave more savory courses, but opted to try a few desserts just for kicks. After tasting three desserts, the olive oil cake is a clear winner and a must for anyone visiting the restaurant. It's just sweet enough to be dessert, but not overpowering and quite moist. Finishing in a close second was the baba rum cake, a perfectly prepared, sweet and quite satisfying little dessert.With an extensive wine list, ranging from high-end Italian wines to little known New York State wines. The focus is on medium-sized plates perfect for sharing and with such reasonable prices it's hard to see L'Artusi not succeeding. You can expect the menu to change regularly, waits for tables every night (but first come first serve seats at the bar) and delicious fare from first course to last. I'll be making my way back to L'Artusi very soon.228 W. 10th St., nr. Bleecker St.; 212-255-5757, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Moderate ($30-50/person)

Only Weeks In, NYC Has a New Top Tapas Spot

***CONTENT
Txikito, the impossible to pronounce new restaurant from Alex Raij and her husband Eder, enhances the tapas offerings of NYC exponentially. Raij, who was previously behind Tia Pol and El Quinto Pino, shifts her focus to Basque food at this cramped, yet cozy 2-week old restaurant. Only a couple dishes actually seem similar to those at her previous restaurants (ones she is no longer associated with) and even those are named differently.At 7pm on a Friday the place is bustling, waits for a table reach 30 minutes and will only continue to get longer, but we planted ourselves at the bar quite easily within minutes of walking in. The design of the restaurant is unique and welcoming, distressed wood lines not only the walls, but the ceilings as well. The kitchen is in the back of the restaurant allowing the layout to be a bit more open than Raij's previous spots, although the blue painted wall in the back is a bit out of place. Lighting could stand to be a tad lower, but this was only week 2 and things are still be worked out. The bar is small, but a more than suitable place to eat, as long as you don't mind people reaching over you and perhaps entering your personal space a few times. It's okay though, the food will take you away, remove you from the bar stool and put you in a very happy place.At first glance the menu here seems substantially larger than Tia Pol. Maybe it's the layout, maybe there are actually more items, regardless, Txikito's menu has more \"wow\" effect than any other tapas spot in the city. Dishes like Morcilla, crispy little packages of blood sausage, remind me of spring rolls and are something I want to serve at every party moving forward. The Txipiron Encebollado, also known as squid ribbons with a sweet onion and pine nut sauce, are very enticing. While not my favorite dish due to a lack of texture, it was very creative and was overall quite pleasing. For the more adventurous eater, dive into a plate of Txarripatak complete with trotters, tripe and beef tendon. It's a dish I didn't sample, but most certainly am interested in.Simplicity is a key here, with merely a few ingredients necessary for some of the dishes. A little sandwich of mushrooms and shrimp resembles the smallest grilled cheese ever. It's delicious and would be at home with a mini bowl of spicy tomato soup. Another little sandwich of Basque tuna with piquillo oil and sweet onion is refreshing and served on a tiny baguette. Albongigas, little meatballs, are light and loosely packed with a nice crust on the outside. They are served with a simple shellfish sauce, a welcome departure from heavier tomato based sauces. The blistered peppers or Pipperak are simply charred and served with olive oil and sea salt, a great snack I'll go back for again and again.The most notable dish of the evening had to be the Arraultza, a canape of sorts with sofrito, chorizo and a fried quail egg. A gorgeous little bite, it was packed with richness and quite the array of flavors. We loved it so much we ordered a second serving (2 per plate) and were equally enthralled the second time we ate it. Along with the Arraultza, the Patatas Mentaiko earned high marks. The Patatas, served as french fries, were perfectly crisp and dusted with a bit of chili powder and accompanied by an addictive bowl of spicy cod roe mayo. The mayo is the star here offering a perfect balance of heat and saltiness; anything dipped in this mayo would be delicious.Txikito is a welcome addition to the diverse dining scene of Manhattan. The food is bold, inventive, but remarkably simple. It's easy to grab a few bites or indulge in a full meal without breaking the bank. Be forewarned, the waits will grow as word gets around about the restaurant so either plan ahead and get their early or grab a few drinks while waiting for a seat. I'm looking forward to many more meals here, never being bored by anything on the menu.240 Ninth Ave., 212-242-4730, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($40-60/person)

Plenty of Beef at Paul's Da Burger Joint

***CONTENT
Paul's is by no means a quite, unassuming storefront. Claiming burger supremacy via numerous signs, Paul's Da Burger Joint is a greasy spoon of sorts, with a charm that reminds me of old diners and neighborhood spots with long, rich histories. Around for almost 20 years, Paul's is a place I wanted to like as soon as I walked in. We sat at the counter giving us full view of the flat top griddle and all the prep behind he burgers and sandwiches. A great show, it was impressive seeing massive bags of ground meat, stacks of cheese and more quickly run out. Unfortunately for usPaul's serves rather large portions, with all the burgers nearing or exceeding 8 ounces. The size is great and all, but there is a pretty big problem with these behemoths. While priced fairly, anywhere from $4.50-9 depending on toppings, the burger lacks any sufficient char which is a direct result of the cooking method here. Even though the burger starts on a griddle it is eventually covered with a little lid essentially steaming the burger till it is has reached the desired temperature. As a result, the burger is flaky, soft and lacking any bite. To top it off it is served atop a super soft sesame seed which quickly absorbs all of the burger juice rendering it non-existent. I found it interesting that the restaurant had such a high opinion of its burgers, with signs saying \"the best burger in NYC\" all over the place. With an extensive menu beyond burgers I'm sure Paul's is a great spot for other greasy options, but when looking for a burger there are many better options in the neighborhood.131 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003-8331, (212) 529-3033, Reservations - Not here, Price - Inexpensive ($6-12/person)

Dude, glad to hear that you also found this place to be totally underwhelming. The only good thing was that they'll give you a fry/onion ring plate and the pickles on the table. It's not a good sign when a burger is only as good as the toppings. I don't know why or how this place still has such a following. I guess the price and location keep it thriving. Where's the BEST burger you've had lately?

One of the newer additions to the Park Slope dining scene has generated quite the buzz. Bussaco, which I briefly touched on a few weeks back regarding their freshest mozzarella, has gained raves from locals and critics. The restaurant is located in the old Black Pearl space, a pretty poor restaurant all around, but the location is wonderful. Housed in a formed fire station there is a gorgeous entry way and high ceilings making this feel out of place in the generally cramped Park Slope area. A large bar sits on the left and is flanked by a fallen tree (from Prospect Park) which has been turned into a tall bar table. Bussaco's owner, Scott Carney of Gotham Bar and Grill fame, has put together a gorgeous restaurant and menu with the help of his chef, Matthew Schaefer formerly of Judson Grill. Together the duo have launched a restaurant sure to have staying power in the somewhat tired dining scene that is Park Slope.With a seasonal menu things are sure to change a number of times, but from what I tasted I look forward to my next visit. A tartare of salmon and gravlax was delicious and a welcome shift from the standard tartares. The smokiness of the gravlax paired nicely with the homemade pickles, chopped egg and potato dill toast. The most recent rendition of the freshest mozzarella was paired with heirloom squash, red onions and croutons and while good was a far cry from the earlier version I had with heirloom tomatoes. I'll look forward to next year when tomatoes are back in season.Entrees were a bit mixed, but overall impressive. There seemed to have been a slight stumble when preparing both our fish courses, nicely cooked, but lacking in flavor. Both the Atlantic salmon and wild stipped bass needed seasoning, perhaps a side as well, but were dissappointing. On the otherhand, the chef clearly is comfortable preparing duck and beef dishes. Pastrami duck breast served with black bread stuffing and sauerkraut, the dish was comforting, unique and overall tasted great. More impressive was the beef bavette served with sweetbreads and yorkshire pudding. A perfectly medium-rare flap steak studded with chopped bits of sweetbreads, three flaky yorkshire puddings and an addictive gravy, this was an impressive dish albeit heavy and one I would be happy to eat again and again.The desserts continued to show the skill of the kitchen as we swept our plates clean of every last bite. Fresh cream pana cotta offered a light end to the meal with just enough sweetness and was served with grapefruit and blood orange slices. The pana cotta was remarkably creamy, but not runny and one of the better pana cotta's I've tasted. Another hit was the caramel apple bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream. This individual serving erupted with the smells of apple, cinnammon and nutmeg and reminded me of a delicious and hearty apple pie, but more refined. Served with the ice cream it is quite the comfort food.Other things of note are the bread service, which consists of numerous different breads and rolls served throughout the meal and the wine list. An extensive list featuring wines by the bottle and glass, I simply trusted the sommelier who picked an excellent and affordable red by the glass. I look forward to future trips to Bussaco for the fried poussin and waffle and even more exciting the bar menu, which features a burger, clam pizza and my favorite little pretzels. Welcome to the neighborhood Bussaco.833 Union St., Brooklyn, NY; 718-857-8828, Reservations - Recommended, Price Moderate-Expensive ($30-50)

There is little to dislike about the new Momofuku concept, it is a bakery, a milk bar and directly connected to the always popular Ssam Bar. Momofuku Bakery/Milk Bar shows off the sweet side of the team behind Momofuku and led by Christina Tosi the place is sure to succeed immediately. Serving mostly sweets and a variety of savory dishes, the space is closer in size to Noodle Bar than anything else, but with standing room only. It's open layout allows for a great view of the ovens, glass enclosed cake displays and of course the soft serve machines.After a few tastes this evening I expect to be back many, many times. The chocolate chip cake is like a cake explosion, filled with layers of passion fruit curd, chocolate crumbs, coffee and buttercream this cake is not to be messed with. A perfect balance of rich chocolate and creamy passion fruit it's a must when visiting. The chocolate cake will fill any chocoholics dream and may require you to eat it in small doses due to its richness. A pistachio cake is almost refreshing with a potent lemon curd, but its still indulgent and topped with milk crumbs and more buttercream. A favorite of mine, the blondie pumpkin pie is another must. All the goodness of a blondie combined with the creamy and rich flavor of pumpkin pie and you've got another winner. For the candy bar lover, the candy bar pie is hard to resist. A bit difficult to cut without making a mess, it's filled with smooth caramel, pretzels and a crust that reminded me of the crunch in Twix bars.To top if off, soft serve and cookies are being served up. The snickerdoodle soft serve is refreshing and bursting with flavor and in tasting the snickerdoodle cookie there appears to be a perfect match. Momofuku Bakery/Milk Bar opens this Saturday at 8am and will likely be mobbed from the get go.

Tasting Notes: Zacapa Rum

***CONTENT
I used to be a rum drinker, but eventually moved on to scothes and whiskeys. Not that I had any problems with rum, but I just \"graduated\", if you will, to slightly more classy drinks. This notion all changed recently as a new rum, Zacapa, launched nationally in the U.S. and I was lucky enough to sample some. Zacapa, produced in Guatemala, is imported by Diageo, the mega-spirit producer responsible for bringing us Captain Morgans, Baileys, Cuervo, Johnnie Walker and other large spirit brands.Zacapa is distilled from sugarcane, unlike most rums which are distilled from molasses. Master Distiller, Lorena Vasquez, is one of only three women Master Distillers in the world and she seems to have created a hit in Zacapa. The rum is aged using Sistema Solera, a unique blending technique that infuses the rum with flavor and then rests in hand selected bourbon, sherry and Pedro Ximenez casks. The press materials state \"the use of sugarcane gives Zacapa Rum its exceptional smoothness and creates a pure unique spirit\" and I firmly agree.In tasting the rum it is disctincly different than other rums I've tasted. To put it simply, it is a sipping rum, great with an ice cube or two and enjoyed just as you would a premium scotch. There is a somewhat strong aroma with hints of spice and dried fruit, one that certainly won't remind you of other rums at first, but it's the taste that really sets it apart. With a bit of sweetness when it first hits the tongue, the rum is surprisingly smooth with a nice crisp finish. Be sure to pour it in a clear glass as its gorgeous amber color is something you will want to show off.Expected to be available nationwide this fall I plan on making my way to a local liquor store to pick up a bottle for my bar. Unfortunatley, the rum is a bit more expensive than I'm generally accustomed to at $45, but it's a fair price when compared to premium scotch.

Not everyone loves a little thymus gland, but me, well I'm a huge fan. To some this may make you queasy, sorry in advance, but to adventurous foodies you should start calling for a reservation. Many places fry their sweetbreads (veal if you're interested) giving them a great outer texture while remaining tender and moist on the inside. Occasionally this method lacks flavor forcing you to rely on the accompanying sauces. Dell'Anima mixes it up, grilling their sweetbreads ($14 a plate) to employ a delicious smokey charred flavor and appearance. Remaining tender and moist, they are served with a parsley root puree, blackberries and a bit of lemon juice. A perfectly balanced plate, these little morsels have become my favorite sweetbread dish very quickly. Suck it up, put what they are behind you and dig in, you're sure to enjoy them.

Tucked into a tiny, modern space, Tebaya is serving up some of the more delicious chicken wings I've tasted in awhile. Not your average wings, these are not doused with flour or a breaded coating, but rather fried up crisp leaving the inside nice and juicy and then mixed with a blend of soy sauce, pepper and sesame seeds also known as \"teba sauce\" by the restaurant. This addictive blend gives the wings a sweet and spicy flavor separating them from many of the Frank's-heavy wings around the city. $5.50 will get you 8 wings and it's well worth it. If you go for lunch, order up one of the combo's which all come with wings.144 West 19th, New York, NY 10011, (212) 924-3335, Reservations - Not Accepted/Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($6-10/person)

Molecular Gastronomy has been a hotly debated topic in the culinary world for quite some time. Restaurants like El Bulli, Alinea and WD-50 have aimed to stretch the minds of diners while at the same time appealing to their taste buds. For some, this style of cooking is more an art form than anything else. An opportunity to use food as a vehicle for out-of-the-box thinking and stretching ones mind, but with a lack of focus on taste. For others, it is the future of cooking, a glimpse 20, 30, 50 years down the road illustrating how we may one day prepare, cook and eat our foods. Regardless of what camp you may fall in, as this is a highly discussed topic, I believe it is important to respect what many chefs and restaurants are doing around the world: advancing food culture.My recent trip to WD-50 was met with much emotion. To be frank, I was nervous. Nervous that the food would not taste good, or for that matter that I wouldn't understand it. I am not alone in thinking this. Frank Bruni gave the restaurant 3-stars and thus received quite the backlash. Other critics have slammed the restaurant for losing sight of cooking and thinking too much like chemists. For me, this was an opportunity to learn about this somewhat mysterious form of cooking. While I did learn a few new things and appreciate the work being done in the spotless stainless steel kitchen, I was left unsatisifed, looking for more flavor, more of something to excite me from a taste perspective.Our first courses, gorgeously displayed, read well on paper, but illustrated a common theme of the night, lack of taste. A dish of sweetbreads with peanut, beet-pomegranate sauce and pickled sweet potato was elegant, modern and flavorless. The sweetbreads, perfectly cooked, were rolled in crushed peanuts of which I could barely taste. The sauce was the closest thing to a saving grace while the pickled sweet potato was more awkward decoration than something I advice eating. A second appetizer of corned duck, purple mustard and horseradish cream on a rye crisp seemed equally interesting. Three little bundles stood upright on the plate, topped with some microgreens and are served cold. The duck had a nice texture, but was very mild. Here the only flavor came from the horseradish cream which I wish there had been more of. I found all of the components, when consumed together, bland and disappointing.Moving onto entrees I was hoping the chefs would let loose and really send out some boldly seasoned dishes. Unfortunately my hopes were not to be. Lamb loin, generally a favorite of mine, appeared to be cooked medium rare, but the chewiness of the meat was a huge turnoff. Was it a poor cut of meat or just poorly cooked? Hard to say, but it was not worth the $30+ they charge for it. The lamb was placed on a green apple, celery salad and was accompanied by green-tomater tots. The tomater tots excited me, anything fried generally does, but I thought these had promise. Again, another misstep. Underseasoned and overly mushy on the inside, I would have rather had regular potato tater tots. The monkfish, which was clearly one of the larger portions on the menu, appeared with a multitude of colors surronding it. Red pepper oatmeal, fried olive tapenade, char-grilled turnips and the gorgeously cooked monkfish complete with crisp crust and pearl white interior. It all sounds great in concept, but as I always stress, taste is most important. Here the red pepper oatmeal quickly thickened and became an unappealing consistency. The fried olive tapenade lacked any olive saltiness and was actually quite mushy. Char-grilled turnips at least added some texture to the plate, but it wasn't enough to save it. At least the monkfish was cooked well and appears to have had a generous and welcome dousing of salt.Finishing four plates of food and not finding much to be happy about we opted to pass on dessert. Do understand, dessert looked amazing and probably was, but after going through four plates of food and finding little to like we decided it was for the better. To wash down your food there is an extensive spirits, wine and beer list with some very solid options, of course they can be quite pricey. Overall I don't know if the poor experience was a result of Wylie being in Peru (he's teaching there right now), an off night (it was Halloween) or really just the difference between my palate and knowledge of food and say Frank Bruni's. Regardless, I won't be recommending the restaurant to anyone, but I have gained a better understanding of molecular gastronomy and eating it is the only way I could have done so.50 Clinton St, New York, NY 10002, (212) 477-2900, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Expensive ($60-90)

Wylie's menu and technique are way out there. Doesnt sound like the problems were conceptual, but in the execution. The restaurant has been open long enough for problems to be caused solely by his absence. Sounds like an off nite. I hope to be eating there in the next couple of months.

I've never hidden my love of Al Di La, the popular Park Slope Italian eatery. The menu rarely changes here, not that it's a bad thing, but there is something somewhat new which should lure Manhattanites across the East River. The dish is a tripe slider ($7), something you wouldn't necessarily expect to see scribbled on a chalkboard down at Al Di La Vino, the wine bar associated with the main restaurant. The slider, which almost resembles a bread soup bowl with it's small sourdough roll hollowed out to be filled with the tender braised tripe. The tripe, perfectly cooked, is mixed with a combination of tomatoes, onions and plenty of garlic. I'd have to call this one of the more exciting and delicious bites I have had in the past few months, one I look forward to next time I get to Al Di La.248 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215, (718) 636-8888, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person)

Restaurant Review: Double Crown

***CONTENT
Dining at the new hot spot, Double Crown, the other night I found myself torn. Generally I'm not one to visit such trendy places, but I had been quite intrigued since it's opening. Owned by the AvroKO design firm in NYC the place was destined to be interesting to look at if nothing else. Once I viewed the menu a few weeks back my expectations shifted a bit, with an assortment of delicious sounding dishes from duck steam buns and miso marrow bone to a venison wellington.Finally making it there the design element sure is evident from the moment you walk in the door. A large bar to the left is beautiful with ornate lighting and an interesting fan and lighting belt system. To the right it looks a bit more like a Chinatown garage sale with a random neon light hanging on the wall and decorative stone pieces just leaning against the wall. The rear of the restaurant is a bit more intimate with small nooks for group dining. Continuing back you come across a lounge where the lighting is limited, the noise level higher and a crowd that may just be cooler than you. Downstairs the bathroom corridor is narrow, but while waiting you can appreciate the word carvings on the walls. A private dining area, which likely sits 30 is also downstairs. Regardless of its shortcomings the restaurant is a site to see, whether you enjoy it or not, as it has so many interesting fixtures and elements throughout.On to the food, the most important part of dining anywhere. A theme developed as I was eating at Double Crown, on paper the dishes have interesting components which some may question, but when eaten not all of the components partner to make the dish taste better. Some of my favorite dishes were the crispy whitebait with dried chili and lime. A platter of tiny fish, fried whole, then covered with the juice of half a lime and a generous dousing of chili flakes. The dish was simple and delicious. The miso-glazed bone marrow was another dish I really enjoyed. Originally nervous about the strong flavored miso taking away from the beef bone marrow, my concerns were wiped away after one bite. The miso added a sweetness which helped cut the richness of the bone marrow without overpowering it. Served with a useless orange-olive marmalade, I recommend this dish be eaten simply with the provided brioche. Sea bream sashimi with smoked vinegar was bright, flavorful and tasted of the sea, a wonderful dish among a menu filled with heavier dishes.A number of dishes had plent of promise as well, but just fell short, like the duck steam buns. Originally the dish I was anticipating most, I found the buns to be lacking in texture and quite frankly duck. Somewhat hollow in the middle, these buns were soft and chewy all the way through and would be greatly improved with another texture and more filling. Venison wellington was an interesting dish on the menu and had great flavor, but wrapping it in cabbage seemed pointless and made the puff pastry crust a bit soggy. I was a fan of the cranberry chutney though, which paired nicely with the gamey venison. A starter of streaky ham with glazed figs was saved by homemade grainy mustard, but otherwise was lackluster.With some successes and a few missteps there were also some failures. Cured Scottish salmon was bland and forgettable. Goan vegetable curry never had a chance with it's uneven cooked vegetables and somewhat boring sauce. Desserts were interesting, but nothing really stood out, with the only exception perhaps being the rice pudding samosas, more for the idea than the taste.It's clear that Double Crown's kitchen can produce some interesting and delicious dishes, but it is also clear that, just in line with the design, creativity and showmanship come first, before flavor. Is it worth a visit for the food, debatable. However, for a drink or two and perhaps that bone marrow and whitebait at the bar, absolutely. The extensive wine, spirits and cocktail list is a draw in itself and it's fast becoming a destination for drinks more than food.316 Bowery,New York 10012, 212-254-0350, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Expensive ($50-70/person)

I've dined at Ssam Bar before, had a wonderful experience and have been waiting to get back since, not only craving the infamous pork buns, but to try a bevy of new items from the menu. A recent dinner produced many delicious memories, ones that are sure to get me back to Ssam soon. As usual, the place was packed Friday evening even though it was relatively early (not even 7pm). Killing the time I ordered an Alagash white, a superb beer, though overpriced at $9. I'm glad I got it, but really don't understand how the beer could be marked up so much. Once we were seated at the bar, my favorite spot here, we scanned the menu immediately opting for the pork buns. While a recent review on The Feedbag may claim these little morsels of goodness have declined in quality I assure you, they are just as delicious as ever. Same goes for the rest of the menu, but I'll get to that shortly. Also ordered first, the cured hamachi clad with a horseradish puree and crispy seaweed. A fabulous range of flavors in this dish, from the briny, salty fish to the pungent horseradish and back again to the saltwater taste of the seaweed. Each element was good on its own, but when combined the true quality of the dish came through. Another delicious dish was the honeycrisp apple kimchi, topped with crispy, smokey jowl, maple labne and arugula. A restrained dish which helped mellow out the evening.Ordering up a round of OB beers, the Korean equivelant of Budweiser except better, we placed an order for the duck. Before it appeared, the kitchen sent out a gift, fried brussel sprouts in a fish sauce vinaigrette with scallions and mint. A powerfully flavored dish the brussel sprouts were delicious. The vinaigrette brought a strong, yet welcome saltiness and the charred bits of brussel sprouts truely highlighted how good this vegetable could be. Shortly after the duck arrived complete with sliced duck breast (cooked perfectly), braised thigh meat, brussel sprouts (different than the previous dish), spaetzle, pear puree and top quality shredded cheddar. A gorgeous dish with so many components it was initially difficult to choose what to eat first. This certainly did not last long though as each part of the dish, as in other Momofuku dishes, really has a purpose. Bringing the spaetzle and pear together is great, but adding a shred of thigh meat elevates the bite to extraordinary. Being a huge duck fans my girlfriend were almost prepared to crown this one of the best duck dishes we have ever had and that says quite a lot. After a relatively salty meal I really craved something sweet and knowing the skills of Pastry Chef Christiana Tosi we quickly orderd the PB & J. Here the popular sandwich from our childhood is transformed into a peanut butter crumble like cookie, concord grapes and to keep with the salty theme a saltine pana cotta topped with crumbled saltines. A playful dessert it suffered only because I had been looking for a break from the salt and this was one of the more salty dishes of the evening. Overall another delicious meal at Ssam, perhaps better than my last visit, if only because I tried more dishes this time. Still going strong and still remarkably popular, I'm happy to see changes in the kitchen, an expansion of the space and all the awards and accolades haven't resulted in a decrease in quality. 207 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003, (212) 254-3500, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($30-60/person)

Making my way into Chinatown yesterday I was filled with anticipation. Eager for the food that had been talked up, eager to order up a cheap feast and most of all eager to sink my teeth into the fried salt and pepper pork chops I had heard so much about. I could probably end the post there with many people already clamoring to find out where they can get these delicious bites, but there is more. Located on on Mott Street, there is little to distinguish the restaurant from others in the neighborhood and the menu is not entirely recommended. Of the dishes I tried I found the pork chops tops and worth the trip alone. The other dishes, pork soup dumplings, rice cakes with oxtail ragu and scallion pancakes were nothing unique or special, but for the most part quite good. Back to the pièce de résistance (I couldn't help myself), the pork chops. About the size of a large chicken wing or rib, the chops have a nice crispy exterior seasoned heavily with salt and pepper (hence the name). Extraordinarily tender the meat falls right off the bone and you may find yourself eating half the order without taking a break (about 6 per order if you're curious). There is little more to say except get down to Chinatown, bring a few bucks and order up the pork chops, you won't be disappointed.

There area few menu items that just grab my attention; short ribs, bone marrow, truffles, heirloom tomatoes, veal and everyone's favorite, mac & cheese. That last one, mac & cheese jumped out at me today while reading the review of Almond, the new hopping spot on East 22nd street, on NYmag.com. The review comments on the food, pool table (yes pool table) and of course the food, giving a special nod to the mac & cheese. Almonds version reads as follows: \"Le Grand Macaroni & Cheese\" (prosciutto, chopped truffles). At $18 it may be a bit more money than say S'mac, but I guarantee you it is much better. I'll be getting myself over there as soon as I can to try this out and some of the other dishes, including braised short ribs, daube of lamb belly, scallops and braised pork shank and the intriguing polenta ravioli.

Just bit into the #7 from Viet-Nam Banh Mi So 1 and wow. The # 7 is a meatball Banh Mi, packed with juicy pork meatballs, shredded carrots, etc, etc. What really matters here is that each ingredient really adds up to a superb sandwich. The bread is fresh with a bit of chewiness, the vegetables nice and crisp and the spicy sauce when added to the meatballs is addictive. It's an unassuming storefront, and the shop is about the size of a taxicab, but I urge you to stop in. With 17 (yes, 17) different types of sandwiches available and nothing costing more than $5 you can find yourself eating here everyday if you choose to. A variety of fresh juices, spring rolls (which are made fresh all day and are rather refreshing) and more are also available, none of which cost more than a few dollars.369 Broome St, New York 10013, 212-219-8341

It's almost criminal that it took me so long to get over to Hill Country, the top NYC BBQ spot for many foodies, but finally I made it there today. Armed with an appetite and some hungry friends we ordered up an extensive array of food. You may ask why the quick eat and not a full review, well I plan to go back and ultimately get some great shots of the meat and try even more, so in due time. Overall we sampled plenty on this first trip, moist brisket that was tender as any I've ever had. Kreuz jalapeno and cheese sausage which had a great bite and was filled with little pockets of cheese and jalapenos. The pork chop, a flinestonian sized piece of meat, had a great smokey crust, but was a tad dry. Pork and beef ribs, both delicious, but not my favorite bite of the day (that was the sausage and brisket). The bottom tier meat was the beef shoulder, lacking in flavor and not remarkably tender. Regardless, a great meal of assorted BBQ meats perfectly complimented by mac and cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, corn bread, pickles and cucumber salad. I look forward to the next trip and some photos. For any hungry group Hill Country is a must.

Unfortunately there are no pictures, but the crowd last night at Morimoto, celebrating the close of the first NYC Wine & Food Festival, was spectacular. A room of the top chefs (Todd English, David Chang, Alfred Portale, Morimoto, Bobby Flay, Ferran Adria, Mikey Price, Joey Campanaro and much more), food personalities and more, drank and snacked on treats like foie gras croquettes (not the literal name), sushi, eel cotton candy, wagyu beef served two ways and more. With all these culinary minds under one roof I have to admit I was a little star struck, but the event was fabulous. With spirits, champagne and Morimoto's Rogue beers being served no one seemed to have a problem putting a few back on a Sunday evening.From the party, which wrapped up around 11:30pm some went to the Meatpacking District, others home and I went to dell'anima where we feasted on grilled octopus, delicious ricotta ravioli, risotto with salami and sausage, grilled tender sweetbreads and an enormous and succulent pork chop. A great meal to wrap up a thrilling weekend and now back to realty. To all those that had a chance to enjoy the festival I hope you enjoyed it just as much as I did. Also, a huge amount of respect and a very appreciative thank you to those that threw the event as it could not have gone smoother.Update - Eater provides a great snapshot of who was at the Morimoto event:NYWFF-- The closing party for the NYWFF at Morimoto last night was perhaps one of the major highlights of the entire event. Just take a look at the guest list: Jose Andres, Lee Schrager, Ferran Adria, Masaharu Morimoto, Noel Cruz, Joe Campanale, Cesare Casella, Dana Cowin, Kate Krader, Todd English, Yann de Rochefort, Bobby Flay, Stephanie March, Michael Berl, Nicole Bermensolo, Marisa May, Pichet Ong, Anne Burrell, Akhtar Nawab, Guy Fieri, Seamus Mullen, Jason Denton, Alfred Portale, David Chang, Tom Colicchio, Govind Armstrong, Waldy Malouf, Alice Waters, and Ken Friedman.

The heirloom tomato tasting at Scarpetta was a great treat this afternoon. Tim Stark (highly respected heirloom farmer) and Scott Conant chatter about heirloom tomatoes, farming, the restaurant and more while a lucky room of fans and press dined on three tomato based dishes. The first being a tomato salad with frisee and white asparagus vinegarette. The second an amazing piece of fried mozzarrella atop a chunky cherry tomato sauce. Last was Scott's signature dish, spaghetti with tomato sauce, a delicious and simple interpretation of the dish. Photos below.

It took sometime to get this post up, but for good reason. The party probably never stopped for some last night, whereas I finally made it in a few hours before sunrise. Mixing it up with hundreds of others at SWEET last night was quite a pleasure. Set in a gorgeous venue on the waterfront, the top desserts and pastries from around the city were at everyone fingertips. Beverages were flowing, music pumping (courtesy of an unhappy looking Samantha Ronson) and popular food celebrities from Bobby Flay to Cat Cora and Miami's popular chef Govind Armstrong (who will be opening a place in NYC). Top tastes from sweet were at Jean-Georges table where Johnny Iuzzini served up lolipops with peanut butter, chocolate, jelly and even gold dust. chanterelle's pastry chef Kate Zuckerman was serving a comforting roasted pear with brioche and truffle honey. The Stanton Social had decadent chocolate peanut butter cupcake while Grammercy Tavern, Kotofu and Del Posto also were on my list of favorites.From SWEET which went until midnight a portion of the crowd went upstairs to the Macy's after party. The same gathering of chefs from earlier could be found as well as Marcus Samuelson and Todd English. Anne Burrell, Bobby Flay and Susie Fogelson of The Food Network could be seen dancing up a storm with pretty much anyone who crossed their paths. Food was subpar and not the draw here and the bar was stocked with everything you would need. To top it off a gorgeous view on the roof helped break up the dancefest downstairs. For photos from last nights fun (and debauchery) check out this slideshow.The weekend wraps up tonight with the Mohegan sunset and then a number of afterparties. Look for wrap up coverage tonight or tomorrow depending on how late into the night the parties go.

***CONTENT
Saturday at the NYC Wine & Food Festival brought two rounds of grand tastings and a number of other events. The tastings were the premier events for the day crowd with tickets going for $150 each. The event was located at Pier 54, right on the Hudson River offering great views of the westside and New Jersey. Fortunately the weather was gorgeous with the sun beaming down and a cool breeze pouring through the tents. Unfortunately, the event was packed and the later it got the more drunk the crowd; making it rather difficult to move seamlessly through the event without the fear of having a drink spilled on you (even though they were handing out those nifty around the neck drink holders). All proceeds went to the charities Share our Strength and The Food Bank.With numerous tastes and beverages it was hard to get through everything and throughout it all I had to show restraint as there are more events to be had this evening. Of the samples I did have the top spots were: Hill Country - Pete Traversa's pulled pork sliders were incredible and in my opinion the best bite of the dayPamplona - Alex Urena partnered with a Kobe beef provider and served a luscious beef brisket with manchego rice. Superbly tender and quite rich, I was glad the piece was smallFelidia - Raw tuna caprese, extremely refreshing, the fresh burrata really was the highlightJohnny Utah's - A perfect slice of chorizo with pickles. Simple, spicy, deliciousLandmarc - Mark Meyers manned this station and served a garlicky orchiette with sausage in a cream sauce, a real crowd pleaserCookshop - Meyer's other spot, brought out root beer float sundaes towards the end of the second tasting and were all the rageSalumeria Rosi - Cesare Casella's new spot had a stand slicing up delicious prosciutto as well as grilled prosciutto with rosemary. Both were amazing, with my favorite being the cured prosciuttoFrom a drink perspective, the Maker's Mark booth was serving some great cocktails and Corona's beer cocktails were rather intriguingPhotos of the above as well as more can be found here.

I have no real physical takeaway from the Adria/Bourdain talk, but it sure was memorable. With no pictures being allowed unfortunately I couldn't grab a shot of the famed chef and chef/personality, but what was said was most important. Bourdain brought his great way with words, affinity for cursing, and wonderfully blunt personality while Adria spoke from his heart and had a great sense of humor. With the focus of the conversation being on the food at El Bulli and the future of avant-garde cooking it was enlightening and quite a joy to get a glimpse into the worlds most famous kitchen. My personal favorite line of the event courtesy of Adria via translator on molecular gastronomy and the mystery behind it:\"It's like seeing magic, you don't want to know how it is done\"Look out for a documentary, by Bourdain, on Ferran Adria and El Bulli to be out soon.

The premier event of the NYC Wine & Food Festival, Burger Bash, went smoothly last night below the lights of the Brooklyn Bridge at the old tobacco warehouse. A packed event at a gorgeous location, it brought together some of the best burger chefs/cooks/etc. in the country as well as all the food personalities you could imagine. The offerings were extensive, with 18 total burgers available from chefs and kitchens like David Burke, Strip House, Shake Shack, even Al Roker and many more. Everyone brought something unique to the table, whether it was a simple slider with griddled onions like White Mana or a dry-aged burger with applewood smoked bacon and spicy shrimp mayo from David Burke, everyone could find a burger they liked. Blue Moon was flowing and desserts by Jacques Torres, Godiva, Momofuku and more were there to offset the meat heavy eating.Not to be forgotten, the burger bash was a competition, a friendly one at that, and attendees were urged to text in their votes for their favorite burger. The surprising outcome (to pretty much everyone there), was that not only did a popular burger spot or highly qualified chef not win, but that the winner was Katie Lee Joel (with a patty melt!!). I did not speak with anyone who had the burger so I couldn't gauge their reactions, but for the most part it seemed remarkably odd that she walks away with the title of best burger. My personal favorite was Market Table's burger, with Mikey Price manning the burgers which were moist, bursting with flavor and sandwiched on what I believe is one of the better buns in the city. My full ranking is below and while I am impressed I managed to sample 10 of the 18 burgers, lets just say I won't be eating a burger for quite some time.

***CONTENT
Last night was the kickoff event for the NYC Wine & Food Festival at Chelsea Market. The event, dubbed \"Chelsea After Dark\", brought Food Network personalities, local chefs, restaurateurs and other food personalities together to sample a variety of foods and drinks with hordes of fans. The event began at 8pm and wound down by 11pm with plenty to see and do. The biggest draw was Bobby Flay, the host of the event, and his burgers from Bobby's Burger Palace. Crowds of fans chanting \"Bobby, Bobby\" were a bit much, but it was good to see such enthusiasm. Giada De Laurentiis and Guy Fieri also brought screaming fans, but Flay was the one bringing the hysteria. Also on sight were Wylie Dufresne, Nigella Lawson, Morimoto, Katie Lee Joel as well as reps from all the major food publications. Below is a photo summary of the eats and the event. More coverage to follow all weekend.Buddakan was one of the first booths when walking through the nicely decorated entrance. Dale from Top Chef was helping them serve tuna tartare spring rolls, a nice light and refreshing bite.A Tommy Bahama booth was all about the mini-mojito's.The Cleaver Company was offering bite size lamb and tzatziki burgers which were flying off the plate.Amy's Bread was serving pizza, interesting, but likely better when fresh.Morimoto's booth, one of my favorite, was serving a lamb carpaccio, which was one of the more unique options of the evening.The Food Network station, pushing their new company magazine, was cooking up duck confit canapes and shrimp, grits and andouille plates. Both were quite good.Like I said, Bobby's burgers were all the rage and he served two. A \"Crunch Burger\" topped with potato chips and some ketchup as well as a pickle and coleslaw topped burger. The potato chip topped burger was my preference, although I did find the chips got soggy after about half the burger. One thing to note the burger was perfectly cooked and the meat very good quality.Eleni's bakery had mini cupcakes, including this caramel apple bite which was surprisingly difficult to eat.

Restaurant Review: New Yeah Shanghai

***CONTENT
There are so many options in Chinatown it's hard to pick where to dine. After much deliberation my group and I landed on New Yeah Shanghai, a popular spot on Bayard street directly across from another Chinatown staple New (Nice) Green Bo. The facade of New Yeah is dated, but its the hand rolling of the dumplings in the window which entices you to come in. After a short wait we were seated in the front section of the restaurant, the back, which you must cross a small bridge to get to, also has a surprisingly large number of seats. We ordered up a round of Tsing Tao's, the crisp light beer of China and at only $3 a pop a steal. The menu here is just as extensive if not more than other spots in the neighborhood, so don't limit yourself to one or two pages. We ordered up the famous steamed juicy pork buns, steamed pea shoot buns and scallion pancakes to start. The pork buns, served 8 to an order, were delicious and piping hot. Filled with a fragrant pork broth and pork chunks it was a wonderful way to start the meal. The pea shoot buns didn't stand a chance after the pork ones being so good and unfortunately they were a bit bland. On the other hand, the scallion pancakes were superb, some of the best I've ever had; perfectly crispy, appropriately greasy and filled with tender little bits of scallion. Our next batch of food featured pork fried dumplings which were tender and crispy, great little packages meat. We also ordered sesame beef, pork fried rice and Shanghai pan fried noodles. Of the three larger plates the noodles were my favorite as they had a wonderful taste and a great mixture of pork, chicken, shrimp and vegetables. The beef, while okay, lacked any crisp and was soggy and weighed down by the heavy corn starch based sauce. The fried rice, was simple, but good and not overly greasy. For a large meal for 6 I would have expected this to run us a good amount of money, but to our surprise it was a mere $20 each pushing this towards the top of my personal favorite cheap eats spots. I eagerly await my next visit to try out such dishes as the pork belly, cold noodles, braised noodles and more. 65 Bayard St, New York, NY 10013, (212) 566-4884, Reservations - Accepted, Price - Moderate - $10-30/person

***CONTENT
This past Sunday brought one of the larger street festivals in all of Brooklyn, Atlantic Antics, which was celebrating its 34th year of bringing people together along Atlantic Ave from 4th Avenue down to Hicks Street. The fair features the general sausage and pepper stands, grilled corn and jewelry and craft booths, but what really makes it special is the participation of local vendors and restaurants. Restaurants all along Atlantic Ave. including Brawta Cafe, Chip Shop, La Mancha, Blue Marble Ice Cream and Pete's Ale House and much more. Music was being played all along the streets and belly dancers and even children's dance groups were on display. But what's really the most important, well the food and there sure was a lot of it.One of my first stops was at Bacchus, a French bistro, where they were serving merguez sausage sandwiches with a mildly spicy aioli. While not the most attractive looking dish it was a nice snack and only cost $3.The next stop brought one of my favorite bites of the day, Bev Eggleston, a famous hog farmer of Eco-Friendly Foods who per Eater supplies David Chang, was serving delicious spicy pork burgers dubbed \"Obama Burgers\". Amazingly succulent, with a nice char they were topped with mustard seeds and homemade pickles, truely amazing, it makes me sad I cannot find a restaurant that provides them. The stand was also serving \"Joe Bidden Gelato\", which I received a sample of the bosch pear and bourbon.Moving further west I stopped at Damascus Bread, a Middle Eastern bakery, with an impressive assortment which included kibbeh, meat and vegetable pies, falafel, baklava and more. A small spinach pie was a mere $1 and provided some nice sustenance.Getting back to the heavier food we headed over to Pete's Waterfront Ale House where a rocking party was going on and some great BBQ was being served. I opted for the brisket sandwich and coleslaw for $6, deciding I'd already had my share of pork for the day. The brisket was wonderfully tender and came with a sweet and tangy bbq sauce. The coleslaw was a nice refreshing and creamy side dotted with mustard seeds.On the sweeter side of things, Blue Marble Ice Cream closed down their shop and sold all products street side. Their mint chip was thick, creamy and all indulgent. Chocolate chunks emerged from the fresh and natural mint ice cream making for a wonderful treat after the trek down and back on Atlantic. All in all it was a great day of walking, eating and mingling with other Brooklyn residents and most importantly there was some remarkably tasty food.

***CONTENT
Bussaco, the new addition to the Park Slope dining scene, opened on Friday in the old Black Pearl spot on Union Street. The menu has been revealed on NYMag and has some remarkable sounding dishes, particularly the Beef Bavette (braised sweetbreads, Yorkshire pudding). On Friday evening the restaurant had a handful of customers at the bar and sitting among the tables. The space is clearly still being finished, but it has a large inviting entrance, gorgeous wooden bar (made from a fallen tree in Prospect Park) and luxurious banquets. The staff seemed friendly and excited, but of course still has some things to get up to speed on. I sampled \"The Frehsest Mozzarrella\", a boldly named appetizer. It was a very attractive dish, with large chunks of yellow and red heirloom tomatoes, red onions, croutons and basil atop a disc of slightly warmed mozzarrela. The cheese was quite fresh, per the server each dish is made and melted to order, and being slightly melted added a welcome indulgence factor. We also sampled a white and red wine, both good and priced around $8-10 a glass (which was generously poured). Overall Bussaco seems to have a bright future and I look forward to having a full meal here and wish them the best.Bussaco, 833 Union St., nr. Seventh Ave.; 718-857-8828, Reservations - Likely Needed, Price - Moderate ($30-50/person)

So, basically you had an appetizer and a glass of wine?

That's correct. I had one appetizer, a bread basket, tried two glasses of wine, spoke with the bartender and surveyed the space and food coming out of the kitchen.

Pichet Ong's West Village bakery, Batch, sure offers some unique and delicious treats. Walking into the brightly colored spot next to P*ong you are met with a multitude of fresh baked goods and a wonderful aroma. Chocolate chip cookies had just emerged from the oven when I arrived, an intoxicating scent that I wish I could bottle up. There are many items showcased on the counter and in the glass fridge, most notably the many varieties of cupcakes. I opted for the carrot cake cupcake, complete with salted caramel frosting and filled with lime cream cheese frosting. The pictures below don't completed do the cupcake justice as they are from a camera phone, but you get the point. I also opted for a fresh chocolate chip cookie and while good, it was not nearly as memorable.# A 150 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 929-0250, Price - Inexpensive

In a tiny shop just North of Houston sits Nicky's, an unassuming storefront serving some delicious foods. Just recently I ordered up the chicken sandwich, not the classic Vietnamese sandwich with pork and pate, but delicious nonetheless. It came topped with pickled carrots, cucumbers, cilantro, mayo, and spicy sauce on a french baguette. The roasted chicken was warm, tender and quiet moist, a nice change from the many sandwich shops serving the obligatory grilled chicken breast. For a mere $5 this sandwich ranks pretty high on my sandwich favorites and I'm surely going to pay Nicky's a return visit. Next time maybe the pork, or even the portobello mushroom sandwich.150 E 2nd St, New York, NY 10009, (212) 388-1088, Reservations - Not Accepted/Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10/person) and cash only

***CONTENT
Tom's restaurant, which opened in 1936, still feeds hordes of Brooklynites and New Yorkers every week. It's a neighborhood spot with a well-known name and wait on the weekends. The owner Gus Vlahadas greets you with a handshake, a smile or a pat on the back. Everyone is welcome here for breakfast, lunch or dinner, but the most popular time is Saturday brunch (they're closed on Sundays). Arriving before 11am is a very smart move and highly recommended unless you enjoy waiting in potentially long lines.Like clockwork the line swings out the door and sometimes around the building at 11am every Saturday rain or shine. While the line may not be enjoyable overall it is one of the easier lines to deal. The reason being the busboys actually offer you samples of orange slices, sausage, cookies, orange juice, coffee, the obligatory wet naps and much more. It's this welcoming service that makes everyone feel at home and the line just goes that much faster as a result. Most everyone comes here for the brunch and for good reason. Tom's offers some of the best pancakes I have ever had and you can go a dozen meals and not order the same kind twice. Blueberry, apple, strawberry and the more unique lemon ricotta, pumpkin, cranberries with sweet corn and more. The pancakes, three to a serving, are light and fluffy and can easily be pulled into bite-sized pieces with a mere tug of your fork. My favorite, the blueberry, are ripe with fresh blueberries which manage to hold their shape and \"pop\" in the cooking process and burst in your mouth when eaten. Other offerings of challah french toast and Belgian waffles are just as good and topped with similar if not identical toppings seen with the pancakes. Homemade butters flavored with lime, strawberry or apple cinnamon are available to all diners and add an extra dimension of flavor if needed or, in my case, are a perfect keepsake to use at home. For the egg eaters, omlettes of all shapes and sizes are available, like the western omlette with ham, peppers and onions or chili omlette. There are always specials available, simply posted on brightly colored signs on the walls and the regular menu hangs beyond the counter with a nostalgic feel. Tom's offers lunch as well, but that may be for another review as the breakfast deserves applause on it's own. 782 Washington Ave, Brooklyn 11238, 718-636-9738, Reservations - Not accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($7-15/person) and cash only

A recent celebration, my girlfriends birthday, found us and a group of friends at Tia Pol, one of our favorite spots in the city. I've reviewed the delicious tapas here before, but have not been to the tapas joint since they lost their chef earlier this year. Well things are still delicious here from the patatas bravas, the addictive fried potatoes with spicy aioli, to the chorizo and chocolate, an unlikely combination that everyone deserves to try. We also opted to try something new in the Spanish tortilla, a mixture of potatoes, egg and onion that resembled a cake or frittata and was delicious. Served with a roasted pepper and mayonaise it was a sizable portion and nice an hearty. Our standards were also excellent, succulent lamb skewers, refreshing fava bean puree toasts, gorgeous blistered peppers and of course the luscious ham and blue cheese (special that night) croquettes. A wonderful night filled with plenty of food (lots of it fried or potato based), sangria and friends I continue to crown Tia Pol as the best tapas spot in the city.205 10th Ave, New York, NY, 212) 675-8805, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($25-$35/person)

With the gorgeous weather today I felt it only appropriate to take a nice walk and eat outdoors. My travels brought me to West Village pizza spot, Pizza Box. I'd never ventured into this shop, but DJ Bubbles of Serious Eats has praised their slices on multiple occasions. Always looking for a good slice it made perfect sense to me, plus they have a huge outdoor patio. I ordered up to plain slices, the only fresh pie at the time, and proceeded to the patio shooing away pigeons all the way to my seat. Upon first examination the slice looked rather poor, or mediocre, but the taste is what really matters here. The crust was crispy and it was easy to pick up and fold, but beyond that there was little right with this slice. It lacked any flavor and really the only thing that kept me eating it was that I 1. paid money for it and 2. was starving. The sauce had a faint tomato flavor to it, a bit sweet, but not prominent at all. As expected the cheese was mediocre quality, but I certainly expected the sum to be greater than its parts...I was wrong. I'll stick with Joe's when looking for slices in the village, they may not be the best in the city, but they certainly have enough flavor to trump Pizza Box.176 Bleecker Street, New York NY 10012, 212-979-0823, No reservations, Price - InexpensiveOn another more positive note, I stopped into my favorite pasta store in the city, Raffetto's and continue to be amazed that every New Yorker does not know about this place. It has a long history of making top quality pastas of all shapes, sizes and flavors and is quite inexpensive. Today I opted for the rosemary parpadelle and at just under $4 a pound it's hard to beat. Other great buys are their fresh and frozen ravioli and assorted specialty goods.144 W Houston St, New York, NY 10012-2546, (212) 777-1261, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate

Dude,Thanks you. Pizza Box is not that good. Let's get Bubbles eyes on this from you. So far Im the only one to challenge him on that besides you. Have you had bleecker street pizza's nonna maria? no joke...
AG
2008-09-25 10:46:00
nyc food guy, completely agree. It was nothing special. I have had the nonna maria, it is the best slice at BSP, but I wouldn't label it best slice though. My problem is, I haven't really had a BEST slice, nothing blows me away in slice form so far in NYC or Brooklyn. My favorite slice is actually a square slice at a spot in Prospect Heights called Amorina. Top quality ingredients, but cheap (2 slices and a drink for $5).

Restaurant Review: Candlelight Inn (Scarsdale, NY)

For roughly a decade I've been going to the Candlelight Inn, always yearning for the wings, teriyaki chicken fingers, fries and cheap beers. To many, including myself, it is a place where you can relax, be yourself and indulge in some top quality bar food without any care in the world. It's appearance from the outside has not changed in some time, it's been around over 50 years, and the parking lot is always crowded no matter what time of the day it may be (and it can be quite a pain navigating). It's been referred to as a biker bar, tavern, dive bar, high school hangout spot and more, but one thing is for sure, everyone is welcome. At first glance the menu appears rather standard, chicken wings, fries, burgers and beers, a typical bar/tavern menu. However, there is more to the food offerings than meets the eye. Popular items such as garlic bread with cheese and pepperoni are always crowd pleasers. The waffle fries (surely frozen, but who cares) come with a bowl melted cheese and freshly diced jalapenos for an indulgent kick. The burgers, available in two sizes, are cooked to order and always have a nice char on them. Even tacos make their way onto the menu and at about $2 each they are a bargain. Cheesesteaks, salads, and even pizza's are also available.The menu is quite robust, but what many people come for are the famous wings. Named top wings in Westchester County multiple times, Candelights wings are available in small, medium and large portions as well as mild, hot, extra hot, chernobyl, teriyaki and BBQ. I've never managed to venture beyond to the chernobyl territory, but on occasion I'll mix the hot and teriyaki for what many call, \"hotbufchickter\". It sounds like a derogatory phrase, but the combination of the sweet, smokey and spicy flavors really hits the spot. The wings are meaty and travel well for those looking for takeout or delivery. Another popular and delicious option is having crispy chicken fingers rolled in a hot sauce of your choosing. The service is just what you would expect from a place always busy with a bit of attitude, quick and to the point. Servers and bus boys fly around the tiny dining area shuttling plates of wings, cups of blue cheese as well as beers from the bar, it's surprising I've never seen a crash in all these years. It's no surprise that the fries are not called French fries, but rather \"freedom fries\" an almost funny term nowadays, but fitting considering the attitude of Candlelight. They are always perfectly crisp and are best with honey mustard a personal favorite of mine.It's hard to contemplate dessert, or even expect it to be anything special at a place like this, but a rotating list of specials, plus a few regular standouts are truly worth it. A favorite of mine is the cookie a la mode. No frills here, simply a warmed 1/4 lb cookie topped with chocolate of vanilla ice cream. As simple as a dessert as you can get, yet the cookie is amazing with chunks of melted chocolate and soon to be melted vanilla (my preference) ice cream all over it. Other options include a variety of pies, cakes and plain ice cream. At a time where the country is quite health conscious with pressure coming from all angles to eat better and eat less, Candlelight perseveres with a loyal customer base and newcomers from far and near. Dining here is pure indulgence, not in the sense of foie gras, homemade pastas or prime cuts of beef, but rather simple comfort food that anyone can find enjoyment in. It is a place where you see old classmates, friends, coaches, neighbors and more. The waits may be long (up to an hour at times), but the food and experience is worth every minute.519 Central Park Ave, Scarsdale, NY 10583, (914) 472-9706, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($10-20/person)

Just came home from the Candlelight. We hadn't been there for many years and were looking forward to introducing our teenager to it. We will never go back. The service was beyond words horrible. The waitress took our order and we watched tables that came in after us receive their food first (the same food that we ordered). After 1/2 hour we stopped our waitress (she never came back to get us another round of drinks) and asked her why we weren't served even the appetizers yet and she claimed the kitchen lost our order but would put in the order again and get us another beer (the glass has been empty for 15 minutes already). Ten minutes later she never came back with the beer. One of us went to the bar, got his own beer and came back to the table. And we waited for the food........ Finally the mozzarella sticks showed up along with the ordered salad. A little more time went by before we got our order. I guess if you don't want wings, don't bother going here. The 'Balboa' was supposed to be on garlic bread - it wasn't. The burger that was ordered 'medium' came with the inside raw. My son had to eat around the middle. I guess that's because the waitress put a rush on it. We had to ask the busgirl to get us the check because our waitress was not around. We waited 20 minutes for a table, which we expected. Waiting 45 minutes for lousy food is unacceptable. Being served lousy food is unacceptable. Having to stop at 7/11 because my son was still hungry is absurd.

sorry to hear you had a bad experience. I certainly don't go for the service (no one does really). It's a greasy spoon spot with good food and familiar faces. The service is usually mediocre at best, just sounds like you had it at it's worst point.

***CONTENT
Last night was the Park Slope Free Food Tour, a new event to the neighborhood where restaurants and shops offer samples from 7pm-10pm to local residents. Initially the turn out seemed bleak and my girlfriend and I were fearful we may be begging for food, but ultimately the turn out was great. In fact, the turn over was likely much larger than anyone had predicted forcing long lines and somerestaurants to ultimately run out of samples earlier than expected. Some of the highlights included the extremely addictive homemade pretzel nuggets at newcomer Bussaco which will be opening in the old Black Pearl spot on Union St. on October 3rd. Across the street Scottadito Osteria was serving some light and fluffy spinach ricotta gnocchi with truffle oil. Further down the street Moim, the popular modern Korean spot, had three treats for guests: kimchi pancakes, bi bim bop spring rolls and beef skewers.Flipsters, the newly named burger spot taking over for Brooklyn Burger Bar had quite the line, but actually served some mighty tasty sliders complete with special sauce and carmelized onions.Down near 15th street Little D'Eatery, which apparently is not closing down and is actually adding lunch, was serving slow-cooked pork shoulder over cornbread with homemade pickles. Winding back up the street you could grab small samples of wine, margarita's, even jambalaya at popular newcomer Nono.One of the more generous offerings was our last stop of the night, Santa Fe Grill. While I may not dine here normally I was blown away by their customer service and the fact that they were actually serving full portions what appeared to be their toastada appetizer. Not to be out done, Cousin John's Bakery served everything in the shop, or at least close to it. Chocolate cake (two kinds), cookies, brownies, canoli's and more. Overall it was a great event and while a bit crazy at times with long lines and limited food (and respect on the part of some participating residents) it was a hit. Hopefully the exposure helps out some of the restaurants and boosts business and I look forward to the event continuing for many years to come.

Just had a fantastic lunch at Market Table, heirloom tomato salad, the burger and turkey club. All dishes were stellar and a perfect way to celebrate a nice, but cold Friday. The standout though was a dish of sauteed sweet corn, shaved off the cob and served with parsley and butter. To top it all off a generous shaving of fresh black truffles, it was a peffect dish to illustrate the changing of the seasons. Absolutely delicious, it was a dish I will not forget and hope to replicate some day. It also rings in truffle season, a happy time for all who can afford (or are lucky enough) to get them.

Restaurant Review: Blue 9 Burger

***CONTENT
On a recent Friday night I ventured out with some friends in town for a little bar crawl from the West to East Villages. It was a great time, an opportunity to catch up, enjoy the weather and have a few drinks. Needless to say, when we got to the East Village we were hungry, personally I was starving. At a time like this there is little that can satisfy me more than a perfectly cooked cheeseburger and the city has it's fair share.Conveniently we were blocks away from Blue 9 Burger when this craving hit me. Blue 9 Burger is a small shop with little decor or atmosphere, however, I've been impressed with what I have heard on the web regarding the patties and figured why not give it a shot (decent remarks from both AHT and Food in Mouth). The menu is limited, but surprisingly inexpensive; ranging from $3.00 for a hamburger to $4.50 for a Blue 9 Burger (double cheeseburger). I opted for a cheeseburger (a measly $3.40) with everything on it. Blue 9 does not ask how you would like your burger cooked, so be ready for something medium-well at the least, however, you may can attempt to ask for it at a certain temperature if you dare. The style of burgers is clearly West Coast, with the thin patties, lettuce, tomato and a soft bun it's best comparisons in New York would be Shake Shack and Five Guys. Cooked to order, the beef is fresh and a nice change of pace from a fast food spot, although it appears to be one. Once the cheeseburger arrived I put on some of their house special sauce, based on appearance it seemed mayo based as most are, and sat down to eat. At first glance the burger was proportionally assembled with lettuce, tomato, onion with the burger somewhat chared and covered in melted American cheese. It was a relatively flavorful and juicy burger considering it's thinness and it was well seasoned. There was a faint pinkness in the center, which was very much welcomed as I was a bit concerned the burger would be too well done for my liking. Blue 9 opened my eyes to another burger spot in the city which I anticpate eating at again. It may not be the best burger, but it is hard to find a burger freshly made and at this price in the city. Other items available include fries (handcut), grilled cheese, milk shakes (a must try next time at only $2.25) and the wide assortment of dipping sauces. 92 Third Ave. New York, NY 10003, 212-979-0053, Reservations - Not Needed/Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10/person)

***CONTENT
With tomatoes in season, BLTs on menu's all over the city and a recent article on NYmag on \"Where to find the best late-summer BLTs what better simple recipe to post than a BLT. To create this you only need a few very simple and easy to find recipes. For me, some gorgeous tomatoes (heirloom, vine, etc.), romaine lettuce (bibb will do as well), applewood smoked bacon (or your preferred bacon), avocado, classic helman's mayo and delicious bread, in this case sourdough from Tom Cat Bakery (I've professed my love of their bread before). A few interesting touches, take 'em or leave 'em, buttering the bread and seasoning lightly with chili powder before toasting. With this bread the sandwichs become smaller, so in my case I recommend preparing two for a full meal. A few easy steps to follow below:1. Cook up your bacon either in the oven or stove top to a nice crispy state2. Wash your vegetables and cut up to fit best on the bread3. Prepare thin slices of avocado4. Toast bread with butter and some seasoning (my choice is de arbol)5. Assemble sandwich with generous spreads of mayo, layering tomato, bacon, avocado and lettuce (or whatever order pleases you the most)6. Serve with chips of your choice, pictured here are Terra chips, and enjoy

Formerly Sullivan Street Bakery, Grandaisy is one of the premier bakeries in the city and fortunately my office is within walking distance. I've made many trips here to enjoy their specialty pizzas, breads, pastries and more and can never get over just how good their products are. For one, walking in you are met with stunning loaves of bread. All shapes and sizes resting above the counter. Below these are the pizza's. These are not your standard pizza's with tomato sauce and melted cheese, but rather a thin focaccia like bread baked crispy and topped with an assortment of vegetables. The cauliflower with onions, olive oil, bread crumbs and gruyere is an example of genius. Perfectly crisp and with a unique sweetness that only comes out from roasting cauliflower, it is by far my favorite pizza here. Other recommendations include the potato and the funghi, both unique and delicious in their own way.Other offerings include sweets such as the panini dolci, a delicate cookie sandwiched around toppings such as dulche de leche and peanut butter, cream cheese and nutella. The cookie reminds of the TKO cookie from Bouchon Bakery, but is a bit more delicate and in my opinion, more delicious. Other items such as pies, cakes, biscotti and even panini's are available with a seasonal menu changing regularly. I've tried to walk in just to see what is available in the past, but it is hard to resist, this is one serious bakery and well worth the trip.73 Sullivan St, New York, NY, (212) 334-9435‎, Price - Inexpensive ($4-$10/person)

Restaurant Review: James

***CONTENT
Recent newcomer to Prospect Heights, James on Carlton Ave, has received a solid amount of attention considering it's location. Reviewed by a handful of major publications/online outlets, it has gained the eye of more than just those living in the neighorbood. Making the trek down the street (James is on my street) seems to have been difficult for me as it took a few months to actually get here. Maybe it was the odd reality that a potentially fantastic restaurant was just feet away from my doorstep. Maybe I was worried of being dissappointed and having to see the spot everyday. Regardless, I'm glad the wait is over.James is a handsome restaurant, no longer looking bleak and dark like it's previous tenant (Sorrel). A contemporary chandelier illuminates the room and the candles and dim lights provide enough light to see your food and also converse with your party. A nice solid wood bar adds some class and the white painted brick walls keep it looking rustic enough for Brooklyn. The space is small, however, and as a result can get loud even when three-quarters full. The menu at James is also quite welcoming and enticing, changing frequently and highlighting the best of the markets offerings.To start we ordered drinks, a Merlot which is escaping me unfortunately and a gin based drink, St. Anne. A solid selection of wines with prices starting just below $10 a glass and cocktails which evoked similarities to neighbors Weather Up and Flatbush Farm, it appears the neighborhood is expanding their alcoholic palates. For starters the heirloom tomato salad with chevre fondue was a wonderful nod to the last of the great tomato bounty. Bursting with flavor the tomatoes swam in a bath of melted chevre and tomato water accented by globe basil and sea salt. The sweetbread starter was also quite good with a rhubarb honey glaze and dandelion greens. Crispy and tender the sweetbreads could have used a little less honey atop them, but I did thoroughly enjoy them regardless.For entrees a beautiful dish of scallops atop a roasted corn salad and a bright green watercress puree brought smiles to our faces. The scallops, generally an appetizer, were perfectly cooked, a tad small, but paired very well with everything on the plate. For my entree, the pinenut and rosemary crusted loin of lamb was cooked exquisitely. Fork tender, it was served with a summer bean stew composed of wax beans, favas, cranberry beans and more it was a great pairing for the meat. I would have liked a bit more seasoning on the lamb as it was a little bland, but overall a nicely prepared dish.I'm not much of a dessert person, something really needs to jump off the menu to get my attention and the ricotta beignets did just that. Served with a tart and sweet raspberry red wine coulis, they were fresh, light and a great way to end the meal on a sweet note. One additional note as to the dessert selection: I was still hungry. James' courses are not enormous and could leave some hungry so be aware. On a more positive note, the food was all delicious and worth a return trip, one that likely will be a special occassion as the bill adds up.605 Carlton Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11238, 718.942.4255, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($30-$50/person)

Restaurant Review: Dallas Jones BBQ

***CONTENT
No this is not a review of Dallas BBQ, the horrendous chain throughout the boroughs with signs on every other bus stop. This is a Dallas Jones BBQ, a hole in the wall BBQ spot in the West Village. Primarily serving as a takeout and catering spot, DJBBQ does provide a few dine in seats (approximately 6 in all) and their speedy delivery make them a solid option for a rainy day or late night at work.I've ordered from Dallas Jones many times, but finally got around to recapping it here. The food here is solid, not amazing by any means, but a great change of pace, hangover cure, or just all out indulge fest for those in the village or Soho. The menu is typical BBQ, ribs, fried starters, pulled pork, chicken or beef sandwiches and much more. For the lunch crowd they offer a $7.95 lunch special where you can choose from a few different options and then fries or a baked potato and pink lemonade. I generally opt for the pulled chicken sandwich, a combination of white and dark meat slathered with a sweet BBQ sauce and sandwiches in between a wonderfully soft roll which soaks up all the juices. The fries, while tasty are usually soggy when delivered, but a bit more acceptable when eaten at the restaurant. Baked potatoes, something not generally praised, are simply enormous and when they can't find a big one they give you two. A large amount of food for $7.95 anywhere in the city.However, my favorite sandwich is the one with boneless beef ribs. Extremely tender and served with a little less sauce, it is a great hearty sandwich. Again the sauce is a bit sweet and needs some more kick, but I'm not complaining. Platters, like the fried chicken, offer more food than anyone really needs during lunch, but it is hard to resist. For instance, the fried chicken platter comes equipped with 2 sides (in this case mac and cheese and baked beans with pork), cornbread, bbq sauce and that is all in addition to 4 enormous pieces of chicken. Crispy, with a bit of spice, the chicken served its purpose, but I may stick with the BBQ next time. Same goes for the burger, an enormous patty of overcooked, underseasoned ground beef.Dallas Jones BBQ offers a nice change of pace for lunch, dinner or even a catering event and while it's no RUB, Dinosaur or Daisy May's, it sure is recommended spot if you are in the area.178 W Houston St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 741-7390, Reservations - Not needed/accepted, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($10-20/person)

Restaurant Review: Blue Ribbon Sushi

***CONTENT
A recent business lunch lead me into Soho for some delicious sushi at Blue Ribbon Sushi. Not a normal destination for lunch as the spot is quite pricey I made sure to enjoy every morsel of fresh fish throughout the meal. The physical layout of the restaurant is very deceptive. Walking in it appears miniscule with a few tables and a sushi bar, but the back opens up to a private little booth as well as more seating for over a dozen people. It is still a tight space, but a comforting space with low lights (even at 1pm), calming music (except for the random 80's tracks) and a very Japanese minimalist inspired interior.Considering it was lunch and also not on my dime we all showed some respect when choosing our food, I for one opted for the sushi platter, a 1 roll and 7 piece delight. Also ordered around were the pieces of scallop, octopus, the fresh Japanese uni, squid, salads and edamame. The platter came with salmon, white tuna, tuna, mackerel, shrimp, yellotwail, fluke and a spicy tuna roll. While none of the these bites were new to me I was particularly fond of the salmon, fluke and mackerel. The salmon was amazingly soft, more so than the tuna actually while the fluke had a nice clean flavor. The mackerel, a very different fish, was tender, but boasted a strong enjoyable fishy taste and was topped with a bit of scallion paste. My two additional pieces, scallop and uni, were top notch. Fresh as can be, the scallop was tender, sweet and tasted how a scallop should always taste. The uni, a special for the day as it was flown in from Japan, was extra creamy and without much prompting melted right in your mouth. The rest of the meal was also quite enjoyable and appropriately filling for lunch.On another occassion I would like to dive into some of the more excotic offerings at Blue Ribbon Sushi, but for now I'm happy with my lunch selections. Leaving comfortable full, feeling clean and satisfied is a good way to leave a restaurant and thankfully I did not have to pick up the tab either. The Blue Ribbon restaurants always serve the highest quality of food in my opinion and I have always enjoyed my food at the number of locations, but one must be prepared to spend in order to not only enjoy the experierence, but get a full meal. This definitely holds true as lunch can exceed $40 a person quickly without any drinks. With that said, I do recommend Blue Ribbon as it is some of the finest fish I have had in the city. 119 Sullivan St, New York, NY - (212) 343-0404‎, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Expensive ($40-80/person)

Odd, most Sushi ya in Japan prize more highly the Uni they get flown in from Santa Barbara.

Interesting point. Well it was a special of the day and described as a much creamier and lighter version. I enjoyed it thoroughly although you need to just let in melt in your mouth as no real chewing was needed.

The second portion of Labor Day weekend brought a different type of experience. For the most part I was able to take advantage of the weather and spend time outside, part at the U.S. Open and the other in Brooklyn and on my patio. This is the type of weather I truly enjoy, warm and sunny during the day, but cool and refreshing in the evening.US OpenUS Open eating For almost a decade I have been visiting the U.S. Open as a family tradition watching greats such as Sampras, Agassi, Chang, Federer, Hingis and more. It is always a great experience and one I hope continues for years to come, however, there has never been a wide array of dining options until the past few years. Previously, burgers, dogs, chicken fingers and such were the common lunch/dinner for many attendees, but this has all changed. Craving a corned beef sandwich? Maybe a platter of fish and chips? Or are you really in the mood for chicken tikka masala? Well all of these are available plus much more. Your standard stadium fare is still available, but no longer are you stuck with it. A chicken tikka wrap (from Curry Curry) was decent and a nice alternative to the usual as was the surprisingly crisp fish and chip platter. Carnegie Deli provides the corned beef and while good, it is much better at the actual location. There was more to indulge in, but the prices still reflect stadium prices, keeping me from ordering up a feast. Flatbush Farm LunchI've been a fan of Flatbush Farm ever since I sunk my teeth into their wonderful French dip sandwich. In my previous review I had only really covered the dinner and bar menu, but with the long weekend and nothing to do for lunch on Labor Day I made my way over to the farm for lunch on their spacious patio. The patio is pretty massive so we had our choice of seats as did another dozen or so on this beautiful day.The lunch menu, while small, had some nice selections many of which highlighted the last of the Summer's bounty. Fried green tomato sandwich, braised tuna belly sandwich and more with my eyes darting straight to the fried chicken. Unfortunately the restaurant was not serving fried chicken today, a huge crush to me, but we pushed on and ordered a BLT sandwich and the house burger with cheddar. I had surprisingly never had the burger here in all my trips and felt it a good time to indulge seeing it was Labor Day. To wash it all down I opted for a bloody mary, a delicious concotion that was quite spicy and very enjoyable. One of my top bloody marys although I wish they had included celery. The BLT was good, quality ingredients on thick toasted white bread, it was a simple, somewhat light sandwich although a little pricey at $10.My burger on the other hand left me regretting my decision. Aside from the fact that I had to remind the server (who seemed to be sleep walking) the temperature of my burger multiple times it was an all out disaster. Arrived completely dwarfed by the bun it sat on (a challah roll fit to hold a 10oz burger possibly), it was very well done, completely lacking flavor and topped with 2 sliced of unmelted cheddar. I ended up trimming off a good third of the bread to better fit the burger, but it did little to fix the overall problem of an overcooked burger. I found it hard to comprehend all of this sliding past the chef. Granted it was a holiday lunch and it is likely the head chef was not present, but for a burger to be served with such blaring problems confounds me. Fortunately the fries were good, albeit quite salty, and I was hungry enough to persevere. However, I do not anticipate ordering another burger here for quite some time if at all and may just stick with the surefire French dip moving forward.76 Saint Marks Ave, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 622-3276, Reservations - Not Necessary, Price - Moderate ($15-30)Peaceful labor day bbq Of course what is Labor Day without a BBQ, so naturally I invited a few people over and threw together a quick menu that could be grilled in our backyard. Opting for a lighter menu, we made grilled spicy fish sandwiches, grilled corn and homemade coleslaw. The fish (tilapia) was seasoned in advance with a mixture of chipotle, cayenne, de arbol chili, parsley, salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon and grilled on medium heat. This was served on Tom Cat Bakery Ciabatta, some of the best bread in the city, with lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, spicy mayo and an avocado spread. The sandwiches evoked a New Orleans Po'boy without the fried element. Accompanying this we picked up some delicious corn on the cob, and simply slathered it with butter after it cooked up on the grill. Wrapping up the meal, the coleslaw was made with red and green cabbage, carrots, red onions, seasoned salt, rice vinegar, honey, mayo, fresh parsley, nutmeg, salt and pepper and sat for a few hours to let the juices absorb. A simple meal with easy preparation and clean up, but a great way to spend some time outside with friends enjoying great food.

If you are like me, you were eating and drinking your way through this past Labor Day weekend. A wonderful weekend with great weather, friends, family and more. Fortunately I had a 4 day weekend allowing for an extra day of indulgence. I made a few stops throughout the weekend some more memorable than others, but all contributed to a great Labor Day weekend.Lederhosen Wurst & BierhausIt all started with a trip to what is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars in Manhattan, Lederhosen, a German beer and sausage house in the West Village. Its location is somewhat hidden on a gorgeous tree-lined street of brownstones. Entering you can take the extremely narrow stair way (only 3-4 stairs) or saunter down the ramp. This is no ordinary bar, beer garden painted back room (kind of funny in a way), walls adorned with rugby and soccer (football) jerseys and plenty of German beer and food all around. A small bit of Bavaria in our own backyard. Service is excellent and friendly which matches the overall attitude of the bar. On the numerous occasions I've come here I have talked with a variety of interesting (and unique) people.Order up some of the delicious bauernwurst, a plump grilled beef and pork sausage, adorned with red cabbage, sauerkraut, onions and mustard and served on a crusty roll. For big eaters it is merely a snack, but at $4.50 it's a bargain. Other options include potato pancakes, herring, burgers, potato dishes and much more. A favorite of mine is the schnitzel sandwich where you can choose from chicken, pork or veal and have it served on rye or pumpernickel. This also comes with the same condiments as the sausage. Not the best schnitzel I have ever had, but a sizable portion with a great mustard it is a great dinner to accompany a few pints (or liters) of German beer.That brings me to the beer offerings; one of the best in the city if you ask me. Order over two dozen German beers, with over half a dozen on tap in either a 1/2 pint, pint, liter, 2 liter or 5 liter keg size. Yes, you can actually order your own 5 liter keg for your table or better yet a 2 liter boot of what you choose for $20 (that works out to about 5.5 beers by the way and click here for more details on the boot). Overall it may not have the best food or be the best looking bar in the city, but between the gracious attitude of the patrons and serves, quality food selection and extensive drink offerings it is hard to find another place like Lederhosen. 39 Grove St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 206-7691, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive (varies)X20I made my way up to Westchester and another meal at Yonkers popular X20. Now I've reviewed x20 before, had a wonderful meal there with a few very memorable dishes, but I felt it necessary to mention some menu changes and improvements. For one, the place is still extremely popular and very difficult to get a reservation at; calling a month in advance works. Another point I'd like to make is that the bar area is quite nice. During my prior visit I did not havea chance to sit at the bar and fully appreciate the drink offerings and design.Getting into the food, the menu was quite different than before. I was unaware of the restaurants seasonality yet pleased to see a variety of the Summer offerings highlighted. A few standouts from the evening include my much loved short rib and foie gras ravioli with truffle butter. A few small packages of pure indulgence, it is hard to not order this whenever dining here, although I would have liked the dish to be a little warmer (it appeared to have sat in the kitchen a few minutes too long). A special for the night, a toro trio appetizer highlighted the best of fresh high-grade toro. Served as tartare, sashimi and nigiri, each presentation offered a different perspective on the fine fish. My entree, a succulent veal hanger, was moist and perfectly cooked, it was fork tender and delicious.Other bites from the night were also quite good and overall I found the restaurant to have improved since my last visit. It is clear the kitchen's strength is meat, but they have made progress in the entree department, an area where I thought the food was lacking a bit back in February. I look forward to my next meal here to again indulge in the ravioli and track their progress.71 Water Grant St. Yonkers, NY 10701, 914-965-1111, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Expensive ($50-75/person)

A few weekends back I made my way up to Cape Cod for a nice 4 day weekend with the family (staying in New Seabury). A gorgeous spot, Cape Cod was my vacation destination for many years as a kid so it was nice to retrace my steps and see how the area had changed. A few dramatic changes occurred, but none that prevented me from relaxing, getting sun and eating and drinking well. Whenever I am near the ocean or beach I feel the need to eat seafood and for most of the trip I did just that. Fried fish sandwich for lunch (a few times), clam strips with bellies (can't say I am a huge fan of the bellies, but I am glad I tried them), stuffed scallops and much more. The freshness of the ingredients is clear even at the small fish shacks.Other culinary highlights included my meal of sweetbreads, chantrelles and fingerlings at Bleu in Mashpee. Never before have I seen sweetbreads these large. They were tender and mild, with a nice crispiness, I probably could have done with half the portion. A salad of heirloom tomatoes was also perfect with the taste of Summer clear and bright, it was something I wish I could eat year round. The gorgeous Chatham Inn in Chatham, MA was the sight of another delicious meal. Although we were dressed more for beachside dining than fine dining, we found a cozy table at the Inn's Tavern, a rather loud space with a surprising menu. While dishes such as fish and chips were expected, I did not anticipate seeing a Monkfish osso buco on the menu, nor did I expect an assortment of miniature desserts. The Monkfsih, served with kale, mussels and chorizo was perfectly cooked and seasoned; an absolutely wonderful dish with a wide array of flavors. The miniature desserts were perfect for those just interested in a few sweet bites. Churros with chocolate jalapeno ice cream were the size of a pen cap, but had huge unique flavors. Apple beignets, again the size of a silver dollar were stuffed with apples and served alongside fresh vanilla bean ice cream. The poor clam chowder I had to open the meal was quickly forgotten after those surpsingly delicious courses. Gorgeous weather, great food and quality time with the family made for an excellent weekend in the Cape. While it may be a bit of a trek for most of us New Yorkers it is worth it if the opportunity arises. A solid way to help wrap up the Summer in my opinion.

Always looking for a new lunch spot near work I've scoured the West Village and Soho for almost a year and recently stumbled upon a promising new option: Mooncake Foods. Though it's name may imply dessert, this restaurant is more of an Asian diner dishing up reliable salads, sandwiches and platters at an alarmingly affordable price. It's location is rather obscure, quite close to the Holland Tunnel entrance, but don't let that fool you. Always packed during lunch I've added it to my rotation of lunch stops. Approaching Mooncake Foods you may think you are walking up to an old fashioned diner. The exterior surely does not scream fresh or quality, let alone Asian. Likewise the interior is setup just like an old diner. A counter with red padded stools as well as booths and small tables complete the art deco look, but it's the food that will keep you hear. Behind the counter is where all the action happens. Two men of severe patience and skill move rapidly assembling all types of dishes. They broil fish and meats, slice baguette's, prepare salads and scoop white and brown rice in a state of organized chaos.On my first trip here I watched as they prepared my sliced steak platter with cilantro and ginger. Huge chunks of perfectly cooked steak topped with a salty, smokey cilantro ginger sauce and accompanied by an abundance of lettuce and brown rice. It was a rather large lunch, but only cost $8.80 (plus tax and tip). On other trips I ordered the spicy hoisin fish tacos with roasted pinu nut hoisin sauce, though an appetizing description the dish did not live up to the hype. The sauce was overly salty and should be used sparingly. Likewise the anise and beer braised beef shins served in tortillas while amazingly tender were quite salty. I would like to order this again, but perhaps hold off on using the dipping sauce and opt for more lettuce in the tortillas. A popular favorite for many, the miso glazed salmon is hard to dislike. Moist and tender, it is a wonderfully prepared dish and one I expect to order again. Other options include chicken wings with honey and soy, crawfish dumplings, a tuna burger with wasabi mayo and a variety of salads and wonton soups.It's amazing that outside of Chinatown I am able to find this wide array of dishes all affordable and within walking distance of my office. For those more North in the city, there is a Chelsea location which I've yet to visit that offers the same menu and pricing. Mooncake foods is open for lunch and dinner and takes cash only.28 Watts St., New York, NY 10013, 212-219-8888, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($7-$15/person)

***CONTENT
Steps from the 7th Ave. Q train in Prospect Heights Brooklyn there is quaint little shop serving delicious pastries, cookies and Jamaican patties. When talking about patties in this neighborhood many people are quick to claim Christie's as the top spot letting this establishment slide under the radar a bit. Little Miss Muffin is the name of this tiny shop, owned and operated by two kind and talented women, it is a hidden gem in my opinion and a place that I will never get tired of. It is a welcoming space about the size of a bedroom, but with strong smells of cookies and coffee (the full name is actually Little Miss Muffin 'N' Her Stuffin).I've started my morning (or afternoon) here with the delicious, buttery croissants, some filled with chocolate, others with strawberries and cream cheese, apple cream or plain. The croissants are flaky, light, certainly not healthy, but absolutely delicious and hard to resist. Muffins, the stores namesake, are also delicious. A simple corn muffin is moist, buttery of course, and always fresh. The chocolate chip muffin, a treat on occasion, is rich and moist and requires a glass of milk when eating.Jamaican patties, one of the perfect handheld meals if made well, are one of my favorite items at Little Miss Muffin. The most well known variety, beef, comes in mild and spicy and while good are not stellar. However, the chicken patties are where Little Miss Muffin really shines. My personal favorite, however, is the BBQ chicken patty, it appears much thicker and larger than any of the other patties and is stuffed with tender shreds of thigh meat. A sweet tangy BBQ sauce with an appropriate kick provides the flavor and 9 times out of 10 keeps the patty nice and moist. The jerk chicken patty also offers a nice change of pace, a sweet and spicy sauce mixed with ground chicken is quite pleasing, albeit a bit thin. The crust for all of the patties is relatively standard, flaky, golden, buttery and a bit dry, but it's the fillings that make them great.For dessert, or just a snack, I've sampled a variety of their cookies and always find them stellar. It is a treat when they are straight out of the oven, but even when they have cooled the moisture is retained. Crisp sides give way to a moist, soft center filled with a variety of things. Chocolate chip and peanut butter are my favorites, but you can't really go wrong with any of the other selections.Nothing on the menu exceeds $3 so it is easy to get a feast here for very little. I highly recommend, while the weather is still warm, grabbing a selection of patties and cookies and heading to Prospect Park. The patties travel well, keep warm and are a very easy delicious meal while basking in the Summer sun. Another highlight for all you coffee drinkers is their iced coffee. Refreshing, clean tasting and always fresh, it's gained the title \"Best Iced Coffee\" from my girlfriend and I easily agree.174 Park Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11238, (718) 857-4963, Reservations - It's a takeout place, Price - Inexpensive ($3-6/person)

Eater reports that Momofuku Ko may be open for lunch. I'm curious as to what the menu would be like as I certainly don't know many people who can 1) afford to take 3 hours off of work, 2) eat 10 courses and 3) are comfortable spending $100+ on lunch. Tired of hangovers? Well maybe it's time to start drinking organic beer and wine. The NY Daily News reports organic booze may in fact reduce your hangover. Interesting...Serious Eats lists upcoming food events for this weekendRestaurant openings from the NYTimes and EaterSerious Eats provides a list of participants for Rachel Ray's Burger Bash this Fall as part of the NYC Wine & Food Festival. A great list likely producing some tasty burgers, but at $200 a ticket it is a bit overpriced.

***CONTENT
The gastro-pub has infiltrated NYC with such places as the E.U., Spotted Pig, and even Flatbush Farm in Brooklyn over the past few years. A relative newcomer, Alchemy which opened last year in Park Slope, has seen it's share of ups and downs, initially receiving rave reviews, but recently locals have been quick to claim the restaurant is in the middle of a crisis. I've read on multiple occasions that the food, service and overall experience is nothing like it used to be, a shadow of its former self. I was disappointed to here this, as a resident of the area you hate to see restaurants struggling, especially one which I thought had promise and was excited to go to. Well, I finally made my way over to Alchemy after some indecisiveness and I am quite happy with my decision. The dark restaurant, located in North Park Slope, was relatively empty when we walked in on a Wednesday. I was actually somewhat put off and began to doubt myself, however, as we walked towards the patio we found it much more welcoming. A large patio filled with 2 and 4 tops allowed us to not only to sit outside, but also not feel as if we were the only diners here. The menu has a variety of standard pub dishes (burger, fish and chips), but also more creative or unique dishes including Gorgonzola and walnut ravioli, duck confit cassoulet and wild mushroom barley risotto to name a few. We ordered up an appetizer of short ribs on a polenta cake with demi glace to start. A rather large portion for an appetizer, the dish was okay, but completely overwhelmed by the demi glace. It overpowered the short rib and the polenta and left me rather disappointed, although I do love short ribs in all forms.For entrees we ordered the Alchemy shells and cheese with peas (sans bacon) and the Gorgonzola walnut ravioli. Again the portion size impressed us. I certainly did not expect a heaping bowl to be placed in front of me, and it made me think I could have done without the short rib even more. Both dishes were quite good and reasonably priced, $13 and $16. The shells and cheese were underseasoned for me, but my girlfriend thought otherwise. My ravioli also featured arugula and a sage brown butter sauce, a nice herbaceous flavor to accompany the Gorgonzola walnut filling. Sufficiently full it was pleasing to know that Alchemy is in fact trying to serve and impress the neighborhood regardless of recent reviews. I'll have to make it back for some of the other dishes, including the sticky Guinness pudding and the Alchemy burger.56 5th Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718) 636-4385, Reservations - Not Necessary, Price - Moderate ($15-30/person)

Restaurant Review: Blue Hill at Stone Barns

***CONTENT
Over the past year or so I've really started to appreciate the simplicity of food. I've enjoyed taking stellar ingredients and preparing them with little more than olive oil, salt, pepper and some fresh herbs. It's this style of cooking where you can fully appreciate food. One person in the restaurant industry who not only follows this practice, but has redefined it is Chef Dan Barber. Barber has always had an affinity for preserving the natural integrity of food, not muddying it up with fancy or unnecessary ingredients. Barber also is the Chef/Owner of the critically acclaimed Blue Hill at Stone Barns restaurant and farm in Tarrytown, NY (there is also a Blue Hill location in the West Village). I was fortunate enough to dine here this past weekend and it truly was a revelatory experience.Driving onto the grounds it is hard to miss the giant cows, rows and rows of corn stalks, vines of multi-colored tomatoes and the massive heritage pigs. Chef Barber has setup the grounds at Blue Hill to support exquisite menus crafted with the freshest ingredients every season always keeping in mind the impact he has on the environment. It being August I knew I was in store for plenty of tomatoes. The farm is covered with them, all sizes, shapes, colors and ultimately tastes. Walking around the grounds other highlights included the turkey pens, the greenhouse filled with more varieties of lettuce than I knew existed, roaming sheep, herb gardens and more. It is a must for anyone to survey the grounds, they are beautiful, enlightening and hard to walk away from.Making your way towards the restaurant you enter a gorgeous courtyard reminiscent of many of the castles and estates I saw while studying in England. Detailed craftsmanship is everywhere and a feeling of serenity hits you before even taking a bite of food, this is truly an unmatched experience. Upon entering the restaurant it is hard to miss the comfortable rustic, but still modern decor: weathered wood floors, tables, chairs, an enormous table holding warm bread and beverages and then a cathedral style ceiling that is more 21st century than I expected. The well dressed servers are everywhere, but also never in your way. They swarm when needed, but keep their distance otherwise.The menus were explained in great lengths to us, with the summary being that a list of today's fresh ingredients are provided and the diner gets to say whether they dislike, or absolutely love specific ingredients. The menu is then crafted keeping allergies, dislikes, likes, etc. in mind. Our table opted for the 5-course tasting menu (the 7-course Farmer's Feast was not the choice of my family) and so began our 3 hour experience. Servers brought out our amuse bouche, a trio of delicious little bites highlighting the freshest ingredients at this time. A variety of tomatoes were placed on little spikes and seasoned with sea salt. A skewer with fresh squash half covered in pancetta and sesame seeds was pleasing from a taste and textural standpoint. A shot glass of \"Blue Hill V-8\" was refreshing and offered a nice hint of onion and celery. The last little bite was something I wish I had more of, a \"tomato burger\" which was essentially a thick tomato sauce with cheese on a mini corn bread \"roll\". Its size was similar to a silver dollar, but it offered bold flavors of summer.With a well timed delay between the amuse and the 1st course, we were presented with a gorgeous watermelon, heirloom tomato gazpacho. Adorned with edible flowers and microgreens the dish was stunning, but also tasted wonderful. It was soothing, refreshing and vibrant, a great start. One thing to note here, the service at Blue Hill is beyond stellar. Each plate is placed on the table in syncopation and with a party of 5 it becomes quite impressive. Our second course was another example of beautifully plated ingredients. A portion of seabass, seared to perfection, sat atop a salty, garlicky pistou made of summer beans, zucchini and broccoli. Too salty on its own, the pistou worked perfectly when paired with the mildly seasoned fish. Another winner, agreed everyone at the table.The third course showcased the chefs pasta making skills. A gorgeous little package of housemade ricotta, farm grown artichokes topped with a tomato caper sauce, it was a light, but a somewhat indulgent little bite. The pasta had been slightly browned on the top adding a nice textural element. The fourth course is where the restaurant really showed its true colors. I had mentioned to our server that I am all for head to tail eating when ordering and he made sure the chefs were aware. As a result I was presented with a massive square plate showcasing different aspects of the farms heritage pigs: loin, belly, cheek, boudin blanc (a white sausage made with the liver/heart and milk) and jowel. To some this may sound a bit daunting, but when I heard this description I burst into a smile. To round things out, or at least provide something else other than pig on the plate there were some delicious string beans, but they just added color to to the plate. Each different piece of the pig offered a new taste and texture. There were a few bites of each, but I could have easily eaten more of the boudin blanc, the cheek and the loin. Three distinct tastes, all absolutely delicious. Not to be forgotten, everyone else at my table was served perfectly cooked ribeye in a ratatouille sauce with a vibrant zucchini puree. A delicious dish, but it had no chance when compared to my boldly flavored head to tail plate.To finish up we were served a delicious peach sorbet with fresh peaches and currants. It was refreshing, sweet, tart and the perfect balance of flavors after the previous course. It also set the stage for a trio of desserts that were served to us. Pistachio cake with raspberry sorbet and creme fraiche was good, but I could have easily done without it. The olive oil cake was a bit more enjoyable and it was topped with Thai basil sorbet and blueberries, a unique combination. The best of the three was the chocolate brioche pudding with caramel ice cream, which had to have had some espresso whipped into it and was rich, but not heavy. The desserts were probably the weakest part of the meal, but enjoyable nonetheless. They were followed by the petit fours, mini strawberry macaroons.Other highlights of the meal included the wine list, which is quite extensive and yielded a delicious Pinot Noir for our table (Brooks, Janus Pinot Noir 2005 from Oregon). And not to be forgotten, the teasin which is roughly a cart of over a dozen fresh herbs that you can select from in order to make a fresh pot of tea. At $15 it is the priciest tea I have ever seen, but it is also quite an impressive show as the server takes his antique scissors and snips off bits of lemongrass, purple basil, lemon thyme, eucalyptus or many other herbs into a clear glass tea pot. To no surprise you are also presented with a gorgeous jar of honey from the farm.Our meal wrapped up roughly 3 hours after we sat down, it was now dark outside with the sun fading in the distance. I was full, plenty full, but I also felt slightly different as if I had been educated or enlightened in some way. It was an eye opening experience and helps you really respect all that goes into your food, I will never forget it and suggest everyone make the trek just once. It may cost quite a bit, but what you get is more than just a meal here and it is well worth every cent.630 Bedford Rd, Tarrytown, NY - (914) 366-9600, Reservations - Required (taken months in advance), Price - Very Expensive (minimum $120/person)‎

Inspired to eat more food from Blue Ribbon due to my delicious lunch there recently and Ed Levine's glowing review I made my way over to Blue Ribbon Bakery Market. The name is a mouthful, but all you really need to know is that at the market you can score some delicious open-faced sandwiches, breads, sides, drinks and honeys all of the highest quality. The market is just down the street from Blue Ribbon Bakery and is an easy and affordable way to get a quick bite.Upon entering the market you are hit with a strong smell of freshly baked bread. Along one wall there is an impressive display of brioche, multi-grain, challah, baguettes and more. A small chalkboard of the toast menus is hanging across the refrigerated section which contains milks, sides, pickles, smoked duck breasts and more. The toast menu is broken out into meat, vegetables, fish, butter and fruit for a total of 22 options and are priced between $3 and $10. I found the smoked duck breast with Mexican honey mustard superb and quite filling. The tender duck perfectly cooked (served at room temperature) was topped with the zesty and sweet homemade honey mustard. For a lighter option the hummus sandwich was delicious and surprisingly vibrant in taste. The smooth hummus was topped with bits of red onion, tomatoes, lemon olive oil, paprika and parsley. A gorgeous looking toast it was perfect for a light lunch. Other options include a tune melt, smoked salmon or sturgeon, mozzarella and basil pesto and many more. For some the toasts may not be enough for a full lunch so I suggest any of the refrigerated sides or a 5 pack of delicious housemade chocolate cookies. I also highly recommend picking up some of the bread either to accompany your meal or for a later time. The challah is delicious and perfect for bread pudding, french toast or just with butter. The famed bacon and red onion loaf is also available for a meager $2.50 along with other interestingly flavored options.While the prices may be slightly higher than your average corner sandwich shop, the ingredients are top notch and well worth it. Be aware that the space is small with no seating except outside, but it's rather therapeutic to to stand while eating your toast surrounded by the fabulous smells of fresh breads.14 Bedford Street New York, NY 10014, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive ($5-$15/person)Update: a recent addition to the menu (as of 8/18), the baked brie with apples, almonds and olive oil is quite delightful. Creamy, salty and a perfect balance of flavors, it is a must get for brie lovers.

I've always had an affinity for tacos, soft-shell, hard shell, it doesn't matter. Maybe it is the hand held aspect or the mere variety of ingredients you can stuff into a taco, regardless I love tacos. La Taqueria is a great place to grab a number of different styles of tacos, but you need to know a few things. 1. La Taq, the recently rennovated \"other half\" of the restaurant is overpriced. 2. Order from the counter on the right hand side of the restaurant. Hopefully those two rules help get across my point.La Taqueria is a somewhat weathered indoor California taco stand with the option to dine in at the few small tables available or take out/delivery. Walking in you are met with a giant board of bright colors and an appetizing list of food. Below that board you will see much of the ingredients, prepared earlier for the most part, which fill the tacos, burritos, quesadillas and more. Don't be alarmed that some of the food is pre made. Unless you are getting the last serving of the day everything is relatively vibrant and fresh, contrary to the opinion of others. A grill is generally fired up with carne asada (flank steak), chicken and tortillas and there is a rotisserie with whole chickens going all day.I personally recommend Lupe's taco, a freshly fried tortilla shell stuffed with barbacoa (shredded beef) or carne asada. It's topped with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Although it may not be the most authentic dish I find the crunch of the shell, which is fried on the spot, a great compliment to the tender beef. Another popular favorite of mine is Pollo Asado taco filled with succulent bits of chicken thigh and topped off the same as Lupe's taco. Aside from tacos The chimichanga (clearly like fried items) is a massive hunk of food and happily the crispy outer shell holds up to the sauce and filling offering some wonderful flavors and textures. The enchiladas are a safe bet, although I find them topped off with way too much sauce. Guacamole, while refreshing and a great compliment to any meal falls short with inconsistent seasoning. Other items including fajitas, the rotisserie chickens and nachos are standard fare, but satisfying.A great thing about eating on the low-key, stand side is the free salsa's. A tomatillo, chunky tomato and chipotle based salsa are available by the bucket load along with jalapanos, pickled vegetables and a cilantro onion mixture. Some issues with cleanliness may present themselves when the place is busy, but in those cases opt for the benches out front or even a short walk to the park. Definitely not the best Mexican I've ever had, but a convenient and quite satisfying option for the area72 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11217, 718-398-4300, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive ($5-15/person)

I'm always looking for inexpensive ways to eat great at home and of course that can be quite difficult with the way food is being priced these days. I generally purchase my meat from Fresh Direct or a butcher and lately Fresh Direct has been really on top of their game. Specifically, their hanger steak, a popular cut of meat in many restaurants for it's bold beefy taste but inexpensive cost, the steaks usually run between $8.99 - $11.99lb. Last night on the fly I pulled together a delicious recipe using my propane grill, a handful of fresh herbs, spices and greenmarket vegetables.For the hanger steak (recipe for two):1-1.5 lb steak (you will need to cut the fatty connective tissue running down the middle, it's a simple process, creating two long steaks)1 teaspoon dried thyme1 teaspoon celery salt1 teaspoon garlic powdercayenne pepper to tastegenerous amount of salt and pepper1 tablespoon olive oil or enough to lightly coat the steaksRosemary Butter:1-2 tablespoon butter, softenedfresh rosemarysmall squeeze of lemon juiceFor the corn:2 cobs of corn cleaned, but not fully shuckedbuttersalt and pepperlime juice1 teaspoon olive oilFor the vegetables:Heirloom Tomatoes (a few small, or 1-2 large) cut length wise in halfSummer squash (a few small or 1-2 large) cut length wise in half3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar1 tablespoon olive oilsalt and pepper to taste1 tablespoon honeyfresh oregano and basil(optional) 4 thin slices of Parmigiano-Reggiano1. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees as well as the grill to med-high heat2. After trimming the steak off it's fat mix the spice blend together and coat the entire steak letting it rest for a few minutes3. While letting the steak rest mix all ingredients for the vegetables except the vegetables and fresh herbs to create the sauce/marinade, place vegetables in bowl and lightly toss once the mixture is ready4. Lightly coat the steak and corn in olive oil so as not to stick to the grill and place on the grill. Steak should cook about 4 minutes per side for medium rare and corn can be turned every 3-4 minutes5. Put the vegetables in the oven for 10-15 minutes on 400 F or until they have reached desired tenderness6. Mix softened butter, chopped fresh rosemary and lemon juice and form two equal servings7. Once the steak is ready place on a cutting board and let sit for at least 5 minutes. Serve as preferred; I enjoy a few slices cut off and then the remaining steak for me to cut on my own8. Coat corn in butter, salt, pepper and a squeeze of lime juice9. Remove vegetables from the oven and top with chopped fresh basil and oregano, add optional parmigiano as well10. Serve family style or all on one plate, adding butter to the top of steaks

Restaurant Review: The Chocolate Room

It's hard to resist good quality chocolate. I may not be a dessert person most of the time, but quality sweets are present I generally find myself indulging. Combine that with my girlfriends affection for chocolate and it's a wonder that it took me three years to get to the popular Chocolate Room in Park Slope. The dessert bar, cafe and chocolate boutique has a loyal following, so much so that they have opened up a second location in Carroll Gardens.Finally getting to the Chocolate Room was fairly spontaneous. Wrapping up a delicious meal at Al Di La down the street I craved something sweet, and saw a perfect opportunity to indulge at the Chocolate Room. The physical space is a small relaxed with a slight vintage look, but it is all chocolate from the displays, the smells and the dark wood. It may not be the most comfortable seating arrangement, but the smells and anticipation of rich chocolate goodness is enough to get you by. Quickly scanning the small yet appropriate menus the hot fudge brownie sundae screamed out to me. I thought back to when I was much younger celebrating a youth soccer win or being consoled after a loss at Friday's and getting my favorite sundaes. However, here I wasn't winning or losing, although I was helping my girlfriend celebrate a great new job. The prospect of pure indulgence was all I needed, brownie sundae with homemade mint chip ice cream here I come. Describing the sundae as indulgent or \"chocolaty\" does not really do it justice. A mixture of real (emphasis on real) mint taste, chocolate slivers, hot fudge, whip cream and of course a warm fudge brownie was transcendent. I was in my own world as I quietly ate and every now and again took a breath and smiled from ear to ear. Same situation for my girlfriend who across the table protected her vanilla ice cream sundae from me, I don't blame her, this was delicious. Chocolate Layer Cake, Black Bottom Butterscotch Custard and an enticing Chocolate Fondue are some of the dishes available.Feeling satisfied and having not yet fallen into a food coma we paid and left quickly glancing at the decorative, but surely delicious, handmade chocolates and other chocolate products. Not to be forgotten is the Chocolate Room's wine and port pairings, available with every item on the menu or by themselves. While I made it to the Chocolate Room for dessert it is surely a place for all occasions, including coffee, a snack, drink or even a chocolate lunch or dinner.86 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, 718-783-2900, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10)

Restaurant Review: Blue Ribbon Bakery (Lunch)

The Blue Ribbon mini-empire is well known by most New Yorkers. One of the more affordable restaurants owned by the Bromberg brothers is Blue Ribbon Bakery, located on the corner of Bedford and Downing in the West Village. This casual eatery with a rustic feel, bakes some of the most delicious breads in the city in addition to serving brunch, lunch and dinner. During lunch they offer a variety of sandwiches between $10-20 all delicious and worth every penny making the restaurant a perfect spot for a long lunch out of the office.Before placing your orders each table receives a delicious basket of fresh bread baked daily. A few slices of challah, olive bread and whole grain bread along with a dish of soft creamy butter, it was a wonderful start to lunch. Fortunately I had recently seen Ed Levine's review of the neighboring Blue Ribbon Bakery Market down the street and their delicious bacon and red onion bread. Be sure to ask your server for some of this savory baked treat. Chunks of bacon and thin slices of red onion baked into a ciabatta style loaf make this some of the best bread I've ever tasted. Word of advice, butter is not necessary as it is already quite moist.Highlights from the meal included the warm goat cheese salad, a heaping portion with two goat cheese toasts and sundried tomatoes. Another popular dish, was the savory and extremely satisfying crispy catfish sandwich. Served on a fresh ciabatta roll with red onion, tomato, lettuce and corn tartar sauce it was one of the better fish sandwiches I've had in recent memory. The fish was perfectly cooked, the bread provided a good amount of chewiness and the tartar added great flavor, though a bit more salt could have been used. Other lunch offerings include a wide variety of appetizers, soups, salads and main courses. Some of my favorites in the past have been the escargot cooked with garlic and butter, pierogies and what I believe to be the best fried chicken in the city. A solid selection of beers and wines are also available throughout the day.Overall a delicious meal, in a great environment. Although it can get rather loud, the restaurant is a great location for an hour out of the office or drinks late night. I look forward to my next meal here, I'm sure there will be many. 35 Downing Street, New York, NY 10014, 212-337-0404, Reservations - Only available for 5+, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($20-$50)

***CONTENT
With restaurant week in full swing and in some cases wrapping up, I was fortunate to snag a last minute reservation at the Modern's Bar Room last night. The Bar Room is a gorgeous, sleek, sexy and modern space outside the more upscale, fine dining Modern restaurant. Both restaurants are under the careful supervision of Danny Meyer's restaurant group equatting to excellent customer service and relations. This is abundantly clear during Restaurant Week as the restaurant pulls out all the stops. Offering a menu as large and diverse as I have ever seen during this promotional two week period I immediately thought we were given the incorrect menu's. Fortunate for us the 8 or so selections for both appetizer and entree were in fact offered as a part of the $35 prix fixed meal, not to be forgotten were the half a dozen or so dessert options.I've always enjoyed the Bar Room and have found the food wonderful, inspired and unique, not to mention the space is just plain fun. After taking a few minutes to select our meals from the abundant options we landed on the upside tuna tartare and warm veal and goat cheese terrine as appetizers, duck confit with shishito pepper hash and crispy cod with apples and celery for entrees and lastly a hazelnut dacquoise with milk chocolate and a buttermilk panna cotta with strawberry soup for dessert. A very well rounded menu with a few clear standouts. My warm veal and goat cheese terrine was sublime, accompanied by a peppery watercress sauce I found it to be quite a comforting starter. The crispy cod offered a high-brow version of fish and chips, without the chips. A perfectly cooked portion of cod sat atop a celery and apple salad along with pickeled onions. Not neccessarily a dish I would go back for, but well throught out and executed. Of the two desserts the hazelnut dacquoise, essentially a dessert cake, was made with a creamy hazelnut filling, milk chocolate sheets and candied pecans. To take a bite with your eyes closed the dish reminded my girlfriend of a Butterfinger with its creamy yet crunchy texture, a great comparison.Overall another wonderful meal at the Bar Room. A great destination whether it is Restaurant Week or not, although the check does arrive quite different (i.e. much higher), I will continue to support the unique food being served here. One note about the restaurant, they also have quite an extensive wine list. Glasses begin at $9 and rise into the twenties. A small yet unique selection of draught beers are also available, I highly recommend the Shmaltz, brewed by Albino Python in New York, flavored with fennel and ginger it was superbly refreshing.9 W 53rd St, New York, NY - (212) 333-1220, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Moderate-Expensive ($50-80/person)‎

Restaurant Review: Artichoke Basille's Pizzeria

***CONTENT
Bloggers, food critics and just plain pizza fans have been talking up Artichoke Basille's Pizzeria for months claiming it the best new slice in Manhattan or even \"Manhattan's DiFara\". With all the press and attention I was wondering when I would ever get a chance to step over to 14th and 1st to grab what I expected to be a wonderful pleasing slice. Known for long lines, odd hours, slow service, and of course their artichoke pizza I was fortunate to be in the neighborhood right before they opened their doors. General knowledge is that come dinner time the lines here get long, people have waited mere minutes to over an hour so it must be good, right?Being the second person in the door at a supposed reputable pizzeria is an accomplishment. I was lucky, I waited no more than five minutes once in the door (and that is with three guys behind the counter). The two slices I'd heard great things about were the square slice and artichoke slice. The square was out first and quickly dropped on a plate while the artichoke pie finished off in the oven. At first glance you will notice all of the pizza's seem rather thick. Not piled with toppings, but just thick dough, layers of cheese and sauce. Ignoring what generally is a concern of mine (thick pies) I bit into the square. At first bite there was a nice taste; basil, indulgent salty cheese, but the sweet sauce and more importantly thick heavy crust was a huge issue. Analyzing the slice after a few more bites I would not rank it too high, nothing about it was memorable or worth $3.50 (although since the slices are so thick it could have been a small lunch for many people).Moving onto the piping hot artichoke slice I felt a sense of concern again, an amazingly thick slice was placed before me. I tried to rationalize it thinking it was only thick to hold up the gooey mess of artichoke, spinach and cheese which covered it. Well, yes it makes sense, you do need something to stand up to the topping, but after speaking with others at the pizzeria it seems all slices were overly thick. Looking beyond the thick crust it was hard to ignore how overcooked it was. On a positive note, I did think the topping had great flavor, it was just served in the wrong way. The artichoke and spinach topping would be much better served as a dip, maybe with bread sticks, crackers, anything but on top of pizza. It is way too creamy, heavy, cheesy and more logisitically, messy to eat (also it is $4.00 for those counting). That's not to say I don't enjoy pizza's with unique or non-authentic toppings. I used to work at a pizzeria where Cajun chicken, chicken parm and lasgana slices were best sellers, and quite good. However, they were not as liquidy and the crust was not as thick.With that said, I find the draw of Artichoke Pizzeria to be more trendy than actually based off of quality. It is a new pizzeria, with attitude, interesting slices and what appear to be some decent ingredients. On the flip side, I can't see a pizzeria of that nature holding up when there are so many better slice joints, but that's just my opinion. Maybe I am more of a purist when it comes to pizza, longing for the thin, crisp slices with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Or perhaps the pizza has gone down hill since they opened and if that is the case it is unfortunate I waited so long, but that doesn't excuse the overall poor pizza making. DiFara is certainly safe as the best pizza in my book.328 E 14th St, New York, NY 10003, Phone: (212) 228-2004, Reservations - Not Accepted/Neccessary, Price - Inexpensive ($4-10/person)

***CONTENT
On a hot summer evening I ventured over to the Flatiron district and around the block from some of the big name stores to a much talked about restaurant Boqueria. The tapas restaurant, with chef/co-owner Seamus Mullen also of Suba, has received much positive press since it opened a few years ago and I felt obligated as a tapas lover to check it out. On this Tuesday night there was no shortage of diners at the somewhat tight yet trendy quarters; a wait for 2 yielded twenty minutes of sitting in the heat outside as there is little standing room near the bar. Fortunately the hostess was accurate and after twenty minutes we were led to our table near the rear of the restaurant. Keeping with the theme of tight quarters our table was situated so that we could hear both neighboring parties and at the same time be forced to raise our voices to speak as it is deafeningly loud (this was only a Tuesday).As for the food, the menu evokes similar dishes from other tapas restaurants, but offers a handful of unique and original plates as well. Before dining at Boqueria it should be noted that Chef Mullen has an affinity for all things pig. Even in a dish sounding of a summertime salad double smoked bacon manages to make its way into the dish. I have no problem with a little pig here or there, but the range of flavors on the menu are almost dulled down due to the over abundance of pig in every dish. Some dishes stood out, the sugar snap peas with double smoked bacon and green market apples was actually quite delicious. A crisp, sweet and salty salad that was amazingly fresh. On the other hand a scallop special with summer peas, favas and of course bacon left me quite unsatisfied. Not only was the taste rather mild and uninspired, but there was only 1 medium sized scallop. Considering the dish was $12 and there were two diners I would have expected a bit more bang for my buck. A fried quail egg and chorizo toast was satisfying, but potentially embarrassing to eat (I recommend taking it down in one bite). A trio of croquettes, featuring a mushroom and truffle oil puree, salt cod and suckling pig were satisfying as were the patatas bravas (fried potatoes with spicy aioli) although not the best I have had.The meal was rounded out with some white wine, white sangria and the churros with warm chocolate sauce. A sweet way to end a meal filled with plenty of salty, porky tastes. Although I can see the draw of Boqueria with it's sleek look, decent tapas selection and extensive drink offerings, ultimately I found it to be middle of the road in terms of food. While many of the dishes looked wonderful the taste was not as big and bold as I have found at many other tapas restaurants.53 W 19th St New York, NY 10011, (212) 727-1548, Reservations - not accepted, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person)

On this gorgeous day I was fortunate to have planned a day off from work, or mental health day I'd like to call it. Of course with all this spare time I had no excuse to not get over to the Union Square Greenmarket. Arriving shortly after noon the market was in full swing and the smells, colors and tastes screamed Summer. I grabbed a few items to play around with and snack on over the next few weeks as you can see by the pictures below. Sugar Snap Peas are on their way out of the market and they are lacking a little sweetness they had a few weeks back, but delicious nonetheless. It's squash season and the wide variety of squashes at the market were impressive.I grabbed a few small ones and plan to either simply grill or saute them as a side. Along with it being squash season, the accompanying squash blossoms are also available throughout the cities greenmarkets.Not needing a full pound I grabbed a handful for a dollar and will likely saute them in a pasta. Some delicious corn was available, though it seemed much of the good offering went in the earlier hours of the market.Lastly, tomatoes certainly not the end of their season at the market, but delicious nonetheless. I love tomatoes and it really is hard to beat a fresh picked tomato raw with some olive oil and sea salt. Holding out till the season is at its peak (August) to stock up, I selected a few gorgeous and odd looking heirloom tomatoes a few of which actually are oblong in shape.More pictures of the market are included for your enjoyment.

Just spoke with Mikey Price at Market Table as he was preparing some food for this evening. Although the dish has been on the menu for a few weeks I felt it necessary to share this description:Sangria marinated hangar steak with grilled caesar and busted tomatoes. If that doesn't sound good to you, especially during the summer months, then you need to check your pulse. I'll certainly be getting over to Market Table to order this up, apparently almost every table has been ordering it and by the looks of the amount of steaks he was prepping the demand doesn't seem to be slowing down. Get on over before they run out.

Waffles and Dinges, the first of the waffle trucks has been a popular attraction this Spring and Summer, so much so that Park Slope residents were able to convince the owner to commit one day to Park Slope a week.Fortunate me, Waffles and Dinges is a mere 5-10 minute walk from my apartment and just happens to be on 7th Avenue and Carroll Street. You can't miss it, the bright yellow truck with a short line forming on the side is a welcome and easy to spot sight every Saturday from 11am - 6pm. The menu consists of Brussels style waffles, rectangular, crunchy and light or liege waffles, chewy, rich and round waffles. There are a handful of toppings or dinges including whipped cream, strawberries, Nutella, chocolate fudge and most recently honey. After some quick thinking I ordered up the Brussels style waffle stopped with Nutella ($5). As you can see in the picture the waffle was extremely rich with the addition of Nutella, I was kicking myself for not adding on some strawberries or even whipped cream to balance things out. Regardless the waffle was delicious. Crisp, and light as the menu suggests and it certainly held up and did not wilt upon being drenched in Nutella.Fortunately for me Saturday is right around the corner so I can try another variation, but there are plenty of other hours and locations for the Waffles and Dinges truck. Check out the webiste for more details and enjoy.

A few interesting articles/features start off yet another work week:The NYTimes publishes an article about dining in Prospect Heights, my current home, and while they mention some of the solid dining options they leave out way too many restaurants. Others left off the list include Amorina, Aliseo, Le Gamin, Noona, Tavern on the Dean, Geido and many smaller establishments.Bottomless Dish and CitySearch release their list of the cheapest eats in the city. Some of the assumed establishments include Dumpling House, Gray's Papaya and Gus's Pickles, while a few of the other options are new to me. They did leave off a pretty obvious one in 99cent Fresh Pizza though.Although NYTimes critic Frank Bruni generally comments more about the food at a restaurant than anything else, he does understand and appreciate a restaurants beauty. He's compiled his 12 best looking restaurants in the city.The famed Alinea of Chicago will be releasing their cookbook this fall. All those foodies out there should get ready for a stunning book along with a corresponding website. For more details check out Eater.The famed Harlem pizzeria, Patsy's, will be turning back the clock and celebrating their 75th anniversary on August 19th with .60 slices. Info courtesy of Slice.

Restaurant Review: Five Guys

***CONTENT
There has been much fanfare when a new Five Guys Burger opens up around the 5 boroughs, so I figured I should at least try it before jumping to any conclusions. I've heard comparisons to In-N-Out Burger, but also have heard plenty negatives. With that said, a hot Summer day seemed like a perfect excuse to walk over to the newly opened Bleecker and 7th Ave. South location.Upon entering Five Guys you immediately notice the line. Not Shake Shack long, but I was about 10-12 back. Five Guys does offer patrons buckets of peanuts as they wait, a rather smart idea until a handful of kids (and their mother) begin to throw peanuts around scattering them on tables and the floor. The ordering process here is pretty simple, you can get a standard burger (which too my surprise is actually two 3.3oz patties), a \"little\" burger (single patty), hot dogs, fries and drinks. Prices are reasonable, but can get relatively high if you add on fries and a soda to your burger choice. On a positive note, all toppings (aside from cheese and bacon) are free of charge so you can pile on the lettuce, tomato, grilled onions or jalapeños without worry.I ordered up a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and grilled onions and as you can see from the picture it was rather large and ended up very messy. Something you must know about Five Guys is that they cook all their burgers to a disappointing well done. Unfortunately, while this may benefit the speed of the kitchen and prevent any temperature complaints the burger does suffer. Since each patty is already rather thing cooking it well done really chars the entire burger. The meat is packed loosely, a plus, but you end up getting many little crunchy burnt bits in every bite. Yes, the meat is fresh and ground every day on sight, but when you cook it to a certain point you lose the great taste of the fresh beef. The toppings were fine, although the tomato was sliced way too thick and I had to remove it. Standard American cheese and sesame seed buns are used, it works for this burger, but I generally prefer cheddar or Gruyere. I did have a chance to sample some of the fries, skin on freshly cut, but a tad under seasoned I would order them next time, but with a \"little\" burger.Overall I was unimpressed and find Five Guys a poor excuse for an East coast In-N-Out Burger. Yes, they try and I appreciate the fresh ingredients, I can see the draw of their food in some respect, but for me I'd take Shake Shack any day and bear the line to get it.296 Bleecker St New York, NY 10014, Get Directions(212) 367-9200, Price - Inexpensive ($8-12/person) Locations nationwide as well http://www.fiveguys.com/

Where does it say that Five Guys is an east coast in and out? Ive never even compared the two, they're nothing alike, Five Guys doesnt even offer thousand island dressing. I think if you went in with that mindset you were setting yourself up for disappointment. Take Five Guys for what it is, a better than average fast food burger. You can't even compare it to shake shack where the burger meat is from LaFrieda (purveyor to the big boys) and contains what I believe is a mix or brisket and sirloin.

I have heard many people refer to Five Guys as an east coast burger. I did not go into the meal thinking that, my experience was purely based on the food regardless of previous reviews I've heard. I just wanted a good burger and hoped that Five Guys would provide me one. No need to take offense just because I had a subpar experience. Just my opinion. You are correct in one aspect, Five Guys is a glorified fast food burger, but in my opinion it doesn't excel beyond fast food that much.

A few noteworthy bites from this week:Shea is turning into a USHG run stadium complete with a Shake Shack, Blue Smoke, fine dining, a taqueria and a Belgian frites stand. Eater has the details.The Frying Pan, a popular bar/restaurant off the Westside Highway has reopened. Now you can get your $5, a lobster and view of New Jersey...just need to cross the highway first. NYmagAs anyone could have guessed, Brother Jimmy's will be opening a location in Murray Hill (how appropriate?!). Expect mediocre BBQ, lots of TV's and plenty of drunken newly graduated New Yorkers. I'm sure I'll get dragged there one day. NYmagSpike from this past season of Top Chef has opened his new burger spot in DC to decent reviews. His plans are to grow the bluntly named \"Good Stuff Eatery\" on a national scale, but lets see how the first restaurant does first. I have to admit some of the menu does sound tasty. SeriousEatsNew Whole Foods has opened in Tribeca, here's hoping a Brooklyn one is next. NYmag

Weekends at the Beach: Montauk and Cape May

***CONTENT
The past two weekends I have been fortunate to get out of the city and spend some time at the beach. My travels brought me to Montauk and Cape May, two very different towns, both offering a nice escape.My Montauk trip was also part wine tasting trip and as a result I drove around the North Fork, Sag Harbor and near East Hampton. The weekend was filled with mostly clouds, but that did not stop the wine tasting. Some of the highlights included Peconic Bay Vineyards on the North Fork, a beautiful little vineyard with a recently rennovated tasting room. Chatting with the older man behind the counter was wonderful and I discovered a delicious Reisling which I quickly purchased a bottle of. Down south outside East Hampton were my two favorite vineyards which to my surprise really hold their own when compared to some higher end California vineyards. Channing Daughters and Duck Walk not only have gorgeous sprawling facilities but they produce some of, in my opinion, the best wine on the east coast. At Channing Daughters a tasting of 5 wines quickly turned into 9 as we were able to easily connect about food and wine with the employee there. My favorite of the tasting was the Rosso Fresco 2006, a wine that is flexible in its use with strong berry flavors, but not overpowering or too sweet. It was a blend predominately of Merlot. Duck Walk, with the guidance of a close friend, introduced me to my new favorite wine, the 2004 Cabernet Sauvingnon Reserve. A delicious all-purpose cab that had a bold flavor and amazingly smooth finish. I have to thank my friend Mike for introducing me to this wine and only hope I can find a good supply as it is limited to only 200 cases.Of course the weekend was not all about food and I was fortunate to dine on some delicious treats. From East by Northeast the Duck Taco's in Wonton Shells were amazing and should be added to a menu here in NYC. A duck confit and fig risotto at Harvest is probably one of my top dishes this summer. The ubiquitous stop at the famous \"Lunch\" opened my eyes to the best fish and chips I've ever had, made with puffer fish and available only in June and July. If you get a chance to grab try any of these three I highly recommend it.More recently I wrapped up a July 4th weekend on the southern most tip of New Jersey in Cape May. A charming little town dotted with gorgeous Victorian mansions, the weather unfortunately was not in our favor. Regardless it was a vacation and offered plenty relaxation. From a food perspective Cape May has its limits, though it does have good options if you do your homework.For breakfast I would recommend George's Place, a family run spot on the main strip (Beach Ave.) that has been serving breakfast, lunch and dinner since 1968. A huge portion of raisin and walnut pancakes was delicious albeit too much food for one person. The French toast with sugar sauteed bananas was a bit more manageable and quite delicious. Some of the more notable meals included the limited Osso Bucco at Freso's a quaint Italian Bistro. A generous portion complete with bone marrow it was delicious especially when paired with the bottle of Rosso Fresco from Channing Daughters in LI (Fresco's is BYOB). A meal at the popular Peter Shields Inn proved uneven, but had a standout crab and lobster cake as well as a spicy seared scallop, both paired perfectly with the cab from Duck Walk.There is an abundance of sweets available from the wide variety of fudge at the Fudge Kitchen, to the famous custards at Kohr's so don't plan on dieting while here. A small, yet reliable selection of bars provide some nighttime entertainment with standard beer selections and the occasional pleasantry (i.e. Newcastle, Magic Hat, Dogfish).Overall two solid weekends, both offering very different experiences. As I was away from the city it dawned on me how much exposure we have here to food and drinks and that while we are quite fortunate it also can be detrimental to our opinions. When dining here in NYC we have relatively high expectations from a food and service standpoint which may not always be applicable when in other parts of the country. I found myself having to step back and think of some of my dining/drinking experiences relative to their location rather than comparing them to what we have here in New York. I hope to be more realistic or more to be blunt, less of a food snob moving forward and I do think that it is important to have an open, understanding mind and not always see things through the lens we have created here in the city.

With summer officially underway I always find specific foods go best with that hot sunny weather. While the go to's may be anything off a grill and a cold beer there are a handful of delights out there which just taste better in the summer time. - A slice of Pizza - we can debate and debate over which slice joint in the city is best, but which ever is your favorite trying taking it to go and simply strolling around the city with it. A perfect on the walk snack or meal, a good slice of pizza should hold up as you eat while walking. Stick with one slice or it can get a little messy. Recommendations for slices (not pies): Joe's Pizzeria, Bleecker Street Pizza, Grandaisy Bakery and Lazarra's - Falafel - A falafel sandwich if made and wrapped correctly is quite a package. So many flavors and textures that could create potential disaster if not wrapped in wax paper and aluminum foil correctly. When done with you can walk for blocks without worrying about tahini dripping down on your clothes. My recommendation for falafel: Mamoun's, Yatagan, Taim, Azuri Cafe and some assorted street vendors.- Gelato - this is a given, but with all of the fro-yo and gelato spots popping up, and NYMag's recent coverage of the best gelato in the W.Village I thought it deserved a mention. Whether walking around or sitting peacefully in Washington Square Park a nice cold, creamy cup of gelato can be uplifting. I like to grab mine from Grom, Il Laboratorio and Otto (only dine-in, but they have pints).- Ice cold Lemonade or Iced Tea - Another obvious choice, but there are some really impressive 'ades and teas in the city that go unnoticed. Refreshing and better for you than say a Coke, Summer time is the perfect time for these drinks. Recommendations include: Taim's Ginger Mint Lemonade, Westville Blended Mint Lemonade, Hill Country's Iced Tea, the variety of fresh lemonade's and teas at the Greenmarket in Union Square/Grand Army Plaza

Restaurant Review (Revisited): Degustation
***AUTHOR

***CONTENT
I recently made it back to one of my favorite restaurants. I was introduced to Degustation and Chef Wesley Genovart's cooking awhile back for a generous birthday meal and never looked back when calling it one of my top places to eat. The combination of fantastic unique flavors, wonderful ambiance and proximity to the cooking and chefs is hard to beat anywhere. Fortunately I found a good reason to get back this past weekend and while the menu has been updated everything else was just as good as I remembered.We had an 8pm reservation on Saturday evening and came into a calm yet busy atmosphere. Our seats were waiting for us and as I sat down I noticed Chef Genovart was actually behind the saute station which was a nice surprise, he was simply plating last time I was here. The menu changes seasonally so we were in for a fresh assortment of tastes reminiscent of my earlier trip to the greenmarket. Personally I always enjoy ordering my own dishes as opposed to ordering the tasting menu here, I feel it allows for a bit more control of what you may eat, but that just my opinion.Our decision was to order up a handful, ultimately nine dishes, and share them each. The first plates were our smallest bites of the evening, croquettes with ham and the Spanish \"tortilla\". Both playful, fun and easy to eat we could have put away a dozen of so of each without a second thought. Our next dish was from the 10-course tasting menu as we had inquired about a dish being prepared earlier. It was grilled bluefish on a bed of strawberries, asparagus and what appeared to be cracklin's of some sort topped with peanuts. The combination of fish and strawberries seemed very interesting and odd to me requiring me to order and thankfully it was delicious; soft, crunchy and chewy textures mingled with smoky, sweet and nutty flavors that were quite memorable.The next two courses brought a remarkably fresh and crisp salad of sugar snap peas with lamb bacon and olive oil poached cod with peas and serrano. The sugar snap pea salad was the a taste of summer in a bowl and its presentation matched this. Crisp, refreshing with a hint of smokiness from the bacon it was a very well crafted dish. The cod offered a softer variety of textures and was perfectly cooked. Most importantly the sauce below (which Chef Genovart provided a detailed description of ) was addictive to say the least. A combination of chicken stock, white wine, a variety of herbs and more ingredients than I can't remember, I sure wish I had the opportunity to write it down.Our next two plates brought the meat courses of the night. Here is where there was a slight stumble from the stellar path so far. A dish of quail, pine nut paste and sorrel was overly seasoned with pepper and did not wow me nearly as much as the dishes prior though the breast was well cooked. A filet of wagyu with pickled radishes and an unidentifiable foam looked wonderful, but missed the mark. While good, I've had better beef dishes here and found this to be bland.One thing many diners way about Degustation is that the portions are small. I won't hesitate to agree here and unless you plan to spend you may be left a bit hungry. Fortunately this was a celebration so we ordered up two dishes. The first brought me back to my meal at Ko, it was a slowly poached egg split open with smoked cheese foam, prosciutto and sesame crusted asparagus. While quite salty I really enjoyed this dish. It would have been better suited earlier in the meal, but that was our mistake. Each element in the dish was able to stand out without being overpowered. Our final savory course was the fish crudo, this evening the fish was kampachi. The fish was gorgeous and had smoky salty flavor that tricked the taste buds shortly into thinking it was prosciutto.The meal did consist of some rather salty options and with a very interesting dessert on the menu we did not hesitate to order one a person. The name escapes me, but the dish was compared to a Spanish version of French Toast and was placed upon fresh raspberries. Bruleed prior to serving the brioche used was crisp on top and creamy and sweet on the inside. A very nice way to end the meal. A definite success and enjoyable meal I think I'll keep Degustation as one of my top restaurants for the same reasons as before further impressed with Chef Genovart's inventive culinary mind. 239 E 5th St, New York, NY 10003, (212) 979-1012, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Expensive ($60-80/pp)

For some restaurant weeks are a real drag. Poor options, poor service and overall not a good represenation of what a restaurants real capabilities are. For others it is a challenge, a challenge to make the most of the restaurant week offer and really select the spots they've always wanted to dine at without worrying about poor menu selections. With that said I personally think restaurant week is great. Yes, it could be better on many levels, but I still remember my meals at Tribeca Grill, The Bar Room, Applewood and more not because they were inexpensive, but because they were in fact very good meals.There are a few spots I'm considering this year, all for dinner as I can't make any for lunch unfortunately:- Perry Street- Mia Dona- Bar Room @ The Modern- Anthos- GrayzAny opinions about these spots or experiences would be great, but I'm confident I can get a great 3-course meal at any of these spots.For more on NYC Summer Restaurant Week 2008 click here

***CONTENT
My vacation to Aruba a few weeks back was eye opening for a variety of reasons. Never before had I seen such clear blue water or won money on a blackjack table. I had never held a live sea urchin, or let a sea spider crawl over my hand before diving down to view gorgeous 50ft coral reefs. All of these were very memorable first-time experiences that I hope to repeat again and again as I anticipate future trips to the Caribbean and this gorgeous island. Of course during my stay food was a big question mark for me. There is little grown on the island in terms of produce, aloe is their main export, but there are a number of quality places to dine.After much research (expected by all from me) I brought a short list of places for lunch and dinner for the 5 day, 4 night stay. Our first meal would be at a seaside spot, Brisas Del Mar, located on the South East end of the island. A long drive from our hotel, The Marriot Surf Club, filled with dark streets, quick turns and a detour, but ultimately arrived at our destination. On first appearance I felt as if I had led us in the wrong direction. A divey looking building with a handful of cars was in front of us, however, upon entering through the gate we discovered a gorgeous patio with plush chairs, tables and lounges all merely feet from the ocean. While we were too late for the sunset, we arrived closer to 8pm, the setting was still wonderfully relaxing, especially on our first night. The food, also was very nice, but did have its troubles. To begin an amuse-bouche was presented to all of us of cranberry soup and a calamari fritter. Word to the wise, cranberry soup doesn't work. It was part cold, part hot, and just overall not very good. On the flip side there were some highlights including a delicious Mahi Mahi special which was perfectly cooked and well seasoned as well as some garlicky baby shrimp and fresh mussels. Looking back the food was good, not great, but it was the setting and kind service that made the experience enjoyable.The next evening we wandered only a short distance from our hotel to a beach side restaurant Moomba Beach and Bar. A gorgeous setting, it is situated right on the beach with perfect views of the sunset as well as some of the peaceful sailboats. The food however is not as good as the view. Every dish fell short, some by a small margin others massive. The only thing keeping us in our seats were the sunset and the convenience of this restaurant to our hotel. Cajun Chicken strips came out and looked like bread crumb strips fried to a deep brown. Fresh Grouper was ruined with a horrendous butter sauce, how can you mess up a butter sauce? The rest of the meal does not warrant listing.Hoping to put our poor meal from night two behind us we set off for Papiamento Restaurant, further inland than we had been going, but worth the trip. The restaurant is set in and around a 175+ year old manor house surrounded by a small jungle of trees and a lit pool it was an enchanting setting. Some of our highlights included very well done baked Escargot, a unique and surprisingly good smoked salmon appetizer with passionfruit, tenderloin topped with a rich mushroom sauce and a well-rounded wine list. The best meal so far, we enjoyed the ambiance, peaceful setting and the cordial service which even offered us a tour of the manor house post-meal.Our last evening in Aruba offered our best dining experience. The Flying Fishbone was the venue, which we had booked reservations at weeks in advance, and it surely lived up to the hype. We had dined on the ocean, on the beach, under a \"jungle\" of sorts, but now we were dining shoes off with the tide coming up feet from our toes. Unique to say the least, it offers a unique ocean to table experience especially as you see fish, crab and eels as you dine on their ocean friends. The Fishbone offers one of the best views of the sunset, is extremely romantic, but also puts a lot of importance on the quality and thought that goes into each dish. A starter of Homemade Pastrami with Pesto was enlightening and delicious as was the Carpaccio of Artichoke with Goat Cheese. I took a chance and ordered Mahi Mahi with Gorgonzola sauce, the special, and was pleasantly surprised when the sauce did not overpower the fish, but rather complimented it nicely. The Sea Bass Provincial was a hearty, rustic dish that still managed to be light on the appetite. Dessert of dark chocolate mousse and a thick slice of apple pie helped end the meal on a sweet note.You may notice every review is for dinner possibly wondering where the breakfast and lunch meals were. Well, breakfast was always at the hotel in our room, trying to be economical. Lunch on the other hand wasn't really worth sharing. Aruba may have some great dining destinations, but lunch is a little more limited. Tony Roma's, Wendy's, Pizza Hut and a variety of mediocre beach bars and grills are the most obvious and abundant lunch options. Grouper sandwich at one may be a Grouper Sandwich with grilled vegetables at another, both equally disappointing. That's not to say good lunch can't be found, it just is not going to be on the beach or that cheap.

Restaurant Review: Peter Lugers

***CONTENT
So I begin this review with a pledge, a pledge to myself to cut back on the red meat for the next few weeks. After Lugers (which was actually two weeks ago) and the Big Apple BBQ Festival this past weekend I think I need to opt for vegetables and fish for a handful of meals. Would I change a thing about how I've been eating the past few weeks? Most certainly not. With that said, let's get into the details of Lugers based on my first ever trip to the famed steakhouse.It has been a goal of mine to get to Luger's for quite sometime, but due to a variety of reasons (reservations, cost, appetite, etc.) it took sometime and nimble planing. Fortunately I was able to arrange a meal there with some family which made the experience all the more appealing. For many, Luger's is an institution, not just a steakhouse. They are the inspiration, even the blueprint, for many steakhouses in Manhattan and beyond. Some love it, some don't. There are great debates about whether it is the best steakhouse in the city and even the country. While I cannot make a claim that it is the best steakhouse in the country at this point I can safely say it is the best steakhouse in the metro area.Beginning with the restaurant itself, it is a very old building with great personality and history. You just know thousands of people have leaned on the bar at the entrance and an equal amount of steaks have been hustled through the restaurant by the wait staff. (On the topic of wait staff, I personally found them very helpful and cheerful, whereas some people have found them gruff and rude. My only recommendation is steer clear of the fish and try not to take anything personal, they have likely been doing this for decades). To get a table at Luger's is not as difficult as I believed it to be. You call, you say when you want to come and what time, they tell you what's available and you hang up content and licking your lips. Problem is your 6:45 table may not actually be ready until 7:30. What I did not know is that your reservation merely puts you on a check-in list. Once on this list you wait to be called. Whether you like it or not, this is the process. One point I want to make here, many get frustrated by this, but Luger's is such a popular place with so many covers a night that there are bound to be delays. You just need to be understanding.Moving on to the most important aspect of Lugers: the food. If you have been there before, or looked at the menu beforehand, there is no need to get a menu (you may not even be brought one unless you ask). Just order up and the waiters will answer the questions you have. Most important question of the night: \"How would you like your steak cooked?\" Easily the single most important thing of the night, if you mess this up you could potentially be ruining a $160+ piece of meat (see porterhouse for 4). My choice is medium-rare, leaning a little towards medium just to keep it from being overly chewy. Of course with a table of 4 we did just that, ordered the Porterhouse for 4 cooked medium-rare. Now what you choose to accompany your steak is equally important as the steak itself. A bad side can bring down your mood and put too much emphasis on the meat. My recommendation (and Lugers') order up the amazing Creamed Spinach, German Potatoes and to start, maybe a Shrimp Cocktail and a Tomato and Onion Salad. It is a lot of food, but if you come hungry you should be okay; we were.The appetizers, were quite good, but very simple. The tomatoes and onions went great with the sweet and tangy Luger sauce. While I'm not a huge shrimp fan I could appreciate the size of the shrimp, easily twice the size of a typical shrimp cocktail. Bread arrives in three varieties, onion rolls which were very good and worth saving for later, as well as bread stick like rolls and another plain roll.The main course, or show in my opinion, is the presentation of the steak. It fits perfectly in the middle of our table and sizzles quite loudly. The steak is pre-sliced with a gorgeous thick char all around complimented by a juicy pink center. The smell of beef and butter (the plate is doused with melted butter prior to putting the steak on it) permeates the air, and neighboring tables take a few jealous ganders. A few slices of beef are served to each diner and then it's time to dig in. Take it slow, there is plenty of steak. Each bite is worth savoring with the first and last being the best (the last gets dipped in all of the remaining juices). The steak is similar to other steaks I've had, but the crust is what sets it apart. Not burnt, but slightly crunchy it provides a great textural element and that grilled/charred flavor I really enjoy.The steak was perfectly complimented by intensely creamy creamed spinach, I mean that in a good way, and the potatoes which were finished off in the oven to get little crispy bits all around. We also spontaneously ordered some Onion Rings which were unnecessary and overly soggy.Of course each and every inch of steak was canvased for more meat until we all finally threw in the towel. For most the indulgence would end here, but I suggest you push on just as we did and order up some of their delicious desserts. We all shared a Chocolate Mousse and Key Lime Pie served with a overflowing bowl of Schalg (homemade German whip cream). The mousse was rich, creamy and very nice after a heavy meal while the pie was good, but not great. In all honesty it was the Schlag that really elevated both desserts, this is certainly not Cool Whip.Overall a fantastic, food filled evening. Minor things such as poor onion rings, a little more salt on the steak and perhaps lower prices were not major factors. Was it a perfect steak? No, it was not. Was it close? Very much so. However, as I said before the sides are just as important as the steak and it is for that reason which Luger's is now my favorite steakhouse.178 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 387-7400, Reservations - Required, Price - Expensive ($70 - 90/person and cash only)

Big Apple BBQ: An Afternoon to Remember

***CONTENT
My excitement has been building for months and it finally came to it's peak today as I emerged from the subway and walked over to Madison Avenue swept away by the sights and smells of the 6th annual Big Apple BBQ. I was a newbie here at the BBQ, unfortunately I had been unable to attend the past two years, but I was well prepared. Armed with a fastpass, mandatory by the way in my opinion, and a small group of hungry friends we plotted our course. There were a handful of must eat places on my list, Mike Mills 17th Street Bar and Grill, Mr. Cecil's California Ribs, Big Bob Gibson's Bar-B-Q, Ed Mitchell's \"The Pit\" and Blue Smoke for desserts.Seeing as how it was on the early side, slightly before 12:30, we opted to get some of the \"big ticket\" items out of the way. 17th Street Bar and Grill are renowned for their baby back ribs and today they were serving Baby Back Ribs and Beans. This would be the longest line of the day for me, I was lucky, and it was well worth it. The ribs were tender, smoky and perfectly moist. However, it was the beans which really sold me. An assortment of pinto, elephant and red beans in a smoky sweet base with shreds of pork, absolutely fantastic.Trying to kill two birds with one stone I quickly hopped over to Cecil's to see what this Californian pit master had to offer; it was their first time at the festival. At first glance the food looked delicious, clearly not a typical BBQ plate of food: an enormous glistening beef rib with an asian glaze and sesame seeds, a beef and pork cajun sausage and a peppery vinegary salad of onions tomatoes and cucumbers. The food looked great, but the taste was another thing. The glaze on the ribs was quite nice, but the rib was not very moist. The salad, again looked great, but was overpowered by black pepper. The saving grace was the sausage, meaty, spicy with a great bite from the casing, it was delicious and one of the more memorable bites of the day.Of course on any other day I would be slowing down now, but my appetite was in full swing so after a quick stroll we made our way over to 26th street with the goal of ultimately ending up at \"The Pit\". First stop on 26th Street, the venerable Big Bob Gibson's of the famed Chris Lilly. My day could have ended here and I would have been pleased. The Pulled Pork Shoulder served up here was everything I could have wanted, moist, tender and when topped with their award winning sauce brought to an all new level. Unfortunately, they were sold out of the sauce as of Saturday afternoon, but that is what the internet is for. The sandwich was served with coleslaw instead of the advertised beans, but it was all about the sandwich.Moving along 26th Street we took a stop at the newly invited Wilson's Pit Barbeque to try some of their Texas Style Brisket and Slaw. I had been craving some brisket for, but this really missed the mark. I was happy to see another state represented at the festival, but the brisket was dry, tough and lacking flavor. While I did manage to finish the serving I would attribute that to the sauce which at least made the beef satisfactory. Even the slaw was bland and left me wishing I had spent my money elsewhere, but oh well no regrets.Fortunately, Ed Mitchell's \"The Pit\" was close by along with his eight smokers filled with whole hogs and whole pig skin, or cracklin's. Surprisingly the line was rather tame perhaps due to the location, it was on the outskirts of the festival, or the unfamiliarity to many BBQ goers. The pork was wildly chopped by the pitmasters and served on a standard bun. The textures were quite different than the pulled pork from earlier in the afternoon, especially when topped with some of the craklin's. I was impressed with the sandwich overall, it had a very deep flavor with a strong vinegar base and a long lasting heat. A creamy simple slaw mellowed out the heat very nicely.At this point the afternoon sun combined with the amazing amount of meat we had eaten started to take it's toll. Some peaceful bench sitting combined with a bit of wandering through the park provided a bit of relief and of course led to a trip to one of the vendor's as we slowly approached the end of our fastpass. Wildwood BBQ's dessert stand caught our eye with their S'mores and at only $2 each it was a worthy purchase. There was a pleasant hint of peanut on top of the S'more which I really appreciated.Continuing with the dessert theme we rounded out the day with a stop at Blue Smoke's dessert setup. Serving Root Beer Float's, Chocolate Brownie's and the very popular Peanut Butter & Jelly Cupcakes even the fastpass line was unexpectedly long. The cupcake was delicious, a creamy peanut butter topping with a soft crumbly cupcake stuffed with a small dab of jelly, it was extremely addictive. The float was light enough to keep me from going over the edge and it was remarkably refreshing after a day of heavy eating and 90 degree humid weather.The day was filled with plenty of food, music, a variety of drinks and of course throngs of people and I can't wait to do it again next year.A variety of photos from throughout the day can be seen below in this order: the lawn full of BBQ lovers, whole hog being flipped at \"The Pit\", pork being pulled at Ubon's, Mint Julips at Eleven Madison Park, live music at Eleven Madison Park and the fully used fastpass). Enjoy!

You are very right Jane. I am still full! It was an amazing day and we managed to stay cool enough in the shade. I also think we made a good choice in going early, helped avoid the lines and also some of the more intense heat.

Solid review overall dude. Definitely agree that Big Bob Gibson's was everything we could want from pulled pork. Disagree with Ed Mitchell, however, didn't impress me at all. I missed out on the PBJ Cupcakes, really wanted one but they ran out. Solid review as usual.NYCFoodGuy.com

It's true, somewhat. As reported by the NY Daily News, Danny Meyer plans to have a Shake Shack truck in downtown Brooklyn near the Metro Tech center. This could go into place by the end of the summer with the truck rotating at other spots on weekends. Good news for all those craving a Shake Burger out in Brooklyn and beyond, bad news for other burger chains.

Restaurant Review: Soba Totto

***CONTENT
Soba noodles have made quite an impression on New Yorkers the past few years as many new noodle shops have been popping up. One that opened up late last year, Soba Totto, is not completely new to the New York dining scene as the sister restaurant, Yakitori Totto, has been around for a few years and is very highly regarded. I've always been a fan of the wonderful food at Yakitori Totto and find it unique, inexpensive and always delicious so I was very interested in trying out the new restaurant. Soba Totto is located on the other side of town on East 43rd street in a relatively unmarked building. Entering the restaurant I immediately was impressed with the space. It seemed much more polished and refined than Yakitori Totto and it also offers more seating. There is a soothing quality to the space, but the smoke off the grill quickly reminds you where you are and what you are here to doMuch of the menu at Soba Totto is borrowed from Yakitori Totto, the meat skewers, some of the salads and appetizers, but all of the noodle dishes are new and exciting. Hearing that the cold soba was the way to go we ordered up Goma Dare Soba, or cold soba with sesame broth. We were presented with a tray of soba noodles, a peanut/sesame sauce, scallions and cucumbers as well as a warm buckwheat broth. The noodles were tender, but with a nice bite and I really enjoyed assembling each bite myself with all of the ingredients. It reminded me of cold noodles and sesame sauce from a Chinese restaurant, but in a much more refined and less saucy way. Accompanying this we also ordered two more dishes, a simple and delicious Tuna Sashimi as well as a deep fried buckwheat ball in a vegetable and soy based broth. Although the buckwheat was too gummy and lacked much flavor the broth was stellar .To help round out the meal we ordered a few skewers, chicken oyster, chicken meatball with egg and the special asparagus wrapped in bacon. The chicken oyster was moist and tender and provided me with a new chicken texture I had never experienced before. The chicken meatball, a favorite of mine at Yakitori Totto, came with a raw quail egg and when dipped in the egg the skewer reached a new heights and a much welcomed richness.Rounding out the meal we were offered complimentary cup of tea which was a great palate cleanser and ended the meal on a high note. Service was, not surprisingly, very good and well-paced and the total bill was extremely reasonable (note they have a $20 minimum per person ). I expect to dine again at Soba Totto and am thrilled that they now have another outpost in the city making it even easier for me to get to. 211 E 43rd St #1F, New York 10017, 212-557-8200, Recommendation - Not Necessary, Price - Inexpensive-Moderate ($20-35/person)

Restaurant Review: Terroir

Recently I dined at Terroir, the new East Village Italian wine bar opened by Marco Canora the chef/owner of neighbor Hearth, and I definitely plan on returning. There were hits and misses throughout the night, but the overall experience provided me with some great tasting Italian small plates, good conversation and great wine.The space is tiny, but not stuffy or overly cramped. A short bar sits on the left of the restaurant while a handful of tables can be found on the right. I personally enjoy sitting at the bar as I believe it offers you more interaction with the servers/bartenders as well as a better view of everything going on. Here you can view the tiny kitchen off to the corner where a panini press, prep station, deep fryer and salamander reside. The menus may hurt the eyes of some with the many fonts, colors and visuals, and although they were occasionally difficult to read I enjoyed the whimsical creative style.Ordering up a few dishes we started with the beet risotto balls and lamb sausage wrapped in sage leaves and fried. These two dishes were possibly my favorite and left me wanting more the rest of the evening. The risotto balls were crispy, but not overly breaded and the gorgeous beet color erupted from within as soon as you took a bite (or fork as they are steaming hot). To round out the flavor a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese emerges from the center as well. The meaty lamb sausage was gorgeous in it's medium rare presentation and it managed to taste even better than it looked. The thin crispy layer of breading and sage merges with the perfectly cooked lamb and is extremely addictive. Both dishes are $7 and are fine to share, though if you are a party larger than two you may be yearning for more.At this point I had ordered and consumed a delicious red wine called Monastrell, M 2 (Salvador Poveda) from 2006. It was highly recommended by the bartender and was smooth, mild with a slight bite. Very much like a Pinot Noir in my opinion with a little more finish to it. It was also hard to complain as at $8 a glass for very generous pours one can get comfortable here for the night.Of course still hungry we ordered up a few more dishes to share starting with the duck ham panini with hen of the woods mushrooms and tallegio cheese. A great looking sandwich it lacked the cheesiness I was looking for and the there could have been a bit more filling. Regardless, the duck ham was nice and tender and was complimented by a prominent, but not overbearing smokiness. To round out the meal little bar snacks of rapnini with garlic and chili's and marinated cremini mushrooms were ordered. Neither of these were really stand outs and I would likely pass on the \"bar snacks\" section next time opting for something different.Although the food was not consistent across the board there is definite potential here. Whether looking for a spot to grab a full meal or simply any one of the fantastic wines Terroir is an affordable, friendly option.413 East 12th Street, New York NY 10009, No phone, Reservations - not accepted, Price - Moderate ($25-$35/person)

An always popular \"activity\" of mine is skipping dinner and simply eating at the bar. There are some wonderful bar treats out there ranging from the sublime pork belly steamed buns at Momofuku Ssam or Rusty Knot's chicken liver sandwich, to the simple yet addictive grilled flatbread at Beast in Brooklyn. These are of course examples of successful bar food options, but there are most definitely plenty of bars serving unremarkable fare throughout the city. I'm sure we've all been subjected to the many tasteless sliders, stale nachos and dips that are likely scooped out of a carton. However, there are many lo-brow, or more approachable foods out there that I cannot turn down.Overlook Lounge's Chicken Sliders - A few bites is all it takes to put away these extremely addictive mini chicken sandwiches. Topped with melted mozzarella, roasted red peppers and a chipotle mayo, these are the perfect compliment to your drinks.Soda Bar's Onion Rings - Huge onion rings with enough batter to give you that crispiness without overpowering the onion.Flatbush Farm/Barn's French Dip - I find it very difficult to find a good French Dip in NYC for some reason, but I fortunately found an amazing one only blocks from my apartment. The meat is wonderfully tender and topped with a great horseradish cream sauce.Crocodile Lounge's Free Pizza - Definitely not the best pizza, but the fact that it is free with any drink purchase makes it good in my book.Cheese Fries from any of the following: Scuffy Duffy's, Bar 515, Emerald Pub, Blackstone's Pub, Gin Lane and moreBurgers from Corner Bistro (technically a bar when it opened), Coppersmith's, Soda Bar, Beast, and the Stoned Crow (remember I'm only talking bars)Wogies Cheesesteaks - A great food to match with a beer.Other places of notable mention are: Ear Inn, Lighthouse Tavern, 12th Street Bar and Grill, Puck Fair, and Spitzer's Corner to name a few. Of course all tapas spots are technically bars as well, but I've exluded them from this conversation thinking they may have an unfair advantage due to the amount of different food they serve compared to the standard bar. Bar dining gets a bad wrap because when you find one the great spot offering quality food, you may have five spots serving terrible food and watered down beer. Any thoughts, comments, suggestions let me know. Always looking for some new bar food.

How about wings? As long as we're talking Scruffy Duffy's we have to mention the fact that 1) they're out of business, crazy I know and 2) they used to have to best wings in the city.Landsdowne Road on 10th and 45th has the same owners but I haven't verfied if they have the same delicious wings.George Keely's on the Upper West Side has awesome bar food, some of the best I've ever had. Definitely better than Blondie's. McAleey's on the Upper West Side also has good grub. Here's a review on Keely's Burger and their monstrous appetizer sampler that's just outta control. Great wings at Keely's too. They also make some outta control cheese fries.

I honestly haven't found amazing wings in nyc at bars. I liked virgils wings, and I guess blondies is a bar and their wings are pretty good. Overall though I find the best wings at grills or restaurants, not bars.I did not know Scruffy Duffy's is closed! I haven't been in midtown for a bit. Interesting.

The Ninth Avenue Food Festival is coming up this weekend and many New Yorkers and tourists will have the opportunity to enjoy a wide assortment of street treats and more. I made my way to the festival last year and sampled such things as lamb kebabs, deep fried oreos, arepa sandwiches, empanada's with assorted fillings and much more. This steet fair is no standard NYC weekend festival. Here you will find a variety of vendors from the area, including many 9th Avenue restaurants offering their treats for very reasonable prices. Assuming the weather is good (and it is questionable at this time) I highly recommend it. The street fair runs on Saturday and Sunday from 37th - 57th street and will be open from 9:30am - 6:30pm. Further information here.

Restaurant Review: Bar Carrera

***CONTENT
In the mood for a casual and inexpensive meal within walking distance of Union Square Bar Carrera was on a short list of spots to check out. I love tapas, ever since my days in Barcelona I have always enjoyed the Spanish flavors and the small plates style of eating, so Bar Carrera was an easy choice (not to mention my date loves tapas as well). Walking down 2nd Avenue it is hard not to walk straight by Bar Carrera as the only signage is the menu taped to the frosted glass windows. For future reference it is right next to Bar Veloce, and owned by the same people.Walking into Bar Carrera it certainly does not feel like a tapas bar in Spain, but don't let that disturb you. You will find many Spanish staples as well as interesting twists on the menu here, and everything is small and cheap. The space is quite modern and the adjoining dining room seems a bit out of place and secondary. We chose to eat at the bar, right in front of the \"kitchen\", also known as a hot plate, fryer, toaster, microwave and small counter - it was one of the smaller kitchens I have seen. We ordered up a handful of dishes for round 1: patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, an a serrano, almond cream and raisin vinagrette topped toast. Of all the dishes the open faced serrano sandwich was the best. The interesting and unique tastes worked very well together, but kept the dish very simple. Our second round of tapas included lackluster meatballs and mini chorizo with honey mustard. Neither dish was particularly good and the meatballs were just confusing as they were topped on spaghetti like ribbons of cucumber (and cucumber does not taste good hot). A dissappointing showing overall after much anticipation from other reviews.We had also ordered a pitcher of sangria to start us off, and again found it subpar. Bar Carrera offers three types of Sangria, and we were recommended the white, also known as the cucumber sangria. Personally, I like sangria. It can be very refreshing and surprisingly strong. However, after the first sip this sangria was no longer refreshing and offered little in the alcohol department. Fortunately it was only $15 and we were able to squeeze 5 glasses out of it.All in all it was not a very memorable meal, and definitely not a spot where I would choose to get Tapas. I can see the benefits of Bar Carrera though as it offers very inexpensive tapas dishes and drinks making it a good spot to meet up, just not to have a meal. 175 Second Ave., New York, NY 10003, 212-375-1555, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($15 - $25/person)

Restaurant Review: Momofuku Ssam Bar

***DATE

***CONTENT
After a highly enjoyable trip to Momofuku Ko a few weeks ago I felt it only appropriate to dine at David Chang's other extremely popular, but more affordable, Ssam Bar. The menu changes frequently and there is a strong emphasis on local purveyors and seasonal ingredients, not to mention constantly being raved about by food critics and bloggers. Well unexpectedly I found myself in the East Village on a rainy Spring Friday and felt obligated to stop into Ssam. Generally I plan where I will eat, especially if it is a place where I have wanted to dine for quite some time, but not this time. Fortunately for me it was early, around 7:30, and raining so the crowds were not too big and I was sitting at the bar within 5 minutes. At first glance it was a busy scene, many people drinking, eating and laughing, but to our surprise there were at least 12 servers. Odd considering there were no more than 50 people in the restaurant. All of the servers seemed to be friends of Chang, and if they weren't they could have been. Hanging out, some in street clothes others all in black, it was an eclectic and fun group who were happy to serve us. There was one thing I needed to order here and that was the steamed buns. I had heard so much of these little morsels of pork belly, but up until recently had never been one to enjoy any pork products. My tastes have shifted over the years, I actually grew up kosher and never laid a finger on pork, and there are certain cuts and preparations which I enjoy. David Chang's pedigree in the world of pork is no secret, so what better place than Ssam, Ko or Noodle Bar to expand my pork knowledge.The steamed buns, filled with a few thick slices of tender pork belly, scallions, thinly sliced cucumber and a generous dab of hoisin were amazing. The soft bun held up nicely to the very strongly flavored fillings, I could easily see myself eating a handful of these without a problem. I may not be much of a pork eater, but these are quite addictive, and at 2 for $10 not terribly expensive. Our second plate of food showcased a huge portion of hanger steak cooked medium-rare accompanied by a ginger scallion dressing, kimchi, bibb lettuce and a bowl of white rice. A nice sized portion which I shared with my date, but there was one major flaw with the dish. It was impossible to chew the meat once it was in the lettuce wraps. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy my steak cooked medium-rare, but when chewing steak in a sandwich or wrap it is better when cooked medium. Now this is something which I'm sure has not always been an issue, but every bite I took the same thing occurred. Personally I believe this is something which the kitchen should have taken into account prior to serving the dish. Regardless, the seasoning was wonderful and despite the chewiness of the steak it was a good piece of meat.After a glass of red, the name escapes me, and a Anchor Steam beer we wrapped up our bill to a reasonable $50. With that said dining at Ssam can get expensive as dishes range from under $5 to over $25 for entrees and even more for the Bo Ssam, $200 gets you a whole pork shoulder for at least seven people with a variety of sides and sauces. I will definitely be back if only for the steamed buns, though I'm sure I will aim to try one of the offal dishes as well. An update on the review should be expected in the future. 207 Second Ave., New York, NY 10003, 212-254-3500, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($30-$40/person)

Ryan Sutton of Bloomberg News gives Ko 3 stars (out of 4) and his review is spot on. Great, inventive cuisine, but the service is not that of a 4 star restaurant, but that's not a bad thing in his eyes.On the other hand, Gael Greene seems to have a personal vendetta against David Chang and write more about herself than the food. Personally, one of the more poor reviews I've ever read.The first major review by Adam Platt is also still available, this was a 4-star review (out of 5) and very widely criticized as the critic only dined at Ko once. Still a nice honest review.All of this is in anticipation of Frank Bruni's review in the NYTimes which will be published tomorrow. My guess is 4 stars for the food, but Ko will lose one for ambiance. 3 stars total. I'll post a link for this review as soon as it is available.Update: Bruni gives Ko 3 stars and a very nice, and appropriate in my mind, review.

Restaurant Review: Momofuku Ko

***CONTENT
So not to completely repeat what many other bloggers and food writers have said, but the reservation process for David Chang's new spot, Momofuku Ko is...well tedious, and that is putting it lightly. Beyond the 9:59am ritual, the overall process has gotten better, but is still quite difficult. Regardless, however many times you need to login for reservations it is worth it, completely worth it...Now before getting to deep into the food review I need to set the scene. Slightly after 6pm on a Wednesday evening the counter at Ko is not even full yet, but there is something in the air. A photographer from the NYTimes present and a full staff of chefs, including David Chang himself, are all present. The stage is set for a grand evening before even settling in on the surprisingly semi-comfortable backless stools. Choosing to match our meal (in case you didn't know it is $85 prix fixe and averages 10-courses) with a beverage pairing was a must and we chose the $50 option, but there were even more options including an $85 and $150 pairing, though I honestly don't believe they would be necessary.The meal begins with what is now becoming the infamous starter of homemade pork rinds and an amazing English muffin with pork fat. Now, it may sound a little bold, but the English muffin is perhaps one of the best bread based things I have ever had the chance to eat. Buttery, salty, just perfection. The following courses (and there were two different ones as Ko does not serve the same course to each diner) consisted of a delicious Fluke with poppy seeds, buttermilk and chives, but an even better Hamachi with pickled grapes and freeze dried soy really started us off on the right foot. Unique flavors and textures and an overall very light dish.The next course consisted of two very different soups. One, a salty, sour kimchi broth with pork belly, cabbage and two generously sized oysters. I loved the broth here, full of flavor, but without being too powerful or salty, but the pork belly and oysters were merely okay. The other soup however was perhaps one of the better soups I've had in my life. An extremely finely pureed spring pea soup with microgreens, perfect crawfish and a rich tofu wrapped package of morrels. The dish was smooth, light, and very fresh with each ingredient working together, but still managing to have distinct flavors on their own. Moving on we were served the egg dishes, one custard with caviar, cashews and asparagus and the other a gorgeous sous vide egg with caviar, pickled sous vide onions and mini-potato chips (this dish has been widely talked about). Both were well crafted and surprisingly good considering I am not much of a fan of eggs, but not particularly memorable in the flavor department. The custard was perhaps my least favorite dish of the evening and one I could have done without.With the beginning of Spring, Chang and Co. developed a homemade lasagna filled with a variety of mushrooms, ramps and asparagus and topped with toasted ricotta salata and crispy broccoli rabe flowers. A gorgeous dish with very finely made homemade pasta, the dish was quite good, simple, but a great way to showcase what's in season. This was one of the few courses which both myself and date received the same thing and we both loved the taste and texture combinations. The following course features a scallop with ham and ramps and skin-on trout with pickled radishes and almonds. The scallop was the stand out here as it was cooked perfectly and worked very well with the salty ham. The trout was good, but not memorable and the bacon puree which it was served atop overpowered the dish.The next course featured the already infamous shaved foie gras over Riesling gelee and lychee nuts. A fantastic amazingly creative dish, the combination of textures and tastes really was a mind trip and one of the better dishes of the evening. I really appreciated the addition of toasted pine nuts as well for that extra textural element. At this point the food began to settle in and my appetite was fading, but with the meat course next I knew we were in the final stretch. Served a delicious, perfectly cooked, braised and then deep fried short rib by David Chang was a memorable experience. Rich and tender the dish was complimented by barely cooked yellow carrots, braised daikon with mustard seeds and grilled scallions. Never before had I been served a short rib that was cooked medium and managed to be as tender as this. The accompanying chicken paillard stuffed with porcini mushrooms was good, but did not match up to the short rib dish. Both of us would have simply preferred two short ribs.Finishing off the evening we entered the dessert courses, the first being a pineapple sorbet with chewy pineapple or a kiwi sorbet with apricot and olive oil. Both were nice and light and great palate cleansers. They prepared us for the final dishes of the evening, cereal milk panacotta with avocado cream and a hazelnut crisp and deep fried apple pie with sour cream ice cream and miso paste. Both dishes were delicious, but to me the cereal milk panacotta was the standout. A rich and creamy dish that really did taste like a bowl of cereal (Chang and co. soak Frosted Flakes in milk and then use the milk to create the panacotta). The dish was wonderful and to my surprise the avocado cream helped balance out the sweetness very well. The pie, while good, did not stand out as much of me, however, it was a nice ode to the infamous McDonald's fast food apple pies.Unfortunately, I cannot recall all of the drinks we were served, but throughout the night we received roughly 9 or 10, or one for every course and at least half of those were different among diners. The drinks varied from a white beer, to warm sake and cava. The service was attentive, but not over the top and everything was presented with great detail and care. I imagine this food in an environment where there are white table clothes and tuxedoed servers and a much higher tab, a la Per Se. However, at Ko you won't find table cloths or soothing classical music, but instead a handful of talented chefs rocking out to Led Zeppelin, The White Stripes or the Beatles as they craft each dish with precision. My final thought after reflecting back on the evening, is that everything was very well thought out, creative and delicious. Even the worst of the dishes was still good (with perhaps the custard being the exception) and the best, well the best were some of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Now I prompt you to sign on at 9:59am and take your stab at getting a reservation, it is truly a life changing meal and very much worth it.163 1st Ave, New York, N.Y., no phone, Reservations - recommended, Price - Expensive (110/person minimum with tax and gratuity)

Bar Review: The Rusty Knot
***AUTHOR
Always Eating
***DATE

***CONTENT
Opened only a few months ago, The Rusty Knot sure has received plenty of press. Sometimes hailed as the next great \"dive\" bar of NYC and a welcome partner to Spotted Pig, the bar has quickly gained a loyal following flocking to the far west of Manhattan. The bar overlooks the Westside Highway, not neccessarily a great sight, but if you can look beyond the speeding cars and asphalt the glimmering Hudson and gorgeous sunset beyond Hoboken is quite a view. Entering the Rusty Knot you may feel a little disoriented. The bar's retro tiled floors and wood paneling sure threw me off a little. It was however a welcome site and the relaxed group of people and jukebox really made the experience all the more fun. The Knot has minimal seating, but depending on what time you go getting a stool is not impossible (just don't expect seats open for the taking come 11pm on a Thursday-Saturday night).Order drinks is quite simple as well - 3 beers on tap, another 3-4 bottled, 2 wines (red and white) and an assortment of mixed drinks and cocktails are available. The bar is small and there are only two bartenders, but they were quite attentive and very entertaining. From .99 cent Busch Draft beers (they're only about 6oz's) to Spice Pina Colada's or the bar's signature drink, a rum based drink called \"The Rusty Knot\" fittingly, there is a small, but diverse selection.Generally in my book a bar does not have to serve food to be good, but if quality food is part of the bar's aura then more power to them (and of course business from me). Well Rusty Knot is not any bar and thus doesn't serve any old bar food. You won't find nachos or burgers here, but rather Beer Puffs, Meatloaf sandwiches, Coca-Cola Ribs and my favorite the Chicken Liver and Bacon Sandwich (which was generously offered to me by a friend). If that doesn't suit you they have a good ol' fashioned pig in a blanket, but it's wrapped in a pretzel, and delicious little Meat Pie's that are the perfect bar food. Overall I'd say the food is good, not amazing, but certainly better and more diverse than the average bar.Rusty Knot's appeal lies in it's approachable, yet somewhat exclusive feel. It could very well mimic the basement of some house in the early '70's or '80's, but the way in which it's brought together (the drinks, the food, the crowd, the music) really sets it apart from other bars in the city. For that I was surprised that our bar tab was not astronomical. Something that really will keep the business pouring in is the fact that beers are $3-6 for a pint, wine's are $4 and mixed drinks range from $7-14 -- certainly not breaking the bank here. The same can be said for the food which of course was a huge surprise. I plan on going back, hopefully to watch the sunset again and ultimately watch the crowds roll in around 10pm.425 West St, New York, NY, (212) 645-5668, Price - Inexpensive (average drink $6, average food $9)

Restaurant Review: Bonnie's Grill

***CONTENT
Tucked into a small narrow storefront on 5th Ave. in Park Slope is Bonnie's Grill. It is easy to pass by and dwarfed by the neighboring Blue Ribbon and Blue Ribbon Sushi, Bonnie's is a Park Slope institution as its been serving big juicy spiced burgers, beef on weck (roast beef on a caraway roll) and wings for almost about a decade. Though some may argue that the quality has recently gone downhill, its still quite popular and a great inexpensive spot to grab a meal or even a drink (they have a handful of beers on tap and an extensive list of bottled beers). My meal at Bonnie's was spurred by a burger craving as a result of watching the Food Network and some burger history. My go to's for burgers are usually Beast, Soda or even Flatbush Farm, but I wanted something new today. Bonnie's was the destination.The decor is perfect for the food, and offers a bit of an unpretentious neighborhood escape. The service, quick, friendly, appropriate. The food, well that's what I was here for. A nice juicy Spiced Angus Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, cheddar and pickles and cooked to a nice medium. The burger arrived with a nice heaping of shoestring fries (salad, soup or chili is available as an alternative), which were quite good when dipped in the homemade spicy mayo (bottles are on every table). The burger itself was crispy and charred on the outside but a nice pink on the inside. I liked this burger, it reminded me of Summer. The crust was a result of a spice rub it seems which was not overly spicy, but had a nice smoky kick. It's hard to find a burger where they get a nice crust on the outside but Bonnie's delivered. The flavor was good, not amazing and it could have used some more salt, but still good. At first the Kaiser roll it was served on was impeding my eating, but gradually the roll soaks up the burger juices and it becomes more manageable.A good option for an inexpensive meal ($9.95 for the burger and fries) with a pint or two, though it's not the best burger in the slope in my opinion. 278 Fifth Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11215, 718-369-9527, Reservation - not accepted/needed, Price - Inexpensive ($10-20/person)

Pecorino Romano is a great cheese, but the importers of it feel slighted and deserving of the same attention received by the always popular parmigiano reggiano. As a result, they are staging a huge marketing blitz on the city by working with a handful of restaurants to offer diners a free tasting of the cheese. A variety of pasta dishes will be paired with the cheese and are free of charge. Note that the times are a little odd, I sure don't want cheesy pasta at 10am, but there are a variety of quality restaurants on the list.Free Cheese!Update:While I was out of town this weekend, a colleague of mine \"attempted\" to take advantage of this pecorino romano weekend. Well, two of the restaurants she contacted had no idea what she was talking about. Was this event a sham? An effort by the pecorino romano backers to get publicity? Hard to tell right now, but sounds fishy to me.

So I just scored reservations to Ko next Wednesday at 6:20pm and I couldn't be happier. A slightly early dinner, but who cares. It's taken me this long to land reservations after trying almost everyone weekday morning so beggers can't be choosers. of course there will be a full review after the meal, but for now I just get to anticipate what may be the best meal of the year for me so far (and hopefully more due to all the hype). My only concern was the cost, I'm not investment banker, but fortunately next Wednesday is pay day! This just looks like it's meant to be...

My new BBQ just arrived this weekend, it's a brand new Weber Q 220, and I can't tell you how excited I am to begin grilling again. It's been years since I had a backyard, porch, patio or even any outdoor space and with my relatively new apartment all setup a BBQ was a necessity. Of course with it being in the high 70's the other day what better way to break in the grill with some good ol' fashioned burgers. Two 6-8oz burgers, one smothered with fontina, the other with gruyere and cooked to a great medium. I grilled up some onions tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper as well. The burgers were seasoned with fennel seed, Worcestershire sauce, breadcrumbs, garlic, salt, pepper and a little olive oil and were delicious. With a freezer full of meat I'm thoroughly looking forward to the Spring and Summer in Brooklyn.

Not a problem. If it wasn't written in my lease I'd definitely have a charcoal grill. How's that Sheepshead Bay BBQ festival? I've never heard of it until this year.

Courtesy of the people at NYmag, I just found out that the always popular neighborhood restaurant, The Little Owl, will begin serving lunch starting tomorrow. Always difficult to get into for dinner, the restaurant wanted to make it easier for customers to dine with them (and of course capitalize on their huge success). If you need to make a reservation login into Opentable before those all start getting snatched up, the restaurant will only have 5 tables for reservations open daily, all else are for walk-ins. And rest assured the meatball sliders WILL be served at lunch.

Josh Ozersky, author of \"The Hamburger\", is a very opinionated person when it comes to burgers. As the writer for NYmag's grubstreet and countless other food articles/postings, he has eaten his fare share of burgers. NY Post has his top 10 and bottom 5 listed. You'll notice a trend, Ozersky isn't a fan of gourmet burgers. He likes the simple and classic for the most part. With that said, I'd have to disagree with some of his selections finding that leaving Shake Shack and Burger Joint off (while touristy sometimes) is wrong. In addition, I find Corner Bistro inconsistent, but definitely not worthy of his worst burger in the city award. Other selections of his seem hard to believe as well, but I'll have to check for myself.

Scary thought I know, but it is possible. A recent NY Post article states that new liquor licenses are not being approved for 4am closing time, but rather 2am closings. While this trend is effecting new licenses only, it may become something larger in the future, but it is hard to say given that this is the city that never sleeps. For now, just know that some of the new establishments you are looking to go to may shutdown at 2am, but those old standbys will be open long into the morning as usual.

For the past few days I've been determined to get a reservation at Ko, the impossibly popular new restaurant by David Chang in the East Village, and I fail due to the internet. Yes, I'm blaming the internet. I sit waiting to pounce at 10am exactly, green checks are everywhere and I get excited. I click whichever one I can first (happens to be an 8:10pm for next Wednesday) sorry someone already booked it the screen says. I then proceed to click on 3 more green checks all with the same response! Clearly my internet is not fast enough or I would be reveling in my 8:10pm reservation. Oh well, there is always tomorrow.Momofuku Ko

So surpsisingly I missed the press late last week about the soon to open beer garden, Franklin Park, in Prospect Heights/Crown Heights Brooklyn. The bar will feature 800 sq. ft of indoor space with another 1200 sq. ft outside with picnic tables. A wonderful addition to the neighborhood and a short walk from the hopping Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights. Further info here, here and here. Seems like Prospect Heights is getting more attention than ever imagined and it doesn't seem to be phasing out. Other notes in the area include:A restaurant seems to be filling the old Sorrel space, Carlton between Prospect Place and St. Marks. Work inside has been going on the past few weeks with new light fixtures and paintClose to the aforementioned Franklin Park two new locations have opened, 95 South a sports baresque spot with BBQ and Abigail's a low-key bar/lounge serving foodPlan B on Vanderbilt is likely opening this weekend. Word from a friend is that the owners said they have the liquor license in hand.As reported in another posting, the country western bar, by the owners of Beast on Vanderbilt, is showing signs of progress. The building which was renovated from top to bottom is looking good and is likely a few months away from offering hush puppies and cheap beer.

Just when it seemed 7th Avenue in Park Slope was dying off, Barrio, a new Mexican restaurant fills the old Tempo Presto space on the corner of 7th Ave and 3rd Street. I'm setting my expectations pretty high for this place as it's owned by Spencer Rothschild who owns part of Calle Ocho, BLT Prime and Django in Manhattan. Expect \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices. Further detail and pictures at Brownstoner (pictures courtesy of Brownstoner).

The 2nd Annual Cook.Eat.Drink.Live Festival will take its place in NYC again this Fall on Pier 94. From November 7th throught the 9th, New Yorkers will be allowed to sample delicious cuisine, a mutlitude of beverages and witness demo's from some of the cities top chefs. More details to come, including ticket prices (which started off at an absurd price last year). Included is a picture from last years event, a quite memorable one in my opinion.Update: I spoke to someone working on the event and they informed me tickets will be priced at $75 a day (Friday, Saturday or Sunday) with packages available for the full weekend also available. This is a far cry from the $300+ it was to attend when tickets first went on sale last year.

Starting this evening, I'm going to begin to offer a new \"service\" of sorts on the site and through e-mail. I've always been offering up restaurant suggestions to friends, family and acquaintances for dining throughout the city and areas of Brooklyn, well moving forward that advice is open to all. Rather than scouring the blogs, magazines and restaurant directories just send me a quick note with the following criteria filled out:1. What areas of the city are you looking to dine in? (ex. North of 14th, Park Slope or LES, etc.)2. What is your price situation? Is price an object? Do you only have $10 a person? Let me know.3. Is there any food or cuisine you most certainly will not eat? Last thing I want to do is recommend Thai food if you despise that cuisine.4. When will you be dining? Important to know, because you may need reservations, or may not be able to get any depending on the day of your plans.5. Any misc. items that are important. Planning on drinking? Prefer very dark restaurants so you can't see your dining party? Really just want dessert and no meal? Anything that would be unique or important for me to know.Shortly after seeing the requests I will get back to you, though you must understand that there will be limitations. For instance, if you send me a request at 2am I won't get right back to you. Plus, I do work and will be away for business every now and again, but don't let that deter you. Trust me, this will be easier than trying to book a table at Momofuku Ko by far.

Saturday evening I dined at one of my favorite local spots, Flatbush Farm and indulged in the usual artichoke dip among other things. I especially like the Farm's version of artichoke dip because of the generous chunks of artichoke hearts mixed within the creamy, cheesy dip. It was a simple luxury, being able to walk a block or so to order up a bowl of dip and a pint, but I figured why not create this at home. Without referencing a recipe it was clear there were a few main ingredients I needed: artichoke hearts, cream, two kinds of cheese, and a bit of pepper. Beyond that it was a pure guess, and it seemed to work. Some may argue canned artichoke's are not the way to go, but for the sake of time and more importantly money a can will do just fine. Just don't buy marinated artichoke hearts as they are even more vinegary and oily than you would ever want for this dip. Other than that, the cheese is also in the hands of the beholder or cook in this case, I recommend a Gruyere and some cheddar, but a fontina, or parmigiano reggiano would work nicely as well.Artichoke hearts - 1 can, not the marinated kind1/4 cup of cream - less if you like the dip less creamysalt and pepperParsley - teaspoon of dried, small bunch of fresh if available1 cup grated cheese - Gruyere preferably and a couple of tablespoons grated cheddar (yellow for color)Freshly grated nutmeg - teaspoonCumin - dashTablespoon of olive oilOven proof dish1. Preheat oven to 450F2. Cut up artichoke hearts coarsely leaving good sized chunks if preferred3. Put all ingredients into a small bowl and mix with artichokes leaving a small handful of cheese to the side4. Pour artichoke mix into the oven proof dish and top with cheese and another twist of fresh cracked pepper5. Let the dip cook in the oven for about 15 minutes of until cheese is fairly melted and then place in broiler until cheese if slightly browned6. Carefully remove from dish and serve with your choice of bread, flatbread or crackers.Try a variation of cheese if you'd like or even blending the artichoke mixture up if you prefer a creamy dip.

The weekend brought yet another peek into what Spring will be, warm weather, shorts, the sun beating down on you in the greenmarkets. A wonderful feeling, and then of course we were brought back to reality with imposing rain clouds which blotted out the sun all every few hours all weekend. Regardless, Spring is here, it may just be taking sometime to fully settle in. This weekend I experimented with a few new dishes. Lately it's been my goal to recreate dishes I taste in restaurants without searching for a recipe. Not only is it a palate test, but it also tests my familiarity with certain ingredients.First off , I chose to break out one of my favorite kitchen tools, the mandolin, and make an potato au gratin. I got this at Bowery Kitchen Supplies in Chelsea Market, but you can get one on Amazon for a low cost. I would be pairing this with an Asian marinated chicken thighs, wings and legs (soy, honey, Chinese five spice, Siracha, rice vinegar and ponzu) which I cooked under a brick in a cast iron pan for a crisp skin. Considering my protein was Asian influenced I thought back to an au gratin I had at Park Slope restaurant Long Tan, it was an au gratin paired with a Thai seasoned hanger steak. My goal was a creamy inside crusty topped dish that would work with the seasonings of the chicken. I looked to my Chinese five spice, some fresh nutmeg and steered clear of olive oil and butters as much as possible. The result was delicious, and my only recommendation would be to use a shallow pan, mine was almost 2 inches deep. Recipe below (for 2):2 large Russet Potatoes - thinly sliced with a mandolin4 tablespoons of heavy creamgrated cheese - recommend a cheddar or gruyere depending on preferencefreshly grated nutmegChinese five spice powder - generous pinchsaltpepperdash of cuminsmall dab of butter to coat the baking dishsmall baking dishbasting brushmandolin1. Put the oven on 425F to preheat while prepping the dish.2. Put all the ingredients, but the butter, in a small bowl and whisk together, prep the baking dish by coating it with the small dab of butter making sure all sides are coated well, this will help the potatoes from sticking and will give it a little crust.3. Thinly slice the potatoes, length or width wise is up to you, and then begin to layer them in the pan making sure they overlap and ultimately building up the sides as well till you get a flat top.4. Every few layers bast the potatoes with the cream mixture coating generously.5. When complete pour remaining liquid as desired on the potatoes and with a generous sprinkle of cheese.6. Bake for about 30 minutes and finish under the broiler for another 5 depending on the level of desired crispiness. Let sit for a few minutes then cut and serve.

Restaurant Review: The Kitchen Counter @ Beacon

***CONTENT
The Kitchen Counter @ Beacon is a rare type of dining experience. A massive, midtown restaurant catering to the business crowd and tourists, it is hard to imagine having an intimate mutli-course meal with the chef. It's that rarity and experience that brought the idea of The Kitchen Counter (TKC) first into Chef Waldy Malouf's mind. An up close and personal dinner with six guests watching every move of a kitchen dishing out potentially hundreds of covers a night. Launched in the Fall of 2007, TKC offers diners an experience not forgotten at a shocking price. 12-courses, six drink pairings and service that makes you feel special or elite only offered four times a month; meaning only 24 people experience this every month. Now that I've gotten your attention let's discuss the meal. What follows is a detailed description of each course, so if you have time to read continue, if not bookmark this for later in your day.The night begins with a gathering near the front of the restaurant in a \"quiet\" corner. All 6 guests, who may or may not know each other, are served a Smoking Kir Royale, a champagne cocktail with a small drop of dry ice. The dry ice adds a theatrical element to the drink and it also tastes quiet delicious. It is a nice compliment to the first bite of food of the night, Tarragon Lobster Fritters served on a small metal stand. Very lightly fried in a delicious tempura like batter and served with a sherry and soy dipping sauce, the fritters were good, though I found the lobster overly tough. After finishing our small bites we were escorted through the restaurant down into the pit, the area of the restaurant where the kitchen is visible. Awaiting our group was a table for six facing the kitchen. A fresh raw radish placed on a bed of pins was on our plates. We were instructed to dip it into the seasoned butter it was served with, \"just like they do in French bistro's\" exclaimed Chef Malouf.Our menus were at each place setting and they outlined our evening step by step and bite by bite. It was daunting, even to the hungriest of diners (myself), but drool worthy. Our, second course was a beautiful slice of Wild Mushroom Pizza served on a small wooden block. Red onion, parsley and three cheeses rounded out the pizza ingredients. A very nice pizza, not amazing by any means, but a good start. It was complimented by a few shot glasses of Leffe Blond Ale, a Belgian ale I very much enjoy. Shortly after our pizza dishes were cleared a dish of oysters was presented to us. Each diner recieved 2 gorgeous fragrant Roasted Oysters with shallots. This was the first of two times where the Chef warned us that we could burn ourselves, the oysters were served on a bed of coarse salt in a small cast iron pan. Not being a fan of oysters in the past this dish blew me away. The flavors of the shallots, mignonette, and herbs worked perfectly with the oyster which had a wonderful woodsy flavor from the wood-fired oven. I made sure to clean the shells as best as possible and of course chase the dish with another shot of the Leffe.Moving onto our now fourth course, our server began by pouring us all a glass of Grenache Blanc, a crisp and slightly fruity white from Spain. This wine would go perfectly with our enormous Seared Scallop rubbed with chipotle and placed on a fava bean puree with pea shoots. Possibly the largest scallop I've ever eaten, I made sure to enjoy every bite and went so far as to cut the scallop into six succulent bites. The chipotle did not overpower the scallop as I initially feared, but added a very appropriate depth and was balanced well with the fava bean puree, which though good was a little on the salty side. With four small courses down, the food began to add up a little, if only to warn you of what was to come.Emerging from the oven was a smoker accompanied by a very pungent applewood smell. This was likely to be our next course, Hot Smoked Wild Bass in Corn Husks. An application that the Chef had used prior, but with different fish and tastes, I had heard good things about this dish. If a dish was merely judged on it's fragrant aromas this dish would be getting 5-stars. Taste wise the dish was very good, not groundbreaking, but the lemon, fennel and applewood worked well with the wild bass without completely overpowering it. Our Granache Blanc was still being served with this course and helped cut through the heavy smokiness of the fish. At this point I find it important to note, Chef Malouf not only presented us with the dish, but cut the corn husks, described the smoking process and even went to far as to discuss how the fish had previously been smoked (in the wood-fired oven) and that this was the first time they were using the stainless steel smoker for this course. He then happily poured an aromatic broth over the top of the fishFinally at the mid-point of the evening, we were presented with our sixth course, a small bed of Tagliatelle with Morels, Peas and Cream, this was my least favorite dish of the evening. Excited about this very Spring dish, I was disappointed that the wonderful morel taste was hidden behind the creamy watery sauce. This was the first time they had served this dish on the menu, and considering it was the only dish not finished by many diners, I hope they opt to remove it. Poured with this dish was a Toad Hall Pinot Noir, a light, somewhat fruity wine, but a little on the bland side in my opinion.Referencing back to the menu I found we were finally upon the meat and poultry section of the menu. Squab with Rhbuarb, Lentils and Baby Carrots was a beautiful dish. Cooked medium rare, the squab rested on roasted rhubarb and delicious baby carrots while a balsamic reduction was poured on top. A small drumstick and wing were also included and had been cooked to a necessary well done. An overall successful dish, I was disappointed with the lack of lentils (I only had 6-8 baby lentils) and found the drumstick and wing too tough and having more visual appeal than taste appeal. At this point we were notified that intermission had begun, a five minute period to gather your thoughts, smoke a cigarette or simply take a walk around the restaurant before diving into the homestretch, and the most indulgent of the courses.Getting back from the short break I was filled with anticipation for our next course, Bone Marrow with Horseradish and Garlic Toast. In my opinion, one of the more indulgent and delicious things available, bone marrow is not necessarily loved by all. The mere concept of bone marrow may be unappealing, but once you look beyond the large six inch split bone in front of you and actually dig in you will be a believer. Rich, beefy, salty, the dish was excellent. The Chef grated some superbly fresh horseradish on top adding a little kick that rounded out the dish. It was also served with two pieces of garlic toast per person as a serving vessel and for texture. Our wine pairing was a 2001 Barolo from Cascina Adelaide, bold yet smooth with a nice cherry undertone. I could have stopped here and been content with my meal. Not full, but comfortable. The meal had been very good with only a few low's. Of course this was only course number seven, so not only do you have to prepare to keep going physically, but also mentally. This was dangerous and delicious territory.Short ribs are perhaps one of my favorite foods. It was brought to my attention recently, that if short ribs are on the menu I generally gravitate to them and will order them in some shape or form. Well, fitting that TKC's 9th course was BBQ Braised Short Ribs with Foie Gras and Grits. From the description it is clearly going to be a heavy, course to say the least. A tender short rib topped with a slab of foie gras (in my case two as my dining companion did not want hers) on top of creamy grits all smothered (in a good way) in a bbq sauce made from the braising liquid. Considering my love of short ribs I may have set the bar too high for this course. It was good, very good to be exact, but not amazing, and I almost could have done without it in order to save room for the following courses, however, I did savor it and clean my plate. At this point we had actually finished the Barolo and demanded something more to drink, in a peaceful friendly way, and our server quickly obliged. Running to the main bar he grabbed another bottle of wine and proceeded to pour everyone a generous glass. Unfortunately the name escapes me, but it was an earthy red, heavier than the barolo and of course being complimentary made it even more enjoyable.So far the entire meal there had been some level of awe or wow factor incorporated into the plating or presentation of our dishes. The Smoking Kir Royale, the delicate dismantling of the corn husks for the wild bass, well the ante was upped on this next dish. Kobe Beef on a Hot Stone, not only resulted in a group sigh, but also perked everyone up from their inevitable food coma's. Traditionally a Japanese method of cooking kobe beef, mind you this was real kobe from Japan, a stone is heated thoroughly and then the beef is placed on it to sizzle and cook. It was suggested that we let the meat sear and then eat it while still very rare, all the while being careful not to burn ourselves (this was the second time in the meal we were warned about previously). The beef had been laid out on a brick of Himilayan rock salt and sprinkled with fresh pepper. You could see the fat melting on the stone as the beef cooked and then upon eating it the piece melted in your mouth. Luxurious, beefy, salty, it was everything good about beef and then some. Fortunately, everyone is served two slices and I was allowed to repeat the process this time cooking the beef to an even more rare state. The dish was accompanied by a small jicama salad with hot mustard which I steered clear of so the beef taste could linger longer.At this point I was full, the food had been very good, the wine excellent and the whole experience memorable. However, we still had two courses left, two dessert courses. To get us started we were served, in gorgeous thick chilled glass bowls, Quark Sorbet with Roasted Strawberries and Mint. An interesting dish and more of a palate cleanser than anything, it was good, but not memorable. The idea of roasted strawberries was intriguing, but ultimately it just resulted in a mushy strawberry core. Our last course however ended on a high note. A Chocolate Souffle with Smoked Vanilla Ice Cream not only was visually stunning, but was a wonderful last bite of the evening. The souffle itself towered over it's ramekin and was cut open for a chocolate sauce of some kind to be poured in. It looked delicious, but it was the smoked vanilla ice cream that was the star. Chef Malouf roasts vanilla beans in his wood-fired oven and then infuses ice cream with the vanilla finishing the scoop off with a sprinkle of smoked vanilla powder. This was the best part of the dessert and I could have eaten this without the addition of the overly soggy souffle. All of the dessert was paired with a very nice and light Muscat from Torbeck in Australia. It was a sweet, but not overpowering and went down very smooth and light.Looking back on the evening it was enough food for two people to finish easily, but with smart planning, i.e. a light breakfast and lunch prior, a single person can finish all 12-courses without major stomach problems. It is an opportunity for indulgence. A celebration of high-end ingredients and how they make us feel. Interaction with a well-run kitchen by a celebrated chef does not come easily, here it is a show for the diner. Sit back relax and enjoy, your movie screen is a kitchen, your popcorn and sodas replaced by sizzling slices of kobe beef and earthy barolo's. Two to three hours of entertainment, that while costing more than a night at the movies ($109/person all-inclusive), it certainly is more entertaining.The Kitchen Counter Menu and Small Plates Menu:Beacon offers The Kitchen Counter on Thursdays only at 7pm and has a dedicated reservation line, 212.332.0508 (different than the main number). Chef Malouf does offer a small plates menu during normal hours and seating at the counter, but you should not expect the same experience. Moving forward if you do want to dine at TKC on a different day than Thursday it is possible if you reserve all six seats per Chef Malouf.25 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019, 212.332.0508, Reservations - Required, Price - Expensive ($109/person including tax, tip and drinks)

Something I've vowed to do since the beginning of this blog is finally around the corner. After years of compiling recipes and corresponding pictures I will begin posting recipes this weekend. Ranging from the indulgent Smoked Mozzarella Baked Penne, to the more heart healthy Baked Flounder with Golden Beets. Any feedback, or suggestions on the recipes is always appreciated and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

Watching the clock right now in eager anticipation of my dinner at the Kitchen Counter @ Beacon. Tonight my months of waiting finally come to fruition. I prepared myself by saving some cash every month and also avoiding a large lunch today. My only concern is setting the bar too high, but I will do my best to go into the meal with a completely open and clear mind. This will be easier considering the new Spring menu kicks off tonight so none of the dishes have been reported or blogged about previously. I may also break one of my rules of photography at a restaurant tonight. I generally find it somewhat rude and mood breaking, but tonight it may be necessary. With so few photographs of the food, and an opportunity to share a new menu with everyone I almost feel obligated to. Certainly there will be a lengthy and thorough review, I mean how could a 12-course meal with 6-course drink pairing not be deserving of a detailed, long review? Exactly.Update: I was unable to take pictures during dinner, not that there was a rule at the restaurant, but it just felt so unnecessary and rude. I can describe the dishes in detail and image are also available from others diners experiences late last year: http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=109409

We all know Murray's Cheeseshop for their delectable assortment of cheeses from around the world. Some may even know of their extensive fresh pasta and characuterie, but there is more. Murray's offers absolutely delicious sandwiches. Made with cheese from in-store, bread from Amy's or Grandaisy's and an including such fillings as housemade meatloaf, Niman Ranch pastrami, and paperthin prosciutto these sandwiches are a great lunch option. Priced between $6.95 and $7.95 you won't find a much better deal in the area for something of this caliber. As I'm writing this I'm enjoying a very good sized meatloaf sandwich with fresh mozzarella. Trust me you won't settle for a plain old turkey sandwich ever again.

This weekend brought some delicious eats due in part to the Green Market at Grand Army Plaza. Saturday morning as the temperature continued to rise into the 50's, I took a stroll to Grand Army Plaza. Twice as many vendors as last week, a good sign of things to come. Strolling along the line for fish was as long as ever, and the always popular Turkey sausage at DiPaolo's was sizzling on their portable propane grill. With a small sirloin steak in the fridge I saw a perfect opportunity to create a simple juicy steak sandwich. I had marinated the steak in some balsamic vinegar, olive oil, fresh black pepper and thyme and just need the rest of the ingredients. A perfect peasant bread ($3) would yield me a few sandwiches beyond today's steak sandwich. A small bag of mixed greens priced at $12.00 a lb, I only need $1's worth, and would add a nice bitterness and would work well with the French swiss I had purchased the previous week. Rounding out my purchase, DiPaolo's Sweet Turkey Sausage, priced moderately at $6.49 a lb, I picked up a lb and a half for later use in the week.Now to assemble the Steak Sandwich you would only need a few ingredients:Small Sirloin or Top Round SteakSalt and PepperButterOlive OilPeasant Bread or CiabattaA French Swiss or Farmhouse CheddarMixed Greens or ArugulaHerb Mayonnaise (mayonnaise, parsley, lemon, garlic powder, salt, pepper)Searing the steak quickly in a cast iron pan or heavy stainless steel pan to create a nice crust is key. Make sure to season the steak liberally with salt and pepper and if you choose to marinate it beforehand pat it dry with a paper towel. Afterwards let the steak finish up in the broiler flipping once and putting a small dab of butter in the pan. Once the steak is cooked let is sit and rest before slicing it thin at an angle against the grain. While waiting for the steak to settle, cut two slices of the bread and one one side layer the thinly sliced cheese and place in the toaster. After toasting, coat the plain side of bread with the herb mayonnaise and place the greens on top. After slicing the steak place the pieces ontop of the greens and then close up the sandwich and cut if desired. Serve with additional mayonnaise for dipping if needed.Picture to come....

I love Thai food. I also acknowledge that there are many mediocre Thai restaurants throughout NYC and the boroughs. I don't generally order pad Thai anymore, but Pad See Yue (spelling varies), a good curry, and some quality appetizers are key. My problem with many Thai restaurants or takeout spots is that the food doesn't lack any depth of flavor. Either the spice overpowers everything else or the sweetness of a peanut sauce controls the dish. The great thing about Thai food is that you can taste the result of chili paste, peanuts, bean sprouts, ginger and more all together and separately. Song on 5th Avenue in Brooklyn produces dishes that generally fit this criteria.Initially I walked into Song feeling a little out of place. The decor is not my thing, a little industrial chic mixed with dark lighting, concrete colorless floors and a DJ. The crowd is a mix of couples, friends and some families all the more intriguing due to the nightclub like interior. I push on and walk past the bar, I am here for the food, not for the decor or music. The menu is relatively large, divided simply into appetizers, soups/salads, curry's, entrees and rice based dishes. A small menu of specials also sits at the bar and generally is revised every month or so. I started off with some Nuur Satay or beef satay, the simple skewered and grilled beef brushed with a peanut sauce and placed next to a cucumber and red onion salad. The dish was good, not the best satay I have ever eaten, but better than average and only $3.95. Next my table shared the house salad with the typical peanut sauce dressing, but this was a very nice rendition of the dressing. Nothing complicated, but fresh and not overpowering. A special of the catfish spring roll was delivered to the table, nice flavor and crisp vegetables, but again nothing spectacular. All things considered the meal did start off well, above average to very good appetizers made better since they were all under $3.95 a dish.Moving into our entrees we were presented with an enormous plate of chicken fried rice full of vegetables. At a more than reasonable $5.50 this portion could easily serve 4 diners with the potential for leftovers. Very nicely seasoned, it is one of the better fried rice dishes in the neighborhood. I went to my staple next, Pad See Yue (beef with broad rice noodles and chinese broccoli in a sweet soy sauce, and I was quite pleased. In my opinion a good Thai restaurant should be able to produce a top notch Pad See Yue, Song's was fantastic though a little sweet on some return occasions. The last dish was Gai Kraprow, chicken with basil and chili sauce with an assortment of vegetables. The aroma of this dish was intoxicating. Yes, taste is of course the most important aspect of food, but when something smells this good you take advantage and savor it. Each entree topped out around $8, which considering the portion size and quality of food is a steal.With all the money you're saving on food don't hesitate to order some drinks. Song has a full bar, a variety of beers and a handful of wines by the glass and bottle. More importantly, don't let the decor take away from your experience. Is it the best Thai food in the NYC area? No, not at all. However, it is very reasonably priced, very good Thai restaurant. Watch as the fires flare up from the woks in the kitchen, some searing allows for a clear view of the kitchen as entertainment. When it warms up take a trip outside and dine in the charming little garden, my favorite place to eat. Just know you don't need to wait behind a velvet rope or dress to impress, the club-like decor is merely an afterthought once you taste the food. 295 Fifth Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11215, 718-965-1108, Reservations - Recommended for large groups, Price - Inexpensive ($10-$25/person)

Restaurant Review: Flatbush Farm

***CONTENT
Sandwiched between Park Slope and Prospect Heights, Flatbush Farm is an all day dining destination. With a seasonal menu and an emphasis on local ingredients (produce from Satar Farms Long Island, potatoes from Stone Ridge Orchard in Upstate NY, and more) it is a great compliment to the already busy and every-changing dining scene in the area. With a rustic theme throughout the restaurant and the adjacent bar, Bar(n). The dining room offers a somewhat lit setting with a small bar jutting out in the middle of the long rectangular space. The bar(n), where I actually prefer to dine, is much more bar, but offers dimmer lighting, wooden tables and a more friendly and noisy environment. The garden, huge in size, offers a great space for drinks or meals once the weather heats up.Offering a diverse brunch menu of Toad in a Hole, Buckwheat Pancakes with Vanilla Maple Syrup and Smoked Duck Club Sandwich to name a few. Portions vary, so you may order up a side to really keep yourself full. For meals later in the day, you can find starters such as Pan-Fried Chicken Livers or Spatzle with Wild Mushrooms. Entrees range from Roast Duck with Braised Red Cabbage and Pureed Sweet Potatoes to a tender and juicy French Dip Horseradish Cream and a side of fries. The latter being one of my favorite meals to eat in the area and perhaps one of the better French Dips I have ever had. Although it's a weird menu system, there is also a bar menu, which can be ordered in the restaurant and is available till around 2am. Here you can order addictive artichoke dip that is cheesy with the right amount of briny bite from the artichokes. For those looking for a comfort meal order up the mac and cheese for a blast back to the days of Velveeta, but much much better. Too full for dessert, but promising to indulge next time, the offerings include chocolate bread pudding some days, cream cheese mouse, and other days molten chocolate cake.Without missing a beat, the wine and cocktail list delivers with some affordable reds and whites (bottles ranging from $24-70 and glasses starting at $6). With wines from around the world, plus a few organic options it will be easy to find something that suits your taste. If you're a beer drinker then settle in, you may be here for awhile. A handful of rotating beers on tap, Sixpoint and Victory being my favorites, as well as 16 bottled beers from the ever popular Miller High Life to one of my favorites Hitachino Nest's White Ale. A variety of cocktails are also available, but wine and beer are my recommendations as the best bang for your buck.Not everything is perfect as there are some service issues, slow and not always very attentive, and the food can be inconsistent depending on what you get. It may not be the best place for a quiet romantic meal or a place where you have limited time to dine, but overall Flatbush Farm is a great casual dining destination or simply a place to grab a drink (or two). Don't miss their BBQ's where you can find Lamb and Venison Sausage, Spareribs, Oysters and Sixpoint Craft Ale's; generally the last Sunday of every month, but varries due to weather.76 Saint Marks Ave, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 622-3276, Reservations - Not Necessary, Price - Moderate ($20-$35/person)

Restaurant Review: 'ino

***CONTENT
Ah 'ino, the kings of the panini sandwich here in NYC. Not recently opened by any means nor an undiscovered gem, but definitely worthy of discussion and in this case praise. I dined at 'ino during lunch hours and the dinner rush and one thing was apparent, the paninis are always good and the restaurant is always crowded.With all of the choices on the menu I found it difficult to just choose one so on numerous occasions I went for the Quattro Panini , a great option where you can choose four paninis to sample for only $10. My standby is the Three Cheese which comes with crotonese, cacio, grana and truffle oil. The crisped bread goes perfectly with the melted saltiness of the cheese and the truffle oil adds a nice earthiness and depth of flavor without being overpowering. I am also quite fond of the Bresaola, Asparagus and Pecorino Peppato and Prosciutto and the Mozzarella and Tomato, both offering different flavor combinations, but always hitting the spot. A few paninis I thought missed the mark such as the Roasted Vegetables and Goat Cheese as well as the Artichoke, Fennel and Fontina. It is not that these paninis were especially bad, but rather many steps below their counterparts lacking the necessary flavors and textures you would expect here.Beyond panini's there are a variety of bruschette creations on the menu. For $3 you get one single piece, but it is generally pilled high with such toppings as butternut squash and asiago or white beans, tomato and basil. These are clear standouts along with the asparagus, truffle oil and parmesan and the goat cheese and fennel fronds. In this instance the bread works as a perfect vessel for this generally powerful flavors as well as the necessary crunch.'ino offers Tramezzini's as well which are Italian \"tea sandwiches\" or crustless sandwiches generally served on sliced bread. Salads and soups are also popular options are their are specials which rotate every few weeks, recently there was Jerusalem artichoke soup finish with fingerling potatoes.The experience of 'ino is not limited to it's top quality paninis, but also the extensive wine offerings. A double-sided list of reds and whites from throughout Italy helps transport you even further forgetting your small surroundings and the hustle and bustle feet away on 6th Avenue. Whether you are sitting at the bar or one of the handful of tables servers are more than willing to offer suggestions and tasting of any of their wines. For those who would prefer a beer, there is a short list of bottled beer as well as Brooklyn Lager on tap.With all the food and wine being so approachable, affordable and most importantly delicious it's almost irrelevant that the entire restaurant is the size of some studios around the city, if not smaller. With a kitchen the size of some cubicle's its hard to believe they are able to keep up with the orders and crowd, but the restaurant (which opened in 1998) values its simplistic approach and has mastered it quite well. As a word of advice, expect a wait so either call ahead for an update or be prepared to have a drink at the bar, during peak times waits can exceed one hour.21 Bedford St., New York, NY 10012, nr. Downing St., 212-989-5769, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($10 - $20/person)

***CONTENT
Otto offers diner a chance to experience Mario Batali's food without the exorbitant (but sometimes reasonable) prices of Lupa, Babbo and of course Del Posto. Reservations are not easy to get, but they are attainable if you plan properly. The food here is not your average spaghetti and meatballs, nor is it your average thing crust Neapolitan pizza. Cheese plates with lavender honey, flavored olive oils and other such dipping sauces are a great start.The pizza is flavorful, though the crust goes soggy if you let it sit long. I recommend the four cheese or the prosciutto pizza. Pasta is cooked very al dente (too al dente for some people's tastes) but covered in sauces ranging from puttanesca to pesto or just a simple primavera like sauce. Batali loves smoked meats so you will find a wide range of Italian meats from simple salami to head cheese for the more adventurous.Wines are all Italian with moderately priced glasses and bottles and also some over the top pricing as well. The desserts are some of the finer options on the menu. Gelato's such as olive oil and hazelnut are irresistible with other standard chocolate and vanilla flavors being distance second choices. The olive oil is actually topped with sea salt adding a wonderful saltiness to a unique and refreshing dish. If you haven't tried it please do for your own good. The restaurant is great for groups, but not recommended for anything intimate. The volume in this place gets out of hand and you will find yourself yelling to your dining companion multiple times if you're not careful. The front wine/bar area allows for groups to sip some wine, eat some olives or cheese and wait for their table to appear on the train station apparatus at the front counter. Prices can be reasonable if you keep your drinking in check and service can be a little inconsistent. A nice option for visitors or a night out with friends.1 5th Ave, New York, NY 10003,(212) 995-9559,Reservations - Recommended,Pricing - Moderate ($20-$40/person)

Yes it's true, for one night Anthony Bourdain was in the back of the house cooking on line at Les Halles, his former stomping grounds (of 8 years ago). Now he is known as a celebrity on food, global food culture and also a highly regarded writer, but he hasn't cooked in some time. On the last episode of his show No Reservations, he steps into the kitchen where they are doing 300+ covers a night. Halfway through his good friend, and one of the best chefs in the city, Eric Ripert shows up to take on the grill station.Watch and enjoy, it's humbling and entertaining: Bourdain and Ripert cooking at Les Halles

also posted on FB....I love to watch AB on his shows... and have dined at les halles... I have not read any of his books or looked into his background... but I can't help but notice that les halles is a very plain and non-adventurous choice for a restaurant...has he offered any explanation for why he chose to stick with moules frites and not something more adventurous?

Although I don't know Bourdain personally I wouldn't let Les Halle's \"plainness\" reflect on him at all. He hasn't cooked there in 8 years and is now called \"a consulting chef\", meaning he probably makes some money off the restaurant, but doesn't really have anything to do with it. Remember, he's classically trained in French cooking. He may eat food from all over the world, but I wouldn't say he knows how to cook it all.

From a few sources (namely Brooklynian) it seems two new places are coming to Vanderbilt Ave. in Prospect Heights: Brooklyn Pizza Company next to Alieso and a new Italian place next to Le Gamin. Now what I don't understand is thy either one of these places would open? We've got Amorina, Franny's and then the mediocre Antonio's and Gino's and then plenty of Italian in Park Slope, not to mention Aliseo and Amorina up the block?Either someone didn't do their homework or someone thinks their food is just better. I sure wouldn't mind an Al Di La caliber spot closer to my home...Oh well, good business for the area at least. Any updates will be provided.

Although they are still in the works, I'm proud to say I've added to new features to the blog. First is a list of all places I've dined at in Manhattan and Brooklyn along with some useful information on my experiences. In conjunction with this I've created a map (thank you google maps) which gives a visual representation of all the places I've dined at (and can remember) across the country. Of course the labels are centralized around Manhattan and Brooklyn, but you will see a few other areas represented (CA, FL, MA, etc.). My goal is to ultimately add a small review to go along with all of the restaurants listed on the map.Links to both these tools can be found on the right side of the window.I hope you can find use in both of these new tools.Thanks,Aaron

Restaurant Review: Bar Stuzzichini

***CONTENT
Bar Stuzzinchini, which opened last year, offers what is becoming very popular food these days in NYC, Italian small plates. The Spanish tapas of a few years ago paved the way, but over the past year we've seen a handful of high-quality Italian small plates restaurants. Most recently Bar Stuzzichini was names \"Best Small Plates\" by NY Mag and was also on their best \"Cheap Eats\" list. With that aside, I've always wanted to dine here, but the Flatiron location has never been very convenient. Finally, I made my way here last Friday with a small party of three ready and willing to try anything and everything, but with high expectations.Fortunately, I had made reservations for 8:30 because the entryway was a mad house; a mix of hosts, customers, coats madness that started everything off on the wrong foot. There is a gorgeous long bar when you first enter the restaurant on the right side which is partitioned off from the dining area. Chalkboards have various wines and appertifs written on them and this area is constantly flooded with people. The entryway situation was difficult to forget as we were finally led to our table after waiting for 15 minutes; we walked by the open kitchen where meats and cheeses were carved and a number of tables before being led to a back corner table right next to the kitchen. Unfortunate about the kitchen being next to us, but fortunate because it was probably the quietest table in the house. From it's exterior Bar Stuzzichini does not appear that large, maybe seating 50, but upon entering you notice the restaurants is very very deep and can accommodate at least double that figure. Mahogany is the wood/color of choice here and the lighting is slightly dim and seems to be set for a rustic or bistro like feel. A little more wear and tear on the restaurant would do the overall look good as it still looks too fresh and \"out of the box\".Yearning to forget my poor first impressions we all scanned the menu with pleasure. I had read about the Stuzzichini Misti a selection of five small plates perfect for sharing, and a very reasonable $24, and looked forward to it. The small plates or misti consisted of a handful of Crostini, Verdure, Pesce, Formaggi, Friti and Salumi. Each dish varries in quantity, but is suitable to share with as many as three people, if you have anymore I would order double. My table selected the Baccala Fritti (salt cod fritter), Scamorze alla Brace (smokey grilled cheese), Carciofi (fried artichoke), Panelle (chickpea fritters) and Polpette (fried meatballs). Unsurprisingly the fried items are delicious with the artichoke and chickpea fritters being amazingly addictive. The salt cod fritters were probably the only one I would replace as it was just bland and paled in comparison to the other items.Next up we ordered the Crostini Misti (crostini sampler) which brought us one of each of the crostini's offered. Of the four the best was the Ricotta e Miele (Saffron Honey) with its sweet yet smokey flavor. The other three were forgettable.Knowing that would not be enough food for three people, we opted to split a pasta and chose theGnocchi all'Amatriciana (Gnocchi in red sauce with chili's and italian bacon). The dish was a great way to fill ourselves up, but seemed to fall short. The gnocchi, very small may I add, were not as light as I had expected and somewhat chewy. The sauce had a nice smokiness from the bacon and chili's, however, I would have preferred more of the fried artichoke at this point.Hoping to end on a high note, and also a little hungry, we decided to order three desserts: Crostada della Mela (baked apple tart), \"Mucca Marrone\" (a spin on a brown cow ice cream soda) and Cannolis The baked apple tart was very good, but would have been much better if it was hot. The cannoli's, served by the piece, were quite good and not overly sweet as has been the case with cannoli's I've had before. The brown cow arrived with a wonderful presentation, but in my opinion was hurt by the orange Pellegrino which was used. The orange flavor did not seem to work with the rich chocolatey carbonation.Bar Stuzzichini also offers an extensive wine list with glasses ranging from $9-16 and bottles starting in the high twenties. Beer is also available with a short list of three on tap and three bottled.From a hype standpoint, the food is quite good, but I will stick with the misti sampler next time. The service needs to be fixed, especially the front of the house. The disorganization and clutter, no matter how busy you may be, shouldn't be tolerated by the manager. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as they've likely seen more business due to the NY Mag write up a few weeks back, but a serious fix is needed. I'll go back, but not for some time, hopefully giving them a chance to figure things out.928 Broadway, nr. 21st St.; 212-780-5100, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person)

Restaurant Review: Tia Pol

***CONTENT
You don't need a plane ticket to Spain to sample some amazing, authentic tapas. The location is in the middle of nowhere near the corner of 23rd and 10th and if you're not careful you will walk right by it. The front of Tia Pol is a bar where many prefer to dine and also linger as they wait for tables. Beyond the bar are a handful of tables with only a few holding more than 2. If you have bad posture don't expect to improve it here as all the seats, except for one booth, are bar stools.I recommend starting your meal with a glass, or pitcher as I usually choose , of sangria and then dive into the extremely authentic menu. The patatas bravas (rough cut potatoes with spicy aioli and the Pimientos de Padrón (piquillo peppers in sea salt) are great to snack on and a perfect start to the meal. The patatas bravas, a staple at most tapas restaurants, as some of the best I've had, though on a recent trip they were a not as good as usual. As for the peppers, well they are as addictive as potato chips. Of course that mentality changes when you get surprised by the heat, every now and again one of the peppers will pack quite a punch and there is really no predicting it. Other favorites of mine include the croquetas de jamón (ham croquettes) Other more substantial dishes include succulent pinchos morunos (lamb skewers) afixed with french bread to sop up all the jucies and a unique and memorable chorizo con chocolate (chorizo and chocolate). Small slices of wonderful chorizo are placed atop a semi-sweet chocolate spread on top of a piece of French bread. The flavors change from spicy to sweet and ultimately merge together to create something I had never tried before, but vow to try many times again. For those of us looking to stay away from meat dishes I recommend the montadito de crema de habitas con (beyos fava bean puree covered with beyos cheese of toasted bread). The puree is piled high and offers a smooth, cooling change of pace to some of the spicier dishes. If you prefer to dine as if you are in Spain try to refrain from ordering all the dishes at once. Instead order 2-3 at a time to let yourself fully enjoy the meal, and also so you don't get overly stuffed. You shouldn't feel like you are in a rush, nor should you worry about the expense. The only dishes that break the bank are a handful of specials and only a few of them are recommended. Unlike many others who've reviewed Tia Pol I have never had a problem leaving hungry, nor have I ever been worried about being overcharged.Ordering drinks is a must, and I recommend splitting a pitcher of the house-made sangria which will produce about 6 total glasses as is well worth it. Other offerings are an all Spanish wine list as well as a handful of beers.When planning your visit to Tia Pol expect waits, on a recent Monday visit the wait was 30-45 minutes for a table of 2. Trying anything closer to the weekend will most definitely require hour or more waits and recommendations are not accepted for parties under 6. This can put a damper in your plans and it's my one big problem with Tia Pol. Even so, I plan to go back as often as possible for the atmosphere, the food, the drinks and to feel as if I'm back in Barcelona.205 10th Ave, New York, NY, 212) 675-8805, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($25-$35/person)

NY Mag just released their best of NY list with some wonderful incite, but also missing on a few in my opinion. Many of the restaurants they list as \"best of...\" are on my list of places to dine, but a few really stood out. I've included the links below as well as the pictures to emphasis the drool factor:Insieme: Best Lasagna. If you never heard of Insiemme, this picture below will make you want to sprint there. The photo is cheesy, indulgent and most of all absolutely delicious. I fortunately just found the recipe for this and will being taking a stab at re-creating this apparently perfect lasagna at home.El Quinto Pino: Best Uni/Low. Originally I thought it was difficult for Uni to be a lowbrow food, however, after thinking about it and seeing how El Quinto Pino (the newly opened sister restaurant to Tia Pol) creates their Uni Panini (pictured above) my thoughts changed. Having never been particularly fond of Uni I find it hard not to want to try this dish. Even if I don't like it it sure won't break the bank.Bar Stuzzichini: Best Small Plates. I've always wanted to try Bar Stuzichini since it burst onto the scene a few years back. The menu looks wonderful and I find ordering a handful of small plates one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had.The review by NY Mag further pushes me to the Brodway and 21st spot to try the carefully crafted dishes. Anthos: Best Un-Beef Burger: This lamb burger from Anthos looks fantastic and has all the accompaniments one would ever need for a burger. Michael Psilakis knows how to cook, there is no question about it, and creating this burger affirms that. See the picture below and get on the reservation line quickly.There were a few winners that I did not agree with:Aquavit: Best $48 All You Can Eat Swedish Sunday Brunch.Okay, so it may be one of the only, if not the only, Swedish restaurant in town offering an all you can eat brunch, but that doesn't mean it deserves being called out. Personally the hype behind Aquavit's Smörgåsbord brunch was just that, hype. Certain aspects of the meal were quite good and unique, but no one in my party of six found the meal memorable.I would have liked to see Market Table (possibly for \"Best Place to Get ___ and pick up some groceries) or Bocca di Bacco (best wine bar where all the employees actually speak Italian), but for the most part there were some good choices here. However, it's clear they are trying not to replicate previous year categories seeing as they are no rating the best Uni, Deviled Egg and even Weird Dessert.

Yes, you read that right. There will be a new outpost of the famed Shake Shack opening up. The new location will be on 77th and Columbus, where Jacques-Imo's used to be housed before their lease was increased. As the NY Post reports, the location will provide diners seating indoors so those cold days waiting in line for some may be numbered. No information on when the location will open could be found.

***CONTENT
I've been on a long hiatus due to massive amounts of work and being sick, of course at the same time. I feel it's only fitting that I enjoyed a nice lunch at Spring Street Natural in Soho yesterday where all natural ingredients are featured along with some unique vegetarian and vegan options. The restaurant is much larger than you would anticipate. With an open layout with massive amounts of natural light streaming in, the restaurant is a great place for a casual meal or even just a drink at the bar.The menu is well rounded even for lunch with a handful of appetizers, half a dozen or so salads, a selection of sandwiches, entrees and even stir-frys. You won't find any red meat on this menu, but chicken is quite abundant. If vegetables are your thing there are plenty of unique salads, grains and more. I was looking for something substantial and opted for the Chicken Burger with chipotle mayo and housemade fries. Of course it's not beef burger, but for a chicken burger it was good. It needed a little seasoning and was a little dry, but overall I'd order it again. Other dishes like Poached Salmon Salad with lentils offered all the greens you would need in a huge portion. The same could be said for the stir-frys. Service was prompt and very friendly.It may not be the best food in Soho, but if you're looking to go all natural in a casual, bright setting Spring Street Natural will please you.62 Spring Street, NY, NY 10012 (212) 966-0290, Reservations - Accepted/Not Required, Price - Moderate ($15 - $25/person)

Bar Review: Weather Up

***CONTENT
Lots of attention has been paid to Prospect Heights and Vanderbilt Ave. over the past few weeks. One of the reasons is the new \"speakeasy\" bar, Weather Up, with drinks created by the owners of Milk & Honey in the LES. Once seen as the ugly cousin of Park Slope, Prospect Heights is fast becoming and dining and drinking destination (as made clear in an earlier post of mine and by Time Out NY). While I generally focus on restaurants I found it important to speak to this gem of a bar.The trickiest part is not walking right by the bar, as it has no signs or any indication it is a bar. There is usually someone standing outside watching the door, but that's the extent of it. Entering the bar you are whisked to another age. Originally an old church, I felt as if the bar belonged in the 20's and that I should have been wearing a derby hat. Dim lighting, a gorgeously tiled ceiling (though somewhat odd) and a handful of patrons making it one of the more relaxing bar experiences I've ever had.Each drink is made with care and comes with a price tag to match, $11 for a cocktail. The master mixologists, more appropriate than bartenders, serve up unique, fresh and strong drinks adorned with caramelized ginger, orange peel and more. I opted for the Presbyterian, a bourbon based cocktail with club soda and ginger. Rounding out the drink was a long chunk of ice cut to fit into the Tom Collins glass. Other drinks are equally impressive and I plan to return to try them all. Other drinks are available, including wine by the glass (starting at $6) and beer on tap and in bottles (also starting at $6).Weather Up plans to have a finished 2nd floor, but more importantly garden this year. The garden is slated to be ready in the Spring, while the timetable for the 2nd floor was not clear. Lets just hope word doesn't spread too far about Weather Up because if they operate anything like Milk & Honey there certainly will be an effort to keep the relaxed vibe, likely limiting the amount of people in the bar at one time. Short update, my worst fear came true last night. I was turned away as the bar had reached maximum capacity at midnight. I was told it would be a 30min wait, completely unnecessary to get into any bar. I sure hope this won't become a trend.(589 Vanderbilt Ave between Bergen and Dean Sts, no phone yet), Price - Expensive ($11 a cocktail)

***CONTENT
More of a boutique of subtle Italian flavors and breads than a place to grab a slice. Amorina offers the charm of a small Italian pizzeria with its red checkered table cloths and family charm. It's also owned by the Ballerini family, who have been running Aliseo Osteria del Borgo across the street. Amorina's impressive menu pays great attention to detail and can speak to the varied flavor cravings of a sophisticated palate.My recommendation is the fennel, caramelized onion and olive pizza as well as the zucchini. The latter is a cheesy salty combination with pesto and a perfectly crisped crust. If you're looking for pizza topped with meat, look no further than the Prosciutto e Fichi, a prosciutto pie topped with fresh mozzarella, figs, thyme and parmigiano. Their pastas are equally appealing and also come with inventive and of course extremely fresh ingredients. The rigatoni with a mushroom cream sauce was scarily addictive. For desserts there are a few offerings with my favorite being the flourless chocolate cake.However, the highlights are the pizza so don't feel bad if you have no room for dessert. Credit cards are accepted and there used to be a BYOB policy with a $10 corkage fee. If you opt to purchase wine their, prices are moderate with carafe's under $20. Don't let the decor, or lack thereof, change your perception of the food or ambiance. The pizza will speak for itself.It's a neighborhood place where everyone is welcome. A small intimate meal with wine or a large group outing to catch up. Regardless of your parties intentions or size you will have a great, low-key meal that will keep you coming back for more. 624 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11238, Phone: 718-230-3030, Recommendations - Not Required, Price - Inexpensive - Moderate ($15 - $30)

...I just returned from the florist down the street and left chuckling to myself. Every flower store in the country has probably doubled their weekly profit in only an hour or so as all us men scamper home to get flowers. Valentines sure is an interesting holiday. My father always questioned it, \"why do I need a day to say I love my wife?!\" he would exclaim. Sweet, and also very true. Regardless, I've been suckered into it all and I will be dining out with the \"special\" Valentines Day menu at a special local restaurant. What a great day for restaurants as well. Prix fixed here, champagne meal there, all at premium prices. Some of the meals are most likely worth the premium price, but others are merely an excuse to charge that premium price. A complimentary bottle of champagne is a great offer, but if it is Andre then what kind of deal are you really getting (in fact you may be doing the restaurant a favor). When the dust clears and we wake to February 15th, it's likely major money has been spent, some have gotten lucky, maybe even engaged, but we have to be able to laugh at ourselves. Wearing red to work, standing in the 30 deep line for chocolate or flowers, paying premium prices for dinners that are finished with a cappuccino adorned with a heart shaped froth; it's all kind of comical don't you agree?Happy Valentines Day Everyone.

One of the few bars in the Prospect Heights area, Soda has a huge loyal fan base. Offering happy hour until 8pm every night (claiming the longest happy hour in Brooklyn) and great prices during other hours, it's hard not to love this bar. Whether you're stopping in for one of their delicious greasy burgers or a long night of drinking you can't go wrong here. With two sections, one with rock music at night, another with more alternative/trendy tunes and couches, plus an outdoor spot, you will find your niche.The food is great if you're thinking greasy. Burgers, onion rings, a BLT or even pirogies all with enough grease to cure your hangover or get you started for the night out. Sometimes the food is a little inconsistent, like when I asked for a burger medium and it came back bright pink and rare (I sent it back for a little more cooking). Other times I am ready to give Soda the juiciest burger award. Just don't expect perfection and you'll be fine.For drinks it's hard to mess up at all. A chalkboard on the wall lists all the wines available by glass, usually 4-5 reds and whites each, and the beer on tap changes quite regularly. With Bluepoint and Brooklyn Lager always on tap and an assortment of bottled beers even the pickiest beer drinks will find something.Though its generally pretty dark, too dark if you ask me especially if you're trying to eat, the neighborhood vibe combined with great music and fair prices makes this a local favorite of mine. 629 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, (212) 230-8393, Price - Inexpensive ($5-15/person)

***CONTENT
So in lieu of the recent article in TONY about Vanderbilt Ave. I thought it only fitting to post some of my earlier reviews, and new, regarding the dining and drinking destinations the neighborhood has to offer. Beast, one of my favorites on Vanderbilt is a neighborhood Spanish pub in a sense. A gothic inspired tapas bar with a neighborhood following. You'll find plenty tapas dishes, but they are most certainly bigger than what you'd find over in Manhattan. No complaints though as the prices are still very fair.Dishes such as flatbread with hummus are a must have and a great way to start the meal (update: the hummus has been replaced with a black bean hummus, possibly due to the season, but it is not as good). Other hits are Blue Point Lager-Braised Short Ribs, Citrus-Marinated Skirt Steak and Seared Diver Scallops (update: it you like polenta, in fact even if you don't, you must order the creamy polenta with blue cheese as it is beyond addictive). All provide a nice journey into Spanish cuisine that almost makes you forget you're in a Brooklyn bar for the most part. Specials can be wonderful like the Venison Loin offered, but do be careful. Some dishes are inconsistent to the point where I won't order them again, like the Sauteed Chorizo which was bursting with flavor one day then tasted like it had been drowned in rubbing alcohol the next.The menu is broken out, oddly, into \"Starters and Snacks\", \"Earth\", \"Land and Sky\" and \"Ocean\" making me think back to the days when Captain Planet was popular. Not to worry, it's not confusing, just strange, and that will go away after a few plates and a few pints. Speaking of drinks, the bar offers a nice variety of microbrews as well as a full bar and a fairly extensive wine list with bottles all under $40.Brunch offers great deals, and a can't miss burger with blue cheese potato salad and a thick slab of cheddar (my vote for best burger in the neighborhood). For the late night crowd happy hour starts at 11pm and goes for a few hours pricing drinks at a can't be beat $3. 638 Bergen St., Brooklyn, NY 11238, at Vanderbilt Ave., 718-399-6855, Pricing - Moderate ($20-30/person), Reservations- recommended for groups

Time Out NY reports that Vanderbilt Ave. in Prospect Heights is quickly becoming a hot spot for restaurateurs and bar operators. Many new storefronts can be seen popping up over the past few years and it is a sign of change for the neighborhood. This comes as no surprise being a resident of the area where I've seen the place change in just over a year. The one interesting thing, as many new bars and restaurants open there are still more hair stylists/dressers than one neighborhood ever needs.Check out the TONY article, and note they left off French Bistro/Cafe Le Gamin and The Usual, the neighborhood diner.TONY Vanderbilt Ave Story

Review: Di Fara's Pizzeria

Growing up in New York I've been privileged to enjoy some very good pizza. There are certain requirements for pizza in my eyes, and other New Yorkers, that follow you where ever you may grab a slice. A certain sauce to cheese ratio as well as a crisp crust worthy of folding and without drooping. Now walking into DiFara's it was hard not to have high expectations. It's been crowned best pizza in the city by magazines, newspapers, foodies and non-foodies for years. Dom Demarco has over 40 years experience so the pizza must be good, right? The lines must be justified. These are just a few questions I asked myself riding down to Midwood on the Q this past Saturday afternoon.I had planned my arrival to be between 2-3pm to avoid the crowds. I went hungry and eager. Sitting a stone's throw away from the Q is DiFara's. A run down looking corner pizza shop. The sign is old, the windows are old, it certainly looks its age (opened over 43 years ago). Walking in I am shocked, and pleased, to see a short line of only 5 people. I had a chance to get a pizza in less time than I expected (45-60min). There are unwritten rules to follow when \"dining/ordering\" at DiFara's. You go straight to the counter to place your order and you stand there until your pizza comes out of the oven. If you move (some purists may find this information secretive) your pizza may take longer. Dom and his son need to see you there to remember your order, whether you want to sit or not.Enough build up, now the pizza. I ordered a round pie with porcini mushrooms. The porcini's are canned and marinated, they're good, but not amazing. The pizza though was amazing. The cheeses melded together into a stable, but creamy texture not found on any other pizza. The crust was perfect, slightly charred, but crisp and thin. The sauce was not overpowering, but seasoned well and the pieces of canned tomato added a nice burst of flavor. Dom tops the pizza's before serving them with freshly grated Grana Padano (similar to Parmigiano Reggiano, but softer), Berio olive oil and fresh basil. Every bite was wonderful and memorable. I left stuffed, but fully satisfied. The pizza and two soda's cost me $32, not cheap by pizza standards, but if you consider the quality of the ingredients and the care Dom puts into every inch of the pizza it is well worth it.1424 Avenue J, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 258-1367, Price - Inexpensive-Moderate ($6 - $16/person), Reservations - Not Accepted

Did you know Food Network is doing a special based on Bon Appetit magazine's best restaurants in America? I think it will be on this weekend. I went through the whole list last night and this was one of 2 that were in NY. And I also said to Mike last night...I wonder if Aaron has been there and what he'll have to say about it...and here you go today. Looks like you read my mind...

Yeah, the pie was delicious. I was very happy to see all the toppings, but I have to admit, I'm happiest with the plain pie. The best burst of flavor and the easiest way to taste a true Di Fara pizza.

I finally made it to Al Di La, a jewel of a restaurant in Park Slope, and I can't wait till I can go again. All the talk about there always being a wait is true, but it's well worth it. We chose to dine at the small adjacent wine bar and waited about 40 minutes. The wait was made easier as we were quick to grab seats at the small bar (there can't be more than 7 seats) and ordered a wonderful Italian bottle of wine from a very cheery and helpful waitress. After making it to our small table in the back, again there are only about six 2 person tables, we were met by the same cheery waitress and placed our orders. A cheese plate featuring three cheeses: a nutty parmigiana reggiano, a smooth blue and an amazingly decadent cheese made from sheeps, cow and goats milk that was rich and creamy, called La Tur.Our main courses consisted of Casumzieei, ravioli stuffed with roasted beets and ricotta and covered in butter and poppy seeds, and Tagliattelle Al Ragu made with homemade pasta cooked to perfection and a creamy and meaty ragu. Both dishes were impeccable and some of the best pasta I've ever been fortunate to eat. And at only $11 and $13 respectably quite the bargain. Dessert was hard to pass up with the first option being Ricotta Fritters with homemade whip cream and chocolate sauce, a perfect indulgent end to our meal. Surprisingly all of this high quality food and wine would be expected to run you over $100, but this meal with tip was just a few dollars south of $100, a bargain in my book.Overall the atmosphere, food and service made for a intimate an leisurely dining experience that I highly recommend. Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes, but just grab a glass of wine to make the wait go quicker. Al Di La does not take reservations at either location.248 5th Ave, Brooklyn NY 11215, 718-636-8888, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person with wine), Reservations - Not Accepted

Marcus Samuelson's new restaurant, Merkato 55, opens today exposing New Yorkers to African cuisine on a grand scale. This meatpacking district newcomers will likely be a hit due to Samuelson's past success, some great PR folks and a impressive and delicious looking menu (though I don't know all the terms on it). For me the draw will be trying something brand new. Check out some pictures from NYmag.com

So as I mentioned a few weeks back, I had to undergo a procedure on my teeth and it was going to be restricting my eating. Well, I'm three weeks away from being able to eat anything I want and it is killing me. I never realized how much bread or crunchy foods I ate until now. No sandwiches, no bagels, any pizza needs to be cut with a knife and fork. Lots of noodles, rice and food cut into smaller pieces.I'm thinking that when I can finally get back to normal, i.e. eating anything and everything, I'll indulge in a wonderfully juicy large burger with some nice crispy french fries. Now just to plan where to eat. My top choices:1. Shake Shack - the double stack (a shack burger and shroom burger) with a side of fries of course2. Market Table - the burger is delicious and the fries are irresistible3. Burger Joint - While the fries are lacking I love the way the burger actually stays together, and it's delicious4. Corner Bistro - I can't think of a better place for a burger and a beer5. Stand - I've always wanted to try their burgersIf I do change my mind and opt for something other than a burger any suggestions would be welcome. Indulgent and big, thats the type of food I'm looking for here.Of course any place I do go will be followed with a glowing review most likely due to the situation.

***CONTENT
Recently opened, The Smith brings another dining option to the East Village/Union Square area. Located in the old Pizzeria Uno location it almost appears to be dated from the outside. Walking in the restaurant you'll find it is usually packed between 6-9pm which is a good sign. The dim lighting, white tiled floors and old (some nude) pictures on the walls create a welcoming vibe. The bar to the left of the entrance is not too large, but provides a nice view of the chalkboards scribbled with wines by the glass, mixed drinks (there are many) and beers on tap.The crowd, a mixed group of NYU students, teachers and neighborhood residents, seem at home as servers swing scalding hot platters of mac and cheese and burgers onto small tables.At first glance the menu seems to be upscale bar food, but dishes like lamb schnitzel, wild mushroom ravioli and vegetable bibimbap can't be found at your local watering hole. For some the dishes may seem out of place, but I think it's risky and commendable for The Smith to offer more than just burgers, wings and steaks. The menu is diverse, just like the neighborhood, and it surely allows for you to visit when certain cravings arise. Mac and cheese, an appetizer, arrives bubbly and slightly charred in a small cast-iron pan. A little more of the broiler would have been nice, but it's indulgent, crisp yet cheesy and very good. A steak salad arrives with beautiful chunks of steak, it looked like sirloin, cooked to a medium rare. The lamb schnitzel was a sizable and tender dish, though the accompanying smashed potatoes were a little too chunky and under seasoned. Desserts are on a separate menu, but sounded delectable; party cake ice cream sundae, banana bread pudding sundae and homemade jumbo chocolate chip cookies to name a few. Unfortunately, I was too full to indulge.With a great list of beers on tap, seven at $5, as well as bottles, mixed drinks and wine The Smith can also just be a drink destination.Although the food was not spectacular the overall experience was positive. Great decor and music combined with a friendly and fun loving staff and crowd make up for some of the shortcomings in the food. 55 Third Ave., nr. 11th St.; 212-420-9800, Price - Moderate ($20 - $30/person), Reservations - Recommended

Nice review! I went to The Smith when it first opened and ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi... wow! It was amazing! I had to go back with someone else and make them try it too. The other dishes that we ordered weren't spectacular but I agree, the decor is very neat - especially the bathroom. I posted two photos from The Smith on yummr.com that you can check out. The Ricotta Gnocchi is there, good stuff!

Stunning. The first word that comes to mind as you walk up the stairs and enter the main dining room. The room is airy and surrounded by windows on three sides providing views of the Hudson river, palisades, NYC and the George Washington Bridge. Beyond the views the room is setup to maximize the dining space while allowing the servers, and there are many, to seamlessly move in and around tables. One would not think this restaurant is in Yonkers, but this area of Yonkers is fighting the stigma the rest of the city has gained and the waterfront spot is no longer an eyesore. After scanning the view and restaurant for some time, I recommend making your way to the menu, as that is where Peter Kelly exceeds expectations. The menu offers a mix of Asian and European flavors that although very different can compliment each other creating unique dishes. Warm bread starts your meal (you get a choice of a flaky roll or a hard baguette). The wait staff is on hand to get drinks orders rather quickly, but they are patient and knowledgeable. A large wine list with moderately priced bottles as well as an assortment of wines by the glass is impressive, but the now onto the food. The menu offers appetizers, entrees and side dishes (desserts are featured on a separate menu. Perhaps one of my favorite new foods and of course my recommendation, the Short Rib and Foie Gras Ravioli with Truffle Butter. Talk about indulgent. This appetizer featured 4-5 handmade ravioli stuffed with moist and tender short ribs, a little dollop of foie gras and this earthy, addictive truffle butter. Each bite was fantastic and I made sure to mop up all the sauce with the bread.Other appetizers that were very good were the Salmon Belly and Seared Tuna Special. For the main course I was lucky to sample 4 outstanding dishes. I personally ordered the grilled tuna with potato puree, carmalized soy, Chinese broccoli and chickpea fries. This dish was a perfect follow up to my heavy and rich appetizer. The tuna was cooked perfectly with a nice sear on the outside and a soft melt in your mouth interior, plus carmalized soy added a depth of flavor not found with general bottled soy sauce. My favorite entree was not mine though, it was the crisped duck schnitzel with spaetzle and glazed turnips. Pounded and breaded duck cooked to perfection with a fantastic homemade spaetzle cooked with duck confit. The dish was hearty and showcased Kelly's international palate and technique. Finally the desserts. Again, without missing a step Kelly delivers here. We ordered four desserts, each with their own distinct flavor, each amazing. I ordered the Black and Brulee. When it was placed in front of me I thought it was too beautiful to eat, it was a work of art. An orange hardened sugar pedestal held up chocolate mousse topped with a layer of creme brulee, it was decadent and light at the same time. Another favorite dessert of mine was the insanely rich butterscotch pudding. Thick and somewhat reminiscent of cookie dough it was heavenly. Overall the meal could not have been better. The restaurant should have great success and hopefully it will. The only barrier is the area and the aforementioned stigma, but hopefully Peter Kelly and the other establishments nearby can fix that. If I had one complaint it would be that I did not get to tell Chef Kelly how good of a time I had here, however, many other people did as the chef walks around regularly to talk to the patrons. One final note, make sure you use the bathroom here. The bathroom provides ceiling to floor windows allowing city and Hudson River views not normally found in a bathroom. All around fantastic. I look forward to my return armed with my wallet (it's pricey) and an appetite (the portions are pretty big). 71 Water Grant St Yonkers, NY 10701, (914) 965-1111, Highly Recommended, Reservations - Highly Recommended

Rounding out the three day weekend I was fortunate to have lunch at Stanton Social with 20 of my family members. It was a great experience as we had the top floor fairly blocked off and all to ourselves. I've dined at Stanton Social before, in the evening, and it is a fun place. Playful twists on many international favorites. The food is not always amazing, but it's always fun with only a few items being complaint worthy.The meal would be family style with a wonderful list of options: Lox platters with a LES bakeries bagels and french onion soup dumplings started us off. Following this a plate of addictable potato pancakes and bland and unnecessary toast points topped with a mini omelet. Lobster rolls and Kobe beef sliders followed and quickly filled us all up. Last but not least, we indulged in Stanton's deliciously fresh donuts with caramel and raspberry sauces. Some of the best donuts I've ever had, you can't just have 1 or 2. A great meal to cap off the weekend, the best of all three actually. Drinks were a plenty as well as laughing, crying and plenty of picture taking moments.Shun Lee Palace: 155 E 55th St, New York, NY 10022, (212) 371-8844Food - Good, Price - Expensive, Recommended dish - Peking Duck, Reservations - Recommended, but not neccessaryVento Trattoria: 675 Hudson St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 699-2400 Food- OK, Price- Moderate/Expensive, Recommended Dish - anythingstandard and the drinks, Reservations - Recommended, but not neccessaryStanton Social: 99 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002, (212) 995-0099Food - Good/Very Good, Price - Moderate/Expensive, Recommended Dish -Kobe Beef Sliders, Lobster Rolls, Reservations - Highly Recommended

Day two of the family and food weekend consisted of the main event, the Bar Mitzvah and the reception which was at Vento in the Meatpacking District. Three floors where ours to peruse, party and eat for almost 6 hours. We began with cocktails and passed hors d'evours. I sampled at least one of everything:- Grilled shrimp with a lime and chili marinade - nothing special and room temperature- \"Kobe\" beef sliders with caramelized onions and cheddar - definitely not Kobe beef, but decent- Marscapone and mushroom cream topped crisped bread - great topping, poor bread selection- Risotto and cheese balls - risotto was decent, but the cheese seemed out of place and bland- Prosciutto on Toast - Nicely sliced prosciutto, but the toast was bland- Short Rib on phylo topped with cheddar - probably my favorite finger food, but I did not get the use of the cheddar cheese, it overpowered any taste the phylo had and could have easily been replaced with a light sauce- White bean soup - too much pepper and I didn't enjoy taking a shot of a thick soup at allAfter filling up on all of this, with only a few I truly enjoyed it was to the 2nd floor for lunch and the toasts. Lunch was filled with a lackluster assortment of small plates (meatballs, salads, fried buffala mozzarella, polenta fries) and followed by a selection of main courses. Not one of the main courses was very good, the best being a simple Chicken Milanese, the worst being a petite fillet that had too much wine in the wine sauce and was poorly cooked. By dessert we were all too full, but did indulge in some chocolate covered strawberries.Overall a poor showing, but understand it was a large party and that food had to be prepared for over 50 people. Not to make excuses, as too much wine in a wine reduction is inexcusable by a chef, but don't judge the place purely on a catering job. I would however be careful with some of the dishes you order and perhaps start with something safe before trying anything too exotic or unique.Part 3 of the weekend to come with a review of Stanton Social...

...is a great weekend, and with all that New York City has to offer it's hard to go wrong. This past weekend I was fortunate to help celebrate my younger cousin's Bar Mitzvah. The weekend began with a feast at Shun Lee Palace (55th btw Lex and 3rd). Our party of 20 or so crammed into the front corner at three large tables topped with lazy susan's.The menu was pre-set and family style and began with scalding hot towels (I actually burnt myself on them) and chicken lettuce wraps, fried pork and steamed vegetable dumplings. The lettuce wraps were quite good, but of course messy. However, based solely on appearance the dumplings looked delicious, but the fillings were bland and the vegetable dumplings were no better than frozen dumplings I've steamed at home. After washing the dumplings down with a nice crisp TsingTao we were presented with 2 or 3 gorgeous Peking Ducks. Brought out on a silver platter and carved table side these ducks had promise and we all drooled in anticipation. Moist and extremely meaty the duck, wrapped gently in pancakes with some hoisin and green onion, was superb and some of the best Peking Duck I have ever eaten. I would have been satisfied eating the duck all night, but there was plenty more food on the way.The next few platters brought out (in no specific order) consisted of sea bass in a very heavy miso sauce, sauteed shitake mushrooms which were treated to a bit more soy sauce than needed, a wonderful tender steak dish with chinese broccoli, bowls of fried rice which were quite bland, assorted steamed vegetables and a chow fun type dish of thick rice noodles chicken and vegetables which lacked any real depth. After surviving such a large feast, and still thinking of the duck, we were left with platters of fresh fruit and hot tea to help ease us into our food coma's.A fine meal for a large family celebration, but certainly not worth all the hype. Shun Lee provides an elegant twist on many Chinese favorites, but there's no guarantee the food will be any better than your favorite neighborhood spot. What I can guarantee is that the service will keep you pleased. Water glasses always full, new silverware and plates in an instant and plenty of waiters buzzing around to grab you a cocktail or beer. Stay tuned for part 2 and 3 where I review my experience at Meatpacking District hot spot Vento and the continually popular LES destination, Stanton Social.

Prospect Heights Brooklyn may not be thought of as a sushi destination, but tucked into a small space on Flatbush Avenue for the past 20+ years Geido has been dishing up some of the freshest fish in the area at astounding prices. This is a neighbohood restaurant and their are many regulars here every night. Walking in there will most likely be a short wait, but it's well worth it. The sushi bar on busy nights may be locked in by Geido veterans or friends, but every now and again you can get lucky. The restaurant is cramped, but not uncomfortable. Maybe it's the wonderfully friendly waitresses that welcome you and bid you goodnight one by one or the graffiti and marker covered walls showing the history of the place. Or maybe it's the ultra fresh fish displayed at the counter for prices you may never have seen before in a sushi restaurant.A Dynamite roll filled with crispy eel, ruby red tuna, tempura flakes, masago (roe), cucumber and avocado can fill up a light eater easily for under $8. Pieces of sushi, all between $2 - $5, are fresh and made with care. The white tuna is tender and smooth, while the spanish mackerel (only when in season) is topped with a garlicky paste and scallions and packs quite a kick. Other menu items include a variety of tempura dishes from shrimp to pumpkin, as well as the standard terriyaki and noodle dishes.The menu is quite expansive and you will always find specials simply pasted on the wall which change regularly. A great place for a small group (call ahead) or a slow sushi dinner for two. Next time I'll try to order omakase to really let the chefs shine. Highly recommended.Geido Sushi 331 Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY 11217 (718) 638-8866

At this small East Village eatery you can have the best meal of your life or just a few bites and some tasty wine. Degustation offers a wonderful menu of small plates and small bites. The menu changes every few months or so allowing you to go back and try new things. The wine list is a good size and offers whites, reds and a handful of dessert wines.The food is inventive, colorful and not lacking flavor by any means here at this open kitchen tapas bar. It's amazing to see all of the action in such a small kitchen: grill, burners, saute station, sink and an assembly area. Watch as the chef's create your meal in front of your eyes and don't hesitate to ask a question about what they are whipping up. Wesley Genovart a rising chef so make sure to visit before reservations are impossible to get.Yes, the portions are small, but the prices are not too over the top. It's more than food, it's an experience. (Don't forget the wine as well).- Crispy Sweetbreads cucumber dill Greek yogurt with chilies- Grilled Quail with forum reduction, pistachios and frisee- Ribeye with a red onion marmalade, molasses and bone marrow- Grilled Lamb Loin with truffled cauliflower and black maitake mushrooms- Monkfish in jamon serrano broth, baby carrots and artichokes- CroquettesEvery dish listed here was amazing. The sweetbreads, my first time trying them, were crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The flavors were complex and hit you on different levels for almost every dish. The ribeye with bone marrow was so savory and rich...I could go on, but I'd rather let you experience it for yourself.

Indian sandwiches and wraps at this W.Village shop keep me coming back for more. The flavors are well rounded, with a heavy dose of heat, and the prices are very reasonable. I'd recommend the Lamb Nanini, cubed lamb tikka with caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese in between two pressed pieces of Nan bread. The Lamb Partha introduced me to stuffed nan bread and was more than filling for lunch and under $5. Limited seating and not much decor make this an ideal takeout spot.

I've been meaning to eat at Taim for some time now considering many critics have been proclaiming it the best falafel in the city. I've always found Mamoun's or Kebab House, both on MacDougal, to have stellar falafel and their price is always under $2.50. Taim is a little different. No giant spit of meat rotating, no lines out the door or assembly line construction of your sandwich. This is a slightly more high end falafel, and I could get used to it. Offering three types of falafel: green (parsley, cilantro, mint), red (roasted pepper) and tunisia (mildly spicy) you already find more variety than at your standard falafel shop. All ingredients are extremely fresh and crispy, and the pita is clearly home made as it it crisp and never a perfect circle (like the bagged pita used across the city). To accompany your falafel I recommend the ginger mint lemonade, made fresh daily. It's refreshing with a little kick from the ginger and it goes well with the spicy green sauce on the falafel. Other offerings in include standard middle eastern salads of taboulli or eggplant salad and platters with hummus and mixed falafel. The fries are something to try on my next trip as they are a popular option with the saffron aioli. The price will set you back more than Mamoun's will, $5 for a falafel sandwich, but this is a different falafel.222 Waverly Place, New York, NY 10014, 212-691-1287 (cash only)

Yatagan down the block from Mamouns is also good but their Schwarma is better. . .

Venturing out to meet my family for dinner this weekend I was intrigued by the restaurant we had all selected. Revamped and redesigned, Meritage in Scarsdale seems to have all the makings of a good local restaurant. Highly qualified chef who cooked at Picholine in Manhattan and La Panetiere in Rye (a highly established French restaurant), a menu that seemed generally focused and many local ingredients. Though the restaurant is in a strip mall it is rather charming, minus the ceiling which looks like its been there since the 70's. The menu is broken out into small plates, appetizers, salads, entrees, pastas and neighborhood favorites. Much of the menu seems very well put together, but the small plates and neighborhood favorites seem out of place. Duck croquettes, olive tapenade and hummus of all things adorn this very much contemporary American menu. Neighborhood favorites are even more confusing, with Veal Milanese and \"Plain Grilled Salmon\". Plain is not a very appropriate naming and is somewhat of a put off.Those are the shortcomings, but the rest of the menu really does come together. Appetizers and small plates are tasty, but really just give you something to eat until the main course arrives. A point of advice, don't fill up on appetizers, save room for the massive main courses. As a table we feasted on grilled cedar river farms hanger steak with matchstick fries, perfectly cooked duck with pecans, apples and figs, a succulent venison chop with pomegranate sauce (a special) and my personal favorite, a softball sized braised short rib on top of a potato puree and roasted root vegetables. It seems meat was my tables preference, and judging by the menu options (2 fish dishes) and the quality of the meat dishes, the chef is good with meat.After such a heavy and large meal I may find it in me to skip dessert, but to do that here I would have sorely regretted it. Trying my first bread pudding I almost fell in love. Warm bread pudding with white and dark chocolates topped with housemade vanilla gelato. Decadent, soothing, refreshing, it was impeccable and I would choose to eat it everyday if I could forgo the weight gain consequences.Meritage offers a quite extensive wines by the bottle list and about 20 wines by the glass starting around $8-9. Reservations are recommended, but not necessary and there is a friendly and generally crowded bar on site for quick bites. Average cost per diner: $45 - $55. 1505 Weaver St. Scarsdale, NY 10583, 914-472-8484, www.meritagerestaurant.com

My favorite restaurant just began serving Sunday brunch this weekend! It was, as expected, simply wonderful. Brunch, like every other meal I have eaten at Meritage, was outstanding. Included in the price is a lovely, high-end buffet and in addition a choice from a menu of wonderful things (omelets, pancakes, eggs benedict (great), and many others. It is very reasonably priced as well, considering the high quality of the food. A nice relaxing thing to do on a Sunday!

Many reviews boast that Franny's has some of the best Pizza in NYC and Brooklyn, but while my experience did not result in crowning a new pizza king, it was still quite good. Remarkably thin crust, a wonderful balance of high-quality ingredients in a bustling rustic setting. The charred, imperfect yet perfect looking pizza's are beautiful adorned with many toppings if you like or simple with only garlic, buffalo mozzarella and oregano. Local and organic ingredients help elevate the pizza's to new heights while not overpowering the wonderful crust. A wine list offering a nice selection of red and white plus a well rounded beer selection make it easy to grab a table and stay awhile. Servers are also very helpful and friendly and are more than happy to make recommendations. The waits can get long and they don't take reservations so make sure to account for potentially long wait time, especially now that that Frank Bruni has given it 2 stars.295 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718) 230-0221m www.frannysbrooklyn.com

Market Table in the West Village has been receiving much acclaim since it opened in the Fall of 2007 and it is much deserved. Walking into this corner restaurant you are met with a wide open pantry selling a variety of goods, a bustling kitchen and a peaceful and rustic dining room. The vibe is welcoming and this carries through to the food. It may be a foodie's haven, but by no means is Market Table snobbish or upscale. Chef Mike Price, who is extraordinarily down to earth and puts his heart and soul into cooking, delivers on meals throughout the day. Brunch offerings such as French Toast with caramelized pears and pecans is very satisfying with a nice hint of vanilla shining through. The burger, which can be considered one of the cities top five, is placed between a soft yet resistant roll and topped with cheddar and caramelized onions. With LaFrieda supplied meat, the same as Shake Shack, the burger is bursting with flavor. Dinner options range from airy gnocchi with short ribs to grilled atlantic char with a wonderful mushroom-radicchio risotto. Overall a very approachable menu with moderate prices considering the high quality of food being served. Definitely worth a return trip to try some of the other dishes or even take home the assorted meats and cheeses being offered.Market Table, 54 Carmine Street, NY, NY 10014 (212) 255-2100

No matter what you call it, a hero/sub/etc., I feel that this generally massively delicious sandwich is overlooked. I remember the days when a chicken parm hero would fill you up for the day with its crispy, cheesey saucy goodness, but now most attention is paid to panini's or artisinal sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, I love a good panini at 'ino or what not and I have no problem with the artisinal sandwiches of Bouchon Bakery and Murray's, but that overly huge, stuffed hero seems to have drifted away. The standard pizza place still offers them, but where are the inventive heroes. Think about it, a panko crusted piece of chicken with carmelized onions, ponzu sauce and frisse lettuce. Or maybe just a wonderful lamb and veal meatball parm topped with fresh mozzarella and sauteed mushrooms. It's a simple sandwich that can fill you up for a day meeting the continually evolving food culture we have. New takes on the classics, without losing that, always conveniently wrapped, oblong aluminum foil sandwich.

My first posting promises to be the lamest of all my posts. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I can get to the point of this blog. Many of us consider ourselves foodies, or food obsessed, but I'm hoping I can provide you something different and new. I've eaten all through NYC and many places around the country, written over 100 restaurant reviews and cooked countless meals for family and friends, but to be honest I just want to talk about food. So you can expect rants on the price of eating lunch in NYC to a formal review of the best new restaurant I've been to. Enjoy and keep eating.

On a recent weekday night I made it over to wine super restaurant Veritas for a business dinner. Veritas had always been a restaurant I heard of, but I didn't know anyone who had been there. They were a top wine destination in the city, but that's about all I knew about the restaurant across the street from Gramercy Tavern.Entering the restaurant we are met with a gorgeous bar, packed with a variety of well dressed men and women, sipping vino and enjoying the newly added bar menu. We sunk into a comfortable booth in the back, with a great view of the somewhat quaint dining room. A party was taking up a good portion of the room as others ordered wine by the glass, with a lucky table donning a magnum. The menu here is prix fixe only in the main dining room, meaning you're not going here for the recession special. On the contrary, you're getting some pretty fabulous food, service and more for about $90 a person, excluding wine of course. Cheap? Nope. But it is fairly priced, something I really only noticed AFTER we ate. The soup amuse, which I surprisingly cannot fully remember, was delicious and a great start to the evening.My courses were comprises of Frogs Legs, Veal Sweetbreads and a Rhubarb Tart Tartin. The Frogs Legs were sauteed with baby chanterelle mushrooms, and served with a fresh garbanzo puree, parsley coulis and fried spring onions. The tiny frogs legs were extremely tender, and at 6 to 7 per dish it was quite the starter. I would have preferred a slightly thinner puree, but that would be my only complaint. My Veal Sweetbreads entree was stellar, the best bite of the evening. Served with a spelt risotto, white asparagus, and morels, it was rich and reminded me of the changing of seasons, from winter to spring. There was a potent rosemary scent throughout the sweetbreads and the sauce was prominent, without overpowering the perfectly prepared vegetables. I would get this again, heck I would get this many times over.My dessert was good, but I found the Rhubarb Tart Tartin overshadowed by amazing petit fours. A serving plate of 6 different tastes graced our table along with a nicely plated cheese plate. Each petit fours was a work of art, with my favorite resembling a remarkably small cream puff. In such a small bite I sampled 6 very unique desserts, a quite impressive end to the meal.To top it all of the wine was as expected, impressive and abundant. From a sparkling rose to the dessert wine, each wine paired well with the courses, with a particularly good Italian red, which stole the show (I'm trying to get the name). In full disclosure, the restaurant treated us well, providing us with a great table and extra attention on the wine front. With that said, it's hard to believe the restaurant not providing stellar service. Some dishes may make you yearn for more, others may merely be okay, but more likely than not you can expect a solid meal worthy of any special occassion, just plan ahead and block of a few hours of your time.43 E 20th St, New York, NY 10003, 212-353-3700, Price - Expensive ($95-150/person), Reservations - Recommended

Tonight, around 9:30 the most outstanding restaurateur award at the 2009 James Beard awards was announced. It was Drew Nieporent. However, the New York Times Diner's Journal blog, had already posted this 30 minutes earlier, along with the winners of a few other prestigious awards (most outstanding restaurant and most outstanding chef). It's disappointing for many people that this happened, ruining the surprise that many of the attendees (excluding myself) have been awaiting since they sat down almost three hours ago, and word has it many people got up before the event even ended since they heard the result. What's more, it shows the negative aspect of live blogging and the urge to share and post information before others in this digital age. On the one hand, is the New York Times at fault for posting this information OR is it the James Beard Foundation's fault for releasing the winners too early. I'm sure this will be debated all night and morning, but it does shed light on the live blogging faults, and it is only one of many I am sure we will see with more and more people using Twitter to share \"breaking\" news. Let's just hope that mistake doesn't come from me next time!See the premature award notice here Diner's Journal: Beard Awards AnnouncedUpdate: and Eater sheds more light on the whole NY Times/JBA debacle last night. Turns out the Washington Post posted the winners a few minutes before the NY Times, but the real culprit here are those behind the JBA's. It seems they released the winners, to a few select papers and asked them not to post them until 9pm. Well, the event ran long, the winners were announced at 9pm and all sort of Twitter and Blog hell let loose. So what does this teach us? Well it means award shows, with sealed results, should remain sealed in the future. Check out Eater's great story here: More words on the JBA spoiler.

***CONTENT
Part 2 of my Houston food tour brings me to my second objective when visiting Houston, BBQ. Now in NY we have had a surge of BBQ spots open over the past few years, some of them bad, others quite good. However, I've always known there is more to BBQ than what I had here. This brings me to my quest for the best BBQ in Houston. I thank a number of people for chiming in, but most of all Alison Cook of the Houston Chronicle (Cook's Tour Blog as well). Thanks to her I found myself driving about a dozen miles outside of the center of Houston, into a relative bare neighborhood with stray dogs and plenty of overgrown lawns. What I found here redefined BBQ as I know it. Words really can't describe the experience at Burns BBQ. This in the middle of nowhere, joint in a rundown neighborhood and it resembles more of a house than a restaurant, but this sure is not simple home cooking. Burns has no seating inside, just a few picnic tables out front, but don't be afraid to eat in your car as many people do. There is minimal space inside, and it gets rather cramped. Order, get your number and stay alert. The menu is simple, brisket, ribs and two kinds of sausage. Sides are limited to beans and potato salad, but these are not your average sides. I ordered the meat platter for 2-3 planning to share with my hungry, Houstonian friend for a measly $23 (photo above, though it doesn't do it justice).Unfortunately they forget to throw in the housemade sausage, but it was an afterthought once I tasted the delicious smokey meat in the Styrofoam container. Brisket piled high, it was the first thing we attacked. Tender, moist, with great flavor and deep smoke rings, it was a surprise it was so lean without being dry. By far the best brisket I have ever had, and I honestly don't expect to find better. Topped with a little house BBQ sauce it was heavenly. The ribs were also a work of art, slightly crispy on the outside, they were tender on the inside with a welcome porkiness. A bit fatty, they were quite greasy, but no complaints here. A side of the house beans, resembling a chili almost, was quite addictive and I understood why someone commented \"you'll wish you ordered a bigger one\" after we sat down with our food. If i wasn't convinced enough that this was good BBQ well, it was good as leftovers, case in point, that brisket was delicious 24 hours later heated in the microwave, achieving greatness that even some northeast BBQ spots cannot with a fresh piece of meat.For some unexplainable reason, we found our BBQ stuffed selves driving back into the city with the goal of eating crawfish. Why? Well, I don't really know why since I probably could have forgone eating for the rest of the day, but eat crawfish we did. It may not have been the premier spot for these little morsels, but Porch Swing, a popular bar, was serving up crawfish across their front porch. We ordered a 6 lb bucket of crawfish, complete with corn, potatoes and a pitcher or two of beer and there went the afternoon. This batch was quite spicy and although there were many little rejects, it was great to just sit outside make a mess and enjoy myself.Later in the evening a dinner wasn't even necessary, but I did find myself at a Jack in the Box drive through on the way home from a number of Houston area bars. Never before had I been to a Jack in the Box, but I have to say, late night I certainly could have been eating worse.The following morning a Tex-Mex breakfast seemed to be the only thing I needed and my friends did not let me down. Maybe not the most authentic of spots, but Buffalo Grille was a great choice, perhaps due to the quantity of food, or maybe just the overall value, but it was a tasty brunch that held me over for the majority of the day. After waiting in a line which extended out into the sidewalk in front of the restaurant we made it to the counter, there was no lunch service, but as soon as I spotted the Huevos Rellenos I knew what I wanted. I ordered up and a few minutes later my name was called. Piled onto my tray were two anaheim chiles, stuffed with pork sausage and cheese, deep fried (of course), topped with two fried eggs, more cheese and a delectable green chile sauce. All of this served with fresh tortillas, refried beans and a vibrant pico de gallo. Now I know, this is not the most authentic of tex-mex brunch meals I could have had, and yes it reminds me of something you may hear about on This is Why Your Fat, but this was a mighty tasty dish. Every ingredient worked individually, but came together nicely, and those tortillas just sopped up all the remaining egg, cheese and green chile sauce. A freshly made dish, that surely sticks to the ribs and doesn't break the bank, that's what Buffalo Grille does best.Some how later that day I made it to Feast where I gorged on more food, like pigskin, stuffed veal heart, blood pudding and more. How I did it, well I don't know, but pretty much every bite of food from the start of the trip to the end of the trip was worth it (with the exception of those fish tacos at Berryhill). I'll remember this trip well and look forward to my next stop there, which will likely include Burns BBQ and Feast to say the least.

It's been awhile since the last post so here is my effort to get caught up. I never finished my recap of Houston, a food-filled weekend a few weeks back. While my meal at Feast was remarkable, there were plenty other bites that are not to be forgotten. With Tex-Mex and BBQ on the mind I managed to score some delicious food. My Tex-Mex craving found me at hole-in-the-wall joint Los Dos Amigos. It was the setting I was looking for, no frills, super cheap, everything homemade. We scoured the menu and came up with a few platters to share as well as a couple of quesadillas to start. The Carnitas Platter, the house specialty, came with a pile of slow roasted tender pork alongside beans and rice. It was by far the best dish, perfectly seasoned and something I had to stop myself from eating. We also ordered the Carne Asada platter and the #1, or a combo platter with cheese enchiladas, a beef taco and a cheese tostada. Each platter came with a bowl of fresh guacamole, and fresh tortillas and chips. The carne asada was disappointing, and was just not a tender, flavorful piece of meat. The combo platter was good, not great, but I did thoroughly enjoy sopping up everything with the fresh tortillas. Overall a great value with a few standout dishes, but I am sure there are better places in Houston.My next day in Houston resulted in a 6+ mile walk, sunburnt arms and plenty of good eating. Stopping by BB's Cajun Cafe, one of the relative newcomers to the Monstrose area dining scene, I was determined to get a po'boy. I know, I know, I'm in Houston, but I had to have the popular southern sandwich and this seemed to be the best spot. The Catfish Po'boy was good, tasty and served on the right type of bread. The fish was fresh, although I've had better numerous times. as a side I ordered some Boudin Balls, delicious little morsels of sausage and rice. I asked for a side of the restaurants famous gravy and I see exactly why people rave about it. The rich, dark, beef flavored gravy is quite addictive and extremely popular poured on the Roast Beef Po'boy. A recommended spot for a small bite of New Orleans.While I was certainly not that hungry anymore I was still in the mood to try more food. I had done the Tex-Mex, but on this gorgeous day a fish taco and a margarita sounded excellent. I had read on numerous sites that Berryhill Baja Grill served some of the best in the area. While the restaurant has a few locations many of the Chowhounders of bloggers seemed to know what they were talking about. Well I have to firmly disagree with all the Berryhill advocates. This was perhaps the worst fish taco I have ever had, not just in Houston, but across the country. The fish is deepfried, generally a delicious idea, but it only tasted like old fryer oil. This greasy, unappealing tasting fried piece was topped with a bland \"slaw\" and lacked any realy flavor. Let's just say, at least I had a margarita.For dinner that evening a trip to the Vietnamese neighborhood, something I eagerly anticipating after reading about the large Vietnamese population in Houston. The BYOB spot called conveniently Vietnam Restaurant, was a bit tacky, in a trying too hard to be flashy kind of way, but the food had promise upon first look. We ordered up a feast of course, complete with Spring Rolls, Charbroiled Beef with Vermicelli, Special Fried Rice and Black Pepper Shrimp. Of the dishes we had the Black Pepper Shrimp were by far the best. The combination of the large, plump fried shrimp combined with the stir fried onions and potent black pepper sauce was quite impressive. Overall a solid, well priced meal, especially when compared to NYC prices.With day one in the books I realized this trip was only getting started. In a 24 span I had managed to visit 4 spots and only anticipated visiting more. Next stop, the best BBQ of my life, stay tuned.

Are you talking about Vietnam Restaurant on 19th in the Heights? It's OK, but there are so many amazing Vietnamese places in town! It sounds like you have great tour guides on hand, but if you're still around, grab some local BBQ at Pierson's, and don't miss the softshell crab at Reef.

For my recent trip to Houston there were just a few things I wanted to do, get some Tex-Mex and indulge in some real Texas BBQ. Never would I have expected that one of my more memorable meals to date would be in Houston, let alone \"Rustic European Fare.\" Feast is a restaurant like no other in Houston, and for that matter I highly doubt there is a restaurant like it in all of Texas. The cuisine is simple, rustic and devoid of frills, highlighting the ingredients on the plate and nothing else. However, that ingredient may very well be veal heart, or beef tongue, but also braised lamb shank or crispy pork belly. Feast has a wide range, from the mostly social acceptable dish to the somewhat fear inducing and that is just one of the reasons this is a special place.After asking around and reading review by the Robb Walsh of the Houston Press and Alison Cook of the Houston Chronicle I was completely sold. (More recently, Frank Bruni of the NYTimes stopped in and gave it a glowing review, hopefully boosting business, but likely making reservations harded to come by.) My friend and I arrived at the restaurant a few minutes before 7pm on Sunday for our reservation, the restaurant was mostly empty, a sad sight of course, so we had our choice of seats. We could have sat down anywhere, as the environment is quite comfortable, in an old wooden house type of way. Having already made up our mind to go with the tasting menu ($49!) we selected a glass of white and a bottle of red to share. The tasting menu is made up of 9 courses, an absolute steal for anyone, and coming from NY quite the bargain.The courses started with delicious housemade bread and a warm Beet and Cumin Soup. The soup was topped with a dollop of yogurt and was a nice beginning to our meal, albeit tame. Following the soup was a course a bit more interesting, Stuffed Pigskin. Most people I've dined with over the years would scoff at this dish, it's a hard dish to get used to since it is served cold, but once you can get by the textural differences it is very tasty. The skin is about a quarter inch thick or less and is soft, not crispy, filled with sausage and herbs and complemented by an orange and radish salad, a very unique dish all around.To this point our service had been wonderful, food delicious and the overall experience memorable, but the heart of the meal, in my opinion, was where the restaurant really shines. A dish of Black Pudding topped with a fried egg was comforting and a hefty serving of English peas and mint kept the richness in check. The Veal Heart, sliced into 4-5 pieces, is served with a refreshing and crisp carrot and coriander salad. The heart itself resembles a minute steak almost, but with much more interesting flavor, it was one of my friends favorite dishes, something remarkable seeing as how he has never ventured into offal or \"lesser-known cuts\" before.Moving along to the heftier courses we were served Beef Tongue with bacon, spinach and lentils. I've had tongue before, but this was a new way for me to try it, almost delicate in its preparation, it was delicious and paired with addictive lentils. We both thoroughly enjoyed this dish and had to slow ourselves down realizing four courses still remained. For our sixth course we took a little departure from meat and offal with a Whole Roasted Rosebud, a small fish similar to Red Snapper. The fish had the head and tail on and was roasted to a wonderful golden brown on the outside, remaining tender and moist on the inside. It was a little challenging to get all the meat out of it, but well worth it, and was served with kale and mashed potatoes. I could have done without the mashed potatoes, and the kale was extremely salty, but the fish was a much needed \"light\" course.Rounding out the savory courses was the Crispy Pork Belly atop a potato cake with red cabbage and apples. This was my favorite savory course of the day, and perhaps the best pork belly I have ever indulged in. A massive portion for a tasting menu, the pork belly appeared fried since it was so crispy, but in fact it was roasted, skin side down to achieve a bubbly, crispy texture. With a great meat to fat ratio it was easy enough to cut and chew, but had all the richness you would want in pork belly. The potato cake was a nice touch, although it was a little overcooked, and the cabbage and apples brought rounded the dish out, with a bit of acid helping to cut through the fat a little bit.A small bowl of Lemon Sorbet served as our eighth course was a nice palate cleanser, and prepped us for the rich Sticky Toffee Pudding served last. The pudding was amazing, served warm, it roughly fell apart with barely any effort and after plenty of fatty, salty bites throughout the nearly 3 hour meal, it was a nice way to end everything. Through it all we drank a nice bottle of red (the name escapes me), chosen from the restaurant's well-rounded wine list. The food at Feast is definitely forward thinking, but not in the molecular way, but more aimed at educating diners on all the delicious animal parts which we as a culture generally shy away from. There are dishes fit for the less adventurous diner, like lamb shank, fish pie and variations on duck as well, making it easy to find something for every palate. The English background is clear in the cooking as well as several Eastern European influences, and to me this is certainly the type of restaurant that every major city should have and embrace. Being able to dine in a no frills atmosphere, with such a high standard of creative, thought provoking food is a joy and I will never forget it. Thank you Megan, James and Richard for my feast.219 Westheimer Road, Houston, Texas, 713-529-7788, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate (40-100/person depending on tasting menu)

true, $40 a person is really not expensive by NYC standards, but I think what is most important is the great value. Huge courses of inventive, unique food and a great atmosphere to boot. $49 for 9 courses is one the best dining deals in the country

I've chatted about Pam Real Thai at some point, not sure when, but it is one of my favorite Thai spots in the NYC area. I used to frequent this place every few weeks when I was in Hells Kitchen more often, but now that I am in Brooklyn I barely see it. Well on a recent weekend I was in the neighborhood and felt the need to revisit my old friend. A super inexpensive spot, Pam Real Thai is cash only and always bustling. Tonight Hung, Top Chef winner from a few seasons back, was there dining with friends. It was great to see him there, but sorry Hung, I was here for the food. My top dish whenever I go out for Thai is Pad See Eiw, occasionally spelled a bit different around the city, but generally the same dish: broad rice noodles, beef or chicken, egg and Chinese broccoli in a sweet soy based sauce (I recommend beef). This was great, but the real star of the night was a dish I'd never had before: Anchovy Fried Rice ($7.50). This rice dish simply had everything, fried jasmine rice, anchovy paste, Thai omelet, scallions, honey pork and tiny dried shrimp. Specked with Thai chilies this dish hit so many notes, the sweet, salty and of course spicy. The dried shrimp offered not only a salty note, but a crunch, adding to the already complex textures. Overall it's one of my new favorite dishes here and something I highly recommend if you are looking for something a little different.404 West 49th Street, 212-333-7500, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($10-20/person)

It was a wet blustery night yesterday, the perfect night to do a cross Manhattan bar crawl, right? Well yes it was and after a start in the dreaded midtown I shifted gears and made it to the East Village. While the midtown bar had surprisingly good nachos, at an Irish pub no less, it was downtown where I was destined to go. The rain was coming down rather hard and without knowing it I was in front of McSorley's, a great spot to dry off on cheap beers without worrying about getting too comfortable. A few mugs (no more than 8 oz of beer each) later and out the door I was, headed to PDT, my desired destination as of about 20 minutes into the evening. Around 9:30pm the place was half full, but the list had them booked through the night. We ordered the Benton's Old Fashioned ($13), a drink I've been talking up all week after I tried it for the first time last Saturday. A delicious blend of bacon infused George Dickel Tennessee Whisky, Maple Syrup, angostura Bitters and orange peel; it's quickly becoming one of my favorite cocktails in the city. Pair it with a Chang Dog, the snappy dog wrapped in bacon and topped with kimchi, and you have yourself a meal for any occassion. Add tater tots with jalapaneo cheese (as I did of course) and you have a 4-star meal. We also sampled the dog with cream cheese, scallions and everything bagel spices. Initially I was reluctant to have a dog with cream cheese, but the fried dog (yes fried hot dog) combined with the creamy spread was delicious. Think the corner bagel spot will hook me up with that if I ask?113 St Marks Pl, New York, NY 10009, 212-614-0386, Reservations - Highly Recommended (or just be prepared to wait), Price - Moderate ($13 - how ever much you decide to drink)

So much has been said about Txikito's lunch menu and burger offering. From Ed Levine at Serious Eats to Josh Ozersky at The Feedbag and NYMag, who originally posted the lunch menu, the food media has been abuzz and I have been itching to get over there. Having already thoroughly enjoyed a dinner feast at the restaurant I had no doubt I would enjoy the lunch, but I didn't know to what degree. The lunch menu is much smaller, with soups, salads, sandwiches, some other plates and sides. I was here for the burger, known as \"el doble\" ($11), first and foremost, so we ordered up burgers and the fries ($4), crispy and dusted with a Basque chili powder. The burger emerged, looking larger than all the pictures do it justice. Two patties are assembled with smoked sheep's milk cheese, pickled guindilla peppers, pickled onions, sliced cornichons, and a special sauce made from mayo and creme fraiche all between a Tom Cat Bakery bun. It is by no means a \"clean\" burger, as the juicy meat, about 20 percent fat, combined with the special sauce drips all over the plate (seen here in the picture), but the bun does a wonderful job absorbing all that meaty goodness. Each bite was delicious, with the combination of flavors unique to me in burger form and quite memorable. It's no Shake Shack burger, but I'm confident in saying it is one of the better burgers in the city, perhaps top five or better. Service is from 12-3pm, Tuesday - Friday, so get over there during the week before it starts getting busy and see for yourself. 240 Ninth Ave., 212-242-4730, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate

Little delayed on the announcement, but if you didn't already know Dine in Brooklyn, a Brooklyn restaurant week, is coming up shortly and the list of restaurants participating is quite extensive. There are some clear standouts, like Rose Water, Grocery, Chestnut, Applewood, Stone Park, Al Di La, ici and many more. For $23 most of these restaurants are likely not making any profit, but some restaurants are even going further and offering dinner for two at only $23, TOTAL. They may not be the finest spots on the list, but for a 3-course meal at roughly $11.50 a person that is a surefire steal. Others are offering this deal during brunch, and the list is a bit more impressive for that. I'll be visiting The Grocery in Carroll Gardens and Aliseo Osteria del Borgo in Prospect Heights and will report back on the meals of course.

Tacos Galore in Sunset Park

This past weekend was beautiful, a small window of spring weather and hope that this brutal winter will soon end. It was a crime not to be outside in some capacity and along with fellow food blogger, NYC Food Guy, I took on Sunset Park's finest. Armed with a list of the top Mexican spots in the area, cameras, a pen, paper and of course an appetite we started down on 60th Street and 5th Avenue with the intention of eating our way as far back North as possible. Our main goal was to try the best tacos in the neighborhood, ones that would put the Manhattan shops to shame, and enlighten us as to what a real taco is, we certainly think the goal was achieved.First stop, Tulcingo Restaurant & Bakery near 56th street. It was barely noon and the place was relatively empty. We plopped ourselves down and with minimal Spanish placed an order for three tacos to share. The restaurant was nothing special aesthetically, but who cares, we were here for the food, which upon landing on our table immediately impressed. Our taco trio consisted of an Arabes ($2.50), Carne Asada ($2.25) and Lengua ($2.25). The Arabes was a ground lamb taco, served with a spicy, red mole. It was phenomenal on so many levels. The mole was vibrant without overpowering the lamb and started us off on a good note. The carne asada was tender and topped with cilantro, onions and a creamy avocado sauce, while the lengua, or tongue, was remarkably moist and reminded me of a more potent pulled pork or shredded beef dish. Of the three, the arabes was hands down the best. By the time we left this spot the restaurant was filled with families.Moving on down 5th Avenue, quite content with our first stop, we walked over to Rico's Tacos (also known as Piaxtla Es Mexico). Even with a rather crowded scene, we were able to score a tiny table for two and quickly order up some pork tacos, the Carnitas Especiale ($3.00 for a large) and Enchilada ($2.00). The latter is a name I usually associate with the dish, enchiladas, but here it was spicy marinated pork. It was a tasty taco, beautiful red color with a nice texture, but I would have preferred some more heat, which was generously added with the containers of salsa on the table. The carnitas, we ordered a small and large taco, were remarkably moist, assisted by the great amount of fat on it, and subsequently very tasty, but there was so much fat we actually had to pull some off before eating.Next stop brought us to a much talked about Tacos Matamoros (we found plenty of Chowhounders talking this place up). It was quite different than any of the other spots we had passed, complete with a wood exterior--this place was classy. Nice tile floors, brand new flat screen TVs and super clean, we were actually hesitant at first about going in. Once in though, it was easy to see we made the right choice. Packed to the gills around 1:30pm, this spot had a similar menu to the previous stops, but the Chorizo Taco ($1.75 for a small) is what jumped out at us here. Along with Chorizo we ordered up the Al Pastor ($1.25), or roasted pork, and dug in. The chorizo was bursting with flavor, spicy, fatty, smoky, it was amazing. The tortillas upped the ante as it seems they were partially toasted giving the taco an added, crunchy, texture. The al pastor was a bit disappointing as it was dry, and lacking much depth, however, it was clear the restaurant was using quality ingredients as everything was bright and fresh.Only a few yards away we came to Tacos Xochimilco, a relatively bare storefront with just a few diners present. Large pictures of the dishes were enticing, but we had heard about a particular dish, the Pambazo Torta ($6.00). The pambazo was a creation we had never heard of, stuffed with potatoes, shredded lettuce, enchilada pork, refried beans, queso fresca, and crema queso all in between two unique pieces of bread. The bread was doused on the outside in a smoky red sauce and then griddled to bake in the sauce. A messy sandwich to say the least, it was remarkable, with so many levels of flavor and texture. I wouldn't hesitate for a second to name it one of the best sandwiches I've had in recent memory and alone, worth the trip to Sunset Park. The great sandwich certainly overshadows the Carne Asada taco ($1.50 for a small) we had, which was good, but forgettable, with it's only unique quality being the queso crema. To top it all off we were served a complimentary glass of Horchata, a sweet, cinnamon flavored milk that paired well with the dishes we had.Wandering around into bakeries with opulent cakes, specialty stores with amazing selections of peppers and spices and passing more taquerias we finally made it to Guerrero Food Center. Mere blocks away from the massive Greenwood Cemetery this spot was unlike all the others. More market than restaurant, we scanned the short but delicious sounding menu, and ordered up a quesadilla, the Flor de Calabaza ($3.00), and sat eagerly awaiting our food. What emerged from the tiny kitchen did not appear to be a quesadilla by American standards, but almost resembled a chalupa (thanks Taco Bell), with its fried outer layer and pocked like appearance. Stuffed with squash blossoms, queso crema, queso fresca, shredded lettuce and a spicy salsa verde, it was delicious. A slightly crunchy exterior with a chewy interior, the fillings all merged together nicely. It wasn't a taco, but I am sure glad we ordered it.Making our way towards Park Slope we stopped at a bakery and grabbed a doughnut. It was nothing special, but it made me yearn for the baked goods we had passed earlier on the tour, back in the 40's and 50's on 5th Avenue where everything simply smelled and tasted better. After the 70 or so block walk it was clear that there is a whole new world of food right here at our fingertips, so close, so cheap, so good, yet underappreciated. I can't wait to get back to Sunset Park for some tacos, tortas, churros and whatever else I can get my hands on.Tulcingo Restaurant & Bakery - 5520 5th Ave nr. 56th Street, Brooklyn, NYRicos Tacos - 505 51st Street nr. 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NYTacos Matamoros - 4508 5th Ave nr. 46th Street, Brooklyn, NYTacos Xochimilco - 4501 5th Ave nr. 45th Street, Brooklyn, NYGuerrero Food Center - 722 5th Ave nr. 23rd Street, Brooklyn, NY

There are a few restaurants in this city which people say \"you have to go to\". Everyone has their own opinion, I certainly have mine, but I always hear Little Owl on the top of peoples list. It may not be a 4-star restaurant (it's 2 actually), but that quaint little spot on the corner of Bedford and Grove has been abuzz since it opened and there is no sign it is falling out of style. Head Chef Joey Campanaro has received plenty of press for his contemporary comfort food style. It's hard to nail down the exact cuisine of food he dishes out with dishes like the famous meatball sliders, sliced duck breast, crispy chicken with brussels sprouts and the remarkable pork chop (more on that later). Little Owl is a neighborhood spot by definition, but people flock to this place, heck they make reservations from 5pm-11pm just to eat here everyday of the week. We may hear about Babbo and Ko as the hardest tables in town, but Little Owl is surely up there and its capacity of 28 or so doesn't make it any easier.Moving on, the evening was special for two reasons. It was my first trip to the Owl and my three year anniversary with my girlfriend, of course the latter is more important. We were both equally excited to dine here and could not have received better service and treatment. We scored a prime table, at 7:30pm, right in the corner of the restaurant looking out onto the street. A very private spot; it was perfect. Scanning the menu I knew we already had chosen at least two of our dishes for the night: meatball sliders and the pork chop. Everyone has likely heard of Little Owl's meatball sliders: tender pork, veal and beef meatballs nestled between delicate Parmesan buns. A two-biter in my opinion to really appreciate the quality of the meat, the sliders were done rather quickly. It's not that they are so complex that you are blown away by their quality, but I think it's the fact that they remind people of their favorite childhood meatball. They offer a glimpse into an innocent past in every bite. Not to be outdone, the scallop appetizer was quite good and offered a nice balance to the heavier sliders. Seared perfectly, they were served with a spinach and caper salad that was refreshing and in a way peaceful.Following our delicious starters, we ordered up the pork chop and crispy chicken. The latter was quite good, reminiscent of the chicken I had at Market Table not too long ago, but not as good. The chicken was still superb--tender, moist and amazingly crispy without being burnt--but the sides were a bit of a let down. Don't get me wrong, the chicken was a great dish, one I would recommend time and time again, but the real standout entree here was the pork chop. I was happy to have ordered the chop as it meant more for me. This giant slab of pork, charred all around, but tender as can be on the inside, was served atop Parmesan butter beans and wild dandelion leaves. The beans and dandelion provided some roughage as I tackled this behemoth and I enjoyed every last bite. There was a sweetness, a saltiness, a well-rounded flavor that even at the last bite was going strong. I'm completely comfortable in saying this was the best pork chop I've ever had and it's hard to believe a better one exists.With that said I could have stopped the meal then and there. Left on a high note, full of porky goodness and the lingering salty taste in my mouth, but no there had to be dessert on this special night, it wouldn't have been complete without it. Beignets with raspberry filling and a Nutella dipping sauce were a sweet, tart and decadent end, and the apple crisp with hazelnut gelato was creamy and refreshing. Each dessert was quite different, but both shared one thing: simplicity. Nothing was over-the-top, it was all about delicious food, presented properly. We, quite happily, finished every last bite, and swigged the last bit of our Nero D'Avola. A clean glass of Muscato finished off the meal and as the food finally settled in we realized it was time to go. A simple, delicious, three-course meal in the books, completely attitude-free. By no means can I make this a weekly stop, even a monthly stop could be somewhat over the top, but I'll be back soon, perhaps for lunch for that all-too-popular burger.90 Bedford St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 741-4695, Reservation - Highly Recommended, Price - Moderate-Expensive ($50-75/person)

The much hyped about, much blogged about, much anticipated sandwich spot, Defonte's is here. Landing on Manhattan soil last week with a somewhat shiny new storefront in the Gramercy area and dishing out those giant sandwiches that put Chipotle's burritos to shame. The sandwiches here have become legendary, but most of us who either living in Manhattan, or just plain too lazy to trek out to Red Hook (I'm in the latter) have not been fortunate enough to sample them. Well, on a brisk weekday I made the walk from work over to Defonte's pretty much knowing I wanted sandwich #20, or the \"famous\" roast beef with fresh mozzarrela, fried eggplant slices and beef jus. Walking up to the restaurant you can see the crowds, the line snakes through the tiny store out the rear door and onto the sidewalk. At first glance it seems a bit imposing, you may even question if it is worth it as I did, but the line moves quickly for better or worse. Orders are yelled to the Defonte's crew from every angle so be ready and state the number of the sandwich. If you want anything special done to it make it clear because you won't see that sandwich until it's in wax paper, at least during a busy lunch hour. As I mentioned before, I already knew which sandwich I wanted, but I took a recommendation from fellow food lover and blogger NYC Food Guy, and requested my sandwich be piled onto a garlic bread roll. What I recieved was different than the picture on his site, mine was more of a toasted garlic soft roll, whereas his appears to be a hero turned into garlic bread. Either way it was a solid choice since the sandwich fillings, or innards, were surprisingly bland. The combination of the garlic really adds a lot, although I did have to add salt and ground pepper before eating. Another thing to be aware of, hot sandwiches are not always hot. The #20 was room temperature while the eggplant parm, a beast of a sandwich by the way, was warm. With prices hovering in the $8-11 range for a sandwich it is on the pricey side, but for smaller eaters, or those simply with self restraint, any sandwich can be made into two meals. If you do want to eat on-site be forewarned, there are maybe 4-5 seats and they are full during lunch time. With a few kinks to figure out with the line and the temperature of the food a trip to Defonte's is worth it, especially if you work or live in the area. Also don't forget, for those big breakfast eaters, Defonte's offers a variety of hearty breakfast sandwiches. For those looking for dinner, be careful and try to order on the early side or at least call ahead, once these guys run out of food they close, no matter what time it may be. 261 3rd Avenue at 21st Street,New York, NY 10010,212-614-1500, Reservations - Not Needed/Accepted, Price - Inexpensive

I've talked about Amorina in Prospect Heights before, claiming it the best pizza in the nabe, and easily the holders of the best slices. It's hard to resist their slice special, two square slices and a Boylan's soda for $5, one of the better deals I've found in Park Slope or Prospect Heights. Well, with the lack of good slice joints near my apartment I thought it only necessary to order in Amorina's sheet pies for a little scotch and poker get together. The sheet pies are priced higher than the smaller, personal, round pies at $18+ each, but they are huge and worth it. 9 slices make up the pie with its slightly thicker crust and any topping is available, although some are better on the square than others. We ordered a plain and a caprissioca, a sausage, olive, artichoke pie that on the recommendation of the chef we had with a little red sauce (it usually is white) to keep it moist. The latter pie was $26, but considering we had 6 people to feed it was a steal and I highly recommend it. Just give the folks at Amorina a heads up before ordering since they usually only make enough square pies for the takeout special.

Jim Lahey's new spot, Co. (or Company) has been the talk of the town for the past few months. A delayed opening, continual packed dinner service, Jean-Georges backing it, and the good and bad first takes. Recently opened for lunch, walking into Co. during the day is a breeze. None of those lines around the block or bad service and \"we're out of dough\" scenarios I've heard of in the past. Lunch offers a serene, casual atmosphere and the opportunity to try some of the great new pizza in the city. There are certainly stumbles here and there, but I'll get to that.The space reminds me of Ssam Bar or Ko, minimalist decor, with a heavy emphasis on modern wood paneling. Large windows allow plenty of sunlight, and the dreary views of 9th Ave, while a small bar offers seating for close to 12 people. Sitting in the corner at a large 5 top, we had a great view of the space and quickly settled in and scanned the menu. The offerings have changed a few times since the spot first opened, but for the most part there are always 7 pies with a rotating special. Fortunately for us, being a large party allowed for the opportunity to try a number of pies so we quickly ordered up. To start we had two salads, the Butter Lettuce and Escarole salads. The Escarole salad came with bread crumbs, anchovies, capers, lemon and olive oil, while the Butter Lettuce came with roasted butternut squash, pumpkin seeds, lemon and olive oil. I was glad we ordered these salad to help provide some greens in our lunch diet, but neither was remarkable and at $7, they were quite similar and small.We came here for pizza and that's what we looked forward too. Each pizza came out at a different time, not too sure why, but it worked to our benefit, allowing us to enjoy each creation straight out of the oven. We first attacked the Flambe, a gooey, cheesey creation with plenty of large bacon chunks scattered atop it. The bechamel, parmesan and buffalo mozzarella melded perfectly with the sweet carmelized onions and salty bacon. The Flambe, in my opinion, is enough reason to visit Jim Lahey's Co.. Next on the docket was the special pie, topped with sausage, leeks and breadcrumbs (the other details escape me) and a pretty intense char around one side of the pie. Despite the char, which for the most part I enjoyed, the pizza was good, but just missing something. A little salt would have gone a long way here, but the combination of ingedients did work well. Halfway through our pizza fest the much talked about Ham and Cheese pie was plopped down in the center of the table. A gorgeous pie, blanketed by paper-thin slices of proscuitto, you could actually see the charred spots through the delicious strands of pork. Beneath the meat was pecorino, gruyere, buffalo mozzarella and caraway seeds, which added a creamy, sweet and salty note to the pizza. The fatty ends of the proscuitto melted into the crust, a beautiful sight we quickly gobbled up.The tail end of our lunch featured the simplest pies, the Amalfi and Margherita. The Amalfi, described as having green olives, anchovies and chilis was remarkably underwhelming. It was presented by Chef/Breadmaker/Pizza Guy Jim Lahey with the comment \"we tried something a little different here\", but we were never really told what was different. Regardless, the pungent anchovies we longed for were hiding somewhere we couldn't find them and the chilis overpowered every flavor of the pie. The Margherita, the standard to which I hold all pizzeria's against, was unfortunately dissappointing. A slightly different dough preparation than the others, which by the way were all very delicious, crispy and thin, this dough was a bit more pillowy. The dough wasn't the problem though, an overly sweet and watery tomato sauce left pools of liquid scattered over the pie and the lack of sufficient cheese left half the pie relatively naked. The saving grace was when we bit into a cheesy, basil topped bite with a thin layer of sauce, but these were few and far between.Overall Co. offers some superb pizzas, albeit expensive, the restaurant has plenty of promise. Service during lunch was good, attentive and kind, and when split amongst a few diners it is easy to keep the cost down and try a number of items. Ordering wine quickly rises the price, but it's all about the pizza here, and of the five we had, two of them were amazing, one was good, one mediocre and one quite poor; not bad for only a month old. I expect to be drawn back for those two great ones and with Lahey's creative mind it is no doubt there will be other delicious creations on the menu soon. If you are looking for a comparison to other pizzerias don't try to compare it to the big name slice or traditional joints, think more L'asso or Frannys (which in my opinion Co. is much better than), the creative, contemporary pizza spots with plenty of high-quality ingredients. Enjoy, and keep eating. 230 9th Ave, New York, NY 10001, 212-243-1105, Reservations - Not Available, Price - Moderate

Valentines Day is cause for many to gather the cash (or credit card) and book a table at the hottest, most romantic recipe in the city. But that's just the problem. Valentines Day is an overpriced, overhyped day of spending which brings out some of the more sappy menu items seen all year. Some restaurants offer great deals and book up fast, others, well others fill there menus with oysters, lobster and champagne, charging a premium and reeling in unsuspecting diners. This year was different with more couples (or hopeful couples) dining at home than ever before. With everyone saving more money these days it is no surprise. For me, a home cooked meal was just the plan, as it generally is, but this year was special. I had landed a complimentary rack of American Lamb, meaty, fresh and already \"Frenched\" so this was the centerpiece of the meal. The three course meal went as follows:1. Roasted Beet Salad with Frisee Lettuce, Toasted Walnuts, Goat Cheese and Champagne Vinaigrette2. Pistachio Pesto Crusted Rack of Lamb Wrapped in Bacon with Roasted Fingerling Potatoes and a Kale White Bean Saute3. Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake with a Cinnamon Graham Cracker CrustThe salad, a common menu item at restaurants around the country was simple and only required a light vinaigrette of champagne vinegar, good olive oil, salt, pepper, lemon juice and honey.The rack of American Lamb recipe was adapted from a Ferran Adria recipe on Food & Wine. Adria may be known for his molecular gastronomy at El Bulli, but this shows another side of his cooking (and genius). I took Adria's lead, but made my own changes, choosing bacon over pancetta, adding some lemon juice into the pesto, making extra pesto and choosing to prepare the scallions a slightly different way. Regardless, the combination of the fresh herbs, delightful pistachios and fatty bacon melded perfectly with the lamb and made for a great lunch the next day. The rack was cut into double chops and served with roasted fingerling potatoes (cooked with thyme, cayenne and garlic)and a saute of kale, white beans, lemon juice, nutmeg and vegetable stock. To wrap up the meal my beautiful girlfriend decided to make a white chocolate raspberry cheesecake complete with homemade cinnamon graham cracker crust. The cake was appropriately sweet with hints of slightly sour raspberry and an addictive crust (my favorite part). We paired a Pinot Noir with the American Lamb which kept up with the bold flavors while a Port from Portugal helped us wash down the cheesecake. All in all, one of the best Valentines Day meals I've had in or out of a restaurant.

This past week two places opened up in Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, Cornelius the new scotch/bourbon/vodka bar in the old Noona space and Cataldo's the Italian-American, red sauce spot next to Le Gamin. Both very different, targeting different locals and only days old. I've been excited about both, seeing a new watering hole and a hopeful step up to the poor slice joints (Antonio's and Gino's) within a short walking distance from my home.First stop, Cornelius, the handsome bar/restaurant on the corner of Pacific and Vanderbilt. Formerly the home of Noona, a modern Korean spot from the owners of Soda and Le Gamin. With a few decorative and structural details remaining from the previous restaurant Cornelius is a very warm, inviting, comfortable space. A long bar extends through more than half of the restaurant with banquets and a rear, slightly elevated, space rounding out the seating. More importantly, the bar is a drinkers dream. Stacked with bottles upon bottles of all varieties of scotch, bourbon, whiskey and vodka you could go for months without trying the same bottle twice. Our final count was 90 whiskeys, scotches and bourbons, but that didn't even include anything below the counter or in storage. A cocktail menu is also impressive, not as much as the neighboring Weather Up, but these drinks still hold their own and at $10 they are reasonably priced for the quality. A booklet with all of the drinks appears endless and prices for the most part stay under $16 for everything, but the super high-end pours and flights are available for everything on the menu.When it comes to food I had high expectations. Former sous-chef from Freemans, Michelle Hanna, offers a menu originally clad with fried chicken, burgers, pulled pork sliders and more. I saw a new weekly spot in the making. Much to my dismay not only did they change the menu right before opening, but the food was just not executed that well. I ordered the burger ($10) which came with cheddar, housemade pickles and fries, but what I got was sadly embarrassing. A brioche bun (housemade and quite dry) hid my burger from sight and was coated with the thinnest piece of yellow cheddar, so thin I was able to see right through the cheese. It is a pet peeve of mine when a bun is bigger than the burger. I do not order burgers for bread, but for meat, so why would someone give me more bread than meat? Fries were matchstick, fast-food type fries that were just boring. A salad of roasted tomatoes, goat cheese, figs and arugula was simple, pleasing and more satisfying than the burger, which by the way was over cooked. Although my first food experience was disappointing I will give the food another shot, perhaps the pulled pork sliders or mac and cheese, and even if the food fails I know there is now a new watering hole, one with an amazing amount of unique, well-priced alcohols that will surely keep me busy.Just a few yards away is Cataldo's, a new Italian-American red sauce joint next to French spot Le Gamin. Cataldo's was a welcome addition in my eyes, a new option for red sauce that won't run my wallet dry. They don't sell slices, but when you want a chicken parm or other similar sandwich or platter it's always good to have a solid option, especially one that delivers. Walking in I was a bit caught off guard. The restaurant is rather small when it comes to seating, but more importantly a giant counter full of hot steam trays contains the pasta's, meatballs, lasagna and more. I was a bit confused, not expecting to see this outside of a dining hall, cafeteria or even hole in the wall joint with a lack of retail space. Here we have a rather large restaurant that has a huge steam counter taking up valuable seating. Oh well, I don't know the details, or blueprints of the place so moving on.I was immediately deterred from ordering any pasta or chicken/veal/meatball variety as it appeared nothing was made to order so pizza it was. A wood-fired pizza oven, decorated with a unique stone pattern rests in the back. Pizza's were pulled out every so often and they looked quite large. Ordering up two pizzas, an artichoke, mushroom and olive pie, and the sausage and broccoli rabe pie. Excited for both, that excitement quickly faded when the pies were brought to the table. The first pie, with the artichoke and mushrooms, was full of canned vegetables. Canned artichokes, canned mushrooms (seriously?!), canned olives and what tasted like a canned sauce. It was bland, limp and overall a disaster. The sausage and broccoli rabe pie was a bit more enjoyable, but still fell quite short of being good. Low quality sausage topped extremely bitter broccoli rabe (a little acid would have gone a long way here) and again the bland sauce and limp crust appeared. Making it half way through the two pies (each are 12\") we gave up, no longer hungry or enjoying the pizza. Disappointing, very, but I hope the place does well. In these troubling economic times I wish every restaurant success. Even if I did not enjoy my experience, others may, but I will be taking my money elsewhere.Cornelius: 565 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY, 718-398-6662, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($15-30/person)Cataldo's: 554 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, NY, 718-857-6700, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($10-20/person)

So here it is. Right around the corner. The Super Bowl is here, this Sunday as a sports fan it is one of the biggest days of the year. As a food lover the occasion is also something I always look forward to. Super Bowl Sunday has historically been a day to let loose, eat junk food and drink some beers while screaming at the television. While I've shared some of those moments I like to change up the food a bit, step away from the ordinary and put a bit more effort and quality into the spread. Don't get me wrong, there are plenty of cheesy, spicy, meaty items to be had and I love pizza, wings and chili.The media around the country has been rounding up the best \"dude foods\", healthy snacks and the best delivery places. NYmag has a great roundup of massive subs you can order. Serious Eats recommends RUB's chicken wings for your party. Chow writes up a \"playbook\" with recipes and suggestions. Food & Wine has a number of suggestions, like Michael Symon's recipes. There are plenty of great resources out there, but the biggest thing is not to overdue it. I'm generally one who goes a bit too far, maybe an extra dish here or there, but this year, the goal is prep as much beforehand as possible so that the game can be enjoyed.Without any stadium dip (this is just insane and impressive) or team colored cookies I am expecting to have:Cheese and Charcuterie PlateGuacamoleBlue Cheese Walnut DipCheesy Artichoke DipHomemade Pita ChipsBuffalo WingsFrench Dip Sandwiches with Horseradish Cream Sauce and Au JusChocolate Chip or Snickerdoodle Cookies (made by my girlfriend the talented baker)It may seem like a lot, but a good portion of this can be made the day before or the morning of letting me kick back, relax and watch the game (and maybe some of the commercials). Expect pictures and a full recap after the food/beer/football hangover subsides.

This past weekend was food filled, from a cooking class and demonstration to a serene, lengthy meal; plenty of great tastes and memorable moments:Al Di La: One of my favorite restaurants in Brooklyn and throughout the city, Friday was a feast like no other. Beginning with the restaurants addictive and bold tripe slider the meal was in full swing. Following was a menu to remember with escarole and pancetta salad, grilled chard stems with an anchovy rub, perfect tagliatelle la ragu, rich and comforting squid ink risotto, calf's liver with onions and grilled polenta and a trio of gelatos including fennel and black pepper. A remarkably prepared, seasoned and presented meal it raised my already stellar opinion of Al Di La.Rosa Mexicano: On Saturday Rosa hosted a Real Men Cook Mexican: Official Guide to a Mexican Super Bowl Party demonstration and luncheon. Among the items cooked and served there was a delicious black bean and ground skirt steak chili. Packed with spice and flavor it was served with cheese, sour cream and tortilla chips. Interestingly enough the black bean stock or liquid from the cans was used in the soup, something I never would have thought to do. To top it all off, the class was FREE for all guys.Market Table: Without skipping a beat Mikey Price always seems to move seamlessly between seasons and this meal was no exception. A bevy of food was ordered, but the homemade parpadelle with braised lamb shank was remarkable. Meaty, perfectly seasoned and comforting, the dish is only a special, but may find its way onto the menu soon. A butterscotch pudding, light, airy and with an ideal balance of sweetness finished the meal accompanied by a smooth Muscato.

James, the relative newcomer to the Brooklyn dining scene, will roll out a bar snacks menu starting tonight. No menu was available yesterday, but expect their addictive fries, marinated olives, bruschetta's of some kind and more. Not a bad idea considering the bar area is gorgeous and can seat close to 10 people. I'm sure more restaurants with bars will begin to do the same over the coming months.605 Carlton Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, 718-942-4255

The understated exterior of Taro in Park Slope may make you think twice before stepping in for sushi, but push through the ugliness of Flatbush Avenue and into the cramped, yet cozy, restaurant for some fresh seafood rewards. Many locals argue that Taro offers the best sushi in the neighborhood and I certainly don't disagree that it is one of the better options. What's most important about dining at Taro is being adventurous, deviating away from the standard spicy tuna or California roll for something not commonly found at places like this. With the likes of big shot Blue Ribbon Sushi down the street on 5th Avenue and the always popular neighborhood spot Geido, Taro finds away to offer something different without really trying that hard.The restaurant is cramped, with a small counter seating close to 8 and a number of 2 and 4 tops bringing the total occupancy to around 25. The menu initially appears rather normal, with the standard rolls, pieces and kitchen entrees, complete with entertaining photos of each dish. However, there is much more to the restaurant than what the initial menu gaze provides. Look further at the special menu, there are occasionally two of these for some strange reason. Items like monkfish liver with it's susprisingly light, creamy texture is apparently the \"#1 appetizer\", an interesting claim, or the variety of omakase offerings. Even the fish selection is unique with butterfish, giant clam, trigger fish, bonito, horse mackerel and more available with new options coming in seasonally. I have thoroughly enjoyed the scallop and uni special, served as a split raw scallop topped generously with uni and a sweet soy-based sauce which was quickly hit with some heat from a blow torch. The light, smooth textured bite was one I'll never forget.On a recent visit I ordered the 6 piece omakase complete with miso soup with a number of succulent clams. The omakase came with fatty bluefin tuna, ruby red tuna, horse mackerel, bonito, sweet shrimp and uni. To top it all of the kitchen fried up the sweet shrimp heads (fully edible) and topped it with a ponzu like sauce. All of the fish was delectable, each remarkably fresh with my favorites being the fatty bluefin and horse mackarel. For the money, you can't find a better selection of fresh fish in the area and perhaps beyond.Although I recommend experimenting at Taro you certainly don't have to. Staple rolls and those two bite behemoth rolls are done very well here and are priced quite reasonably. The Mountain, filled with tuna, yellowtail, avocado and tobiko rises tall from the plate and is quite a hearty, tasty bite. The dragon roll with eel, cucumber and avocado is always delicious as are the variety of spicy rolls. You won't find anything overly ambitious or creative in the roll department, but rest assured the fish will be as fresh as can be. Don't forget to wash it down with a 21oz beer and what appear to be endless pitchers of green tea. Taro brings superbly fresh fish and seafood to an unlikely location, and what's more remarkable, it is packed almost every night. Kind service, comfortable albeit tight quarters, reasonable prices and superb product is their recipe to success.446 Dean St, Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718) 398-0872, Reservations - Recommended On A Busy Night, Price - Moderate ($20-30/person)

This past Saturday was a doozy, freezing outside and just completely uninviting. Enter Momofuku Milkbar, the space was cozy, warm and hopping around 4pm. I've never been during the day and have always had to order the sweets, not that I'm complaining, but now I had a chance to have some of the savory items. We ordered up the english muffin and the pork and egg bun. The english muffin is the standard to which all english muffins should be held to, fried in pork fat with a crispy exterior and soft chewy interior it was delicious. I would have liked a bit more meat in there with the wonderful runny egg, but it was not a deal breaker. The pork and egg bun stole the show. Not just based on taste, but on the sheer size of it. This beast of a bun is easily twice the size of a normal Momofuku pork bun and when filled with a runny poached egg a mess quickly insues after the first bite. However, the combination of the fatty, unctuous pork belly, sweet hoisin, crunchy cucumbers and rich egg yolk makes this a heart-stopping, can't miss breakfast (or any meal for that matter) sandwich. I'll just have to wait till I can have one again so my body can bounce back.

Two new openings in my neighborhood, Prospect Heights, are official. Cornelius, in the former Noona spot on Vanderbilt, is now a bar serving burgers, mac and cheese, bbq pork sliders, fried chicken, creative cocktails and high-end booze. Check out the menu here from Thrillist. Just down the block, a new Italian joint complete with a wood-fired oven opened on Monday, it's called Cataldo's. This spot has been long in making, but hopefully will offer a nice change of pace from Gino's and Antonio's, the poor Italian spots nearby.South Gate will be hosting a series of events dubbed, Studio at South Gate, \"a consecutive five-week series of culinary classes, offering an inside look at the restaurant's unique epicurean elements.\" Classes are $35, a relative deal considering the normal restaurant prices, and range from a fish tutorial (purchasing, preparing, etc.) to wine buying for any occasion. For more info call the restaurant or check here.In a only mildly surprising move, Alto, Michael White's upscale Italian spot, has waved their corking fee. Now we know restaurants are doing whatever they can to keep business coming, but for a place with such a notable, pricey wine list this may be the start of a new trend. Will more restaurants become BYOB spots? Check out the NYPost for more on the story.L'Artusi, the newly opened West Village spot from the Dell'Anima guys, will be hosting wine events led by Beverages Director (and wine prodigy) Joey Campanale. The events are not cheap, but offer unique, intimate opportunities to sample delicious wines along with food pairings from Chef Gab Thompson. More info here.With the economy struggling, spending for a food event may seem a bit excessive. Enter the Village Voice and there affordably priced Choice Eats event. At $35 the price is right for an opportunity to taste Christina Tosi's delectable Milkbar creations, the always popular BBQ from Fette Sau, Peter Hoffman's grub from Back Forty, tacos from Pinche Taqueria, pizza from Motorino and much much more. For more details click here.To the shock of no one, restaurant week will likely be extended through February. Thanks Crain's for the hot tip.An unfortunate review of L'Artusi from Alan Richman of GQ.

On Saturday Jimmy No. 43 hosted a delicious event, the Cassoulet Cookoff, complete with a bevy of area cooks, chefs and cassoulet lovers. The event provided food and drinks (not free of course) to food lovers looking to keep warm as the temperatures hovered in the single digits. Seven total cassoulet's were served ranging from the traditional with beans and sausage to the less traditional vegetarian version. All proceeds helped the greenmarket and all sausages were from greenmarket vendors. A full run down of the competitors are below with pictures:#1: Cathy Erway, Not Eating Out in New York - an extremely sweet version complete with maple-cured sausage, ham hocks and apple cider. A great aroma the dish was just too swett for my taste and lacked the meat I was looking for.#2: Andrew Field, Rockaway Taco and Rice - this vegetarian option through me for a loop, but I went in with an open mind. Unfortunately the lack of any meat left it bland and more like a vegetable soup.#3: Chef Phillip Kirschen Clark, formerly of Wd-50 and Pegu Club - unfortunately I did not have any of this cassoulet and it was the one I looked forward to more than anything. Either it was so good it ran out quickly or the chef just did not plan ahead and made too little.#4: Melissa Rebholz, cook, former greenmaket manager - there definitely was some meat in this cassoulet; sausage, ham hocks, and lamb breast which employed a rich flavor, the one I had been craving. Unfortunately the beans had been overcooked and reduced to mush ruining the texture of a delicious dish. I did enjoy the taste of this so it falls to 2nd or 3rd in my book.#5: Jimmy's No. 43 - the housemade cassoulet had a great smokey essence to it, but was just a little too thin for my taste. A good balance of meat and beans it would have benefited from a little pop in the oven uncovered to help dry it out a bit.#6: Kelly Geary, Sweet Deliverance - the bread crumb topping on this offered a nice bit of texture and although it was overcooked and a little dry the flavor was spot on. Since it was overcooked the beans and meat all seemed to share the same texture, but it was hearty, meaty and definitely comforting.#7: Chef Mark Bello, Pizza A Casa - well rounded, with bold flavors, the combination of duck confit, sausage, cannelini beans and the toasted bread crumb topping made this the winner in my book. Great texture, not too dry and everythig I wanted on this freezing cold day.Overall the event was a hit, plenty of good eats, great crowd and quality music. There will be more events like this throughout the year so stay tuned and check Jimmy's No. 43 for more information. Full menu below.

El Gran Castillo de Jagua has always intrigued me. This corner restaurant just off Flatbush Avenue in Prospect Heights has an old, ugly facade and whenever I walk by all I smell is grease. It's not the most welcoming image or smell, but I knew one day I would stop in, I just didn't know if it would be a one time thing. A recent dinner turned into a lazy thrown together meal and a rotisserie chicken was needed. El Gran Castillo has plenty of these and they are cheap so I figured why not.Stepping into the restaurant you are immediately confronted with smells of roasted meats and a strong, impenetrable aroma of grease. In the restaurant it is slightly more enjoyable than walking on the sidewalk towards the Crunch gym across the street, but I was still hesitant and kept my low expectations. Ordering up a half chicken I was surprised to see the bill come to a ridiculously low $5.80 or so, a meal for two potentially for less than $6, that's a steal. Okay, it's cheap, always a good thing, but is it good? Well there are definitely some complaints: too much salt, too greasy, a bit fatty, but for the most part it was pretty good. A nice fall back meal during uncertain and unstable economic times for anyone in the surrounding neighborhood. I decided to go back and on a recent visit and ordered up the cubano. Again keeping my expectations in check this was a bit more disappointing. In cubano's I expect two things, tender roast pork and crunchy flattened bread. The other ingredients, while important, don't play as large of a role. In this case I actually had to make some improvements back at home to make the sandwich more enjoyable. In retrospect it's nice to be able to pick up a cubano so close to home, not too many spots nearby can even offer this. Perhaps visiting on the earlier side would result in more succulent roast pork.My experience on both occassions wasn't mind-blowing by any means, but I certainly will give El Gran Castillo de Jagua another shot. Perhaps for the pepper steak, or the oxtail or maybe again for the chicken on one of the lazy weekday nights. With the economy the way it is any budget-friendly dining option is a welcome addition, especially when they churn out so many different dishes at an alarming pace.345 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn 11238, Reservations - Absolutely Not, Price - Inexpensive ($6-15/person)

Somehow I lucked out this past Saturday. I brought a friend down to Difara's after building it up for years. He had never been and was eager to sink his teeth into Dom's famous pizza. I was concerned the wait might turn him off or that we would fall victim to the occasional burnt pie that Dom forgot about in the oven. I opted for an early arrival, convinced that with the incoming snowstorm we may be in luck if we get there by noon. Well we certainly lucked out. Walking in there were perhaps 6 others waiting for pizza with a pie already being sliced up and handed out. Before we could even place our order Dom looked up and asked \"anybody want a plain pie? Anyone?\" Quickly realizing it was completely up for grabs we claimed the pie and were seated with the beautiful pizza within 5 minutes of arriving at the pizzeria. Our wait for the square with sausage (amazing by the way) ended up being close to 1 hour, but the mere fact that we got a whole pie so quickly made up for any wait time. The pizza gods certainly were looking down on us.

It's been a crazy year for me, including everyone in the city and around the world. The food world seems to have peaked in the middle of the year before the economic crisis, but looking back 2008 should mean more than just economic troubles. There were plenty of good times, dishes and trips. It's now been 1 year since I started this blog and I've seen it evolve (for the better) in many many ways. It will still change, still improve and most of all still continue to feature great eats from NYC and beyond. Thanks for reading and lets look forward to a delicious 2009. Some highlights from the past year:My first trip to DiFara'sThe long, filling meal at Beacon's Kitchen Counter Meal of the year at Momofuku KoPlenty of BBQ on that blistering hot day during the Big Apple BBQ FestivalMy fist visit to the meat temple, Peter LugersGreat dining in ArubaSomehow Degustation got even betterRevelatory meal at Blue Hill Stone BarnsThe unforgettable dining and events of the NYC Wine & Food FestivalDelectable sweets at Momofuku Milkbar/BakeryTop tastes of 2008Where to eat in 2009

2008 was quite the year for NYC restaurants (and the country for that matter). Great new spots like Momofuku Ko, Convivio, Eighty One, L'Artusi, Corton, Allegretti and many more opened up with throngs of foodies dining, drinking and talking about their experiences. Now that we're fully into 2009 I've formed a list, that will of course be ongoing, of places I aim to visit throughout the year. Some may be brand new, others may be older, but necessary. I'm embarrassed about a few on the list, not because they are bad restaurants, but more because it's shocking I've never made it there yet.Always taking suggestions and please comment if you feel a spot on my list is not worth the time, money or even space on the blog.

Some hate restaurant week, others love it. I fall somewhere in the middle. It has it's place, I get it and for the most part I happily participate in the good offers. However, there are may people taken advantage of, those who haphazardly book tables at good or even mediocre restaurants are are served even worse food than normal. A few words of advice when booking your spots, be smart. If the restaurant already offers a special prix fixe menu close to or even less than the Winter Restaurant Week menu then skip it. Call ahead if you can and ask about the menu otherwise you may be subjected to the chicken, pasta, salmon options and sorely disappointed. I've had some success, and one failure, dining out during restaurant week, below are a few suggestions:Anything from Danny Meyer, the man knows how to treat customers and doesn't skimp during this promotion. Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe, Blue Smoke and The Modern are all participating to some extent.Jean-Georges spots generally list the menu ahead of time, but also some of them offer prix fixe menus year round. Look into, but don't run for Perry Street and Mercer Kitchen, with a strong recommendation for his elder Jojo. Steakhouses can be hit or miss, sometimes they are worth it, other times a huge waste. A few recommendations (in my opinion), but none of them are can't miss: Angelo and Maxie's, Delmonico's, Primehouse, Porterhouse, Smith & Wollensky, and the still uber-popular The PalmA few of my can't miss suggestions: Anthos, Aquavit, Artisinal, Bar Boulud, Bar Stuzzichini, BarBao, Bread Bar, Cafe Boulud, Convivio, Del Posto, Devi, Dovetail, Eleven Madison Park, EN Japanese Brasserie, Esca, Gotham Bar & Grill, Gramercy Tavern, Jojo, Lupa, Lure Fishbar, Matsugen, Morimoto, Payard, Tabla, Telepan, The Modern, Tribeca Grill and Union Square CafeEnjoy!

It's true. When it is super busy at a restaurant because of events like \"Restaurant Week\", most restaurants limit selection and prep more than usual to meet the expected demands. Mass feedings are just that- not interested either.Dat Todat@restaurantjobboard.comhttp://www.RestaurantJobBoard.com/Blog

Lunch Feast at Don's Bogam

***CONTENT
With the work week shortened by the New Years eve celebration and the office relatively empty, a trip up to Koreatown for lunch seemed logical. The great decision could have quickly gone wrong had we stumbled into the wrong spot, but through prior experience a friend of mine brought us to Don's Bogam, a sleek, somewhat dated, Korean spot slightly off the beaten path and beyond the many, more familiar spots on 32nd street.Entering the restaurant there was a small bar, filled with empty decorative wine and sake bottles and a festive (and funny) marshmallow wreath. Beyond the front bar, the restaurant requires a step up to enter the many bbq booths complete with modern, copper accented exhaust systems. With a full view of the kitchen, where all the chopping, frying and cleaning is only feet away, the seating is comfortable albeit a little awkward to get into. Don's Bogam offers an unbeatable lunch special. It's easy to keep your budget down and fill yourself up for the day, nothing really exceeds $14 during lunch.As with many Korean spots a littany of small plates (or banchan) comes to the table before anything else arrives. Sometimes these plates are rather dissappointing, something that may have been created earlier than need be, but plates at Don's Bogam were delicious. The tiny crispy fish were addictive, as were the spicy, smokey, thinly sliced squid and the vinegary bean sprouts. The kimchi was good, but not phenomenal, and the other 3-4 dishes were forgettable. A seafood pancake, stuffed with oysters, also arrived, I personally wasn't a fan, but the table enjoyed it.Main dishes really impressed, a delicious trio of bibimbap was ordered, including the spicy seafood, marinated short ribs and the spicy pork and chive. Each served in a piping hot clay bowl with the delicious crispy rice just waiting to be eaten. The seafood variety came packed with shrimp, mussels, octopus and squid as well as an assortment of vegetables, it was rich, fresh and my favorite of the three. We also ordered the \"bo\" special, marinated short ribs on a scolding hot platter over sliced onions with rice and soup. The meat was seasoned nicely and being a short rib lover it was hard not to enjoy the rich, tender and comforting dish on this cold snowy day. Washed down with a few OB's (Korean beers), the food was for the most part, spot on, affordable and worth coming back night or day. While the decor may leave something to be desired, the food is worth every penny.17 East 32nd St, New York, NY 10016, 212-683-2200, Reservation - Not Needed, Price - Moderate ($15-25/person for lunch)

There always appears to be a scramble when making plans for New Years Eve. So close to the holidays and so many options, but this year the plan is to be more frugal. Dining options are anywhere from $350 (Le Cirque) to straight a la carte, but more and more people are staying home or going to apartment/house parties. Here are a few options in case you have been procrastinating (thanks to all the online sources for helping compile this list):A night at Hill Country is always a good time, and this year they are offering a nice package for tonight's celebration. Eater has more details, but with an open bar, live band and a variety of drink packages, this is sure to be a hopping spot.Per NYMag, Motorino in Williamsburg, one of the hottest pizzerias in town, is offering a $30 prix fixe and BYOB. Splurge on the black-truffle pie if you dare. Although L'Artusi is offering a $175 package, which includes a multi-course meal and drinks throughout the evening, they are also offering an 11pm-2am drink only package available for $60. Considering Joey Campanale's affinity for choosing great wines that is a pretty good deal.Newcomer this year, Almond in the Flatiron district, will be offering a reasonably priced 4-course menu for $65/person. The menu sounds quite delicious and considering it always has a festive atmosphere I expect the place to be very festive. More on the Feedbag.Pamplona is offering a $70/person 4-course menu which includes cava and some of Alex Urena's delicious celebratory creationsAll of the Rosa Mexicano's are offering a $55 multi-course meal with multiple seatings and a DJ and party favors to help ring in the New YearTaboon on the far westside is offering a $65 5-course menu complete with champagne before 9pm. Go for the addictive housemade flatbread then walk down the street (if you dare) for the insanity in midtownFor a free show far away from the madness that is Times Square, visit Brooklyn's Grand Army Plaza for fireworks and a musical performance. Show starts prior to midnight and continues into 2009. Brown bagging is a popular thing to do (although I would never advocate such a thing...)Happy New Year Everyone! Speak to you in 2009!

***CONTENT
On this rainy and cold Christmas Eve I ventured downtown to Spotted Pig for my first meal at the famed gastro-pub. It has been on my list for years, but for some reason I never managed to get my act together and make it to April Bloomfield's much heralded spot. The lunch crowd was thin, being that it was a holiday and disgusting outside so we were immediately ushered upstairs to a quiet table. I already liked the place, a hodge-podge of decorations, pictures and other assorted attic finds, it was my kind of spot. Besides the backless stools I was a fan. More important though was the food, and by the looks of the heaping plates of fries and other dishes I wasn't too worried.Unfortunately my trip hit a minor speedbump. Always one to appreciate and gravitate towards a good burger in the city, I had planned to order the burger for lunch. No dice. They were apparently out of the burger, something I simply cannot wrap my head around. To make matters worse, as I sat there in my confused and dissappointed state the \"last\" burger was served just feet away to another diner. After a few minutes I pushed on, helping to select the last of our dishes, all of which we would be sharing. Some deviled eggs, chicken liver toast, a hearty bowl of the haddock chowder, the famous ricotta gnudi and the cubano (taking the place of the burger). We also ordered a bottle of rose wine, a nice sweet compliment to our rather heavy meal.The deviled eggs and chicken liver toast arrived first. The eggs were good, not amazing, but good and something I would recommend to any egg fan. The toast on the other hand was delicious. It was rich without being too heavy and was served atop grilled or toasted country bread making for a wonderful combination of textures. Topping it with some olive oil was also a nice touch.The entrees arrived and we could hardly contain ourselves. The gnudi was the first to be attacked, drenched in a brown butter and sage sauce, these little morsels were wonderful. The fresh and light sheep's milk ricotta filling was remarkably addictive and we found ourselves all but licking the bowl clean of the brown butter. The chowder was thick and chunky, just how I like my chowders and the perfect food for a day like today. A variety of vegetables mingled with the chunks of haddock and the homemade oyster crackers added a nice crunch to the dish. I was impressed by the cubano, not something I would generally expect to find on the Pig's menu, but it was delicious albeit a bit expensive. Nice crusty bread, pressed around a decent amount of roasted pork, it didn't beat the cubano at say Milanese or another Spanish restaurant, but was a nice upscale alternative. I would have preferred more pickles, or cornichons in this case, but overall a nice sandwich. For the most part the meal went smoothly, nice service, good food and good company. I was happily surprised to find the bill at about $35 a person for food, wine, tip and tax, but still find it a bit expensive for what the food is. Regardless, I'll be back and when I am I won't need a menu, just that elusive burger.314 W 11th St #,New York, NY 10014(212) 620-0393, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($20-50/person)

On a rather quiet and boring stretch of 25th street, Milanese with it's dark red awning is an escape from the bland sandwich shops, subpar sushi spots and forgettable fast food joints. Here at Milanese you do not come for the ambiance, but the food. Delicious, cheap and served in generous portions, this Spanish restaurant is a savior for many of us working in the area. Entering the restaurant you are smacked in the face with bold smells and a bustling scene. A counter serves the regulars to your left and seating is in the rear. Waitresses are slinging food to diners left and right with a quick smile before moving onto the next task. Everything slows down though when you get that first bite of food in your mouth. Milanese offers a breadth of Spanish staples with a few Americanized dishes as well. Lunch specials range from stewed chicken to the more interesting goat meat and even spare ribs. Each lunch special comes with rice and beans or plantains. Other dishes include breaded steak, ox tail, a range of soups and a nice selection of sandwiches. On this blustery winter day I shared the stewed chicken with yellow rice and black beans, stewed goat with fried plantains and the cubano. The chicken was moist and tender, not to mention a heaping portion. The accompanying rice and beans were delicious; the beans were stewed with a onions, peppers and spices imparting a rich, addictive flavor. The goat served as chunks still on the bone was good, but a tad inconsistent. Some pieces were succulent and fell of the bone while others needed some more cooking. Regardless the sauce was quite good and the fried plantains we ordered, served halved, were well prepared and could easily feed a few people. The cubano may have been the defining dish of the meal, perfeclty prepared and well priced (around $6) it was worth coming back for many times over. Each ingredient played a role in the overall taste of the sandwich and it was clear the restaurant does not skimp on their cubanos. I look forward to getting back to Milanese for a leisurely, inexpensive and most of all delicious lunch sometime soon. With this weather, it's also important to know that they do deliver within the neighborhood. 168 w 25th st, (212) 352-0755, New York, NY, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($6-15/person) Update: After a recent visit, and subsequent food coma, I tried a few more dishes. The bistec, or minute steak with red onions is delicious and works well as a sandwich or platter. Spare ribs are rather large, but unfortunately produce limited meat, albeit super tender and moist. Tostones are a bit disappointing but dip them in some of the meat juice and you are good to go.

A New Reason For Me To Go To The UWS

I'm not one to generally travel to the UWS. It's a far trip from my Brooklyn home and for the most part I can get everything I need food wise downtown and in Brooklyn. This year there has been an UWS renaissance of sorts with restaurants opening left and right. Bar Boulud, West Branch, Shake Shack the new Kefi, to name a few, and now Salumeria Rosi. I made my way up to Salumeria Rosi not too long ago looking forward to delicious cured meats courtesy of Parmacotto and Cesare Casella, but what I found was much more than a meat counter.Upon entering the space you are first met with dozens of different cured meats. For any carnivore it is a beautiful sight and the neighborhood seems to have quickly embraced the new restaurant. To the right of the restaurant there are approximately 25 or so seats under a gorgeous and inventive sculpture of Italy. The place was bustling when I went, but we were fortunate enough to get a table after a glass of wine. With servers moving rather seamlessly around the restaurant and Casella greeting everyone he could see, I found the restaurant extremely welcoming. In looking at the menu you will see there is much more than just meat, with extensive offerings ranging from Spanish mackerel to braised brisket.With a group of four hungry eaters we ordered up a feast which included many small plates and plenty of highlights. Always a fan of brussels sprouts, the Cavolini is served with pancetta and garlic a classic combination. One of Casella's signature dishes, the Insalata Pontormo is a must for anyone visiting the restaurant. A mixture of soft scrambled egg, pancetta and market greens, it is quite addictive and remarkably simple. A leek and pancetta tart was absolutely delicious and a nice homey dish. I was a fan of the butternut squash risotto's , Cavolfiori Gratinati, creaminess and beautiful orange color. A few of the meat dishes were ordered, like the braised brisket with polenta, stewed tripe and pasta with cured pork and we found a common theme. Everything was prepared perfectly, but with a tad too much salt. I tend to believe we were just unlucky though as on subsequent visits fellow eaters have not been faced with the same issue.Of course I can't talk about Salumeria Rosi without mentioning the cured meats we samples, and we sampled a good amount. Ordering up the Selexione del Salumeria, or grand selection pretty much, we had the opportunity to taste Prosciutto Arrosto, Mortadella di Bologna, Prosciutto di Parma, Coppa, Finocchiona, Speck Alto and the Arista. The proscuitto's were superb, wonderfully seasoned and sliced paper thin. I was a huge fan of the smokey speck and the boldy flavored Finocchiona seasoned with fennel. These two also had a great ratio of meat to fat (of course plenty of fat). For anyone visiting the Salumeria, do yourself a favor and order up a plate of the meats, best when shared with friends so you get a few bites of each.After all of the cured meats and shared plates we felt it only appropriate to order dessert and the standout of the bunch was the poached pear in red wine, Pere al Vino Rosso. It was delicious, tender and quite soothing, especially on this rainy weekday night. The restaurant also offers an extensive wine list, including after dinner drinks and if you did not get a chance to try some of the meats just grab some to go as they slice to order whatever you need. Overall a very enjoyable experience and perhaps the final reason for me to get up to the UWS more frequently.283 Amsterdam Ave., New York, NY 10023, 212-877-4800, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate ($30-50/person)

The Obligatory Best Things I Ate in 2008 List

***CONTENT
It's that time of the year, where foodies reminisce about what they ate in 2008 and the media selects their favorite meals, dishes, bites, etc. It's been a great year for food (with the exception of the current recession) and for New York City dining. I've had some great meals and some terrible meals, but there are a number of dishes that just stood out above the rest. In no specific order my top 10 are included below:Momofuku Milk Bar/Bakery - I'm cheating a bit here, but there is a tie between the Passionfruit Chocolate Cake and the Candy Bar Pie. Both are remarkably unique desserts, delicious in their own way and sure to be fan favorites for a long time. Looking forward to what Christina Tosi introduces us to in 2009.Al Di La - A somewhat recent addition to the specials menu, the tripe sliders pushed the boundaries when it comes to sliders. Stewed tripe, with tomatoes and onions, is scooped into a hollowed out sourdough roll and briefly toasted making this dish a must for any Al Di La visitor. It's not always on the specials menu, but occasionally they can make it for you.Txikito - This tiny new spot from Alex Raij burst onto the scene without much notice and quickly became one of my favorite tapas restaurants. Chef Raij's Basque cuisine is simple, with bold flavors and the Arraultza, a canape of sorts with sofrito, chorizo and a fried quail egg was so good I had to order seconds (and considered thirds).Dell'Anima - Grilling their sweetbreads to employ a delicious, charred flavor and appearance, these are by far my favorite sweetbreads in the city. Remaining tender and moist, they are served with a parsley root puree, blackberries and a bit of lemon juice. A well-balanced plate, these little morsels are a must for any sweetbread fan.Momofuku Ssam - I'm a huge fan of duck and Ssam Bar serves it perfectly, long island sliced duck breast, braised thigh meat, brussels sprouts, dijon spaetzle, pear puree and top quality cheddar. It is a busy plate, but everything works well together, making this a truly addictive dish.Blue Ribbon Bakery Market - Of all the Blue Ribbon locations I especially love the market. It's homey, welcoming feel, the amazing smells and most of all the bacon red onion loaf. This tiny house made loaf is perfect on it's own, toasted with butter or even as a bun for a burger.Terroir - It was the year of the wine bar in many peoples eyes and one that clearly stood out was Terrior. From the hit makers behind Hearth and Insieme this tiny spot offers some of the more eclectic wines in the city and delicious bites. The fried sage wrapped lamb sausage is hard to beat as a bar snack in NYC or anywhere for that matter.Blue Hill Stone Barns - One of the more revelatory meals I had all year, the best plate of my 3 hour meal has to be the head to tail heritage pig plate featuring loin, belly, cheek, boudin blanc crispy fried jowel. The combination of textures and tastes made this a standout among many other fine dishes.X2O - Xavier's on the Hudson - This gem of a restaurant in Yonkers, NY is helping to revitalize the area and bring some might tasty food to Westchester County. There are plenty of solid dishes on the menu, but the short rib and foie gras ravioli with truffle butter is a picture of pure indulgence. I remember each bite as if I had it yesterday.Degustation - Somehow this restaurant manages to fly under the radar, but that's fine with me. Wesley Genovart's food gets better everytime I visit and his slow poached egg with smoked cheese foam, prosciutto and sesame crusted asparagus rose among many stellar dishes as my favorite. The contrasting tastes, textures and aromas made these simple ingredients superb.Runners up: Momofuku Ko's Deep Fried Short Rib, Market Table's Turkey Club Sandwich, Bussaco's Pretzel Bites, Taro's Scallop and Uni Special, Scarpetta's Spaghetti with Simple Tomato Sauce, PDT's Chang Dog, Hill Country's Moist Brisket, Flatbush Farm's French Dip, Sichaun Cafe's Salt and Pepper Pork Chops, Elettaria's Fried Quail, Peter Luger's Porterhouse and Beacon's Roasted Bone Marrow.Looking forward to what eats 2009 has to offer. Happy holidays and New Year!

Nestled among a variety of sketchy stores along 8th street, Elettaria offers a unique, enjoyable dining experience and cuisine. Entering the space you are greeted by a warm, open bar space. Banquettes to the right and a sizable bar on the left complete with well dressed bartenders and a quite reliable cocktail service. The lighting resembles a lounge, except when you gaze into the rear of the restaurant where a bright, stainless steel open kitchen resides. The restaurant quickly filled up on this somewhat rainy weekday evening. The after drink crowd was slowly replaced by the dinner crowd around 7:30pm and the kitchen really started to move. Led by Craft alum Akhtar Nawab, one of the rising chefs in Manhattan, the menu changes frequently and is heavily influenced by South Asian cuisine.During my visit it only seemed best to order a variety of starters to share, one of my favorite ways to dine. With each starter in the $10-16 range, it's easy to indulge without breaking the bank (entrees can be a bit more pricey with some nearing $30) although it is easy to spend a fortune hear quickly. To start a plate of warm flatbread with a light raita, or similar dip, was served. A great way to start the meal and definitely something you will want to save for some of the latter courses. Emerging first from the kitchen, the fried quail is perhaps one of the better \"bar foods\" in the city. Beer battered, fried and topped with pomegranate seeds, the quail is wonderfully moist and meaty (ironically) and served with a deep fried quail egg which upps the anty even more. I've made my love of sweetbreads clear and Elettaria serves up some nice ones. Accompanied by an apple puree, honeyed endive and pink peppercorns they were delicious. Not the best I've had, but a worthy dish and one I would recommend.Our next batch of dishes began with the infamous pork ribs. I've had these before and found them a tad dry on my most recent visit, but boldly flavored and another dish I'd recommend. Served with cucumbers, lychee and yogurt they are a nother wonderful melding of eastern and western cuisines. The next two dishes to be served were specials that evening, one a turbot served with almonds and concord grapes, the other lúgao, a congee style rish dish made with arctic char and paper thin slices of beef tendon. The turbot was very nicely prepared, with perfectly crisped skin, but a rather bland concord grape sauce. On the other hand, the lúgao was quite impressive, boldly flavored and like no other dish I've had before. My favorite part being the paper thin slices of beef tendon which were previously braised and formed into a torchon before being sliced. It is a special, but hopefully will served for awhile as it is surely a dish worth returning for.We opted not to order dessert and instead chose to have a few drinks, beers, wine and a cocktail. The variety was quite nice, with prices as I expected for a place of this caliber. Service could not have been better, with a warm greeting, humorous bartender and kind goodnight. Although not brand new, the restaurant is a welcome addition to the neighborhood and likely still undiscovered by many.33 W. 8th St., New York, NY 10011, 212-677-3833, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($40-60/person)

If you have never sampled the treats at Kyotofu there is hope. Opening soon at Bo-Concept in Chelsea, Kyotofu will have a kiosk offering their popular sweets making it easy to indulge in miso chocolate cakes or green tea macaroons. Last night there was a little soiree to support the opening with passed items such as the aforementioned miso chocolate cakes, a spicy version of the cake, green tea and yuzu macaroons and savory items like chicken tofu sliders, smoked salmon rolls and quiches. I'm a big fan of the sweets, but the savory items have potential and seem to be getting better every visit.144 W 18th St, New York, NY 10011 5465

Just sampled the few day old Baoguette and there is hope for those in the Flatiron area looking for something beyond tired turkey sandwiches and expensive lunches. I'm not crowning Baoquette as the new lunch spot of the area, but there is promise here as long as they work out a few kinks. The menu is limited to sandwiches and pre-made salads, with noodles, spring rolls and specials on the way. The space, a former Blimpie, seats 10 at a counter and is snug to say the least. Don't expect a Chinatown size sandwich here. No $4 or less double stuffed sandwiches, but everything is under a reasonable $8. The food is quite good with the standard \"baoguette\" filled with shredded pork, pate and terrine, a suitable substitute for a Lenny's, Toasties or other corner sandwich spot, especially at only $5. The BBQ chicken doesn't resemble BBQ chicken at all, but tastes quite good and is filled with a bit of chicken liver adding a welcome richness. The problem with the sandwich isn't the filling at all, all the vegetables are fresh and condiments tasty, but the bread. A supremely stale bread was served today, making that first bite painful and I hope for their businesses sake, and the roof of my mouth, that they fix it. With that fix and the soon to be expanded menu I see Baoguette becoming a new lunch staple, one that I would frequent quite often. 61 Lexington Ave., New York, NY 10010, 212-518-4089, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10/person)

Bigger, Bolder, Better?: L'Artusi Has It All

***CONTENT
Opened just a few days ago, L'Artusi, from the guys behind Dell'Anima is sure to be a hit for many reasons. With Dell'Anima's success, late night hours and continual praise from top journalists one would think that the team would simply open a similar spot and have immediate success. Well L'Artusi is a far cry from Dell'Anima, it may share owners, a chef and beverage director, but beyond that the two are very different restaurants.L'Artusi seats over 120 people easily, a far cry from the 30 or so at the team's other spot. The space is two floors, with a massive open kitchen and three different bars (crudo, cheese and of course alcohol). Gorgeous marble bar tops contrast nicely with the dark blue walls and the light fixtures add a nice touch of class. Chairs and booths may remind you a bit of an aquatic theme, but they work, adding a nice color contrast and keeping with the welcoming, relaxed decor of the restaurant. There were plenty of staff members working the night I went, but I expect this to continue as there are many stations to operate and customers to serve. Heading upstairs you will find a more intimate, quieter room. About the size of Dell'Anima, the space is recommended for a meal where conversation is important. Additionally, there is a private space up here, which will is surrounded by a temperature controlled wine room expected to hold hundreds of different labels.While the space is quite welcoming it is the sight and aroma of the food that is what I gravitate towards most. With an extensive menu broken into crudo, verdura, pasta, pesce and carne sections the variety easily surpasses that of Dell'Anima. While there are a few tweaks to be made to the menu and its layout, I expect the offerings to be a hit. The dishes all range between $7 and $20 so far with the average plate running around $14. Portion size, is for the most part, generous. Of the dishes I tasted I would recommend almost all of them.However, there were a few standouts, including the beef carpaccio topped with rye crisp studs and horseradish crema. The carpaccio was paper thin and perhaps one of the better carpaccio's I have ever tasted. Under the verdura section I found the Anson Mills polenta particularly good. With a unique texture and rich taste, it was a great side dish.The pasta's are most certainly a strong suit of L'Artusi and Chef Gabe Thompson, as I was a huge fan of two of them. The spaghetti and meatballs, a comfort food favorite, is brought to a new level without being too gourmet; the addition of pancetta adds a wonderful depth of flavor and richness. The pizzocheri, wide buckwheat noodles, is served with sage, fontina and brussels sprouts and has all the making of a deconstructed lasagna, but better.Of the carne courses the roasted sausage stuffed quail was delicious, but was put to shame by the spectacular involtino di manzo, a beef braciole. The involtino was tender, moist and rich, served with a side of sauteed greens it was one of my favorite dishes of the evening. While the portion on the quail was a bit small (it is a quail) the involtino was a rather sizable portion, perfect for 2, 3 or even 4 people to share.I generally crave more savory courses, but opted to try a few desserts just for kicks. After tasting three desserts, the olive oil cake is a clear winner and a must for anyone visiting the restaurant. It's just sweet enough to be dessert, but not overpowering and quite moist. Finishing in a close second was the baba rum cake, a perfectly prepared, sweet and quite satisfying little dessert.With an extensive wine list, ranging from high-end Italian wines to little known New York State wines. The focus is on medium-sized plates perfect for sharing and with such reasonable prices it's hard to see L'Artusi not succeeding. You can expect the menu to change regularly, waits for tables every night (but first come first serve seats at the bar) and delicious fare from first course to last. I'll be making my way back to L'Artusi very soon.228 W. 10th St., nr. Bleecker St.; 212-255-5757, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Moderate ($30-50/person)

Only Weeks In, NYC Has a New Top Tapas Spot

Txikito, the impossible to pronounce new restaurant from Alex Raij and her husband Eder, enhances the tapas offerings of NYC exponentially. Raij, who was previously behind Tia Pol and El Quinto Pino, shifts her focus to Basque food at this cramped, yet cozy 2-week old restaurant. Only a couple dishes actually seem similar to those at her previous restaurants (ones she is no longer associated with) and even those are named differently.At 7pm on a Friday the place is bustling, waits for a table reach 30 minutes and will only continue to get longer, but we planted ourselves at the bar quite easily within minutes of walking in. The design of the restaurant is unique and welcoming, distressed wood lines not only the walls, but the ceilings as well. The kitchen is in the back of the restaurant allowing the layout to be a bit more open than Raij's previous spots, although the blue painted wall in the back is a bit out of place. Lighting could stand to be a tad lower, but this was only week 2 and things are still be worked out. The bar is small, but a more than suitable place to eat, as long as you don't mind people reaching over you and perhaps entering your personal space a few times. It's okay though, the food will take you away, remove you from the bar stool and put you in a very happy place.At first glance the menu here seems substantially larger than Tia Pol. Maybe it's the layout, maybe there are actually more items, regardless, Txikito's menu has more \"wow\" effect than any other tapas spot in the city. Dishes like Morcilla, crispy little packages of blood sausage, remind me of spring rolls and are something I want to serve at every party moving forward. The Txipiron Encebollado, also known as squid ribbons with a sweet onion and pine nut sauce, are very enticing. While not my favorite dish due to a lack of texture, it was very creative and was overall quite pleasing. For the more adventurous eater, dive into a plate of Txarripatak complete with trotters, tripe and beef tendon. It's a dish I didn't sample, but most certainly am interested in.Simplicity is a key here, with merely a few ingredients necessary for some of the dishes. A little sandwich of mushrooms and shrimp resembles the smallest grilled cheese ever. It's delicious and would be at home with a mini bowl of spicy tomato soup. Another little sandwich of Basque tuna with piquillo oil and sweet onion is refreshing and served on a tiny baguette. Albongigas, little meatballs, are light and loosely packed with a nice crust on the outside. They are served with a simple shellfish sauce, a welcome departure from heavier tomato based sauces. The blistered peppers or Pipperak are simply charred and served with olive oil and sea salt, a great snack I'll go back for again and again.The most notable dish of the evening had to be the Arraultza, a canape of sorts with sofrito, chorizo and a fried quail egg. A gorgeous little bite, it was packed with richness and quite the array of flavors. We loved it so much we ordered a second serving (2 per plate) and were equally enthralled the second time we ate it. Along with the Arraultza, the Patatas Mentaiko earned high marks. The Patatas, served as french fries, were perfectly crisp and dusted with a bit of chili powder and accompanied by an addictive bowl of spicy cod roe mayo. The mayo is the star here offering a perfect balance of heat and saltiness; anything dipped in this mayo would be delicious.Txikito is a welcome addition to the diverse dining scene of Manhattan. The food is bold, inventive, but remarkably simple. It's easy to grab a few bites or indulge in a full meal without breaking the bank. Be forewarned, the waits will grow as word gets around about the restaurant so either plan ahead and get their early or grab a few drinks while waiting for a seat. I'm looking forward to many more meals here, never being bored by anything on the menu.240 Ninth Ave., 212-242-4730, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($40-60/person)

Plenty of Beef at Paul's Da Burger Joint

Paul's is by no means a quite, unassuming storefront. Claiming burger supremacy via numerous signs, Paul's Da Burger Joint is a greasy spoon of sorts, with a charm that reminds me of old diners and neighborhood spots with long, rich histories. Around for almost 20 years, Paul's is a place I wanted to like as soon as I walked in. We sat at the counter giving us full view of the flat top griddle and all the prep behind he burgers and sandwiches. A great show, it was impressive seeing massive bags of ground meat, stacks of cheese and more quickly run out. Unfortunately for usPaul's serves rather large portions, with all the burgers nearing or exceeding 8 ounces. The size is great and all, but there is a pretty big problem with these behemoths. While priced fairly, anywhere from $4.50-9 depending on toppings, the burger lacks any sufficient char which is a direct result of the cooking method here. Even though the burger starts on a griddle it is eventually covered with a little lid essentially steaming the burger till it is has reached the desired temperature. As a result, the burger is flaky, soft and lacking any bite. To top it off it is served atop a super soft sesame seed which quickly absorbs all of the burger juice rendering it non-existent. I found it interesting that the restaurant had such a high opinion of its burgers, with signs saying \"the best burger in NYC\" all over the place. With an extensive menu beyond burgers I'm sure Paul's is a great spot for other greasy options, but when looking for a burger there are many better options in the neighborhood.131 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003-8331, (212) 529-3033, Reservations - Not here, Price - Inexpensive ($6-12/person)

Dude, glad to hear that you also found this place to be totally underwhelming. The only good thing was that they'll give you a fry/onion ring plate and the pickles on the table. It's not a good sign when a burger is only as good as the toppings. I don't know why or how this place still has such a following. I guess the price and location keep it thriving. Where's the BEST burger you've had lately?

One of the newer additions to the Park Slope dining scene has generated quite the buzz. Bussaco, which I briefly touched on a few weeks back regarding their freshest mozzarella, has gained raves from locals and critics. The restaurant is located in the old Black Pearl space, a pretty poor restaurant all around, but the location is wonderful. Housed in a formed fire station there is a gorgeous entry way and high ceilings making this feel out of place in the generally cramped Park Slope area. A large bar sits on the left and is flanked by a fallen tree (from Prospect Park) which has been turned into a tall bar table. Bussaco's owner, Scott Carney of Gotham Bar and Grill fame, has put together a gorgeous restaurant and menu with the help of his chef, Matthew Schaefer formerly of Judson Grill. Together the duo have launched a restaurant sure to have staying power in the somewhat tired dining scene that is Park Slope.With a seasonal menu things are sure to change a number of times, but from what I tasted I look forward to my next visit. A tartare of salmon and gravlax was delicious and a welcome shift from the standard tartares. The smokiness of the gravlax paired nicely with the homemade pickles, chopped egg and potato dill toast. The most recent rendition of the freshest mozzarella was paired with heirloom squash, red onions and croutons and while good was a far cry from the earlier version I had with heirloom tomatoes. I'll look forward to next year when tomatoes are back in season.Entrees were a bit mixed, but overall impressive. There seemed to have been a slight stumble when preparing both our fish courses, nicely cooked, but lacking in flavor. Both the Atlantic salmon and wild stipped bass needed seasoning, perhaps a side as well, but were dissappointing. On the otherhand, the chef clearly is comfortable preparing duck and beef dishes. Pastrami duck breast served with black bread stuffing and sauerkraut, the dish was comforting, unique and overall tasted great. More impressive was the beef bavette served with sweetbreads and yorkshire pudding. A perfectly medium-rare flap steak studded with chopped bits of sweetbreads, three flaky yorkshire puddings and an addictive gravy, this was an impressive dish albeit heavy and one I would be happy to eat again and again.The desserts continued to show the skill of the kitchen as we swept our plates clean of every last bite. Fresh cream pana cotta offered a light end to the meal with just enough sweetness and was served with grapefruit and blood orange slices. The pana cotta was remarkably creamy, but not runny and one of the better pana cotta's I've tasted. Another hit was the caramel apple bread pudding with vanilla bean ice cream. This individual serving erupted with the smells of apple, cinnammon and nutmeg and reminded me of a delicious and hearty apple pie, but more refined. Served with the ice cream it is quite the comfort food.Other things of note are the bread service, which consists of numerous different breads and rolls served throughout the meal and the wine list. An extensive list featuring wines by the bottle and glass, I simply trusted the sommelier who picked an excellent and affordable red by the glass. I look forward to future trips to Bussaco for the fried poussin and waffle and even more exciting the bar menu, which features a burger, clam pizza and my favorite little pretzels.

First Taste: Momofuku Bakery/Milk Bar

There is little to dislike about the new Momofuku concept, it is a bakery, a milk bar and directly connected to the always popular Ssam Bar. Momofuku Bakery/Milk Bar shows off the sweet side of the team behind Momofuku and led by Christina Tosi the place is sure to succeed immediately. Serving mostly sweets and a variety of savory dishes, the space is closer in size to Noodle Bar than anything else, but with standing room only. It's open layout allows for a great view of the ovens, glass enclosed cake displays and of course the soft serve machines.After a few tastes this evening I expect to be back many, many times. The chocolate chip cake is like a cake explosion, filled with layers of passion fruit curd, chocolate crumbs, coffee and buttercream this cake is not to be messed with. A perfect balance of rich chocolate and creamy passion fruit it's a must when visiting. The chocolate cake will fill any chocoholics dream and may require you to eat it in small doses due to its richness. A pistachio cake is almost refreshing with a potent lemon curd, but its still indulgent and topped with milk crumbs and more buttercream. A favorite of mine, the blondie pumpkin pie is another must. All the goodness of a blondie combined with the creamy and rich flavor of pumpkin pie and you've got another winner. For the candy bar lover, the candy bar pie is hard to resist. A bit difficult to cut without making a mess, it's filled with smooth caramel, pretzels and a crust that reminded me of the crunch in Twix bars.To top if off, soft serve and cookies are being served up. The snickerdoodle soft serve is refreshing and bursting with flavor and in tasting the snickerdoodle cookie there appears to be a perfect match. Momofuku Bakery/Milk Bar opens this Saturday at 8am and will likely be mobbed from the get go.

Tasting Notes: Zacapa Rum

***CONTENT
I used to be a rum drinker, but eventually moved on to scothes and whiskeys. Not that I had any problems with rum, but I just \"graduated\", if you will, to slightly more classy drinks. This notion all changed recently as a new rum, Zacapa, launched nationally in the U.S. and I was lucky enough to sample some. Zacapa, produced in Guatemala, is imported by Diageo, the mega-spirit producer responsible for bringing us Captain Morgans, Baileys, Cuervo, Johnnie Walker and other large spirit brands.Zacapa is distilled from sugarcane, unlike most rums which are distilled from molasses. Master Distiller, Lorena Vasquez, is one of only three women Master Distillers in the world and she seems to have created a hit in Zacapa. The rum is aged using Sistema Solera, a unique blending technique that infuses the rum with flavor and then rests in hand selected bourbon, sherry and Pedro Ximenez casks. The press materials state \"the use of sugarcane gives Zacapa Rum its exceptional smoothness and creates a pure unique spirit\" and I firmly agree.In tasting the rum it is disctincly different than other rums I've tasted. To put it simply, it is a sipping rum, great with an ice cube or two and enjoyed just as you would a premium scotch. There is a somewhat strong aroma with hints of spice and dried fruit, one that certainly won't remind you of other rums at first, but it's the taste that really sets it apart. With a bit of sweetness when it first hits the tongue, the rum is surprisingly smooth with a nice crisp finish. Be sure to pour it in a clear glass as its gorgeous amber color is something you will want to show off.Expected to be available nationwide this fall I plan on making my way to a local liquor store to pick up a bottle for my bar. Unfortunatley, the rum is a bit more expensive than I'm generally accustomed to at $45, but it's a fair price when compared to premium scotch.

Not everyone loves a little thymus gland, but me, well I'm a huge fan. To some this may make you queasy, sorry in advance, but to adventurous foodies you should start calling for a reservation. Many places fry their sweetbreads (veal if you're interested) giving them a great outer texture while remaining tender and moist on the inside. Occasionally this method lacks flavor forcing you to rely on the accompanying sauces. Dell'Anima mixes it up, grilling their sweetbreads ($14 a plate) to employ a delicious smokey charred flavor and appearance. Remaining tender and moist, they are served with a parsley root puree, blackberries and a bit of lemon juice. A perfectly balanced plate, these little morsels have become my favorite sweetbread dish very quickly. Suck it up, put what they are behind you and dig in, you're sure to enjoy them.

Tucked into a tiny, modern space, Tebaya is serving up some of the more delicious chicken wings I've tasted in awhile. Not your average wings, these are not doused with flour or a breaded coating, but rather fried up crisp leaving the inside nice and juicy and then mixed with a blend of soy sauce, pepper and sesame seeds also known as \"teba sauce\" by the restaurant. This addictive blend gives the wings a sweet and spicy flavor separating them from many of the Frank's-heavy wings around the city. $5.50 will get you 8 wings and it's well worth it. If you go for lunch, order up one of the combo's which all come with wings.144 West 19th, New York, NY 10011, (212) 924-3335, Reservations - Not Accepted/Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($6-10/person)

Restaurant Review: WD-50

***CONTENT
Molecular Gastronomy has been a hotly debated topic in the culinary world for quite some time. Restaurants like El Bulli, Alinea and WD-50 have aimed to stretch the minds of diners while at the same time appealing to their taste buds. For some, this style of cooking is more an art form than anything else. An opportunity to use food as a vehicle for out-of-the-box thinking and stretching ones mind, but with a lack of focus on taste. For others, it is the future of cooking, a glimpse 20, 30, 50 years down the road illustrating how we may one day prepare, cook and eat our foods. Regardless of what camp you may fall in, as this is a highly discussed topic, I believe it is important to respect what many chefs and restaurants are doing around the world: advancing food culture.My recent trip to WD-50 was met with much emotion. To be frank, I was nervous. Nervous that the food would not taste good, or for that matter that I wouldn't understand it. I am not alone in thinking this. Frank Bruni gave the restaurant 3-stars and thus received quite the backlash. Other critics have slammed the restaurant for losing sight of cooking and thinking too much like chemists. For me, this was an opportunity to learn about this somewhat mysterious form of cooking. While I did learn a few new things and appreciate the work being done in the spotless stainless steel kitchen, I was left unsatisifed, looking for more flavor, more of something to excite me from a taste perspective.Our first courses, gorgeously displayed, read well on paper, but illustrated a common theme of the night, lack of taste. A dish of sweetbreads with peanut, beet-pomegranate sauce and pickled sweet potato was elegant, modern and flavorless. The sweetbreads, perfectly cooked, were rolled in crushed peanuts of which I could barely taste. The sauce was the closest thing to a saving grace while the pickled sweet potato was more awkward decoration than something I advice eating. A second appetizer of corned duck, purple mustard and horseradish cream on a rye crisp seemed equally interesting. Three little bundles stood upright on the plate, topped with some microgreens and are served cold. The duck had a nice texture, but was very mild. Here the only flavor came from the horseradish cream which I wish there had been more of. I found all of the components, when consumed together, bland and disappointing.Moving onto entrees I was hoping the chefs would let loose and really send out some boldly seasoned dishes. Unfortunately my hopes were not to be. Lamb loin, generally a favorite of mine, appeared to be cooked medium rare, but the chewiness of the meat was a huge turnoff. Was it a poor cut of meat or just poorly cooked? Hard to say, but it was not worth the $30+ they charge for it. The lamb was placed on a green apple, celery salad and was accompanied by green-tomater tots. The tomater tots excited me, anything fried generally does, but I thought these had promise. Again, another misstep. Underseasoned and overly mushy on the inside, I would have rather had regular potato tater tots. The monkfish, which was clearly one of the larger portions on the menu, appeared with a multitude of colors surronding it. Red pepper oatmeal, fried olive tapenade, char-grilled turnips and the gorgeously cooked monkfish complete with crisp crust and pearl white interior. It all sounds great in concept, but as I always stress, taste is most important. Here the red pepper oatmeal quickly thickened and became an unappealing consistency. The fried olive tapenade lacked any olive saltiness and was actually quite mushy. Char-grilled turnips at least added some texture to the plate, but it wasn't enough to save it. At least the monkfish was cooked well and appears to have had a generous and welcome dousing of salt.Finishing four plates of food and not finding much to be happy about we opted to pass on dessert. Do understand, dessert looked amazing and probably was, but after going through four plates of food and finding little to like we decided it was for the better. To wash down your food there is an extensive spirits, wine and beer list with some very solid options, of course they can be quite pricey. Overall I don't know if the poor experience was a result of Wylie being in Peru (he's teaching there right now), an off night (it was Halloween) or really just the difference between my palate and knowledge of food and say Frank Bruni's. Regardless, I won't be recommending the restaurant to anyone, but I have gained a better understanding of molecular gastronomy and eating it is the only way I could have done so.50 Clinton St, New York, NY 10002, (212) 477-2900, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Expensive ($60-90)

Wylie's menu and technique are way out there. Doesnt sound like the problems were conceptual, but in the execution. The restaurant has been open long enough for problems to be caused solely by his absence. Sounds like an off nite. I hope to be eating there in the next couple of months.

I've never hidden my love of Al Di La, the popular Park Slope Italian eatery. The menu rarely changes here, not that it's a bad thing, but there is something somewhat new which should lure Manhattanites across the East River. The dish is a tripe slider ($7), something you wouldn't necessarily expect to see scribbled on a chalkboard down at Al Di La Vino, the wine bar associated with the main restaurant. The slider, which almost resembles a bread soup bowl with it's small sourdough roll hollowed out to be filled with the tender braised tripe. The tripe, perfectly cooked, is mixed with a combination of tomatoes, onions and plenty of garlic. I'd have to call this one of the more exciting and delicious bites I have had in the past few months, one I look forward to next time I get to Al Di La.248 5th Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11215, (718) 636-8888, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person)

Restaurant Review: Double Crown

***CONTENT
Dining at the new hot spot, Double Crown, the other night I found myself torn. Generally I'm not one to visit such trendy places, but I had been quite intrigued since it's opening. Owned by the AvroKO design firm in NYC the place was destined to be interesting to look at if nothing else. Once I viewed the menu a few weeks back my expectations shifted a bit, with an assortment of delicious sounding dishes from duck steam buns and miso marrow bone to a venison wellington.Finally making it there the design element sure is evident from the moment you walk in the door. A large bar to the left is beautiful with ornate lighting and an interesting fan and lighting belt system. To the right it looks a bit more like a Chinatown garage sale with a random neon light hanging on the wall and decorative stone pieces just leaning against the wall. The rear of the restaurant is a bit more intimate with small nooks for group dining. Continuing back you come across a lounge where the lighting is limited, the noise level higher and a crowd that may just be cooler than you. Downstairs the bathroom corridor is narrow, but while waiting you can appreciate the word carvings on the walls. A private dining area, which likely sits 30 is also downstairs. Regardless of its shortcomings the restaurant is a site to see, whether you enjoy it or not, as it has so many interesting fixtures and elements throughout.On to the food, the most important part of dining anywhere. A theme developed as I was eating at Double Crown, on paper the dishes have interesting components which some may question, but when eaten not all of the components partner to make the dish taste better. Some of my favorite dishes were the crispy whitebait with dried chili and lime. A platter of tiny fish, fried whole, then covered with the juice of half a lime and a generous dousing of chili flakes. The dish was simple and delicious. The miso-glazed bone marrow was another dish I really enjoyed. Originally nervous about the strong flavored miso taking away from the beef bone marrow, my concerns were wiped away after one bite. The miso added a sweetness which helped cut the richness of the bone marrow without overpowering it. Served with a useless orange-olive marmalade, I recommend this dish be eaten simply with the provided brioche. Sea bream sashimi with smoked vinegar was bright, flavorful and tasted of the sea, a wonderful dish among a menu filled with heavier dishes.A number of dishes had plent of promise as well, but just fell short, like the duck steam buns. Originally the dish I was anticipating most, I found the buns to be lacking in texture and quite frankly duck. Somewhat hollow in the middle, these buns were soft and chewy all the way through and would be greatly improved with another texture and more filling. Venison wellington was an interesting dish on the menu and had great flavor, but wrapping it in cabbage seemed pointless and made the puff pastry crust a bit soggy. I was a fan of the cranberry chutney though, which paired nicely with the gamey venison. A starter of streaky ham with glazed figs was saved by homemade grainy mustard, but otherwise was lackluster.With some successes and a few missteps there were also some failures. Cured Scottish salmon was bland and forgettable. Goan vegetable curry never had a chance with it's uneven cooked vegetables and somewhat boring sauce. Desserts were interesting, but nothing really stood out, with the only exception perhaps being the rice pudding samosas, more for the idea than the taste.It's clear that Double Crown's kitchen can produce some interesting and delicious dishes, but it is also clear that, just in line with the design, creativity and showmanship come first, before flavor. Is it worth a visit for the food, debatable. However, for a drink or two and perhaps that bone marrow and whitebait at the bar, absolutely. The extensive wine, spirits and cocktail list is a draw in itself and it's fast becoming a destination for drinks more than food.316 Bowery,New York 10012, 212-254-0350, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Expensive ($50-70/person)

I've dined at Ssam Bar before, had a wonderful experience and have been waiting to get back since, not only craving the infamous pork buns, but to try a bevy of new items from the menu. A recent dinner produced many delicious memories, ones that are sure to get me back to Ssam soon. As usual, the place was packed Friday evening even though it was relatively early (not even 7pm). Killing the time I ordered an Alagash white, a superb beer, though overpriced at $9. I'm glad I got it, but really don't understand how the beer could be marked up so much. Once we were seated at the bar, my favorite spot here, we scanned the menu immediately opting for the pork buns. While a recent review on The Feedbag may claim these little morsels of goodness have declined in quality I assure you, they are just as delicious as ever. Same goes for the rest of the menu, but I'll get to that shortly. Also ordered first, the cured hamachi clad with a horseradish puree and crispy seaweed. A fabulous range of flavors in this dish, from the briny, salty fish to the pungent horseradish and back again to the saltwater taste of the seaweed. Each element was good on its own, but when combined the true quality of the dish came through. Another delicious dish was the honeycrisp apple kimchi, topped with crispy, smokey jowl, maple labne and arugula. A restrained dish which helped mellow out the evening.Ordering up a round of OB beers, the Korean equivelant of Budweiser except better, we placed an order for the duck. Before it appeared, the kitchen sent out a gift, fried brussel sprouts in a fish sauce vinaigrette with scallions and mint. A powerfully flavored dish the brussel sprouts were delicious. The vinaigrette brought a strong, yet welcome saltiness and the charred bits of brussel sprouts truely highlighted how good this vegetable could be. Shortly after the duck arrived complete with sliced duck breast (cooked perfectly), braised thigh meat, brussel sprouts (different than the previous dish), spaetzle, pear puree and top quality shredded cheddar. A gorgeous dish with so many components it was initially difficult to choose what to eat first. This certainly did not last long though as each part of the dish, as in other Momofuku dishes, really has a purpose. Bringing the spaetzle and pear together is great, but adding a shred of thigh meat elevates the bite to extraordinary. Being a huge duck fans my girlfriend were almost prepared to crown this one of the best duck dishes we have ever had and that says quite a lot. After a relatively salty meal I really craved something sweet and knowing the skills of Pastry Chef Christiana Tosi we quickly orderd the PB & J. Here the popular sandwich from our childhood is transformed into a peanut butter crumble like cookie, concord grapes and to keep with the salty theme a saltine pana cotta topped with crumbled saltines. A playful dessert it suffered only because I had been looking for a break from the salt and this was one of the more salty dishes of the evening. Overall another delicious meal at Ssam, perhaps better than my last visit, if only because I tried more dishes this time. Still going strong and still remarkably popular, I'm happy to see changes in the kitchen, an expansion of the space and all the awards and accolades haven't resulted in a decrease in quality. 207 2nd Ave, New York, NY 10003, (212) 254-3500, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($30-60/person)

Making my way into Chinatown yesterday I was filled with anticipation. Eager for the food that had been talked up, eager to order up a cheap feast and most of all eager to sink my teeth into the fried salt and pepper pork chops I had heard so much about. I could probably end the post there with many people already clamoring to find out where they can get these delicious bites, but there is more. Located on on Mott Street, there is little to distinguish the restaurant from others in the neighborhood and the menu is not entirely recommended. Of the dishes I tried I found the pork chops tops and worth the trip alone. The other dishes, pork soup dumplings, rice cakes with oxtail ragu and scallion pancakes were nothing unique or special, but for the most part quite good. Back to the pièce de résistance (I couldn't help myself), the pork chops. About the size of a large chicken wing or rib, the chops have a nice crispy exterior seasoned heavily with salt and pepper (hence the name). Extraordinarily tender the meat falls right off the bone and you may find yourself eating half the order without taking a break (about 6 per order if you're curious). There is little more to say except get down to Chinatown, bring a few bucks and order up the pork chops, you won't be disappointed.

That last one, mac & cheese jumped out at me today while reading the review of Almond, the new hopping spot on East 22nd street, on NYmag.com. The review comments on the food, pool table (yes pool table) and of course the food, giving a special nod to the mac & cheese. Almonds version reads as follows: \"Le Grand Macaroni & Cheese\" (prosciutto, chopped truffles). At $18 it may be a bit more money than say S'mac, but I guarantee you it is much better. I'll be getting myself over there as soon as I can to try this out and some of the other dishes, including braised short ribs, daube of lamb belly, scallops and braised pork shank and the intriguing polenta ravioli.

Just bit into the #7 from Viet-Nam Banh Mi So 1 and wow. The # 7 is a meatball Banh Mi, packed with juicy pork meatballs, shredded carrots, etc, etc. What really matters here is that each ingredient really adds up to a superb sandwich. The bread is fresh with a bit of chewiness, the vegetables nice and crisp and the spicy sauce when added to the meatballs is addictive. It's an unassuming storefront, and the shop is about the size of a taxicab, but I urge you to stop in. With 17 (yes, 17) different types of sandwiches available and nothing costing more than $5 you can find yourself eating here everyday if you choose to. A variety of fresh juices, spring rolls (which are made fresh all day and are rather refreshing) and more are also available, none of which cost more than a few dollars.369 Broome St, New York 10013, 212-219-8341

Tempo Presto, the neighboring sandwich shop of Tempo Restaurant, has many fans in the Park Slope area and rightly so. The eclectic menu of sandwiches such as my beloved Thanksgiving, stuffed with delicious roast turkey, cranberry sauce, pecan stuffing and mayo, has many fans. With an extensive assortment of cold and hot sandwiches as well as gelato, baked goods and soups, Tempo Presto is a great spot for lunch or dinner and doesn't break the bank, like it's sister restaurant Tempo. Other great sandwiches include pressed corned beef, the muffaletta, a meatloaf sandwich and housemade falafel.254 5th Ave, Brooklyn 11215, 718-636-8899, Price - Inexpensive ($8-15/person)

It's almost criminal that it took me so long to get over to Hill Country, the top NYC BBQ spot for many foodies, but finally I made it there today. Armed with an appetite and some hungry friends we ordered up an extensive array of food. You may ask why the quick eat and not a full review, well I plan to go back and ultimately get some great shots of the meat and try even more, so in due time. Overall we sampled plenty on this first trip, moist brisket that was tender as any I've ever had. Kreuz jalapeno and cheese sausage which had a great bite and was filled with little pockets of cheese and jalapenos. The pork chop, a flinestonian sized piece of meat, had a great smokey crust, but was a tad dry. Pork and beef ribs, both delicious, but not my favorite bite of the day (that was the sausage and brisket). The bottom tier meat was the beef shoulder, lacking in flavor and not remarkably tender. Regardless, a great meal of assorted BBQ meats perfectly complimented by mac and cheese, mashed sweet potatoes, corn bread, pickles and cucumber salad. I look forward to the next trip and some photos. For any hungry group Hill Country is a must. Now back to my food coma.30 W 26th St, New York, NY 10010, (212) 255-4544, Reservations - Recommended at night, Price - Moderate ($20-30/person)

Courtesy of Eater:John's on 12th St. celebrates its 100th anniversary on the 23rd, and to celebrate they're rolling back their prices to match those they offered 1908. The deal only lasts from 11 a.m. - 4 p.m., but they'll offer everything on the menu for under $1: veal parm for $.95, chicken cacciatore for $.75, stuffed mushrooms and tomato bruschetta for a quarter, and most excellently, a glass of cabernet or chablis for $.50. [EaterWire]It promises to be busy, but how can you resist veal parm for $.95??

Of course my palate is different than others, but for the most part I doubt anyone would disagree with my selections:Chelsea Market After DarkMorimoto's lamb carpaccio: a unique bite that really showcased the lambBurger BashMarket Table: Always a great burger in my opinion, the quarter burger I had benefited from being pulled right off the grill for me, and also from the delicious Pat LaFrieda blendShake Shack: It's hard to deny that the shackburger was not one of the best of the evening, but the milkshake really made me smileWhite Manna: Maybe not the most upscale or decadent of the burgers, but I swear I could have had a dozen of these. A great roadside burger.Grand Tasting SaturdayHill Country: Hands down my favorite bite of this event, the pulled pork slider was tender, meaty and perfectly sized.Landmarc's: The Orchiette was superb and the creamy garlic and sausage sauce was so indulgent, but oh so good.Felidi: The raw tuna caprese was refreshing, perfectly seasoned and a must eatSWEETJohnny Iuzzini (Jean-Georges) - Chocolate, Peanut Butter, Jelly Popsicle.

Unfortunately there are no pictures, but the crowd last night at Morimoto, celebrating the close of the first NYC Wine & Food Festival, was spectacular. A room of the top chefs (Todd English, David Chang, Alfred Portale, Morimoto, Bobby Flay, Ferran Adria, Mikey Price, Joey Campanaro and much more), food personalities and more, drank and snacked on treats like foie gras croquettes (not the literal name), sushi, eel cotton candy, wagyu beef served two ways and more. With all these culinary minds under one roof I have to admit I was a little star struck, but the event was fabulous. With spirits, champagne and Morimoto's Rogue beers being served no one seemed to have a problem putting a few back on a Sunday evening.From the party, which wrapped up around 11:30pm some went to the Meatpacking District, others home and I went to dell'anima where we feasted on grilled octopus, delicious ricotta ravioli, risotto with salami and sausage, grilled tender sweetbreads and an enormous and succulent pork chop. A great meal to wrap up a thrilling weekend and now back to realty. To all those that had a chance to enjoy the festival I hope you enjoyed it just as much as I did. Also, a huge amount of respect and a very appreciative thank you to those that threw the event as it could not have gone smoother.Update - Eater provides a great snapshot of who was at the Morimoto event:NYWFF-- The closing party for the NYWFF at Morimoto last night was perhaps one of the major highlights of the entire event. Just take a look at the guest list: Jose Andres, Lee Schrager, Ferran Adria, Masaharu Morimoto, Noel Cruz, Joe Campanale, Cesare Casella, Dana Cowin, Kate Krader, Todd English, Yann de Rochefort, Bobby Flay, Stephanie March, Michael Berl, Nicole Bermensolo, Marisa May, Pichet Ong, Anne Burrell, Akhtar Nawab, Guy Fieri, Seamus Mullen, Jason Denton, Alfred Portale, David Chang, Tom Colicchio, Govind Armstrong, Waldy Malouf, Alice Waters, and Ken Friedman.

The heirloom tomato tasting at Scarpetta was a great treat this afternoon. Tim Stark (highly respected heirloom farmer) and Scott Conant chatter about heirloom tomatoes, farming, the restaurant and more while a lucky room of fans and press dined on three tomato based dishes. The first being a tomato salad with frisee and white asparagus vinegarette. The second an amazing piece of fried mozzarrella atop a chunky cherry tomato sauce. Last was Scott's signature dish, spaghetti with tomato sauce, a delicious and simple interpretation of the dish. Photos below.

It took sometime to get this post up, but for good reason. The party probably never stopped for some last night, whereas I finally made it in a few hours before sunrise. Mixing it up with hundreds of others at SWEET last night was quite a pleasure. Set in a gorgeous venue on the waterfront, the top desserts and pastries from around the city were at everyone fingertips. Beverages were flowing, music pumping (courtesy of an unhappy looking Samantha Ronson) and popular food celebrities from Bobby Flay to Cat Cora and Miami's popular chef Govind Armstrong (who will be opening a place in NYC). Top tastes from sweet were at Jean-Georges table where Johnny Iuzzini served up lolipops with peanut butter, chocolate, jelly and even gold dust. chanterelle's pastry chef Kate Zuckerman was serving a comforting roasted pear with brioche and truffle honey. The Stanton Social had decadent chocolate peanut butter cupcake while Grammercy Tavern, Kotofu and Del Posto also were on my list of favorites.From SWEET which went until midnight a portion of the crowd went upstairs to the Macy's after party. The same gathering of chefs from earlier could be found as well as Marcus Samuelson and Todd English. Anne Burrell, Bobby Flay and Susie Fogelson of The Food Network could be seen dancing up a storm with pretty much anyone who crossed their paths. Food was subpar and not the draw here and the bar was stocked with everything you would need. To top it off a gorgeous view on the roof helped break up the dancefest downstairs. For photos from last nights fun (and debauchery) check out this slideshow.The weekend wraps up tonight with the Mohegan sunset and then a number of afterparties. Look for wrap up coverage tonight or tomorrow depending on how late into the night the parties go.

Saturday at the NYC Wine & Food Festival brought two rounds of grand tastings and a number of other events. The tastings were the premier events for the day crowd with tickets going for $150 each. The event was located at Pier 54, right on the Hudson River offering great views of the westside and New Jersey. Fortunately the weather was gorgeous with the sun beaming down and a cool breeze pouring through the tents. Unfortunately, the event was packed and the later it got the more drunk the crowd; making it rather difficult to move seamlessly through the event without the fear of having a drink spilled on you (even though they were handing out those nifty around the neck drink holders). All proceeds went to the charities Share our Strength and The Food Bank.With numerous tastes and beverages it was hard to get through everything and throughout it all I had to show restraint as there are more events to be had this evening. Of the samples I did have the top spots were: Hill Country - Pete Traversa's pulled pork sliders were incredible and in my opinion the best bite of the dayPamplona - Alex Urena partnered with a Kobe beef provider and served a luscious beef brisket with manchego rice. Superbly tender and quite rich, I was glad the piece was smallFelidia - Raw tuna caprese, extremely refreshing, the fresh burrata really was the highlightJohnny Utah's - A perfect slice of chorizo with pickles. Simple, spicy, deliciousLandmarc - Mark Meyers manned this station and served a garlicky orchiette with sausage in a cream sauce, a real crowd pleaserCookshop - Meyer's other spot, brought out root beer float sundaes towards the end of the second tasting and were all the rageSalumeria Rosi - Cesare Casella's new spot had a stand slicing up delicious prosciutto as well as grilled prosciutto with rosemary. Both were amazing, with my favorite being the cured prosciuttoFrom a drink perspective, the Maker's Mark booth was serving some great cocktails and Corona's beer cocktails were rather intriguingPhotos of the above as well as more can be found here.

I have no real physical takeaway from the Adria/Bourdain talk, but it sure was memorable. With no pictures being allowed unfortunately I couldn't grab a shot of the famed chef and chef/personality, but what was said was most important. Bourdain brought his great way with words, affinity for cursing, and wonderfully blunt personality while Adria spoke from his heart and had a great sense of humor. With the focus of the conversation being on the food at El Bulli and the future of avant-garde cooking it was enlightening and quite a joy to get a glimpse into the worlds most famous kitchen. My personal favorite line of the event courtesy of Adria via translator on molecular gastronomy and the mystery behind it:\"It's like seeing magic, you don't want to know how it is done\"Look out for a documentary, by Bourdain, on Ferran Adria and El Bulli to be out soon.

The premier event of the NYC Wine & Food Festival, Burger Bash, went smoothly last night below the lights of the Brooklyn Bridge at the old tobacco warehouse. A packed event at a gorgeous location, it brought together some of the best burger chefs/cooks/etc. in the country as well as all the food personalities you could imagine. The offerings were extensive, with 18 total burgers available from chefs and kitchens like David Burke, Strip House, Shake Shack, even Al Roker and many more. Everyone brought something unique to the table, whether it was a simple slider with griddled onions like White Mana or a dry-aged burger with applewood smoked bacon and spicy shrimp mayo from David Burke, everyone could find a burger they liked. Blue Moon was flowing and desserts by Jacques Torres, Godiva, Momofuku and more were there to offset the meat heavy eating.Not to be forgotten, the burger bash was a competition, a friendly one at that, and attendees were urged to text in their votes for their favorite burger. The surprising outcome (to pretty much everyone there), was that not only did a popular burger spot or highly qualified chef not win, but that the winner was Katie Lee Joel (with a patty melt!!). I did not speak with anyone who had the burger so I couldn't gauge their reactions, but for the most part it seemed remarkably odd that she walks away with the title of best burger. My personal favorite was Market Table's burger, with Mikey Price manning the burgers which were moist, bursting with flavor and sandwiched on what I believe is one of the better buns in the city. My full ranking is below and while I am impressed I managed to sample 10 of the 18 burgers, lets just say I won't be eating a burger for quite some time.

***CONTENT
Last night was the kickoff event for the NYC Wine & Food Festival at Chelsea Market. The event, dubbed \"Chelsea After Dark\", brought Food Network personalities, local chefs, restaurateurs and other food personalities together to sample a variety of foods and drinks with hordes of fans. The event began at 8pm and wound down by 11pm with plenty to see and do. The biggest draw was Bobby Flay, the host of the event, and his burgers from Bobby's Burger Palace. Crowds of fans chanting \"Bobby, Bobby\" were a bit much, but it was good to see such enthusiasm. Giada De Laurentiis and Guy Fieri also brought screaming fans, but Flay was the one bringing the hysteria. Also on sight were Wylie Dufresne, Nigella Lawson, Morimoto, Katie Lee Joel as well as reps from all the major food publications. Below is a photo summary of the eats and the event. More coverage to follow all weekend.Buddakan was one of the first booths when walking through the nicely decorated entrance. Dale from Top Chef was helping them serve tuna tartare spring rolls, a nice light and refreshing bite.A Tommy Bahama booth was all about the mini-mojito's.The Cleaver Company was offering bite size lamb and tzatziki burgers which were flying off the plate.Amy's Bread was serving pizza, interesting, but likely better when fresh.Morimoto's booth, one of my favorite, was serving a lamb carpaccio, which was one of the more unique options of the evening.The Food Network station, pushing their new company magazine, was cooking up duck confit canapes and shrimp, grits and andouille plates. Both were quite good.Like I said, Bobby's burgers were all the rage and he served two. A \"Crunch Burger\" topped with potato chips and some ketchup as well as a pickle and coleslaw topped burger. The potato chip topped burger was my preference, although I did find the chips got soggy after about half the burger. One thing to note the burger was perfectly cooked and the meat very good quality.Eleni's bakery had mini cupcakes, including this caramel apple bite which was surprisingly difficult to eat.

In the meantime there are still plenty of free events and a handful of events with tickets available for purchase. If you plan on attending any events please do let me know as I'd love to meet others foodies over the weekend.For extra coverage and links to buy tickets see below:NYC Wine and Food Festival TicketsRachel Ray's Burger Bash CoverageMetromix's 411 on the FestivalRestaurants with specials over the weekend

Restaurant Review: New Yeah Shanghai

There are so many options in Chinatown it's hard to pick where to dine. After much deliberation my group and I landed on New Yeah Shanghai, a popular spot on Bayard street directly across from another Chinatown staple New (Nice) Green Bo. The facade of New Yeah is dated, but its the hand rolling of the dumplings in the window which entices you to come in. After a short wait we were seated in the front section of the restaurant, the back, which you must cross a small bridge to get to, also has a surprisingly large number of seats. We ordered up a round of Tsing Tao's, the crisp light beer of China and at only $3 a pop a steal. The menu here is just as extensive if not more than other spots in the neighborhood, so don't limit yourself to one or two pages. We ordered up the famous steamed juicy pork buns, steamed pea shoot buns and scallion pancakes to start. The pork buns, served 8 to an order, were delicious and piping hot. Filled with a fragrant pork broth and pork chunks it was a wonderful way to start the meal. The pea shoot buns didn't stand a chance after the pork ones being so good and unfortunately they were a bit bland. On the other hand, the scallion pancakes were superb, some of the best I've ever had; perfectly crispy, appropriately greasy and filled with tender little bits of scallion. Our next batch of food featured pork fried dumplings which were tender and crispy, great little packages meat. We also ordered sesame beef, pork fried rice and Shanghai pan fried noodles. Of the three larger plates the noodles were my favorite as they had a wonderful taste and a great mixture of pork, chicken, shrimp and vegetables. The beef, while okay, lacked any crisp and was soggy and weighed down by the heavy corn starch based sauce. The fried rice, was simple, but good and not overly greasy. For a large meal for 6 I would have expected this to run us a good amount of money, but to our surprise it was a mere $20 each pushing this towards the top of my personal favorite cheap eats spots. I eagerly await my next visit to try out such dishes as the pork belly, cold noodles, braised noodles and more. 65 Bayard St, New York, NY 10013, (212) 566-4884, Reservations - Accepted, Price - Moderate - $10-30/person

Review:  Atlantic Antics Street Festival

***CONTENT
This past Sunday brought one of the larger street festivals in all of Brooklyn, Atlantic Antics, which was celebrating its 34th year of bringing people together along Atlantic Ave from 4th Avenue down to Hicks Street. The fair features the general sausage and pepper stands, grilled corn and jewelry and craft booths, but what really makes it special is the participation of local vendors and restaurants. Restaurants all along Atlantic Ave. including Brawta Cafe, Chip Shop, La Mancha, Blue Marble Ice Cream and Pete's Ale House and much more. Music was being played all along the streets and belly dancers and even children's dance groups were on display. But what's really the most important, well the food and there sure was a lot of it.One of my first stops was at Bacchus, a French bistro, where they were serving merguez sausage sandwiches with a mildly spicy aioli. While not the most attractive looking dish it was a nice snack and only cost $3.The next stop brought one of my favorite bites of the day, Bev Eggleston, a famous hog farmer of Eco-Friendly Foods who per Eater supplies David Chang, was serving delicious spicy pork burgers dubbed \"Obama Burgers\". Amazingly succulent, with a nice char they were topped with mustard seeds and homemade pickles, truely amazing, it makes me sad I cannot find a restaurant that provides them. The stand was also serving \"Joe Bidden Gelato\", which I received a sample of the bosch pear and bourbon.Moving further west I stopped at Damascus Bread, a Middle Eastern bakery, with an impressive assortment which included kibbeh, meat and vegetable pies, falafel, baklava and more. A small spinach pie was a mere $1 and provided some nice sustenance.Getting back to the heavier food we headed over to Pete's Waterfront Ale House where a rocking party was going on and some great BBQ was being served. I opted for the brisket sandwich and coleslaw for $6, deciding I'd already had my share of pork for the day. The brisket was wonderfully tender and came with a sweet and tangy bbq sauce. The coleslaw was a nice refreshing and creamy side dotted with mustard seeds.On the sweeter side of things, Blue Marble Ice Cream closed down their shop and sold all products street side. Their mint chip was thick, creamy and all indulgent. Chocolate chunks emerged from the fresh and natural mint ice cream making for a wonderful treat after the trek down and back on Atlantic. All in all it was a great day of walking, eating and mingling with other Brooklyn residents and most importantly there was some remarkably tasty food.

Bussaco, the new addition to the Park Slope dining scene, opened on Friday in the old Black Pearl spot on Union Street. The menu has been revealed on NYMag and has some remarkable sounding dishes, particularly the Beef Bavette (braised sweetbreads, Yorkshire pudding). On Friday evening the restaurant had a handful of customers at the bar and sitting among the tables. The space is clearly still being finished, but it has a large inviting entrance, gorgeous wooden bar (made from a fallen tree in Prospect Park) and luxurious banquets. The staff seemed friendly and excited, but of course still has some things to get up to speed on. I sampled \"The Frehsest Mozzarrella\", a boldly named appetizer. It was a very attractive dish, with large chunks of yellow and red heirloom tomatoes, red onions, croutons and basil atop a disc of slightly warmed mozzarrela. The cheese was quite fresh, per the server each dish is made and melted to order, and being slightly melted added a welcome indulgence factor. We also sampled a white and red wine, both good and priced around $8-10 a glass (which was generously poured). Overall Bussaco seems to have a bright future and I look forward to having a full meal here and wish them the best.Bussaco, 833 Union St., nr.

Pichet Ong's West Village bakery, Batch, sure offers some unique and delicious treats. Walking into the brightly colored spot next to P*ong you are met with a multitude of fresh baked goods and a wonderful aroma. Chocolate chip cookies had just emerged from the oven when I arrived, an intoxicating scent that I wish I could bottle up. There are many items showcased on the counter and in the glass fridge, most notably the many varieties of cupcakes. I opted for the carrot cake cupcake, complete with salted caramel frosting and filled with lime cream cheese frosting. The pictures below don't completed do the cupcake justice as they are from a camera phone, but you get the point. I also opted for a fresh chocolate chip cookie and while good, it was not nearly as memorable.# A 150 W 10th St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 929-0250, Price - Inexpensive

In a tiny shop just North of Houston sits Nicky's, an unassuming storefront serving some delicious foods. Just recently I ordered up the chicken sandwich, not the classic Vietnamese sandwich with pork and pate, but delicious nonetheless. It came topped with pickled carrots, cucumbers, cilantro, mayo, and spicy sauce on a french baguette. The roasted chicken was warm, tender and quiet moist, a nice change from the many sandwich shops serving the obligatory grilled chicken breast. For a mere $5 this sandwich ranks pretty high on my sandwich favorites and I'm surely going to pay Nicky's a return visit. Next time maybe the pork, or even the portobello mushroom sandwich.150 E 2nd St, New York, NY 10009, (212) 388-1088, Reservations - Not Accepted/Needed, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10/person) and cash only

***CONTENT
Tom's restaurant, which opened in 1936, still feeds hordes of Brooklynites and New Yorkers every week. It's a neighborhood spot with a well-known name and wait on the weekends. The owner Gus Vlahadas greets you with a handshake, a smile or a pat on the back. Everyone is welcome here for breakfast, lunch or dinner, but the most popular time is Saturday brunch (they're closed on Sundays). Arriving before 11am is a very smart move and highly recommended unless you enjoy waiting in potentially long lines.Like clockwork the line swings out the door and sometimes around the building at 11am every Saturday rain or shine. While the line may not be enjoyable overall it is one of the easier lines to deal. The reason being the busboys actually offer you samples of orange slices, sausage, cookies, orange juice, coffee, the obligatory wet naps and much more. It's this welcoming service that makes everyone feel at home and the line just goes that much faster as a result. Most everyone comes here for the brunch and for good reason. Tom's offers some of the best pancakes I have ever had and you can go a dozen meals and not order the same kind twice. Blueberry, apple, strawberry and the more unique lemon ricotta, pumpkin, cranberries with sweet corn and more. The pancakes, three to a serving, are light and fluffy and can easily be pulled into bite-sized pieces with a mere tug of your fork. My favorite, the blueberry, are ripe with fresh blueberries which manage to hold their shape and \"pop\" in the cooking process and burst in your mouth when eaten. Other offerings of challah french toast and Belgian waffles are just as good and topped with similar if not identical toppings seen with the pancakes. Homemade butters flavored with lime, strawberry or apple cinnamon are available to all diners and add an extra dimension of flavor if needed or, in my case, are a perfect keepsake to use at home. For the egg eaters, omlettes of all shapes and sizes are available, like the western omlette with ham, peppers and onions or chili omlette. There are always specials available, simply posted on brightly colored signs on the walls and the regular menu hangs beyond the counter with a nostalgic feel. Tom's offers lunch as well, but that may be for another review as the breakfast deserves applause on it's own. 782 Washington Ave, Brooklyn 11238, 718-636-9738, Reservations - Not accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($7-15/person) and cash only

A recent celebration, my girlfriends birthday, found us and a group of friends at Tia Pol, one of our favorite spots in the city. I've reviewed the delicious tapas here before, but have not been to the tapas joint since they lost their chef earlier this year. Well things are still delicious here from the patatas bravas, the addictive fried potatoes with spicy aioli, to the chorizo and chocolate, an unlikely combination that everyone deserves to try. We also opted to try something new in the Spanish tortilla, a mixture of potatoes, egg and onion that resembled a cake or frittata and was delicious. Served with a roasted pepper and mayonaise it was a sizable portion and nice an hearty. Our standards were also excellent, succulent lamb skewers, refreshing fava bean puree toasts, gorgeous blistered peppers and of course the luscious ham and blue cheese (special that night) croquettes. A wonderful night filled with plenty of food (lots of it fried or potato based), sangria and friends I continue to crown Tia Pol as the best tapas spot in the city.205 10th Ave, New York, NY, 212) 675-8805, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($25-$35/person)

With the gorgeous weather today I felt it only appropriate to take a nice walk and eat outdoors. My travels brought me to West Village pizza spot, Pizza Box. I'd never ventured into this shop, but DJ Bubbles of Serious Eats has praised their slices on multiple occasions. Always looking for a good slice it made perfect sense to me, plus they have a huge outdoor patio. I ordered up to plain slices, the only fresh pie at the time, and proceeded to the patio shooing away pigeons all the way to my seat. Upon first examination the slice looked rather poor, or mediocre, but the taste is what really matters here. The crust was crispy and it was easy to pick up and fold, but beyond that there was little right with this slice. It lacked any flavor and really the only thing that kept me eating it was that I 1. paid money for it and 2. was starving. The sauce had a faint tomato flavor to it, a bit sweet, but not prominent at all. As expected the cheese was mediocre quality, but I certainly expected the sum to be greater than its parts...I was wrong. I'll stick with Joe's when looking for slices in the village, they may not be the best in the city, but they certainly have enough flavor to trump Pizza Box.176 Bleecker Street, New York NY 10012, 212-979-0823, No reservations, Price - InexpensiveOn another more positive note, I stopped into my favorite pasta store in the city, Raffetto's and continue to be amazed that every New Yorker does not know about this place. It has a long history of making top quality pastas of all shapes, sizes and flavors and is quite inexpensive. Today I opted for the rosemary parpadelle and at just under $4 a pound it's hard to beat. Other great buys are their fresh and frozen ravioli and assorted specialty goods.144 W Houston St, New York, NY 10012-2546, (212) 777-1261, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate

nyc food guy, completely agree. It was nothing special. I have had the nonna maria, it is the best slice at BSP, but I wouldn't label it best slice though. My problem is, I haven't really had a BEST slice, nothing blows me away in slice form so far in NYC or Brooklyn. My favorite slice is actually a square slice at a spot in Prospect Heights called Amorina. Top quality ingredients, but cheap (2 slices and a drink for $5).

***CONTENT
For roughly a decade I've been going to the Candlelight Inn, always yearning for the wings, teriyaki chicken fingers, fries and cheap beers. To many, including myself, it is a place where you can relax, be yourself and indulge in some top quality bar food without any care in the world. It's appearance from the outside has not changed in some time, it's been around over 50 years, and the parking lot is always crowded no matter what time of the day it may be (and it can be quite a pain navigating). It's been referred to as a biker bar, tavern, dive bar, high school hangout spot and more, but one thing is for sure, everyone is welcome. At first glance the menu appears rather standard, chicken wings, fries, burgers and beers, a typical bar/tavern menu. However, there is more to the food offerings than meets the eye. Popular items such as garlic bread with cheese and pepperoni are always crowd pleasers. The waffle fries (surely frozen, but who cares) come with a bowl melted cheese and freshly diced jalapenos for an indulgent kick. The burgers, available in two sizes, are cooked to order and always have a nice char on them. Even tacos make their way onto the menu and at about $2 each they are a bargain. Cheesesteaks, salads, and even pizza's are also available.The menu is quite robust, but what many people come for are the famous wings. Named top wings in Westchester County multiple times, Candelights wings are available in small, medium and large portions as well as mild, hot, extra hot, chernobyl, teriyaki and BBQ. I've never managed to venture beyond to the chernobyl territory, but on occasion I'll mix the hot and teriyaki for what many call, \"hotbufchickter\". It sounds like a derogatory phrase, but the combination of the sweet, smokey and spicy flavors really hits the spot. The wings are meaty and travel well for those looking for takeout or delivery. Another popular and delicious option is having crispy chicken fingers rolled in a hot sauce of your choosing. The service is just what you would expect from a place always busy with a bit of attitude, quick and to the point. Servers and bus boys fly around the tiny dining area shuttling plates of wings, cups of blue cheese as well as beers from the bar, it's surprising I've never seen a crash in all these years. It's no surprise that the fries are not called French fries, but rather \"freedom fries\" an almost funny term nowadays, but fitting considering the attitude of Candlelight. They are always perfectly crisp and are best with honey mustard a personal favorite of mine.It's hard to contemplate dessert, or even expect it to be anything special at a place like this, but a rotating list of specials, plus a few regular standouts are truly worth it. A favorite of mine is the cookie a la mode. No frills here, simply a warmed 1/4 lb cookie topped with chocolate of vanilla ice cream. As simple as a dessert as you can get, yet the cookie is amazing with chunks of melted chocolate and soon to be melted vanilla (my preference) ice cream all over it. Other options include a variety of pies, cakes and plain ice cream. At a time where the country is quite health conscious with pressure coming from all angles to eat better and eat less, Candlelight perseveres with a loyal customer base and newcomers from far and near. Dining here is pure indulgence, not in the sense of foie gras, homemade pastas or prime cuts of beef, but rather simple comfort food that anyone can find enjoyment in. It is a place where you see old classmates, friends, coaches, neighbors and more. The waits may be long (up to an hour at times), but the food and experience is worth every minute.519 Central Park Ave, Scarsdale, NY 10583, (914) 472-9706, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($10-20/person)

Just came home from the Candlelight. We hadn't been there for many years and were looking forward to introducing our teenager to it. We will never go back. The service was beyond words horrible. The waitress took our order and we watched tables that came in after us receive their food first (the same food that we ordered). After 1/2 hour we stopped our waitress (she never came back to get us another round of drinks) and asked her why we weren't served even the appetizers yet and she claimed the kitchen lost our order but would put in the order again and get us another beer (the glass has been empty for 15 minutes already). Ten minutes later she never came back with the beer. One of us went to the bar, got his own beer and came back to the table. And we waited for the food........ Finally the mozzarella sticks showed up along with the ordered salad. A little more time went by before we got our order. I guess if you don't want wings, don't bother going here. The 'Balboa' was supposed to be on garlic bread - it wasn't. The burger that was ordered 'medium' came with the inside raw. My son had to eat around the middle. I guess that's because the waitress put a rush on it. We had to ask the busgirl to get us the check because our waitress was not around. We waited 20 minutes for a table, which we expected. Waiting 45 minutes for lousy food is unacceptable. Being served lousy food is unacceptable. Having to stop at 7/11 because my son was still hungry is absurd.

sorry to hear you had a bad experience. I certainly don't go for the service (no one does really). It's a greasy spoon spot with good food and familiar faces. The service is usually mediocre at best, just sounds like you had it at it's worst point.

Last night was the Park Slope Free Food Tour, a new event to the neighborhood where restaurants and shops offer samples from 7pm-10pm to local residents. Initially the turn out seemed bleak and my girlfriend and I were fearful we may be begging for food, but ultimately the turn out was great. In fact, the turn over was likely much larger than anyone had predicted forcing long lines and somerestaurants to ultimately run out of samples earlier than expected. Some of the highlights included the extremely addictive homemade pretzel nuggets at newcomer Bussaco which will be opening in the old Black Pearl spot on Union St. on October 3rd. Across the street Scottadito Osteria was serving some light and fluffy spinach ricotta gnocchi with truffle oil. Further down the street Moim, the popular modern Korean spot, had three treats for guests: kimchi pancakes, bi bim bop spring rolls and beef skewers.Flipsters, the newly named burger spot taking over for Brooklyn Burger Bar had quite the line, but actually served some mighty tasty sliders complete with special sauce and carmelized onions.Down near 15th street Little D'Eatery, which apparently is not closing down and is actually adding lunch, was serving slow-cooked pork shoulder over cornbread with homemade pickles. Winding back up the street you could grab small samples of wine, margarita's, even jambalaya at popular newcomer Nono.One of the more generous offerings was our last stop of the night, Santa Fe Grill. While I may not dine here normally I was blown away by their customer service and the fact that they were actually serving full portions what appeared to be their toastada appetizer. Not to be out done, Cousin John's Bakery served everything in the shop, or at least close to it. Chocolate cake (two kinds), cookies, brownies, canoli's and more. Overall it was a great event and while a bit crazy at times with long lines and limited food (and respect on the part of some participating residents) it was a hit. Hopefully the exposure helps out some of the restaurants and boosts business and I look forward to the event continuing for many years to come.

Just had a fantastic lunch at Market Table, heirloom tomato salad, the burger and turkey club. All dishes were stellar and a perfect way to celebrate a nice, but cold Friday. The standout though was a dish of sauteed sweet corn, shaved off the cob and served with parsley and butter. To top it all off a generous shaving of fresh black truffles, it was a peffect dish to illustrate the changing of the seasons. Absolutely delicious, it was a dish I will not forget and hope to replicate some day. It also rings in truffle season, a happy time for all who can afford (or are lucky enough) to get them.

***CONTENT
On a recent Friday night I ventured out with some friends in town for a little bar crawl from the West to East Villages. It was a great time, an opportunity to catch up, enjoy the weather and have a few drinks. Needless to say, when we got to the East Village we were hungry, personally I was starving. At a time like this there is little that can satisfy me more than a perfectly cooked cheeseburger and the city has it's fair share.Conveniently we were blocks away from Blue 9 Burger when this craving hit me. Blue 9 Burger is a small shop with little decor or atmosphere, however, I've been impressed with what I have heard on the web regarding the patties and figured why not give it a shot (decent remarks from both AHT and Food in Mouth). The menu is limited, but surprisingly inexpensive; ranging from $3.00 for a hamburger to $4.50 for a Blue 9 Burger (double cheeseburger). I opted for a cheeseburger (a measly $3.40) with everything on it. Blue 9 does not ask how you would like your burger cooked, so be ready for something medium-well at the least, however, you may can attempt to ask for it at a certain temperature if you dare. The style of burgers is clearly West Coast, with the thin patties, lettuce, tomato and a soft bun it's best comparisons in New York would be Shake Shack and Five Guys. Cooked to order, the beef is fresh and a nice change of pace from a fast food spot, although it appears to be one. Once the cheeseburger arrived I put on some of their house special sauce, based on appearance it seemed mayo based as most are, and sat down to eat. At first glance the burger was proportionally assembled with lettuce, tomato, onion with the burger somewhat chared and covered in melted American cheese. It was a relatively flavorful and juicy burger considering it's thinness and it was well seasoned. There was a faint pinkness in the center, which was very much welcomed as I was a bit concerned the burger would be too well done for my liking. Blue 9 opened my eyes to another burger spot in the city which I anticpate eating at again. It may not be the best burger, but it is hard to find a burger freshly made and at this price in the city. Other items available include fries (handcut), grilled cheese, milk shakes (a must try next time at only $2.25) and the wide assortment of dipping sauces. 92 Third Ave. New York, NY 10003, 212-979-0053, Reservations - Not Needed/Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10/person)

***CONTENT
With tomatoes in season, BLTs on menu's all over the city and a recent article on NYmag on \"Where to find the best late-summer BLTs what better simple recipe to post than a BLT. To create this you only need a few very simple and easy to find recipes. For me, some gorgeous tomatoes (heirloom, vine, etc.), romaine lettuce (bibb will do as well), applewood smoked bacon (or your preferred bacon), avocado, classic helman's mayo and delicious bread, in this case sourdough from Tom Cat Bakery (I've professed my love of their bread before). A few interesting touches, take 'em or leave 'em, buttering the bread and seasoning lightly with chili powder before toasting. With this bread the sandwichs become smaller, so in my case I recommend preparing two for a full meal. A few easy steps to follow below:1. Cook up your bacon either in the oven or stove top to a nice crispy state2. Wash your vegetables and cut up to fit best on the bread3. Prepare thin slices of avocado4. Toast bread with butter and some seasoning (my choice is de arbol)5. Assemble sandwich with generous spreads of mayo, layering tomato, bacon, avocado and lettuce (or whatever order pleases you the most)6. Serve with chips of your choice, pictured here are Terra chips, and enjoy

Formerly Sullivan Street Bakery, Grandaisy is one of the premier bakeries in the city and fortunately my office is within walking distance. I've made many trips here to enjoy their specialty pizzas, breads, pastries and more and can never get over just how good their products are. For one, walking in you are met with stunning loaves of bread. All shapes and sizes resting above the counter. Below these are the pizza's. These are not your standard pizza's with tomato sauce and melted cheese, but rather a thin focaccia like bread baked crispy and topped with an assortment of vegetables. The cauliflower with onions, olive oil, bread crumbs and gruyere is an example of genius. Perfectly crisp and with a unique sweetness that only comes out from roasting cauliflower, it is by far my favorite pizza here. Other recommendations include the potato and the funghi, both unique and delicious in their own way.Other offerings include sweets such as the panini dolci, a delicate cookie sandwiched around toppings such as dulche de leche and peanut butter, cream cheese and nutella. The cookie reminds of the TKO cookie from Bouchon Bakery, but is a bit more delicate and in my opinion, more delicious. Other items such as pies, cakes, biscotti and even panini's are available with a seasonal menu changing regularly. I've tried to walk in just to see what is available in the past, but it is hard to resist, this is one serious bakery and well worth the trip.73 Sullivan St, New York, NY, (212) 334-9435‎, Price - Inexpensive ($4-$10/person)

***CONTENT
Recent newcomer to Prospect Heights, James on Carlton Ave, has received a solid amount of attention considering it's location. Reviewed by a handful of major publications/online outlets, it has gained the eye of more than just those living in the neighorbood. Making the trek down the street (James is on my street) seems to have been difficult for me as it took a few months to actually get here. Maybe it was the odd reality that a potentially fantastic restaurant was just feet away from my doorstep. Maybe I was worried of being dissappointed and having to see the spot everyday. Regardless, I'm glad the wait is over.James is a handsome restaurant, no longer looking bleak and dark like it's previous tenant (Sorrel). A contemporary chandelier illuminates the room and the candles and dim lights provide enough light to see your food and also converse with your party. A nice solid wood bar adds some class and the white painted brick walls keep it looking rustic enough for Brooklyn. The space is small, however, and as a result can get loud even when three-quarters full. The menu at James is also quite welcoming and enticing, changing frequently and highlighting the best of the markets offerings.To start we ordered drinks, a Merlot which is escaping me unfortunately and a gin based drink, St. Anne. A solid selection of wines with prices starting just below $10 a glass and cocktails which evoked similarities to neighbors Weather Up and Flatbush Farm, it appears the neighborhood is expanding their alcoholic palates. For starters the heirloom tomato salad with chevre fondue was a wonderful nod to the last of the great tomato bounty. Bursting with flavor the tomatoes swam in a bath of melted chevre and tomato water accented by globe basil and sea salt. The sweetbread starter was also quite good with a rhubarb honey glaze and dandelion greens. Crispy and tender the sweetbreads could have used a little less honey atop them, but I did thoroughly enjoy them regardless.For entrees a beautiful dish of scallops atop a roasted corn salad and a bright green watercress puree brought smiles to our faces. The scallops, generally an appetizer, were perfectly cooked, a tad small, but paired very well with everything on the plate. For my entree, the pinenut and rosemary crusted loin of lamb was cooked exquisitely. Fork tender, it was served with a summer bean stew composed of wax beans, favas, cranberry beans and more it was a great pairing for the meat. I would have liked a bit more seasoning on the lamb as it was a little bland, but overall a nicely prepared dish.I'm not much of a dessert person, something really needs to jump off the menu to get my attention and the ricotta beignets did just that. Served with a tart and sweet raspberry red wine coulis, they were fresh, light and a great way to end the meal on a sweet note. One additional note as to the dessert selection: I was still hungry. James' courses are not enormous and could leave some hungry so be aware. On a more positive note, the food was all delicious and worth a return trip, one that likely will be a special occassion as the bill adds up.605 Carlton Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11238, 718.942.4255, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($30-$50/person)

***CONTENT
No this is not a review of Dallas BBQ, the horrendous chain throughout the boroughs with signs on every other bus stop. This is a Dallas Jones BBQ, a hole in the wall BBQ spot in the West Village. Primarily serving as a takeout and catering spot, DJBBQ does provide a few dine in seats (approximately 6 in all) and their speedy delivery make them a solid option for a rainy day or late night at work.I've ordered from Dallas Jones many times, but finally got around to recapping it here. The food here is solid, not amazing by any means, but a great change of pace, hangover cure, or just all out indulge fest for those in the village or Soho. The menu is typical BBQ, ribs, fried starters, pulled pork, chicken or beef sandwiches and much more. For the lunch crowd they offer a $7.95 lunch special where you can choose from a few different options and then fries or a baked potato and pink lemonade. I generally opt for the pulled chicken sandwich, a combination of white and dark meat slathered with a sweet BBQ sauce and sandwiches in between a wonderfully soft roll which soaks up all the juices. The fries, while tasty are usually soggy when delivered, but a bit more acceptable when eaten at the restaurant. Baked potatoes, something not generally praised, are simply enormous and when they can't find a big one they give you two. A large amount of food for $7.95 anywhere in the city.However, my favorite sandwich is the one with boneless beef ribs. Extremely tender and served with a little less sauce, it is a great hearty sandwich. Again the sauce is a bit sweet and needs some more kick, but I'm not complaining. Platters, like the fried chicken, offer more food than anyone really needs during lunch, but it is hard to resist. For instance, the fried chicken platter comes equipped with 2 sides (in this case mac and cheese and baked beans with pork), cornbread, bbq sauce and that is all in addition to 4 enormous pieces of chicken. Crispy, with a bit of spice, the chicken served its purpose, but I may stick with the BBQ next time. Same goes for the burger, an enormous patty of overcooked, underseasoned ground beef.Dallas Jones BBQ offers a nice change of pace for lunch, dinner or even a catering event and while it's no RUB, Dinosaur or Daisy May's, it sure is recommended spot if you are in the area.178 W Houston St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 741-7390, Reservations - Not needed/accepted, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($10-20/person)

Restaurant Review: Blue Ribbon Sushi

***CONTENT
A recent business lunch lead me into Soho for some delicious sushi at Blue Ribbon Sushi. Not a normal destination for lunch as the spot is quite pricey I made sure to enjoy every morsel of fresh fish throughout the meal. The physical layout of the restaurant is very deceptive. Walking in it appears miniscule with a few tables and a sushi bar, but the back opens up to a private little booth as well as more seating for over a dozen people. It is still a tight space, but a comforting space with low lights (even at 1pm), calming music (except for the random 80's tracks) and a very Japanese minimalist inspired interior.Considering it was lunch and also not on my dime we all showed some respect when choosing our food, I for one opted for the sushi platter, a 1 roll and 7 piece delight. Also ordered around were the pieces of scallop, octopus, the fresh Japanese uni, squid, salads and edamame. The platter came with salmon, white tuna, tuna, mackerel, shrimp, yellotwail, fluke and a spicy tuna roll. While none of the these bites were new to me I was particularly fond of the salmon, fluke and mackerel. The salmon was amazingly soft, more so than the tuna actually while the fluke had a nice clean flavor. The mackerel, a very different fish, was tender, but boasted a strong enjoyable fishy taste and was topped with a bit of scallion paste. My two additional pieces, scallop and uni, were top notch. Fresh as can be, the scallop was tender, sweet and tasted how a scallop should always taste. The uni, a special for the day as it was flown in from Japan, was extra creamy and without much prompting melted right in your mouth. The rest of the meal was also quite enjoyable and appropriately filling for lunch.On another occassion I would like to dive into some of the more excotic offerings at Blue Ribbon Sushi, but for now I'm happy with my lunch selections. Leaving comfortable full, feeling clean and satisfied is a good way to leave a restaurant and thankfully I did not have to pick up the tab either. The Blue Ribbon restaurants always serve the highest quality of food in my opinion and I have always enjoyed my food at the number of locations, but one must be prepared to spend in order to not only enjoy the experierence, but get a full meal. This definitely holds true as lunch can exceed $40 a person quickly without any drinks. With that said, I do recommend Blue Ribbon as it is some of the finest fish I have had in the city. 119 Sullivan St, New York, NY - (212) 343-0404‎, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Expensive ($40-80/person)

Interesting point. Well it was a special of the day and described as a much creamier and lighter version. I enjoyed it thoroughly although you need to just let in melt in your mouth as no real chewing was needed.

The second portion of Labor Day weekend brought a different type of experience. For the most part I was able to take advantage of the weather and spend time outside, part at the U.S. Open and the other in Brooklyn and on my patio. This is the type of weather I truly enjoy, warm and sunny during the day, but cool and refreshing in the evening.US OpenUS Open eating For almost a decade I have been visiting the U.S. Open as a family tradition watching greats such as Sampras, Agassi, Chang, Federer, Hingis and more. It is always a great experience and one I hope continues for years to come, however, there has never been a wide array of dining options until the past few years. Previously, burgers, dogs, chicken fingers and such were the common lunch/dinner for many attendees, but this has all changed. Craving a corned beef sandwich? Maybe a platter of fish and chips? Or are you really in the mood for chicken tikka masala? Well all of these are available plus much more. Your standard stadium fare is still available, but no longer are you stuck with it. A chicken tikka wrap (from Curry Curry) was decent and a nice alternative to the usual as was the surprisingly crisp fish and chip platter. Carnegie Deli provides the corned beef and while good, it is much better at the actual location. There was more to indulge in, but the prices still reflect stadium prices, keeping me from ordering up a feast. Flatbush Farm LunchI've been a fan of Flatbush Farm ever since I sunk my teeth into their wonderful French dip sandwich. In my previous review I had only really covered the dinner and bar menu, but with the long weekend and nothing to do for lunch on Labor Day I made my way over to the farm for lunch on their spacious patio. The patio is pretty massive so we had our choice of seats as did another dozen or so on this beautiful day.The lunch menu, while small, had some nice selections many of which highlighted the last of the Summer's bounty. Fried green tomato sandwich, braised tuna belly sandwich and more with my eyes darting straight to the fried chicken. Unfortunately the restaurant was not serving fried chicken today, a huge crush to me, but we pushed on and ordered a BLT sandwich and the house burger with cheddar. I had surprisingly never had the burger here in all my trips and felt it a good time to indulge seeing it was Labor Day. To wash it all down I opted for a bloody mary, a delicious concotion that was quite spicy and very enjoyable. One of my top bloody marys although I wish they had included celery. The BLT was good, quality ingredients on thick toasted white bread, it was a simple, somewhat light sandwich although a little pricey at $10.My burger on the other hand left me regretting my decision. Aside from the fact that I had to remind the server (who seemed to be sleep walking) the temperature of my burger multiple times it was an all out disaster. Arrived completely dwarfed by the bun it sat on (a challah roll fit to hold a 10oz burger possibly), it was very well done, completely lacking flavor and topped with 2 sliced of unmelted cheddar. I ended up trimming off a good third of the bread to better fit the burger, but it did little to fix the overall problem of an overcooked burger. I found it hard to comprehend all of this sliding past the chef. Granted it was a holiday lunch and it is likely the head chef was not present, but for a burger to be served with such blaring problems confounds me. Fortunately the fries were good, albeit quite salty, and I was hungry enough to persevere. However, I do not anticipate ordering another burger here for quite some time if at all and may just stick with the surefire French dip moving forward.76 Saint Marks Ave, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 622-3276, Reservations - Not Necessary, Price - Moderate ($15-30)Peaceful labor day bbq Of course what is Labor Day without a BBQ, so naturally I invited a few people over and threw together a quick menu that could be grilled in our backyard. Opting for a lighter menu, we made grilled spicy fish sandwiches, grilled corn and homemade coleslaw. The fish (tilapia) was seasoned in advance with a mixture of chipotle, cayenne, de arbol chili, parsley, salt, pepper, olive oil and lemon and grilled on medium heat. This was served on Tom Cat Bakery Ciabatta, some of the best bread in the city, with lettuce, tomatoes, red onion, spicy mayo and an avocado spread. The sandwiches evoked a New Orleans Po'boy without the fried element. Accompanying this we picked up some delicious corn on the cob, and simply slathered it with butter after it cooked up on the grill. Wrapping up the meal, the coleslaw was made with red and green cabbage, carrots, red onions, seasoned salt, rice vinegar, honey, mayo, fresh parsley, nutmeg, salt and pepper and sat for a few hours to let the juices absorb. A simple meal with easy preparation and clean up, but a great way to spend some time outside with friends enjoying great food.

If you are like me, you were eating and drinking your way through this past Labor Day weekend. A wonderful weekend with great weather, friends, family and more. Fortunately I had a 4 day weekend allowing for an extra day of indulgence. I made a few stops throughout the weekend some more memorable than others, but all contributed to a great Labor Day weekend.Lederhosen Wurst & BierhausIt all started with a trip to what is quickly becoming one of my favorite bars in Manhattan, Lederhosen, a German beer and sausage house in the West Village. Its location is somewhat hidden on a gorgeous tree-lined street of brownstones. Entering you can take the extremely narrow stair way (only 3-4 stairs) or saunter down the ramp. This is no ordinary bar, beer garden painted back room (kind of funny in a way), walls adorned with rugby and soccer (football) jerseys and plenty of German beer and food all around. A small bit of Bavaria in our own backyard. Service is excellent and friendly which matches the overall attitude of the bar. On the numerous occasions I've come here I have talked with a variety of interesting (and unique) people.Order up some of the delicious bauernwurst, a plump grilled beef and pork sausage, adorned with red cabbage, sauerkraut, onions and mustard and served on a crusty roll. For big eaters it is merely a snack, but at $4.50 it's a bargain. Other options include potato pancakes, herring, burgers, potato dishes and much more. A favorite of mine is the schnitzel sandwich where you can choose from chicken, pork or veal and have it served on rye or pumpernickel. This also comes with the same condiments as the sausage. Not the best schnitzel I have ever had, but a sizable portion with a great mustard it is a great dinner to accompany a few pints (or liters) of German beer.That brings me to the beer offerings; one of the best in the city if you ask me. Order over two dozen German beers, with over half a dozen on tap in either a 1/2 pint, pint, liter, 2 liter or 5 liter keg size. Yes, you can actually order your own 5 liter keg for your table or better yet a 2 liter boot of what you choose for $20 (that works out to about 5.5 beers by the way and click here for more details on the boot). Overall it may not have the best food or be the best looking bar in the city, but between the gracious attitude of the patrons and serves, quality food selection and extensive drink offerings it is hard to find another place like Lederhosen. 39 Grove St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 206-7691, Reservations - Not Needed, Price - Inexpensive (varies)X20I made my way up to Westchester and another meal at Yonkers popular X20. Now I've reviewed x20 before, had a wonderful meal there with a few very memorable dishes, but I felt it necessary to mention some menu changes and improvements. For one, the place is still extremely popular and very difficult to get a reservation at; calling a month in advance works. Another point I'd like to make is that the bar area is quite nice. During my prior visit I did not havea chance to sit at the bar and fully appreciate the drink offerings and design.Getting into the food, the menu was quite different than before. I was unaware of the restaurants seasonality yet pleased to see a variety of the Summer offerings highlighted. A few standouts from the evening include my much loved short rib and foie gras ravioli with truffle butter. A few small packages of pure indulgence, it is hard to not order this whenever dining here, although I would have liked the dish to be a little warmer (it appeared to have sat in the kitchen a few minutes too long). A special for the night, a toro trio appetizer highlighted the best of fresh high-grade toro. Served as tartare, sashimi and nigiri, each presentation offered a different perspective on the fine fish. My entree, a succulent veal hanger, was moist and perfectly cooked, it was fork tender and delicious.Other bites from the night were also quite good and overall I found the restaurant to have improved since my last visit. It is clear the kitchen's strength is meat, but they have made progress in the entree department, an area where I thought the food was lacking a bit back in February. I look forward to my next meal here to again indulge in the ravioli and track their progress.71 Water Grant St. Yonkers, NY 10701, 914-965-1111, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Expensive ($50-75/person)

It's been a busy few weeks with vacations, work and holidays, but I am finally getting to a few write ups. A few weekends back I made my way up to Cape Cod for a nice 4 day weekend with the family (staying in New Seabury). A gorgeous spot, Cape Cod was my vacation destination for many years as a kid so it was nice to retrace my steps and see how the area had changed. A few dramatic changes occurred, but none that prevented me from relaxing, getting sun and eating and drinking well. Whenever I am near the ocean or beach I feel the need to eat seafood and for most of the trip I did just that. Fried fish sandwich for lunch (a few times), clam strips with bellies (can't say I am a huge fan of the bellies, but I am glad I tried them), stuffed scallops and much more. The freshness of the ingredients is clear even at the small fish shacks.Other culinary highlights included my meal of sweetbreads, chantrelles and fingerlings at Bleu in Mashpee. Never before have I seen sweetbreads these large. They were tender and mild, with a nice crispiness, I probably could have done with half the portion. A salad of heirloom tomatoes was also perfect with the taste of Summer clear and bright, it was something I wish I could eat year round. The gorgeous Chatham Inn in Chatham, MA was the sight of another delicious meal. Although we were dressed more for beachside dining than fine dining, we found a cozy table at the Inn's Tavern, a rather loud space with a surprising menu. While dishes such as fish and chips were expected, I did not anticipate seeing a Monkfish osso buco on the menu, nor did I expect an assortment of miniature desserts. The Monkfsih, served with kale, mussels and chorizo was perfectly cooked and seasoned; an absolutely wonderful dish with a wide array of flavors. The miniature desserts were perfect for those just interested in a few sweet bites. Churros with chocolate jalapeno ice cream were the size of a pen cap, but had huge unique flavors. Apple beignets, again the size of a silver dollar were stuffed with apples and served alongside fresh vanilla bean ice cream. The poor clam chowder I had to open the meal was quickly forgotten after those surpsingly delicious courses. Gorgeous weather, great food and quality time with the family made for an excellent weekend in the Cape. While it may be a bit of a trek for most of us New Yorkers it is worth it if the opportunity arises. A solid way to help wrap up the Summer in my opinion.

***CONTENT
Always looking for a new lunch spot near work I've scoured the West Village and Soho for almost a year and recently stumbled upon a promising new option: Mooncake Foods. Though it's name may imply dessert, this restaurant is more of an Asian diner dishing up reliable salads, sandwiches and platters at an alarmingly affordable price. It's location is rather obscure, quite close to the Holland Tunnel entrance, but don't let that fool you. Always packed during lunch I've added it to my rotation of lunch stops. Approaching Mooncake Foods you may think you are walking up to an old fashioned diner. The exterior surely does not scream fresh or quality, let alone Asian. Likewise the interior is setup just like an old diner. A counter with red padded stools as well as booths and small tables complete the art deco look, but it's the food that will keep you hear. Behind the counter is where all the action happens. Two men of severe patience and skill move rapidly assembling all types of dishes. They broil fish and meats, slice baguette's, prepare salads and scoop white and brown rice in a state of organized chaos.On my first trip here I watched as they prepared my sliced steak platter with cilantro and ginger. Huge chunks of perfectly cooked steak topped with a salty, smokey cilantro ginger sauce and accompanied by an abundance of lettuce and brown rice. It was a rather large lunch, but only cost $8.80 (plus tax and tip). On other trips I ordered the spicy hoisin fish tacos with roasted pinu nut hoisin sauce, though an appetizing description the dish did not live up to the hype. The sauce was overly salty and should be used sparingly. Likewise the anise and beer braised beef shins served in tortillas while amazingly tender were quite salty. I would like to order this again, but perhaps hold off on using the dipping sauce and opt for more lettuce in the tortillas. A popular favorite for many, the miso glazed salmon is hard to dislike. Moist and tender, it is a wonderfully prepared dish and one I expect to order again. Other options include chicken wings with honey and soy, crawfish dumplings, a tuna burger with wasabi mayo and a variety of salads and wonton soups.It's amazing that outside of Chinatown I am able to find this wide array of dishes all affordable and within walking distance of my office. For those more North in the city, there is a Chelsea location which I've yet to visit that offers the same menu and pricing. Mooncake foods is open for lunch and dinner and takes cash only.28 Watts St., New York, NY 10013, 212-219-8888, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($7-$15/person)

Restaurant Review: Little Miss Muffin

***CONTENT
Steps from the 7th Ave. Q train in Prospect Heights Brooklyn there is quaint little shop serving delicious pastries, cookies and Jamaican patties. When talking about patties in this neighborhood many people are quick to claim Christie's as the top spot letting this establishment slide under the radar a bit. Little Miss Muffin is the name of this tiny shop, owned and operated by two kind and talented women, it is a hidden gem in my opinion and a place that I will never get tired of. It is a welcoming space about the size of a bedroom, but with strong smells of cookies and coffee (the full name is actually Little Miss Muffin 'N' Her Stuffin).I've started my morning (or afternoon) here with the delicious, buttery croissants, some filled with chocolate, others with strawberries and cream cheese, apple cream or plain. The croissants are flaky, light, certainly not healthy, but absolutely delicious and hard to resist. Muffins, the stores namesake, are also delicious. A simple corn muffin is moist, buttery of course, and always fresh. The chocolate chip muffin, a treat on occasion, is rich and moist and requires a glass of milk when eating.Jamaican patties, one of the perfect handheld meals if made well, are one of my favorite items at Little Miss Muffin. The most well known variety, beef, comes in mild and spicy and while good are not stellar. However, the chicken patties are where Little Miss Muffin really shines. My personal favorite, however, is the BBQ chicken patty, it appears much thicker and larger than any of the other patties and is stuffed with tender shreds of thigh meat. A sweet tangy BBQ sauce with an appropriate kick provides the flavor and 9 times out of 10 keeps the patty nice and moist. The jerk chicken patty also offers a nice change of pace, a sweet and spicy sauce mixed with ground chicken is quite pleasing, albeit a bit thin. The crust for all of the patties is relatively standard, flaky, golden, buttery and a bit dry, but it's the fillings that make them great.For dessert, or just a snack, I've sampled a variety of their cookies and always find them stellar. It is a treat when they are straight out of the oven, but even when they have cooled the moisture is retained. Crisp sides give way to a moist, soft center filled with a variety of things. Chocolate chip and peanut butter are my favorites, but you can't really go wrong with any of the other selections.Nothing on the menu exceeds $3 so it is easy to get a feast here for very little. I highly recommend, while the weather is still warm, grabbing a selection of patties and cookies and heading to Prospect Park. The patties travel well, keep warm and are a very easy delicious meal while basking in the Summer sun. Another highlight for all you coffee drinkers is their iced coffee. Refreshing, clean tasting and always fresh, it's gained the title \"Best Iced Coffee\" from my girlfriend and I easily agree.174 Park Pl, Brooklyn, NY 11238, (718) 857-4963, Reservations - It's a takeout place, Price - Inexpensive ($3-6/person)

Eater reports that Momofuku Ko may be open for lunch. I'm curious as to what the menu would be like as I certainly don't know many people who can 1) afford to take 3 hours off of work, 2) eat 10 courses and 3) are comfortable spending $100+ on lunch. Tired of hangovers? Well maybe it's time to start drinking organic beer and wine. The NY Daily News reports organic booze may in fact reduce your hangover. Interesting...Serious Eats lists upcoming food events for this weekendRestaurant openings from the NYTimes and EaterSerious Eats provides a list of participants for Rachel Ray's Burger Bash this Fall as part of the NYC Wine & Food Festival. A great list likely producing some tasty burgers, but at $200 a ticket it is a bit overpriced.

***CONTENT
The gastro-pub has infiltrated NYC with such places as the E.U., Spotted Pig, and even Flatbush Farm in Brooklyn over the past few years. A relative newcomer, Alchemy which opened last year in Park Slope, has seen it's share of ups and downs, initially receiving rave reviews, but recently locals have been quick to claim the restaurant is in the middle of a crisis. I've read on multiple occasions that the food, service and overall experience is nothing like it used to be, a shadow of its former self. I was disappointed to here this, as a resident of the area you hate to see restaurants struggling, especially one which I thought had promise and was excited to go to. Well, I finally made my way over to Alchemy after some indecisiveness and I am quite happy with my decision. The dark restaurant, located in North Park Slope, was relatively empty when we walked in on a Wednesday. I was actually somewhat put off and began to doubt myself, however, as we walked towards the patio we found it much more welcoming. A large patio filled with 2 and 4 tops allowed us to not only to sit outside, but also not feel as if we were the only diners here. The menu has a variety of standard pub dishes (burger, fish and chips), but also more creative or unique dishes including Gorgonzola and walnut ravioli, duck confit cassoulet and wild mushroom barley risotto to name a few. We ordered up an appetizer of short ribs on a polenta cake with demi glace to start. A rather large portion for an appetizer, the dish was okay, but completely overwhelmed by the demi glace. It overpowered the short rib and the polenta and left me rather disappointed, although I do love short ribs in all forms.For entrees we ordered the Alchemy shells and cheese with peas (sans bacon) and the Gorgonzola walnut ravioli. Again the portion size impressed us. I certainly did not expect a heaping bowl to be placed in front of me, and it made me think I could have done without the short rib even more. Both dishes were quite good and reasonably priced, $13 and $16. The shells and cheese were underseasoned for me, but my girlfriend thought otherwise. My ravioli also featured arugula and a sage brown butter sauce, a nice herbaceous flavor to accompany the Gorgonzola walnut filling. Sufficiently full it was pleasing to know that Alchemy is in fact trying to serve and impress the neighborhood regardless of recent reviews. I'll have to make it back for some of the other dishes, including the sticky Guinness pudding and the Alchemy burger.56 5th Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718) 636-4385, Reservations - Not Necessary, Price - Moderate ($15-30/person)

Restaurant Review: Blue Hill at Stone Barns

***CONTENT
Over the past year or so I've really started to appreciate the simplicity of food. I've enjoyed taking stellar ingredients and preparing them with little more than olive oil, salt, pepper and some fresh herbs. It's this style of cooking where you can fully appreciate food. One person in the restaurant industry who not only follows this practice, but has redefined it is Chef Dan Barber. Barber has always had an affinity for preserving the natural integrity of food, not muddying it up with fancy or unnecessary ingredients. Barber also is the Chef/Owner of the critically acclaimed Blue Hill at Stone Barns restaurant and farm in Tarrytown, NY (there is also a Blue Hill location in the West Village). I was fortunate enough to dine here this past weekend and it truly was a revelatory experience.Driving onto the grounds it is hard to miss the giant cows, rows and rows of corn stalks, vines of multi-colored tomatoes and the massive heritage pigs. Chef Barber has setup the grounds at Blue Hill to support exquisite menus crafted with the freshest ingredients every season always keeping in mind the impact he has on the environment. It being August I knew I was in store for plenty of tomatoes. The farm is covered with them, all sizes, shapes, colors and ultimately tastes. Walking around the grounds other highlights included the turkey pens, the greenhouse filled with more varieties of lettuce than I knew existed, roaming sheep, herb gardens and more. It is a must for anyone to survey the grounds, they are beautiful, enlightening and hard to walk away from.Making your way towards the restaurant you enter a gorgeous courtyard reminiscent of many of the castles and estates I saw while studying in England. Detailed craftsmanship is everywhere and a feeling of serenity hits you before even taking a bite of food, this is truly an unmatched experience. Upon entering the restaurant it is hard to miss the comfortable rustic, but still modern decor: weathered wood floors, tables, chairs, an enormous table holding warm bread and beverages and then a cathedral style ceiling that is more 21st century than I expected. The well dressed servers are everywhere, but also never in your way. They swarm when needed, but keep their distance otherwise.The menus were explained in great lengths to us, with the summary being that a list of today's fresh ingredients are provided and the diner gets to say whether they dislike, or absolutely love specific ingredients. The menu is then crafted keeping allergies, dislikes, likes, etc. in mind. Our table opted for the 5-course tasting menu (the 7-course Farmer's Feast was not the choice of my family) and so began our 3 hour experience. Servers brought out our amuse bouche, a trio of delicious little bites highlighting the freshest ingredients at this time. A variety of tomatoes were placed on little spikes and seasoned with sea salt. A skewer with fresh squash half covered in pancetta and sesame seeds was pleasing from a taste and textural standpoint. A shot glass of \"Blue Hill V-8\" was refreshing and offered a nice hint of onion and celery. The last little bite was something I wish I had more of, a \"tomato burger\" which was essentially a thick tomato sauce with cheese on a mini corn bread \"roll\". Its size was similar to a silver dollar, but it offered bold flavors of summer.With a well timed delay between the amuse and the 1st course, we were presented with a gorgeous watermelon, heirloom tomato gazpacho. Adorned with edible flowers and microgreens the dish was stunning, but also tasted wonderful. It was soothing, refreshing and vibrant, a great start. One thing to note here, the service at Blue Hill is beyond stellar. Each plate is placed on the table in syncopation and with a party of 5 it becomes quite impressive. Our second course was another example of beautifully plated ingredients. A portion of seabass, seared to perfection, sat atop a salty, garlicky pistou made of summer beans, zucchini and broccoli. Too salty on its own, the pistou worked perfectly when paired with the mildly seasoned fish. Another winner, agreed everyone at the table.The third course showcased the chefs pasta making skills. A gorgeous little package of housemade ricotta, farm grown artichokes topped with a tomato caper sauce, it was a light, but a somewhat indulgent little bite. The pasta had been slightly browned on the top adding a nice textural element. The fourth course is where the restaurant really showed its true colors. I had mentioned to our server that I am all for head to tail eating when ordering and he made sure the chefs were aware. As a result I was presented with a massive square plate showcasing different aspects of the farms heritage pigs: loin, belly, cheek, boudin blanc (a white sausage made with the liver/heart and milk) and jowel. To some this may sound a bit daunting, but when I heard this description I burst into a smile. To round things out, or at least provide something else other than pig on the plate there were some delicious string beans, but they just added color to to the plate. Each different piece of the pig offered a new taste and texture. There were a few bites of each, but I could have easily eaten more of the boudin blanc, the cheek and the loin. Three distinct tastes, all absolutely delicious. Not to be forgotten, everyone else at my table was served perfectly cooked ribeye in a ratatouille sauce with a vibrant zucchini puree. A delicious dish, but it had no chance when compared to my boldly flavored head to tail plate.To finish up we were served a delicious peach sorbet with fresh peaches and currants. It was refreshing, sweet, tart and the perfect balance of flavors after the previous course. It also set the stage for a trio of desserts that were served to us. Pistachio cake with raspberry sorbet and creme fraiche was good, but I could have easily done without it. The olive oil cake was a bit more enjoyable and it was topped with Thai basil sorbet and blueberries, a unique combination. The best of the three was the chocolate brioche pudding with caramel ice cream, which had to have had some espresso whipped into it and was rich, but not heavy. The desserts were probably the weakest part of the meal, but enjoyable nonetheless. They were followed by the petit fours, mini strawberry macaroons.Other highlights of the meal included the wine list, which is quite extensive and yielded a delicious Pinot Noir for our table (Brooks, Janus Pinot Noir 2005 from Oregon). And not to be forgotten, the teasin which is roughly a cart of over a dozen fresh herbs that you can select from in order to make a fresh pot of tea. At $15 it is the priciest tea I have ever seen, but it is also quite an impressive show as the server takes his antique scissors and snips off bits of lemongrass, purple basil, lemon thyme, eucalyptus or many other herbs into a clear glass tea pot. To no surprise you are also presented with a gorgeous jar of honey from the farm.Our meal wrapped up roughly 3 hours after we sat down, it was now dark outside with the sun fading in the distance. I was full, plenty full, but I also felt slightly different as if I had been educated or enlightened in some way. It was an eye opening experience and helps you really respect all that goes into your food, I will never forget it and suggest everyone make the trek just once. It may cost quite a bit, but what you get is more than just a meal here and it is well worth every cent.630 Bedford Rd, Tarrytown, NY - (914) 366-9600, Reservations - Required (taken months in advance), Price - Very Expensive (minimum $120/person)‎

Inspired to eat more food from Blue Ribbon due to my delicious lunch there recently and Ed Levine's glowing review I made my way over to Blue Ribbon Bakery Market. The name is a mouthful, but all you really need to know is that at the market you can score some delicious open-faced sandwiches, breads, sides, drinks and honeys all of the highest quality. The market is just down the street from Blue Ribbon Bakery and is an easy and affordable way to get a quick bite.Upon entering the market you are hit with a strong smell of freshly baked bread. Along one wall there is an impressive display of brioche, multi-grain, challah, baguettes and more. A small chalkboard of the toast menus is hanging across the refrigerated section which contains milks, sides, pickles, smoked duck breasts and more. The toast menu is broken out into meat, vegetables, fish, butter and fruit for a total of 22 options and are priced between $3 and $10. I found the smoked duck breast with Mexican honey mustard superb and quite filling. The tender duck perfectly cooked (served at room temperature) was topped with the zesty and sweet homemade honey mustard. For a lighter option the hummus sandwich was delicious and surprisingly vibrant in taste. The smooth hummus was topped with bits of red onion, tomatoes, lemon olive oil, paprika and parsley. A gorgeous looking toast it was perfect for a light lunch. Other options include a tune melt, smoked salmon or sturgeon, mozzarella and basil pesto and many more. For some the toasts may not be enough for a full lunch so I suggest any of the refrigerated sides or a 5 pack of delicious housemade chocolate cookies. I also highly recommend picking up some of the bread either to accompany your meal or for a later time. The challah is delicious and perfect for bread pudding, french toast or just with butter. The famed bacon and red onion loaf is also available for a meager $2.50 along with other interestingly flavored options.While the prices may be slightly higher than your average corner sandwich shop, the ingredients are top notch and well worth it. Be aware that the space is small with no seating except outside, but it's rather therapeutic to to stand while eating your toast surrounded by the fabulous smells of fresh breads.14 Bedford Street New York, NY 10014, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive ($5-$15/person)Update: a recent addition to the menu (as of 8/18), the baked brie with apples, almonds and olive oil is quite delightful. Creamy, salty and a perfect balance of flavors, it is a must get for brie lovers.

Restaurant Review: La Taqueria

I've always had an affinity for tacos, soft-shell, hard shell, it doesn't matter. Maybe it is the hand held aspect or the mere variety of ingredients you can stuff into a taco, regardless I love tacos. La Taqueria is a great place to grab a number of different styles of tacos, but you need to know a few things. 1. La Taq, the recently rennovated \"other half\" of the restaurant is overpriced. 2. Order from the counter on the right hand side of the restaurant. Hopefully those two rules help get across my point.La Taqueria is a somewhat weathered indoor California taco stand with the option to dine in at the few small tables available or take out/delivery. Walking in you are met with a giant board of bright colors and an appetizing list of food. Below that board you will see much of the ingredients, prepared earlier for the most part, which fill the tacos, burritos, quesadillas and more. Don't be alarmed that some of the food is pre made. Unless you are getting the last serving of the day everything is relatively vibrant and fresh, contrary to the opinion of others. A grill is generally fired up with carne asada (flank steak), chicken and tortillas and there is a rotisserie with whole chickens going all day.I personally recommend Lupe's taco, a freshly fried tortilla shell stuffed with barbacoa (shredded beef) or carne asada. It's topped with lettuce, tomato and cheese. Although it may not be the most authentic dish I find the crunch of the shell, which is fried on the spot, a great compliment to the tender beef. Another popular favorite of mine is Pollo Asado taco filled with succulent bits of chicken thigh and topped off the same as Lupe's taco. Aside from tacos The chimichanga (clearly like fried items) is a massive hunk of food and happily the crispy outer shell holds up to the sauce and filling offering some wonderful flavors and textures. The enchiladas are a safe bet, although I find them topped off with way too much sauce. Guacamole, while refreshing and a great compliment to any meal falls short with inconsistent seasoning. Other items including fajitas, the rotisserie chickens and nachos are standard fare, but satisfying.A great thing about eating on the low-key, stand side is the free salsa's. A tomatillo, chunky tomato and chipotle based salsa are available by the bucket load along with jalapanos, pickled vegetables and a cilantro onion mixture. Some issues with cleanliness may present themselves when the place is busy, but in those cases opt for the benches out front or even a short walk to the park. Definitely not the best Mexican I've ever had, but a convenient and quite satisfying option for the area72 Seventh Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11217, 718-398-4300, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive ($5-15/person)

I'm always looking for inexpensive ways to eat great at home and of course that can be quite difficult with the way food is being priced these days. I generally purchase my meat from Fresh Direct or a butcher and lately Fresh Direct has been really on top of their game. Specifically, their hanger steak, a popular cut of meat in many restaurants for it's bold beefy taste but inexpensive cost, the steaks usually run between $8.99 - $11.99lb. Last night on the fly I pulled together a delicious recipe using my propane grill, a handful of fresh herbs, spices and greenmarket vegetables.For the hanger steak (recipe for two):1-1.5 lb steak (you will need to cut the fatty connective tissue running down the middle, it's a simple process, creating two long steaks)1 teaspoon dried thyme1 teaspoon celery salt1 teaspoon garlic powdercayenne pepper to tastegenerous amount of salt and pepper1 tablespoon olive oil or enough to lightly coat the steaksRosemary Butter:1-2 tablespoon butter, softenedfresh rosemarysmall squeeze of lemon juiceFor the corn:2 cobs of corn cleaned, but not fully shuckedbuttersalt and pepperlime juice1 teaspoon olive oilFor the vegetables:Heirloom Tomatoes (a few small, or 1-2 large) cut length wise in halfSummer squash (a few small or 1-2 large) cut length wise in half3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar1 tablespoon olive oilsalt and pepper to taste1 tablespoon honeyfresh oregano and basil(optional) 4 thin slices of Parmigiano-Reggiano1. Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees as well as the grill to med-high heat2. After trimming the steak off it's fat mix the spice blend together and coat the entire steak letting it rest for a few minutes3. While letting the steak rest mix all ingredients for the vegetables except the vegetables and fresh herbs to create the sauce/marinade, place vegetables in bowl and lightly toss once the mixture is ready4. Lightly coat the steak and corn in olive oil so as not to stick to the grill and place on the grill. Steak should cook about 4 minutes per side for medium rare and corn can be turned every 3-4 minutes5. Put the vegetables in the oven for 10-15 minutes on 400 F or until they have reached desired tenderness6. Mix softened butter, chopped fresh rosemary and lemon juice and form two equal servings7. Once the steak is ready place on a cutting board and let sit for at least 5 minutes. Serve as preferred; I enjoy a few slices cut off and then the remaining steak for me to cut on my own8. Coat corn in butter, salt, pepper and a squeeze of lime juice9. Remove vegetables from the oven and top with chopped fresh basil and oregano, add optional parmigiano as well10. Serve family style or all on one plate, adding butter to the top of steaks

Restaurant Review: The Chocolate Room

It's hard to resist good quality chocolate. I may not be a dessert person most of the time, but quality sweets are present I generally find myself indulging. Combine that with my girlfriends affection for chocolate and it's a wonder that it took me three years to get to the popular Chocolate Room in Park Slope. The dessert bar, cafe and chocolate boutique has a loyal following, so much so that they have opened up a second location in Carroll Gardens.Finally getting to the Chocolate Room was fairly spontaneous. Wrapping up a delicious meal at Al Di La down the street I craved something sweet, and saw a perfect opportunity to indulge at the Chocolate Room. The physical space is a small relaxed with a slight vintage look, but it is all chocolate from the displays, the smells and the dark wood. It may not be the most comfortable seating arrangement, but the smells and anticipation of rich chocolate goodness is enough to get you by. Quickly scanning the small yet appropriate menus the hot fudge brownie sundae screamed out to me. I thought back to when I was much younger celebrating a youth soccer win or being consoled after a loss at Friday's and getting my favorite sundaes. However, here I wasn't winning or losing, although I was helping my girlfriend celebrate a great new job. The prospect of pure indulgence was all I needed, brownie sundae with homemade mint chip ice cream here I come. Describing the sundae as indulgent or \"chocolaty\" does not really do it justice. A mixture of real (emphasis on real) mint taste, chocolate slivers, hot fudge, whip cream and of course a warm fudge brownie was transcendent. I was in my own world as I quietly ate and every now and again took a breath and smiled from ear to ear. Same situation for my girlfriend who across the table protected her vanilla ice cream sundae from me, I don't blame her, this was delicious. Chocolate Layer Cake, Black Bottom Butterscotch Custard and an enticing Chocolate Fondue are some of the dishes available.Feeling satisfied and having not yet fallen into a food coma we paid and left quickly glancing at the decorative, but surely delicious, handmade chocolates and other chocolate products. Not to be forgotten is the Chocolate Room's wine and port pairings, available with every item on the menu or by themselves. While I made it to the Chocolate Room for dessert it is surely a place for all occasions, including coffee, a snack, drink or even a chocolate lunch or dinner.86 Fifth Avenue, Brooklyn, New York, 718-783-2900, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive ($5-10)

The Blue Ribbon mini-empire is well known by most New Yorkers. One of the more affordable restaurants owned by the Bromberg brothers is Blue Ribbon Bakery, located on the corner of Bedford and Downing in the West Village. This casual eatery with a rustic feel, bakes some of the most delicious breads in the city in addition to serving brunch, lunch and dinner. During lunch they offer a variety of sandwiches between $10-20 all delicious and worth every penny making the restaurant a perfect spot for a long lunch out of the office.Before placing your orders each table receives a delicious basket of fresh bread baked daily. A few slices of challah, olive bread and whole grain bread along with a dish of soft creamy butter, it was a wonderful start to lunch. Fortunately I had recently seen Ed Levine's review of the neighboring Blue Ribbon Bakery Market down the street and their delicious bacon and red onion bread. Be sure to ask your server for some of this savory baked treat. Chunks of bacon and thin slices of red onion baked into a ciabatta style loaf make this some of the best bread I've ever tasted. Word of advice, butter is not necessary as it is already quite moist.Highlights from the meal included the warm goat cheese salad, a heaping portion with two goat cheese toasts and sundried tomatoes. Another popular dish, was the savory and extremely satisfying crispy catfish sandwich. Served on a fresh ciabatta roll with red onion, tomato, lettuce and corn tartar sauce it was one of the better fish sandwiches I've had in recent memory. The fish was perfectly cooked, the bread provided a good amount of chewiness and the tartar added great flavor, though a bit more salt could have been used. Other lunch offerings include a wide variety of appetizers, soups, salads and main courses. Some of my favorites in the past have been the escargot cooked with garlic and butter, pierogies and what I believe to be the best fried chicken in the city. A solid selection of beers and wines are also available throughout the day.Overall a delicious meal, in a great environment. Although it can get rather loud, the restaurant is a great location for an hour out of the office or drinks late night. I look forward to my next meal here, I'm sure there will be many. 35 Downing Street, New York, NY 10014, 212-337-0404, Reservations - Only available for 5+, Price - Moderate/Expensive ($20-$50)

Gobbl lists their 50 top restaurants in NYC. There are certainly some rankings here worth arguing and I'd love to get a better understanding of their \"formula\", but it's interesting reading and makes you think \"how many have I been to?\"Tickets for the Harvest in the Square event in Union Square are now on sale, at a rather pricey $115. However, the money does get you beverages from New York microbreweries and wineries as well as the opportunity to mingle with chefs from Gramercy Tavern, Union Square Cafe, Devi, Tocqueville Strip House and many more. The event is Thursday, September 18thFor those who generally take advantage of Restaurant Week or if you just plain missed out there are 4 more weeks for you to dine on the cheap. Gothamist reports that many of the participating restaurants have extended the promotion till Labor Day.The New York Observer lists 10 new restaurants which it believes live up to if not beyond the hype all which had very little PR supporting them. Quite a few of these are on my \"to go to\" list which is comforting.Tao Palate, a new pan-asian vegan restaurant in Prospect Heights seems fairly close to opening. They've even started handing out menu's to curious passerby's. Brooklynian has the menu.Serious Eats has this weekend's food events.

With restaurant week in full swing and in some cases wrapping up, I was fortunate to snag a last minute reservation at the Modern's Bar Room last night. The Bar Room is a gorgeous, sleek, sexy and modern space outside the more upscale, fine dining Modern restaurant. Both restaurants are under the careful supervision of Danny Meyer's restaurant group equatting to excellent customer service and relations. This is abundantly clear during Restaurant Week as the restaurant pulls out all the stops. Offering a menu as large and diverse as I have ever seen during this promotional two week period I immediately thought we were given the incorrect menu's. Fortunate for us the 8 or so selections for both appetizer and entree were in fact offered as a part of the $35 prix fixed meal, not to be forgotten were the half a dozen or so dessert options.I've always enjoyed the Bar Room and have found the food wonderful, inspired and unique, not to mention the space is just plain fun. After taking a few minutes to select our meals from the abundant options we landed on the upside tuna tartare and warm veal and goat cheese terrine as appetizers, duck confit with shishito pepper hash and crispy cod with apples and celery for entrees and lastly a hazelnut dacquoise with milk chocolate and a buttermilk panna cotta with strawberry soup for dessert. A very well rounded menu with a few clear standouts. My warm veal and goat cheese terrine was sublime, accompanied by a peppery watercress sauce I found it to be quite a comforting starter. The crispy cod offered a high-brow version of fish and chips, without the chips. A perfectly cooked portion of cod sat atop a celery and apple salad along with pickeled onions. Not neccessarily a dish I would go back for, but well throught out and executed. Of the two desserts the hazelnut dacquoise, essentially a dessert cake, was made with a creamy hazelnut filling, milk chocolate sheets and candied pecans. To take a bite with your eyes closed the dish reminded my girlfriend of a Butterfinger with its creamy yet crunchy texture, a great comparison.Overall another wonderful meal at the Bar Room. A great destination whether it is Restaurant Week or not, although the check does arrive quite different (i.e. much higher), I will continue to support the unique food being served here. One note about the restaurant, they also have quite an extensive wine list. Glasses begin at $9 and rise into the twenties. A small yet unique selection of draught beers are also available, I highly recommend the Shmaltz, brewed by Albino Python in New York, flavored with fennel and ginger it was superbly refreshing.9 W 53rd St, New York, NY - (212) 333-1220, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Moderate-Expensive ($50-80/person)‎

Restaurant Review: Artichoke Basille's Pizzeria

***CONTENT
Bloggers, food critics and just plain pizza fans have been talking up Artichoke Basille's Pizzeria for months claiming it the best new slice in Manhattan or even \"Manhattan's DiFara\". With all the press and attention I was wondering when I would ever get a chance to step over to 14th and 1st to grab what I expected to be a wonderful pleasing slice. Known for long lines, odd hours, slow service, and of course their artichoke pizza I was fortunate to be in the neighborhood right before they opened their doors. General knowledge is that come dinner time the lines here get long, people have waited mere minutes to over an hour so it must be good, right?Being the second person in the door at a supposed reputable pizzeria is an accomplishment. I was lucky, I waited no more than five minutes once in the door (and that is with three guys behind the counter). The two slices I'd heard great things about were the square slice and artichoke slice. The square was out first and quickly dropped on a plate while the artichoke pie finished off in the oven. At first glance you will notice all of the pizza's seem rather thick. Not piled with toppings, but just thick dough, layers of cheese and sauce. Ignoring what generally is a concern of mine (thick pies) I bit into the square. At first bite there was a nice taste; basil, indulgent salty cheese, but the sweet sauce and more importantly thick heavy crust was a huge issue. Analyzing the slice after a few more bites I would not rank it too high, nothing about it was memorable or worth $3.50 (although since the slices are so thick it could have been a small lunch for many people).Moving onto the piping hot artichoke slice I felt a sense of concern again, an amazingly thick slice was placed before me. I tried to rationalize it thinking it was only thick to hold up the gooey mess of artichoke, spinach and cheese which covered it. Well, yes it makes sense, you do need something to stand up to the topping, but after speaking with others at the pizzeria it seems all slices were overly thick. Looking beyond the thick crust it was hard to ignore how overcooked it was. On a positive note, I did think the topping had great flavor, it was just served in the wrong way. The artichoke and spinach topping would be much better served as a dip, maybe with bread sticks, crackers, anything but on top of pizza. It is way too creamy, heavy, cheesy and more logisitically, messy to eat (also it is $4.00 for those counting). That's not to say I don't enjoy pizza's with unique or non-authentic toppings. I used to work at a pizzeria where Cajun chicken, chicken parm and lasgana slices were best sellers, and quite good. However, they were not as liquidy and the crust was not as thick.With that said, I find the draw of Artichoke Pizzeria to be more trendy than actually based off of quality. It is a new pizzeria, with attitude, interesting slices and what appear to be some decent ingredients. On the flip side, I can't see a pizzeria of that nature holding up when there are so many better slice joints, but that's just my opinion. Maybe I am more of a purist when it comes to pizza, longing for the thin, crisp slices with the perfect amount of cheese and sauce. Or perhaps the pizza has gone down hill since they opened and if that is the case it is unfortunate I waited so long, but that doesn't excuse the overall poor pizza making. DiFara is certainly safe as the best pizza in my book.328 E 14th St, New York, NY 10003, Phone: (212) 228-2004, Reservations - Not Accepted/Neccessary, Price - Inexpensive ($4-10/person)

Restaurant Review: Boqueria

On a hot summer evening I ventured over to the Flatiron district and around the block from some of the big name stores to a much talked about restaurant Boqueria. The tapas restaurant, with chef/co-owner Seamus Mullen also of Suba, has received much positive press since it opened a few years ago and I felt obligated as a tapas lover to check it out. On this Tuesday night there was no shortage of diners at the somewhat tight yet trendy quarters; a wait for 2 yielded twenty minutes of sitting in the heat outside as there is little standing room near the bar. Fortunately the hostess was accurate and after twenty minutes we were led to our table near the rear of the restaurant. Keeping with the theme of tight quarters our table was situated so that we could hear both neighboring parties and at the same time be forced to raise our voices to speak as it is deafeningly loud (this was only a Tuesday).As for the food, the menu evokes similar dishes from other tapas restaurants, but offers a handful of unique and original plates as well. Before dining at Boqueria it should be noted that Chef Mullen has an affinity for all things pig. Even in a dish sounding of a summertime salad double smoked bacon manages to make its way into the dish. I have no problem with a little pig here or there, but the range of flavors on the menu are almost dulled down due to the over abundance of pig in every dish. Some dishes stood out, the sugar snap peas with double smoked bacon and green market apples was actually quite delicious. A crisp, sweet and salty salad that was amazingly fresh. On the other hand a scallop special with summer peas, favas and of course bacon left me quite unsatisfied. Not only was the taste rather mild and uninspired, but there was only 1 medium sized scallop. Considering the dish was $12 and there were two diners I would have expected a bit more bang for my buck. A fried quail egg and chorizo toast was satisfying, but potentially embarrassing to eat (I recommend taking it down in one bite). A trio of croquettes, featuring a mushroom and truffle oil puree, salt cod and suckling pig were satisfying as were the patatas bravas (fried potatoes with spicy aioli) although not the best I have had.The meal was rounded out with some white wine, white sangria and the churros with warm chocolate sauce. A sweet way to end a meal filled with plenty of salty, porky tastes. Although I can see the draw of Boqueria with it's sleek look, decent tapas selection and extensive drink offerings, ultimately I found it to be middle of the road in terms of food. While many of the dishes looked wonderful the taste was not as big and bold as I have found at many other tapas restaurants.53 W 19th St New York, NY 10011, (212) 727-1548, Reservations - not accepted, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person)

On this gorgeous day I was fortunate to have planned a day off from work, or mental health day I'd like to call it. Of course with all this spare time I had no excuse to not get over to the Union Square Greenmarket. Arriving shortly after noon the market was in full swing and the smells, colors and tastes screamed Summer. I grabbed a few items to play around with and snack on over the next few weeks as you can see by the pictures below. Sugar Snap Peas are on their way out of the market and they are lacking a little sweetness they had a few weeks back, but delicious nonetheless. It's squash season and the wide variety of squashes at the market were impressive.I grabbed a few small ones and plan to either simply grill or saute them as a side. Along with it being squash season, the accompanying squash blossoms are also available throughout the cities greenmarkets.Not needing a full pound I grabbed a handful for a dollar and will likely saute them in a pasta. Some delicious corn was available, though it seemed much of the good offering went in the earlier hours of the market.Lastly, tomatoes certainly not the end of their season at the market, but delicious nonetheless. I love tomatoes and it really is hard to beat a fresh picked tomato raw with some olive oil and sea salt. Holding out till the season is at its peak (August) to stock up, I selected a few gorgeous and odd looking heirloom tomatoes a few of which actually are oblong in shape.More pictures of the market are included for your enjoyment.

Just spoke with Mikey Price at Market Table as he was preparing some food for this evening. Although the dish has been on the menu for a few weeks I felt it necessary to share this description:Sangria marinated hangar steak with grilled caesar and busted tomatoes. If that doesn't sound good to you, especially during the summer months, then you need to check your pulse. I'll certainly be getting over to Market Table to order this up, apparently almost every table has been ordering it and by the looks of the amount of steaks he was prepping the demand doesn't seem to be slowing down. Get on over before they run out.

These days food trucks are all the rage. We have dessert truck (see the Treats Truck), coffee Trucks (see Mud), taco trucks (Calexico) and more recently waffle trucks. Waffles and Dinges, the first of the waffle trucks has been a popular attraction this Spring and Summer, so much so that Park Slope residents were able to convince the owner to commit one day to Park Slope a week.Fortunate me, Waffles and Dinges is a mere 5-10 minute walk from my apartment and just happens to be on 7th Avenue and Carroll Street. You can't miss it, the bright yellow truck with a short line forming on the side is a welcome and easy to spot sight every Saturday from 11am - 6pm. The menu consists of Brussels style waffles, rectangular, crunchy and light or liege waffles, chewy, rich and round waffles. There are a handful of toppings or dinges including whipped cream, strawberries, Nutella, chocolate fudge and most recently honey. After some quick thinking I ordered up the Brussels style waffle stopped with Nutella ($5). As you can see in the picture the waffle was extremely rich with the addition of Nutella, I was kicking myself for not adding on some strawberries or even whipped cream to balance things out. Regardless the waffle was delicious. Crisp, and light as the menu suggests and it certainly held up and did not wilt upon being drenched in Nutella.Fortunately for me Saturday is right around the corner so I can try another variation, but there are plenty of other hours and locations for the Waffles and Dinges truck. Check out the webiste for more details and enjoy.

A few interesting articles/features start off yet another work week:The NYTimes publishes an article about dining in Prospect Heights, my current home, and while they mention some of the solid dining options they leave out way too many restaurants. Others left off the list include Amorina, Aliseo, Le Gamin, Noona, Tavern on the Dean, Geido and many smaller establishments.Bottomless Dish and CitySearch release their list of the cheapest eats in the city. Some of the assumed establishments include Dumpling House, Gray's Papaya and Gus's Pickles, while a few of the other options are new to me. They did leave off a pretty obvious one in 99cent Fresh Pizza though.Although NYTimes critic Frank Bruni generally comments more about the food at a restaurant than anything else, he does understand and appreciate a restaurants beauty. He's compiled his 12 best looking restaurants in the city.The famed Alinea of Chicago will be releasing their cookbook this fall. All those foodies out there should get ready for a stunning book along with a corresponding website. For more details check out Eater.The famed Harlem pizzeria, Patsy's, will be turning back the clock and celebrating their 75th anniversary on August 19th with .60 slices. Info courtesy of Slice.

***CONTENT
There has been much fanfare when a new Five Guys Burger opens up around the 5 boroughs, so I figured I should at least try it before jumping to any conclusions. I've heard comparisons to In-N-Out Burger, but also have heard plenty negatives. With that said, a hot Summer day seemed like a perfect excuse to walk over to the newly opened Bleecker and 7th Ave. South location.Upon entering Five Guys you immediately notice the line. Not Shake Shack long, but I was about 10-12 back. Five Guys does offer patrons buckets of peanuts as they wait, a rather smart idea until a handful of kids (and their mother) begin to throw peanuts around scattering them on tables and the floor. The ordering process here is pretty simple, you can get a standard burger (which too my surprise is actually two 3.3oz patties), a \"little\" burger (single patty), hot dogs, fries and drinks. Prices are reasonable, but can get relatively high if you add on fries and a soda to your burger choice. On a positive note, all toppings (aside from cheese and bacon) are free of charge so you can pile on the lettuce, tomato, grilled onions or jalapeños without worry.I ordered up a cheeseburger with lettuce, tomato and grilled onions and as you can see from the picture it was rather large and ended up very messy. Something you must know about Five Guys is that they cook all their burgers to a disappointing well done. Unfortunately, while this may benefit the speed of the kitchen and prevent any temperature complaints the burger does suffer. Since each patty is already rather thing cooking it well done really chars the entire burger. The meat is packed loosely, a plus, but you end up getting many little crunchy burnt bits in every bite. Yes, the meat is fresh and ground every day on sight, but when you cook it to a certain point you lose the great taste of the fresh beef. The toppings were fine, although the tomato was sliced way too thick and I had to remove it. Standard American cheese and sesame seed buns are used, it works for this burger, but I generally prefer cheddar or Gruyere. I did have a chance to sample some of the fries, skin on freshly cut, but a tad under seasoned I would order them next time, but with a \"little\" burger.Overall I was unimpressed and find Five Guys a poor excuse for an East coast In-N-Out Burger. Yes, they try and I appreciate the fresh ingredients, I can see the draw of their food in some respect, but for me I'd take Shake Shack any day and bear the line to get it.296 Bleecker St New York, NY 10014, Get Directions(212) 367-9200, Price - Inexpensive ($8-12/person) Locations nationwide as well http://www.fiveguys.com/

Where does it say that Five Guys is an east coast in and out? Ive never even compared the two, they're nothing alike, Five Guys doesnt even offer thousand island dressing. I think if you went in with that mindset you were setting yourself up for disappointment. Take Five Guys for what it is, a better than average fast food burger. You can't even compare it to shake shack where the burger meat is from LaFrieda (purveyor to the big boys) and contains what I believe is a mix or brisket and sirloin.

I have heard many people refer to Five Guys as an east coast burger. I did not go into the meal thinking that, my experience was purely based on the food regardless of previous reviews I've heard. I just wanted a good burger and hoped that Five Guys would provide me one. No need to take offense just because I had a subpar experience. Just my opinion. You are correct in one aspect, Five Guys is a glorified fast food burger, but in my opinion it doesn't excel beyond fast food that much.

A few noteworthy bites from this week:Shea is turning into a USHG run stadium complete with a Shake Shack, Blue Smoke, fine dining, a taqueria and a Belgian frites stand. Eater has the details.The Frying Pan, a popular bar/restaurant off the Westside Highway has reopened. Now you can get your $5, a lobster and view of New Jersey...just need to cross the highway first. NYmagAs anyone could have guessed, Brother Jimmy's will be opening a location in Murray Hill (how appropriate?!). Expect mediocre BBQ, lots of TV's and plenty of drunken newly graduated New Yorkers. I'm sure I'll get dragged there one day. NYmagSpike from this past season of Top Chef has opened his new burger spot in DC to decent reviews. His plans are to grow the bluntly named \"Good Stuff Eatery\" on a national scale, but lets see how the first restaurant does first. I have to admit some of the menu does sound tasty. SeriousEatsNew Whole Foods has opened in Tribeca, here's hoping a Brooklyn one is next. NYmag

Weekends at the Beach: Montauk and Cape May

***CONTENT
The past two weekends I have been fortunate to get out of the city and spend some time at the beach. My travels brought me to Montauk and Cape May, two very different towns, both offering a nice escape.My Montauk trip was also part wine tasting trip and as a result I drove around the North Fork, Sag Harbor and near East Hampton. The weekend was filled with mostly clouds, but that did not stop the wine tasting. Some of the highlights included Peconic Bay Vineyards on the North Fork, a beautiful little vineyard with a recently rennovated tasting room. Chatting with the older man behind the counter was wonderful and I discovered a delicious Reisling which I quickly purchased a bottle of. Down south outside East Hampton were my two favorite vineyards which to my surprise really hold their own when compared to some higher end California vineyards. Channing Daughters and Duck Walk not only have gorgeous sprawling facilities but they produce some of, in my opinion, the best wine on the east coast. At Channing Daughters a tasting of 5 wines quickly turned into 9 as we were able to easily connect about food and wine with the employee there. My favorite of the tasting was the Rosso Fresco 2006, a wine that is flexible in its use with strong berry flavors, but not overpowering or too sweet. It was a blend predominately of Merlot. Duck Walk, with the guidance of a close friend, introduced me to my new favorite wine, the 2004 Cabernet Sauvingnon Reserve. A delicious all-purpose cab that had a bold flavor and amazingly smooth finish. I have to thank my friend Mike for introducing me to this wine and only hope I can find a good supply as it is limited to only 200 cases.Of course the weekend was not all about food and I was fortunate to dine on some delicious treats. From East by Northeast the Duck Taco's in Wonton Shells were amazing and should be added to a menu here in NYC. A duck confit and fig risotto at Harvest is probably one of my top dishes this summer. The ubiquitous stop at the famous \"Lunch\" opened my eyes to the best fish and chips I've ever had, made with puffer fish and available only in June and July. If you get a chance to grab try any of these three I highly recommend it.More recently I wrapped up a July 4th weekend on the southern most tip of New Jersey in Cape May. A charming little town dotted with gorgeous Victorian mansions, the weather unfortunately was not in our favor. Regardless it was a vacation and offered plenty relaxation. From a food perspective Cape May has its limits, though it does have good options if you do your homework.For breakfast I would recommend George's Place, a family run spot on the main strip (Beach Ave.) that has been serving breakfast, lunch and dinner since 1968. A huge portion of raisin and walnut pancakes was delicious albeit too much food for one person. The French toast with sugar sauteed bananas was a bit more manageable and quite delicious. Some of the more notable meals included the limited Osso Bucco at Freso's a quaint Italian Bistro. A generous portion complete with bone marrow it was delicious especially when paired with the bottle of Rosso Fresco from Channing Daughters in LI (Fresco's is BYOB). A meal at the popular Peter Shields Inn proved uneven, but had a standout crab and lobster cake as well as a spicy seared scallop, both paired perfectly with the cab from Duck Walk.There is an abundance of sweets available from the wide variety of fudge at the Fudge Kitchen, to the famous custards at Kohr's so don't plan on dieting while here. A small, yet reliable selection of bars provide some nighttime entertainment with standard beer selections and the occasional pleasantry (i.e. Newcastle, Magic Hat, Dogfish).Overall two solid weekends, both offering very different experiences. As I was away from the city it dawned on me how much exposure we have here to food and drinks and that while we are quite fortunate it also can be detrimental to our opinions. When dining here in NYC we have relatively high expectations from a food and service standpoint which may not always be applicable when in other parts of the country. I found myself having to step back and think of some of my dining/drinking experiences relative to their location rather than comparing them to what we have here in New York. I hope to be more realistic or more to be blunt, less of a food snob moving forward and I do think that it is important to have an open, understanding mind and not always see things through the lens we have created here in the city.

With summer officially underway I always find specific foods go best with that hot sunny weather. While the go to's may be anything off a grill and a cold beer there are a handful of delights out there which just taste better in the summer time. - A slice of Pizza - we can debate and debate over which slice joint in the city is best, but which ever is your favorite trying taking it to go and simply strolling around the city with it. A perfect on the walk snack or meal, a good slice of pizza should hold up as you eat while walking. Stick with one slice or it can get a little messy. Recommendations for slices (not pies): Joe's Pizzeria, Bleecker Street Pizza, Grandaisy Bakery and Lazarra's - Falafel - A falafel sandwich if made and wrapped correctly is quite a package. So many flavors and textures that could create potential disaster if not wrapped in wax paper and aluminum foil correctly. When done with you can walk for blocks without worrying about tahini dripping down on your clothes. My recommendation for falafel: Mamoun's, Yatagan, Taim, Azuri Cafe and some assorted street vendors.- Gelato - this is a given, but with all of the fro-yo and gelato spots popping up, and NYMag's recent coverage of the best gelato in the W.Village I thought it deserved a mention. Whether walking around or sitting peacefully in Washington Square Park a nice cold, creamy cup of gelato can be uplifting. I like to grab mine from Grom, Il Laboratorio and Otto (only dine-in, but they have pints).- Ice cold Lemonade or Iced Tea - Another obvious choice, but there are some really impressive 'ades and teas in the city that go unnoticed. Refreshing and better for you than say a Coke, Summer time is the perfect time for these drinks. Recommendations include: Taim's Ginger Mint Lemonade, Westville Blended Mint Lemonade, Hill Country's Iced Tea, the variety of fresh lemonade's and teas at the Greenmarket in Union Square/Grand Army Plaza

Restaurant Review (Revisited): Degustation

***CONTENT
I recently made it back to one of my favorite restaurants. I was introduced to Degustation and Chef Wesley Genovart's cooking awhile back for a generous birthday meal and never looked back when calling it one of my top places to eat. The combination of fantastic unique flavors, wonderful ambiance and proximity to the cooking and chefs is hard to beat anywhere. Fortunately I found a good reason to get back this past weekend and while the menu has been updated everything else was just as good as I remembered.We had an 8pm reservation on Saturday evening and came into a calm yet busy atmosphere. Our seats were waiting for us and as I sat down I noticed Chef Genovart was actually behind the saute station which was a nice surprise, he was simply plating last time I was here. The menu changes seasonally so we were in for a fresh assortment of tastes reminiscent of my earlier trip to the greenmarket. Personally I always enjoy ordering my own dishes as opposed to ordering the tasting menu here, I feel it allows for a bit more control of what you may eat, but that just my opinion.Our decision was to order up a handful, ultimately nine dishes, and share them each. The first plates were our smallest bites of the evening, croquettes with ham and the Spanish \"tortilla\". Both playful, fun and easy to eat we could have put away a dozen of so of each without a second thought. Our next dish was from the 10-course tasting menu as we had inquired about a dish being prepared earlier. It was grilled bluefish on a bed of strawberries, asparagus and what appeared to be cracklin's of some sort topped with peanuts. The combination of fish and strawberries seemed very interesting and odd to me requiring me to order and thankfully it was delicious; soft, crunchy and chewy textures mingled with smoky, sweet and nutty flavors that were quite memorable.The next two courses brought a remarkably fresh and crisp salad of sugar snap peas with lamb bacon and olive oil poached cod with peas and serrano. The sugar snap pea salad was the a taste of summer in a bowl and its presentation matched this. Crisp, refreshing with a hint of smokiness from the bacon it was a very well crafted dish. The cod offered a softer variety of textures and was perfectly cooked. Most importantly the sauce below (which Chef Genovart provided a detailed description of ) was addictive to say the least. A combination of chicken stock, white wine, a variety of herbs and more ingredients than I can't remember, I sure wish I had the opportunity to write it down.Our next two plates brought the meat courses of the night. Here is where there was a slight stumble from the stellar path so far. A dish of quail, pine nut paste and sorrel was overly seasoned with pepper and did not wow me nearly as much as the dishes prior though the breast was well cooked. A filet of wagyu with pickled radishes and an unidentifiable foam looked wonderful, but missed the mark. While good, I've had better beef dishes here and found this to be bland.One thing many diners way about Degustation is that the portions are small. I won't hesitate to agree here and unless you plan to spend you may be left a bit hungry. Fortunately this was a celebration so we ordered up two dishes. The first brought me back to my meal at Ko, it was a slowly poached egg split open with smoked cheese foam, prosciutto and sesame crusted asparagus. While quite salty I really enjoyed this dish. It would have been better suited earlier in the meal, but that was our mistake. Each element in the dish was able to stand out without being overpowered. Our final savory course was the fish crudo, this evening the fish was kampachi. The fish was gorgeous and had smoky salty flavor that tricked the taste buds shortly into thinking it was prosciutto.The meal did consist of some rather salty options and with a very interesting dessert on the menu we did not hesitate to order one a person. The name escapes me, but the dish was compared to a Spanish version of French Toast and was placed upon fresh raspberries. Bruleed prior to serving the brioche used was crisp on top and creamy and sweet on the inside. A very nice way to end the meal. A definite success and enjoyable meal I think I'll keep Degustation as one of my top restaurants for the same reasons as before further impressed with Chef Genovart's inventive culinary mind. 239 E 5th St, New York, NY 10003, (212) 979-1012, Reservations - Highly Recommended, Price - Expensive ($60-80/pp)

For some restaurant weeks are a real drag. Poor options, poor service and overall not a good represenation of what a restaurants real capabilities are. For others it is a challenge, a challenge to make the most of the restaurant week offer and really select the spots they've always wanted to dine at without worrying about poor menu selections. With that said I personally think restaurant week is great. Yes, it could be better on many levels, but I still remember my meals at Tribeca Grill, The Bar Room, Applewood and more not because they were inexpensive, but because they were in fact very good meals.There are a few spots I'm considering this year, all for dinner as I can't make any for lunch unfortunately:- Perry Street- Mia Dona- Bar Room @ The Modern- Anthos- GrayzAny opinions about these spots or experiences would be great, but I'm confident I can get a great 3-course meal at any of these spots.For more on NYC Summer Restaurant Week 2008 click here

For most of us planning a month ahead can be daunting, but how about 5 months? Well start planning as the 1st NYC Wine and Food Festival, presented by The Food Network and Food & Wine Magazine, comes to town October 8th - 11th. Tickets went on sale this past Monday, my apologies for the delay, with a few popular events already being sold out. The most exciting and affordable, is the Anthony Bourdain and Ferran Adria talk at the TimesCenter building. Unfortunatly it is sold out, I managed to get myself a ticket at least, but there are plenty other events. If you're willing to shell out $200 to eat some gourmet burgers and mingle with top-notch chefs check out Rachel Ray's Burger Bash in Brooklyn.

My vacation to Aruba a few weeks back was eye opening for a variety of reasons. Never before had I seen such clear blue water or won money on a blackjack table. I had never held a live sea urchin, or let a sea spider crawl over my hand before diving down to view gorgeous 50ft coral reefs. All of these were very memorable first-time experiences that I hope to repeat again and again as I anticipate future trips to the Caribbean and this gorgeous island. Of course during my stay food was a big question mark for me. There is little grown on the island in terms of produce, aloe is their main export, but there are a number of quality places to dine.After much research (expected by all from me) I brought a short list of places for lunch and dinner for the 5 day, 4 night stay. Our first meal would be at a seaside spot, Brisas Del Mar, located on the South East end of the island. A long drive from our hotel, The Marriot Surf Club, filled with dark streets, quick turns and a detour, but ultimately arrived at our destination. On first appearance I felt as if I had led us in the wrong direction. A divey looking building with a handful of cars was in front of us, however, upon entering through the gate we discovered a gorgeous patio with plush chairs, tables and lounges all merely feet from the ocean. While we were too late for the sunset, we arrived closer to 8pm, the setting was still wonderfully relaxing, especially on our first night. The food, also was very nice, but did have its troubles. To begin an amuse-bouche was presented to all of us of cranberry soup and a calamari fritter. Word to the wise, cranberry soup doesn't work. It was part cold, part hot, and just overall not very good. On the flip side there were some highlights including a delicious Mahi Mahi special which was perfectly cooked and well seasoned as well as some garlicky baby shrimp and fresh mussels. Looking back the food was good, not great, but it was the setting and kind service that made the experience enjoyable.The next evening we wandered only a short distance from our hotel to a beach side restaurant Moomba Beach and Bar. A gorgeous setting, it is situated right on the beach with perfect views of the sunset as well as some of the peaceful sailboats. The food however is not as good as the view. Every dish fell short, some by a small margin others massive. The only thing keeping us in our seats were the sunset and the convenience of this restaurant to our hotel. Cajun Chicken strips came out and looked like bread crumb strips fried to a deep brown. Fresh Grouper was ruined with a horrendous butter sauce, how can you mess up a butter sauce? The rest of the meal does not warrant listing.Hoping to put our poor meal from night two behind us we set off for Papiamento Restaurant, further inland than we had been going, but worth the trip. The restaurant is set in and around a 175+ year old manor house surrounded by a small jungle of trees and a lit pool it was an enchanting setting. Some of our highlights included very well done baked Escargot, a unique and surprisingly good smoked salmon appetizer with passionfruit, tenderloin topped with a rich mushroom sauce and a well-rounded wine list. The best meal so far, we enjoyed the ambiance, peaceful setting and the cordial service which even offered us a tour of the manor house post-meal.Our last evening in Aruba offered our best dining experience. The Flying Fishbone was the venue, which we had booked reservations at weeks in advance, and it surely lived up to the hype. We had dined on the ocean, on the beach, under a \"jungle\" of sorts, but now we were dining shoes off with the tide coming up feet from our toes. Unique to say the least, it offers a unique ocean to table experience especially as you see fish, crab and eels as you dine on their ocean friends. The Fishbone offers one of the best views of the sunset, is extremely romantic, but also puts a lot of importance on the quality and thought that goes into each dish. A starter of Homemade Pastrami with Pesto was enlightening and delicious as was the Carpaccio of Artichoke with Goat Cheese. I took a chance and ordered Mahi Mahi with Gorgonzola sauce, the special, and was pleasantly surprised when the sauce did not overpower the fish, but rather complimented it nicely. The Sea Bass Provincial was a hearty, rustic dish that still managed to be light on the appetite. Dessert of dark chocolate mousse and a thick slice of apple pie helped end the meal on a sweet note.You may notice every review is for dinner possibly wondering where the breakfast and lunch meals were. Well, breakfast was always at the hotel in our room, trying to be economical. Lunch on the other hand wasn't really worth sharing. Aruba may have some great dining destinations, but lunch is a little more limited. Tony Roma's, Wendy's, Pizza Hut and a variety of mediocre beach bars and grills are the most obvious and abundant lunch options. Grouper sandwich at one may be a Grouper Sandwich with grilled vegetables at another, both equally disappointing. That's not to say good lunch can't be found, it just is not going to be on the beach or that cheap.

Restaurant Review: Peter Lugers

Always Eating
***DATE

***CONTENT
So I begin this review with a pledge, a pledge to myself to cut back on the red meat for the next few weeks. After Lugers (which was actually two weeks ago) and the Big Apple BBQ Festival this past weekend I think I need to opt for vegetables and fish for a handful of meals. Would I change a thing about how I've been eating the past few weeks? Most certainly not. With that said, let's get into the details of Lugers based on my first ever trip to the famed steakhouse.It has been a goal of mine to get to Luger's for quite sometime, but due to a variety of reasons (reservations, cost, appetite, etc.) it took sometime and nimble planing. Fortunately I was able to arrange a meal there with some family which made the experience all the more appealing. For many, Luger's is an institution, not just a steakhouse. They are the inspiration, even the blueprint, for many steakhouses in Manhattan and beyond. Some love it, some don't. There are great debates about whether it is the best steakhouse in the city and even the country. While I cannot make a claim that it is the best steakhouse in the country at this point I can safely say it is the best steakhouse in the metro area.Beginning with the restaurant itself, it is a very old building with great personality and history. You just know thousands of people have leaned on the bar at the entrance and an equal amount of steaks have been hustled through the restaurant by the wait staff. (On the topic of wait staff, I personally found them very helpful and cheerful, whereas some people have found them gruff and rude. My only recommendation is steer clear of the fish and try not to take anything personal, they have likely been doing this for decades). To get a table at Luger's is not as difficult as I believed it to be. You call, you say when you want to come and what time, they tell you what's available and you hang up content and licking your lips. Problem is your 6:45 table may not actually be ready until 7:30. What I did not know is that your reservation merely puts you on a check-in list. Once on this list you wait to be called. Whether you like it or not, this is the process. One point I want to make here, many get frustrated by this, but Luger's is such a popular place with so many covers a night that there are bound to be delays. You just need to be understanding.Moving on to the most important aspect of Lugers: the food. If you have been there before, or looked at the menu beforehand, there is no need to get a menu (you may not even be brought one unless you ask). Just order up and the waiters will answer the questions you have. Most important question of the night: \"How would you like your steak cooked?\" Easily the single most important thing of the night, if you mess this up you could potentially be ruining a $160+ piece of meat (see porterhouse for 4). My choice is medium-rare, leaning a little towards medium just to keep it from being overly chewy. Of course with a table of 4 we did just that, ordered the Porterhouse for 4 cooked medium-rare. Now what you choose to accompany your steak is equally important as the steak itself. A bad side can bring down your mood and put too much emphasis on the meat. My recommendation (and Lugers') order up the amazing Creamed Spinach, German Potatoes and to start, maybe a Shrimp Cocktail and a Tomato and Onion Salad. It is a lot of food, but if you come hungry you should be okay; we were.The appetizers, were quite good, but very simple. The tomatoes and onions went great with the sweet and tangy Luger sauce. While I'm not a huge shrimp fan I could appreciate the size of the shrimp, easily twice the size of a typical shrimp cocktail. Bread arrives in three varieties, onion rolls which were very good and worth saving for later, as well as bread stick like rolls and another plain roll.The main course, or show in my opinion, is the presentation of the steak. It fits perfectly in the middle of our table and sizzles quite loudly. The steak is pre-sliced with a gorgeous thick char all around complimented by a juicy pink center. The smell of beef and butter (the plate is doused with melted butter prior to putting the steak on it) permeates the air, and neighboring tables take a few jealous ganders. A few slices of beef are served to each diner and then it's time to dig in. Take it slow, there is plenty of steak. Each bite is worth savoring with the first and last being the best (the last gets dipped in all of the remaining juices). The steak is similar to other steaks I've had, but the crust is what sets it apart. Not burnt, but slightly crunchy it provides a great textural element and that grilled/charred flavor I really enjoy.The steak was perfectly complimented by intensely creamy creamed spinach, I mean that in a good way, and the potatoes which were finished off in the oven to get little crispy bits all around. We also spontaneously ordered some Onion Rings which were unnecessary and overly soggy.Of course each and every inch of steak was canvased for more meat until we all finally threw in the towel. For most the indulgence would end here, but I suggest you push on just as we did and order up some of their delicious desserts. We all shared a Chocolate Mousse and Key Lime Pie served with a overflowing bowl of Schalg (homemade German whip cream). The mousse was rich, creamy and very nice after a heavy meal while the pie was good, but not great. In all honesty it was the Schlag that really elevated both desserts, this is certainly not Cool Whip.Overall a fantastic, food filled evening. Minor things such as poor onion rings, a little more salt on the steak and perhaps lower prices were not major factors. Was it a perfect steak? No, it was not. Was it close? Very much so. However, as I said before the sides are just as important as the steak and it is for that reason which Luger's is now my favorite steakhouse.178 Broadway, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 387-7400, Reservations - Required, Price - Expensive ($70 - 90/person and cash only)

Big Apple BBQ: An Afternoon to Remember

***CONTENT
My excitement has been building for months and it finally came to it's peak today as I emerged from the subway and walked over to Madison Avenue swept away by the sights and smells of the 6th annual Big Apple BBQ. I was a newbie here at the BBQ, unfortunately I had been unable to attend the past two years, but I was well prepared. Armed with a fastpass, mandatory by the way in my opinion, and a small group of hungry friends we plotted our course. There were a handful of must eat places on my list, Mike Mills 17th Street Bar and Grill, Mr. Cecil's California Ribs, Big Bob Gibson's Bar-B-Q, Ed Mitchell's \"The Pit\" and Blue Smoke for desserts.Seeing as how it was on the early side, slightly before 12:30, we opted to get some of the \"big ticket\" items out of the way. 17th Street Bar and Grill are renowned for their baby back ribs and today they were serving Baby Back Ribs and Beans. This would be the longest line of the day for me, I was lucky, and it was well worth it. The ribs were tender, smoky and perfectly moist. However, it was the beans which really sold me. An assortment of pinto, elephant and red beans in a smoky sweet base with shreds of pork, absolutely fantastic.Trying to kill two birds with one stone I quickly hopped over to Cecil's to see what this Californian pit master had to offer; it was their first time at the festival. At first glance the food looked delicious, clearly not a typical BBQ plate of food: an enormous glistening beef rib with an asian glaze and sesame seeds, a beef and pork cajun sausage and a peppery vinegary salad of onions tomatoes and cucumbers. The food looked great, but the taste was another thing. The glaze on the ribs was quite nice, but the rib was not very moist. The salad, again looked great, but was overpowered by black pepper. The saving grace was the sausage, meaty, spicy with a great bite from the casing, it was delicious and one of the more memorable bites of the day.Of course on any other day I would be slowing down now, but my appetite was in full swing so after a quick stroll we made our way over to 26th street with the goal of ultimately ending up at \"The Pit\". First stop on 26th Street, the venerable Big Bob Gibson's of the famed Chris Lilly. My day could have ended here and I would have been pleased. The Pulled Pork Shoulder served up here was everything I could have wanted, moist, tender and when topped with their award winning sauce brought to an all new level. Unfortunately, they were sold out of the sauce as of Saturday afternoon, but that is what the internet is for. The sandwich was served with coleslaw instead of the advertised beans, but it was all about the sandwich.Moving along 26th Street we took a stop at the newly invited Wilson's Pit Barbeque to try some of their Texas Style Brisket and Slaw. I had been craving some brisket for, but this really missed the mark. I was happy to see another state represented at the festival, but the brisket was dry, tough and lacking flavor. While I did manage to finish the serving I would attribute that to the sauce which at least made the beef satisfactory. Even the slaw was bland and left me wishing I had spent my money elsewhere, but oh well no regrets.Fortunately, Ed Mitchell's \"The Pit\" was close by along with his eight smokers filled with whole hogs and whole pig skin, or cracklin's. Surprisingly the line was rather tame perhaps due to the location, it was on the outskirts of the festival, or the unfamiliarity to many BBQ goers. The pork was wildly chopped by the pitmasters and served on a standard bun. The textures were quite different than the pulled pork from earlier in the afternoon, especially when topped with some of the craklin's. I was impressed with the sandwich overall, it had a very deep flavor with a strong vinegar base and a long lasting heat. A creamy simple slaw mellowed out the heat very nicely.At this point the afternoon sun combined with the amazing amount of meat we had eaten started to take it's toll. Some peaceful bench sitting combined with a bit of wandering through the park provided a bit of relief and of course led to a trip to one of the vendor's as we slowly approached the end of our fastpass. Wildwood BBQ's dessert stand caught our eye with their S'mores and at only $2 each it was a worthy purchase. There was a pleasant hint of peanut on top of the S'more which I really appreciated.Continuing with the dessert theme we rounded out the day with a stop at Blue Smoke's dessert setup. Serving Root Beer Float's, Chocolate Brownie's and the very popular Peanut Butter & Jelly Cupcakes even the fastpass line was unexpectedly long. The cupcake was delicious, a creamy peanut butter topping with a soft crumbly cupcake stuffed with a small dab of jelly, it was extremely addictive. The float was light enough to keep me from going over the edge and it was remarkably refreshing after a day of heavy eating and 90 degree humid weather.The day was filled with plenty of food, music, a variety of drinks and of course throngs of people and I can't wait to do it again next year.A variety of photos from throughout the day can be seen below in this order: the lawn full of BBQ lovers, whole hog being flipped at \"The Pit\", pork being pulled at Ubon's, Mint Julips at Eleven Madison Park, live music at Eleven Madison Park and the fully used fastpass). Enjoy!

You are very right Jane. I am still full! It was an amazing day and we managed to stay cool enough in the shade. I also think we made a good choice in going early, helped avoid the lines and also some of the more intense heat.

Solid review overall dude. Definitely agree that Big Bob Gibson's was everything we could want from pulled pork. Disagree with Ed Mitchell, however, didn't impress me at all. I missed out on the PBJ Cupcakes, really wanted one but they ran out. Solid review as usual.NYCFoodGuy.com

It's true, somewhat. As reported by the NY Daily News, Danny Meyer plans to have a Shake Shack truck in downtown Brooklyn near the Metro Tech center. This could go into place by the end of the summer with the truck rotating at other spots on weekends. Good news for all those craving a Shake Burger out in Brooklyn and beyond, bad news for other burger chains.

Restaurant Review: Soba Totto

***CONTENT
Soba noodles have made quite an impression on New Yorkers the past few years as many new noodle shops have been popping up. One that opened up late last year, Soba Totto, is not completely new to the New York dining scene as the sister restaurant, Yakitori Totto, has been around for a few years and is very highly regarded. I've always been a fan of the wonderful food at Yakitori Totto and find it unique, inexpensive and always delicious so I was very interested in trying out the new restaurant. Soba Totto is located on the other side of town on East 43rd street in a relatively unmarked building. Entering the restaurant I immediately was impressed with the space. It seemed much more polished and refined than Yakitori Totto and it also offers more seating. There is a soothing quality to the space, but the smoke off the grill quickly reminds you where you are and what you are here to doMuch of the menu at Soba Totto is borrowed from Yakitori Totto, the meat skewers, some of the salads and appetizers, but all of the noodle dishes are new and exciting. Hearing that the cold soba was the way to go we ordered up Goma Dare Soba, or cold soba with sesame broth. We were presented with a tray of soba noodles, a peanut/sesame sauce, scallions and cucumbers as well as a warm buckwheat broth. The noodles were tender, but with a nice bite and I really enjoyed assembling each bite myself with all of the ingredients. It reminded me of cold noodles and sesame sauce from a Chinese restaurant, but in a much more refined and less saucy way. Accompanying this we also ordered two more dishes, a simple and delicious Tuna Sashimi as well as a deep fried buckwheat ball in a vegetable and soy based broth. Although the buckwheat was too gummy and lacked much flavor the broth was stellar .To help round out the meal we ordered a few skewers, chicken oyster, chicken meatball with egg and the special asparagus wrapped in bacon. The chicken oyster was moist and tender and provided me with a new chicken texture I had never experienced before. The chicken meatball, a favorite of mine at Yakitori Totto, came with a raw quail egg and when dipped in the egg the skewer reached a new heights and a much welcomed richness.Rounding out the meal we were offered complimentary cup of tea which was a great palate cleanser and ended the meal on a high note. Service was, not surprisingly, very good and well-paced and the total bill was extremely reasonable (note they have a $20 minimum per person ). I expect to dine again at Soba Totto and am thrilled that they now have another outpost in the city making it even easier for me to get to. 211 E 43rd St #1F, New York 10017, 212-557-8200, Recommendation - Not Necessary, Price - Inexpensive-Moderate ($20-35/person)

Restaurant Review: Terroir

Recently I dined at Terroir, the new East Village Italian wine bar opened by Marco Canora the chef/owner of neighbor Hearth, and I definitely plan on returning. There were hits and misses throughout the night, but the overall experience provided me with some great tasting Italian small plates, good conversation and great wine.The space is tiny, but not stuffy or overly cramped. A short bar sits on the left of the restaurant while a handful of tables can be found on the right. I personally enjoy sitting at the bar as I believe it offers you more interaction with the servers/bartenders as well as a better view of everything going on. Here you can view the tiny kitchen off to the corner where a panini press, prep station, deep fryer and salamander reside. The menus may hurt the eyes of some with the many fonts, colors and visuals, and although they were occasionally difficult to read I enjoyed the whimsical creative style.Ordering up a few dishes we started with the beet risotto balls and lamb sausage wrapped in sage leaves and fried. These two dishes were possibly my favorite and left me wanting more the rest of the evening. The risotto balls were crispy, but not overly breaded and the gorgeous beet color erupted from within as soon as you took a bite (or fork as they are steaming hot). To round out the flavor a small chunk of gorgonzola cheese emerges from the center as well. The meaty lamb sausage was gorgeous in it's medium rare presentation and it managed to taste even better than it looked. The thin crispy layer of breading and sage merges with the perfectly cooked lamb and is extremely addictive. Both dishes are $7 and are fine to share, though if you are a party larger than two you may be yearning for more.At this point I had ordered and consumed a delicious red wine called Monastrell, M 2 (Salvador Poveda) from 2006. It was highly recommended by the bartender and was smooth, mild with a slight bite. Very much like a Pinot Noir in my opinion with a little more finish to it. It was also hard to complain as at $8 a glass for very generous pours one can get comfortable here for the night.Of course still hungry we ordered up a few more dishes to share starting with the duck ham panini with hen of the woods mushrooms and tallegio cheese. A great looking sandwich it lacked the cheesiness I was looking for and the there could have been a bit more filling. Regardless, the duck ham was nice and tender and was complimented by a prominent, but not overbearing smokiness. To round out the meal little bar snacks of rapnini with garlic and chili's and marinated cremini mushrooms were ordered. Neither of these were really stand outs and I would likely pass on the \"bar snacks\" section next time opting for something different.Although the food was not consistent across the board there is definite potential here. Whether looking for a spot to grab a full meal or simply any one of the fantastic wines Terroir is an affordable, friendly option.413 East 12th Street, New York NY 10009, No phone, Reservations - not accepted, Price - Moderate ($25-$35/person)

An always popular \"activity\" of mine is skipping dinner and simply eating at the bar. There are some wonderful bar treats out there ranging from the sublime pork belly steamed buns at Momofuku Ssam or Rusty Knot's chicken liver sandwich, to the simple yet addictive grilled flatbread at Beast in Brooklyn. These are of course examples of successful bar food options, but there are most definitely plenty of bars serving unremarkable fare throughout the city. I'm sure we've all been subjected to the many tasteless sliders, stale nachos and dips that are likely scooped out of a carton. However, there are many lo-brow, or more approachable foods out there that I cannot turn down.Overlook Lounge's Chicken Sliders - A few bites is all it takes to put away these extremely addictive mini chicken sandwiches. Topped with melted mozzarella, roasted red peppers and a chipotle mayo, these are the perfect compliment to your drinks.Soda Bar's Onion Rings - Huge onion rings with enough batter to give you that crispiness without overpowering the onion.Flatbush Farm/Barn's French Dip - I find it very difficult to find a good French Dip in NYC for some reason, but I fortunately found an amazing one only blocks from my apartment. The meat is wonderfully tender and topped with a great horseradish cream sauce.Crocodile Lounge's Free Pizza - Definitely not the best pizza, but the fact that it is free with any drink purchase makes it good in my book.Cheese Fries from any of the following: Scuffy Duffy's, Bar 515, Emerald Pub, Blackstone's Pub, Gin Lane and moreBurgers from Corner Bistro (technically a bar when it opened), Coppersmith's, Soda Bar, Beast, and the Stoned Crow (remember I'm only talking bars)Wogies Cheesesteaks - A great food to match with a beer.Other places of notable mention are: Ear Inn, Lighthouse Tavern, 12th Street Bar and Grill, Puck Fair, and Spitzer's Corner to name a few. Of course all tapas spots are technically bars as well, but I've exluded them from this conversation thinking they may have an unfair advantage due to the amount of different food they serve compared to the standard bar. Bar dining gets a bad wrap because when you find one the great spot offering quality food, you may have five spots serving terrible food and watered down beer. Any thoughts, comments, suggestions let me know. Always looking for some new bar food.

How about wings? As long as we're talking Scruffy Duffy's we have to mention the fact that 1) they're out of business, crazy I know and 2) they used to have to best wings in the city.Landsdowne Road on 10th and 45th has the same owners but I haven't verfied if they have the same delicious wings.George Keely's on the Upper West Side has awesome bar food, some of the best I've ever had. Definitely better than Blondie's. McAleey's on the Upper West Side also has good grub. Here's a review on Keely's Burger and their monstrous appetizer sampler that's just outta control. Great wings at Keely's too. They also make some outta control cheese fries.

I honestly haven't found amazing wings in nyc at bars. I liked virgils wings, and I guess blondies is a bar and their wings are pretty good. Overall though I find the best wings at grills or restaurants, not bars.I did not know Scruffy Duffy's is closed! I haven't been in midtown for a bit. Interesting.

The Ninth Avenue Food Festival is coming up this weekend and many New Yorkers and tourists will have the opportunity to enjoy a wide assortment of street treats and more. I made my way to the festival last year and sampled such things as lamb kebabs, deep fried oreos, arepa sandwiches, empanada's with assorted fillings and much more. This steet fair is no standard NYC weekend festival. Here you will find a variety of vendors from the area, including many 9th Avenue restaurants offering their treats for very reasonable prices. Assuming the weather is good (and it is questionable at this time) I highly recommend it. The street fair runs on Saturday and Sunday from 37th - 57th street and will be open from 9:30am - 6:30pm. Further information here.

Restaurant Review: Bar Carrera

***CONTENT
In the mood for a casual and inexpensive meal within walking distance of Union Square Bar Carrera was on a short list of spots to check out. I love tapas, ever since my days in Barcelona I have always enjoyed the Spanish flavors and the small plates style of eating, so Bar Carrera was an easy choice (not to mention my date loves tapas as well). Walking down 2nd Avenue it is hard not to walk straight by Bar Carrera as the only signage is the menu taped to the frosted glass windows. For future reference it is right next to Bar Veloce, and owned by the same people.Walking into Bar Carrera it certainly does not feel like a tapas bar in Spain, but don't let that disturb you. You will find many Spanish staples as well as interesting twists on the menu here, and everything is small and cheap. The space is quite modern and the adjoining dining room seems a bit out of place and secondary. We chose to eat at the bar, right in front of the \"kitchen\", also known as a hot plate, fryer, toaster, microwave and small counter - it was one of the smaller kitchens I have seen. We ordered up a handful of dishes for round 1: patatas bravas, garlic shrimp, an a serrano, almond cream and raisin vinagrette topped toast. Of all the dishes the open faced serrano sandwich was the best. The interesting and unique tastes worked very well together, but kept the dish very simple. Our second round of tapas included lackluster meatballs and mini chorizo with honey mustard. Neither dish was particularly good and the meatballs were just confusing as they were topped on spaghetti like ribbons of cucumber (and cucumber does not taste good hot). A dissappointing showing overall after much anticipation from other reviews.We had also ordered a pitcher of sangria to start us off, and again found it subpar. Bar Carrera offers three types of Sangria, and we were recommended the white, also known as the cucumber sangria. Personally, I like sangria. It can be very refreshing and surprisingly strong. However, after the first sip this sangria was no longer refreshing and offered little in the alcohol department. Fortunately it was only $15 and we were able to squeeze 5 glasses out of it.All in all it was not a very memorable meal, and definitely not a spot where I would choose to get Tapas. I can see the benefits of Bar Carrera though as it offers very inexpensive tapas dishes and drinks making it a good spot to meet up, just not to have a meal. 175 Second Ave., New York, NY 10003, 212-375-1555, Reservations - Not Accepted/Necessary, Price - Inexpensive/Moderate ($15 - $25/person)

Restaurant Review: Momofuku Ssam Bar

***DATE
2008-05-12 14:49:00
***CONTENT
After a highly enjoyable trip to Momofuku Ko a few weeks ago I felt it only appropriate to dine at David Chang's other extremely popular, but more affordable, Ssam Bar. The menu changes frequently and there is a strong emphasis on local purveyors and seasonal ingredients, not to mention constantly being raved about by food critics and bloggers. Well unexpectedly I found myself in the East Village on a rainy Spring Friday and felt obligated to stop into Ssam. Generally I plan where I will eat, especially if it is a place where I have wanted to dine for quite some time, but not this time. Fortunately for me it was early, around 7:30, and raining so the crowds were not too big and I was sitting at the bar within 5 minutes. At first glance it was a busy scene, many people drinking, eating and laughing, but to our surprise there were at least 12 servers. Odd considering there were no more than 50 people in the restaurant. All of the servers seemed to be friends of Chang, and if they weren't they could have been. Hanging out, some in street clothes others all in black, it was an eclectic and fun group who were happy to serve us. There was one thing I needed to order here and that was the steamed buns. I had heard so much of these little morsels of pork belly, but up until recently had never been one to enjoy any pork products. My tastes have shifted over the years, I actually grew up kosher and never laid a finger on pork, and there are certain cuts and preparations which I enjoy. David Chang's pedigree in the world of pork is no secret, so what better place than Ssam, Ko or Noodle Bar to expand my pork knowledge.The steamed buns, filled with a few thick slices of tender pork belly, scallions, thinly sliced cucumber and a generous dab of hoisin were amazing. The soft bun held up nicely to the very strongly flavored fillings, I could easily see myself eating a handful of these without a problem. I may not be much of a pork eater, but these are quite addictive, and at 2 for $10 not terribly expensive. Our second plate of food showcased a huge portion of hanger steak cooked medium-rare accompanied by a ginger scallion dressing, kimchi, bibb lettuce and a bowl of white rice. A nice sized portion which I shared with my date, but there was one major flaw with the dish. It was impossible to chew the meat once it was in the lettuce wraps. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy my steak cooked medium-rare, but when chewing steak in a sandwich or wrap it is better when cooked medium. Now this is something which I'm sure has not always been an issue, but every bite I took the same thing occurred. Personally I believe this is something which the kitchen should have taken into account prior to serving the dish. Regardless, the seasoning was wonderful and despite the chewiness of the steak it was a good piece of meat.After a glass of red, the name escapes me, and a Anchor Steam beer we wrapped up our bill to a reasonable $50. With that said dining at Ssam can get expensive as dishes range from under $5 to over $25 for entrees and even more for the Bo Ssam, $200 gets you a whole pork shoulder for at least seven people with a variety of sides and sauces. I will definitely be back if only for the steamed buns, though I'm sure I will aim to try one of the offal dishes as well. An update on the review should be expected in the future. 207 Second Ave., New York, NY 10003, 212-254-3500, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($30-$40/person)

Ryan Sutton of Bloomberg News gives Ko 3 stars (out of 4) and his review is spot on. Great, inventive cuisine, but the service is not that of a 4 star restaurant, but that's not a bad thing in his eyes.On the other hand, Gael Greene seems to have a personal vendetta against David Chang and write more about herself than the food. Personally, one of the more poor reviews I've ever read.The first major review by Adam Platt is also still available, this was a 4-star review (out of 5) and very widely criticized as the critic only dined at Ko once. Still a nice honest review.All of this is in anticipation of Frank Bruni's review in the NYTimes which will be published tomorrow. My guess is 4 stars for the food, but Ko will lose one for ambiance. 3 stars total. I'll post a link for this review as soon as it is available.Update: Bruni gives Ko 3 stars and a very nice, and appropriate in my mind, review.

***CONTENT
So not to completely repeat what many other bloggers and food writers have said, but the reservation process for David Chang's new spot, Momofuku Ko is...well tedious, and that is putting it lightly. Beyond the 9:59am ritual, the overall process has gotten better, but is still quite difficult. Regardless, however many times you need to login for reservations it is worth it, completely worth it...Now before getting to deep into the food review I need to set the scene. Slightly after 6pm on a Wednesday evening the counter at Ko is not even full yet, but there is something in the air. A photographer from the NYTimes present and a full staff of chefs, including David Chang himself, are all present. The stage is set for a grand evening before even settling in on the surprisingly semi-comfortable backless stools. Choosing to match our meal (in case you didn't know it is $85 prix fixe and averages 10-courses) with a beverage pairing was a must and we chose the $50 option, but there were even more options including an $85 and $150 pairing, though I honestly don't believe they would be necessary.The meal begins with what is now becoming the infamous starter of homemade pork rinds and an amazing English muffin with pork fat. Now, it may sound a little bold, but the English muffin is perhaps one of the best bread based things I have ever had the chance to eat. Buttery, salty, just perfection. The following courses (and there were two different ones as Ko does not serve the same course to each diner) consisted of a delicious Fluke with poppy seeds, buttermilk and chives, but an even better Hamachi with pickled grapes and freeze dried soy really started us off on the right foot. Unique flavors and textures and an overall very light dish.The next course consisted of two very different soups. One, a salty, sour kimchi broth with pork belly, cabbage and two generously sized oysters. I loved the broth here, full of flavor, but without being too powerful or salty, but the pork belly and oysters were merely okay. The other soup however was perhaps one of the better soups I've had in my life. An extremely finely pureed spring pea soup with microgreens, perfect crawfish and a rich tofu wrapped package of morrels. The dish was smooth, light, and very fresh with each ingredient working together, but still managing to have distinct flavors on their own. Moving on we were served the egg dishes, one custard with caviar, cashews and asparagus and the other a gorgeous sous vide egg with caviar, pickled sous vide onions and mini-potato chips (this dish has been widely talked about). Both were well crafted and surprisingly good considering I am not much of a fan of eggs, but not particularly memorable in the flavor department. The custard was perhaps my least favorite dish of the evening and one I could have done without.With the beginning of Spring, Chang and Co. developed a homemade lasagna filled with a variety of mushrooms, ramps and asparagus and topped with toasted ricotta salata and crispy broccoli rabe flowers. A gorgeous dish with very finely made homemade pasta, the dish was quite good, simple, but a great way to showcase what's in season. This was one of the few courses which both myself and date received the same thing and we both loved the taste and texture combinations. The following course features a scallop with ham and ramps and skin-on trout with pickled radishes and almonds. The scallop was the stand out here as it was cooked perfectly and worked very well with the salty ham. The trout was good, but not memorable and the bacon puree which it was served atop overpowered the dish.The next course featured the already infamous shaved foie gras over Riesling gelee and lychee nuts. A fantastic amazingly creative dish, the combination of textures and tastes really was a mind trip and one of the better dishes of the evening. I really appreciated the addition of toasted pine nuts as well for that extra textural element. At this point the food began to settle in and my appetite was fading, but with the meat course next I knew we were in the final stretch. Served a delicious, perfectly cooked, braised and then deep fried short rib by David Chang was a memorable experience. Rich and tender the dish was complimented by barely cooked yellow carrots, braised daikon with mustard seeds and grilled scallions. Never before had I been served a short rib that was cooked medium and managed to be as tender as this. The accompanying chicken paillard stuffed with porcini mushrooms was good, but did not match up to the short rib dish. Both of us would have simply preferred two short ribs.Finishing off the evening we entered the dessert courses, the first being a pineapple sorbet with chewy pineapple or a kiwi sorbet with apricot and olive oil. Both were nice and light and great palate cleansers. They prepared us for the final dishes of the evening, cereal milk panacotta with avocado cream and a hazelnut crisp and deep fried apple pie with sour cream ice cream and miso paste. Both dishes were delicious, but to me the cereal milk panacotta was the standout. A rich and creamy dish that really did taste like a bowl of cereal (Chang and co. soak Frosted Flakes in milk and then use the milk to create the panacotta). The dish was wonderful and to my surprise the avocado cream helped balance out the sweetness very well. The pie, while good, did not stand out as much of me, however, it was a nice ode to the infamous McDonald's fast food apple pies.Unfortunately, I cannot recall all of the drinks we were served, but throughout the night we received roughly 9 or 10, or one for every course and at least half of those were different among diners. The drinks varied from a white beer, to warm sake and cava. The service was attentive, but not over the top and everything was presented with great detail and care. I imagine this food in an environment where there are white table clothes and tuxedoed servers and a much higher tab, a la Per Se. However, at Ko you won't find table cloths or soothing classical music, but instead a handful of talented chefs rocking out to Led Zeppelin, The White Stripes or the Beatles as they craft each dish with precision. My final thought after reflecting back on the evening, is that everything was very well thought out, creative and delicious. Even the worst of the dishes was still good (with perhaps the custard being the exception) and the best, well the best were some of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. Now I prompt you to sign on at 9:59am and take your stab at getting a reservation, it is truly a life changing meal and very much worth it.163 1st Ave, New York, N.Y., no phone, Reservations - recommended, Price - Expensive (110/person minimum with tax and gratuity)

Bar Review: The Rusty Knot

***CONTENT
Opened only a few months ago, The Rusty Knot sure has received plenty of press. Sometimes hailed as the next great \"dive\" bar of NYC and a welcome partner to Spotted Pig, the bar has quickly gained a loyal following flocking to the far west of Manhattan. The bar overlooks the Westside Highway, not neccessarily a great sight, but if you can look beyond the speeding cars and asphalt the glimmering Hudson and gorgeous sunset beyond Hoboken is quite a view. Entering the Rusty Knot you may feel a little disoriented. The bar's retro tiled floors and wood paneling sure threw me off a little. It was however a welcome site and the relaxed group of people and jukebox really made the experience all the more fun. The Knot has minimal seating, but depending on what time you go getting a stool is not impossible (just don't expect seats open for the taking come 11pm on a Thursday-Saturday night).Order drinks is quite simple as well - 3 beers on tap, another 3-4 bottled, 2 wines (red and white) and an assortment of mixed drinks and cocktails are available. The bar is small and there are only two bartenders, but they were quite attentive and very entertaining. From .99 cent Busch Draft beers (they're only about 6oz's) to Spice Pina Colada's or the bar's signature drink, a rum based drink called \"The Rusty Knot\" fittingly, there is a small, but diverse selection.Generally in my book a bar does not have to serve food to be good, but if quality food is part of the bar's aura then more power to them (and of course business from me). Well Rusty Knot is not any bar and thus doesn't serve any old bar food. You won't find nachos or burgers here, but rather Beer Puffs, Meatloaf sandwiches, Coca-Cola Ribs and my favorite the Chicken Liver and Bacon Sandwich (which was generously offered to me by a friend). If that doesn't suit you they have a good ol' fashioned pig in a blanket, but it's wrapped in a pretzel, and delicious little Meat Pie's that are the perfect bar food. Overall I'd say the food is good, not amazing, but certainly better and more diverse than the average bar.Rusty Knot's appeal lies in it's approachable, yet somewhat exclusive feel. It could very well mimic the basement of some house in the early '70's or '80's, but the way in which it's brought together (the drinks, the food, the crowd, the music) really sets it apart from other bars in the city. For that I was surprised that our bar tab was not astronomical. Something that really will keep the business pouring in is the fact that beers are $3-6 for a pint, wine's are $4 and mixed drinks range from $7-14 -- certainly not breaking the bank here. The same can be said for the food which of course was a huge surprise. I plan on going back, hopefully to watch the sunset again and ultimately watch the crowds roll in around 10pm.425 West St, New York, NY, (212) 645-5668, Price - Inexpensive (average drink $6, average food $9)

Restaurant Review: Bonnie's Grill

***CONTENT
Tucked into a small narrow storefront on 5th Ave. in Park Slope is Bonnie's Grill. It is easy to pass by and dwarfed by the neighboring Blue Ribbon and Blue Ribbon Sushi, Bonnie's is a Park Slope institution as its been serving big juicy spiced burgers, beef on weck (roast beef on a caraway roll) and wings for almost about a decade. Though some may argue that the quality has recently gone downhill, its still quite popular and a great inexpensive spot to grab a meal or even a drink (they have a handful of beers on tap and an extensive list of bottled beers). My meal at Bonnie's was spurred by a burger craving as a result of watching the Food Network and some burger history. My go to's for burgers are usually Beast, Soda or even Flatbush Farm, but I wanted something new today. Bonnie's was the destination.The decor is perfect for the food, and offers a bit of an unpretentious neighborhood escape. The service, quick, friendly, appropriate. The food, well that's what I was here for. A nice juicy Spiced Angus Burger topped with lettuce, tomato, cheddar and pickles and cooked to a nice medium. The burger arrived with a nice heaping of shoestring fries (salad, soup or chili is available as an alternative), which were quite good when dipped in the homemade spicy mayo (bottles are on every table). The burger itself was crispy and charred on the outside but a nice pink on the inside. I liked this burger, it reminded me of Summer. The crust was a result of a spice rub it seems which was not overly spicy, but had a nice smoky kick. It's hard to find a burger where they get a nice crust on the outside but Bonnie's delivered. The flavor was good, not amazing and it could have used some more salt, but still good. At first the Kaiser roll it was served on was impeding my eating, but gradually the roll soaks up the burger juices and it becomes more manageable.A good option for an inexpensive meal ($9.95 for the burger and fries) with a pint or two, though it's not the best burger in the slope in my opinion. 278 Fifth Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11215, 718-369-9527, Reservation - not accepted/needed, Price - Inexpensive ($10-20/person)

Pecorino Romano is a great cheese, but the importers of it feel slighted and deserving of the same attention received by the always popular parmigiano reggiano. As a result, they are staging a huge marketing blitz on the city by working with a handful of restaurants to offer diners a free tasting of the cheese. A variety of pasta dishes will be paired with the cheese and are free of charge. Note that the times are a little odd, I sure don't want cheesy pasta at 10am, but there are a variety of quality restaurants on the list.Free Cheese!Update:While I was out of town this weekend, a colleague of mine \"attempted\" to take advantage of this pecorino romano weekend. Well, two of the restaurants she contacted had no idea what she was talking about. Was this event a sham? An effort by the pecorino romano backers to get publicity? Hard to tell right now, but sounds fishy to me.

So I just scored reservations to Ko next Wednesday at 6:20pm and I couldn't be happier. A slightly early dinner, but who cares. It's taken me this long to land reservations after trying almost everyone weekday morning so beggers can't be choosers. of course there will be a full review after the meal, but for now I just get to anticipate what may be the best meal of the year for me so far (and hopefully more due to all the hype). My only concern was the cost, I'm not investment banker, but fortunately next Wednesday is pay day! This just looks like it's meant to be...

My new BBQ just arrived this weekend, it's a brand new Weber Q 220, and I can't tell you how excited I am to begin grilling again. It's been years since I had a backyard, porch, patio or even any outdoor space and with my relatively new apartment all setup a BBQ was a necessity. Of course with it being in the high 70's the other day what better way to break in the grill with some good ol' fashioned burgers. Two 6-8oz burgers, one smothered with fontina, the other with gruyere and cooked to a great medium. I grilled up some onions tossed in olive oil, salt and pepper as well. The burgers were seasoned with fennel seed, Worcestershire sauce, breadcrumbs, garlic, salt, pepper and a little olive oil and were delicious. With a freezer full of meat I'm thoroughly looking forward to the Spring and Summer in Brooklyn.

Courtesy of the people at NYmag, I just found out that the always popular neighborhood restaurant, The Little Owl, will begin serving lunch starting tomorrow. Always difficult to get into for dinner, the restaurant wanted to make it easier for customers to dine with them (and of course capitalize on their huge success). If you need to make a reservation login into Opentable before those all start getting snatched up, the restaurant will only have 5 tables for reservations open daily, all else are for walk-ins. And rest assured the meatball sliders WILL be served at lunch.

Josh Ozersky, author of \"The Hamburger\", is a very opinionated person when it comes to burgers. As the writer for NYmag's grubstreet and countless other food articles/postings, he has eaten his fare share of burgers. NY Post has his top 10 and bottom 5 listed. You'll notice a trend, Ozersky isn't a fan of gourmet burgers. He likes the simple and classic for the most part. With that said, I'd have to disagree with some of his selections finding that leaving Shake Shack and Burger Joint off (while touristy sometimes) is wrong. In addition, I find Corner Bistro inconsistent, but definitely not worthy of his worst burger in the city award. Other selections of his seem hard to believe as well, but I'll have to check for myself.

Scary thought I know, but it is possible. A recent NY Post article states that new liquor licenses are not being approved for 4am closing time, but rather 2am closings. While this trend is effecting new licenses only, it may become something larger in the future, but it is hard to say given that this is the city that never sleeps. For now, just know that some of the new establishments you are looking to go to may shutdown at 2am, but those old standbys will be open long into the morning as usual.

For the past few days I've been determined to get a reservation at Ko, the impossibly popular new restaurant by David Chang in the East Village, and I fail due to the internet. Yes, I'm blaming the internet. I sit waiting to pounce at 10am exactly, green checks are everywhere and I get excited. I click whichever one I can first (happens to be an 8:10pm for next Wednesday) sorry someone already booked it the screen says. I then proceed to click on 3 more green checks all with the same response! Clearly my internet is not fast enough or I would be reveling in my 8:10pm reservation. Oh well, there is always tomorrow.Momofuku Ko

So surpsisingly I missed the press late last week about the soon to open beer garden, Franklin Park, in Prospect Heights/Crown Heights Brooklyn. The bar will feature 800 sq. ft of indoor space with another 1200 sq. ft outside with picnic tables. A wonderful addition to the neighborhood and a short walk from the hopping Vanderbilt Avenue in Prospect Heights. Further info here, here and here. Seems like Prospect Heights is getting more attention than ever imagined and it doesn't seem to be phasing out. Other notes in the area include:A restaurant seems to be filling the old Sorrel space, Carlton between Prospect Place and St. Marks. Work inside has been going on the past few weeks with new light fixtures and paintClose to the aforementioned Franklin Park two new locations have opened, 95 South a sports baresque spot with BBQ and Abigail's a low-key bar/lounge serving foodPlan B on Vanderbilt is likely opening this weekend. Word from a friend is that the owners said they have the liquor license in hand.As reported in another posting, the country western bar, by the owners of Beast on Vanderbilt, is showing signs of progress. The building which was renovated from top to bottom is looking good and is likely a few months away from offering hush puppies and cheap beer.

Just when it seemed 7th Avenue in Park Slope was dying off, Barrio, a new Mexican restaurant fills the old Tempo Presto space on the corner of 7th Ave and 3rd Street. I'm setting my expectations pretty high for this place as it's owned by Spencer Rothschild who owns part of Calle Ocho, BLT Prime and Django in Manhattan. Expect \"authentic\" Mexican cuisine at reasonable prices. Further detail and pictures at Brownstoner (pictures courtesy of Brownstoner).

The 2nd Annual Cook.Eat.Drink.Live Festival will take its place in NYC again this Fall on Pier 94. From November 7th throught the 9th, New Yorkers will be allowed to sample delicious cuisine, a mutlitude of beverages and witness demo's from some of the cities top chefs. More details to come, including ticket prices (which started off at an absurd price last year). Included is a picture from last years event, a quite memorable one in my opinion.Update: I spoke to someone working on the event and they informed me tickets will be priced at $75 a day (Friday, Saturday or Sunday) with packages available for the full weekend also available. This is a far cry from the $300+ it was to attend when tickets first went on sale last year.

Starting this evening, I'm going to begin to offer a new \"service\" of sorts on the site and through e-mail. I've always been offering up restaurant suggestions to friends, family and acquaintances for dining throughout the city and areas of Brooklyn, well moving forward that advice is open to all. Rather than scouring the blogs, magazines and restaurant directories just send me a quick note with the following criteria filled out:1. What areas of the city are you looking to dine in? (ex. North of 14th, Park Slope or LES, etc.)2. What is your price situation? Is price an object? Do you only have $10 a person? Let me know.3. Is there any food or cuisine you most certainly will not eat? Last thing I want to do is recommend Thai food if you despise that cuisine.4. When will you be dining? Important to know, because you may need reservations, or may not be able to get any depending on the day of your plans.5. Any misc. items that are important. Planning on drinking? Prefer very dark restaurants so you can't see your dining party? Really just want dessert and no meal? Anything that would be unique or important for me to know.Shortly after seeing the requests I will get back to you, though you must understand that there will be limitations. For instance, if you send me a request at 2am I won't get right back to you. Plus, I do work and will be away for business every now and again, but don't let that deter you. Trust me, this will be easier than trying to book a table at Momofuku Ko by far.

Saturday evening I dined at one of my favorite local spots, Flatbush Farm and indulged in the usual artichoke dip among other things. I especially like the Farm's version of artichoke dip because of the generous chunks of artichoke hearts mixed within the creamy, cheesy dip. It was a simple luxury, being able to walk a block or so to order up a bowl of dip and a pint, but I figured why not create this at home. Without referencing a recipe it was clear there were a few main ingredients I needed: artichoke hearts, cream, two kinds of cheese, and a bit of pepper. Beyond that it was a pure guess, and it seemed to work. Some may argue canned artichoke's are not the way to go, but for the sake of time and more importantly money a can will do just fine. Just don't buy marinated artichoke hearts as they are even more vinegary and oily than you would ever want for this dip. Other than that, the cheese is also in the hands of the beholder or cook in this case, I recommend a Gruyere and some cheddar, but a fontina, or parmigiano reggiano would work nicely as well.Artichoke hearts - 1 can, not the marinated kind1/4 cup of cream - less if you like the dip less creamysalt and pepperParsley - teaspoon of dried, small bunch of fresh if available1 cup grated cheese - Gruyere preferably and a couple of tablespoons grated cheddar (yellow for color)Freshly grated nutmeg - teaspoonCumin - dashTablespoon of olive oilOven proof dish1. Preheat oven to 450F2. Cut up artichoke hearts coarsely leaving good sized chunks if preferred3. Put all ingredients into a small bowl and mix with artichokes leaving a small handful of cheese to the side4. Pour artichoke mix into the oven proof dish and top with cheese and another twist of fresh cracked pepper5. Let the dip cook in the oven for about 15 minutes of until cheese is fairly melted and then place in broiler until cheese if slightly browned6. Carefully remove from dish and serve with your choice of bread, flatbread or crackers.Try a variation of cheese if you'd like or even blending the artichoke mixture up if you prefer a creamy dip.

The weekend brought yet another peek into what Spring will be, warm weather, shorts, the sun beating down on you in the greenmarkets. A wonderful feeling, and then of course we were brought back to reality with imposing rain clouds which blotted out the sun all every few hours all weekend. Regardless, Spring is here, it may just be taking sometime to fully settle in. This weekend I experimented with a few new dishes. Lately it's been my goal to recreate dishes I taste in restaurants without searching for a recipe. Not only is it a palate test, but it also tests my familiarity with certain ingredients.First off , I chose to break out one of my favorite kitchen tools, the mandolin, and make an potato au gratin. I got this at Bowery Kitchen Supplies in Chelsea Market, but you can get one on Amazon for a low cost. I would be pairing this with an Asian marinated chicken thighs, wings and legs (soy, honey, Chinese five spice, Siracha, rice vinegar and ponzu) which I cooked under a brick in a cast iron pan for a crisp skin. Considering my protein was Asian influenced I thought back to an au gratin I had at Park Slope restaurant Long Tan, it was an au gratin paired with a Thai seasoned hanger steak. My goal was a creamy inside crusty topped dish that would work with the seasonings of the chicken. I looked to my Chinese five spice, some fresh nutmeg and steered clear of olive oil and butters as much as possible. The result was delicious, and my only recommendation would be to use a shallow pan, mine was almost 2 inches deep. Recipe below (for 2):2 large Russet Potatoes - thinly sliced with a mandolin4 tablespoons of heavy creamgrated cheese - recommend a cheddar or gruyere depending on preferencefreshly grated nutmegChinese five spice powder - generous pinchsaltpepperdash of cuminsmall dab of butter to coat the baking dishsmall baking dishbasting brushmandolin1. Put the oven on 425F to preheat while prepping the dish.2. Put all the ingredients, but the butter, in a small bowl and whisk together, prep the baking dish by coating it with the small dab of butter making sure all sides are coated well, this will help the potatoes from sticking and will give it a little crust.3. Thinly slice the potatoes, length or width wise is up to you, and then begin to layer them in the pan making sure they overlap and ultimately building up the sides as well till you get a flat top.4. Every few layers bast the potatoes with the cream mixture coating generously.5. When complete pour remaining liquid as desired on the potatoes and with a generous sprinkle of cheese.6. Bake for about 30 minutes and finish under the broiler for another 5 depending on the level of desired crispiness. Let sit for a few minutes then cut and serve.

Restaurant Review: The Kitchen Counter @ Beacon

***CONTENT
The Kitchen Counter @ Beacon is a rare type of dining experience. A massive, midtown restaurant catering to the business crowd and tourists, it is hard to imagine having an intimate mutli-course meal with the chef. It's that rarity and experience that brought the idea of The Kitchen Counter (TKC) first into Chef Waldy Malouf's mind. An up close and personal dinner with six guests watching every move of a kitchen dishing out potentially hundreds of covers a night. Launched in the Fall of 2007, TKC offers diners an experience not forgotten at a shocking price. 12-courses, six drink pairings and service that makes you feel special or elite only offered four times a month; meaning only 24 people experience this every month. Now that I've gotten your attention let's discuss the meal. What follows is a detailed description of each course, so if you have time to read continue, if not bookmark this for later in your day.The night begins with a gathering near the front of the restaurant in a \"quiet\" corner. All 6 guests, who may or may not know each other, are served a Smoking Kir Royale, a champagne cocktail with a small drop of dry ice. The dry ice adds a theatrical element to the drink and it also tastes quiet delicious. It is a nice compliment to the first bite of food of the night, Tarragon Lobster Fritters served on a small metal stand. Very lightly fried in a delicious tempura like batter and served with a sherry and soy dipping sauce, the fritters were good, though I found the lobster overly tough. After finishing our small bites we were escorted through the restaurant down into the pit, the area of the restaurant where the kitchen is visible. Awaiting our group was a table for six facing the kitchen. A fresh raw radish placed on a bed of pins was on our plates. We were instructed to dip it into the seasoned butter it was served with, \"just like they do in French bistro's\" exclaimed Chef Malouf.Our menus were at each place setting and they outlined our evening step by step and bite by bite. It was daunting, even to the hungriest of diners (myself), but drool worthy. Our, second course was a beautiful slice of Wild Mushroom Pizza served on a small wooden block. Red onion, parsley and three cheeses rounded out the pizza ingredients. A very nice pizza, not amazing by any means, but a good start. It was complimented by a few shot glasses of Leffe Blond Ale, a Belgian ale I very much enjoy. Shortly after our pizza dishes were cleared a dish of oysters was presented to us. Each diner recieved 2 gorgeous fragrant Roasted Oysters with shallots. This was the first of two times where the Chef warned us that we could burn ourselves, the oysters were served on a bed of coarse salt in a small cast iron pan. Not being a fan of oysters in the past this dish blew me away. The flavors of the shallots, mignonette, and herbs worked perfectly with the oyster which had a wonderful woodsy flavor from the wood-fired oven. I made sure to clean the shells as best as possible and of course chase the dish with another shot of the Leffe.Moving onto our now fourth course, our server began by pouring us all a glass of Grenache Blanc, a crisp and slightly fruity white from Spain. This wine would go perfectly with our enormous Seared Scallop rubbed with chipotle and placed on a fava bean puree with pea shoots. Possibly the largest scallop I've ever eaten, I made sure to enjoy every bite and went so far as to cut the scallop into six succulent bites. The chipotle did not overpower the scallop as I initially feared, but added a very appropriate depth and was balanced well with the fava bean puree, which though good was a little on the salty side. With four small courses down, the food began to add up a little, if only to warn you of what was to come.Emerging from the oven was a smoker accompanied by a very pungent applewood smell. This was likely to be our next course, Hot Smoked Wild Bass in Corn Husks. An application that the Chef had used prior, but with different fish and tastes, I had heard good things about this dish. If a dish was merely judged on it's fragrant aromas this dish would be getting 5-stars. Taste wise the dish was very good, not groundbreaking, but the lemon, fennel and applewood worked well with the wild bass without completely overpowering it. Our Granache Blanc was still being served with this course and helped cut through the heavy smokiness of the fish. At this point I find it important to note, Chef Malouf not only presented us with the dish, but cut the corn husks, described the smoking process and even went to far as to discuss how the fish had previously been smoked (in the wood-fired oven) and that this was the first time they were using the stainless steel smoker for this course. He then happily poured an aromatic broth over the top of the fishFinally at the mid-point of the evening, we were presented with our sixth course, a small bed of Tagliatelle with Morels, Peas and Cream, this was my least favorite dish of the evening. Excited about this very Spring dish, I was disappointed that the wonderful morel taste was hidden behind the creamy watery sauce. This was the first time they had served this dish on the menu, and considering it was the only dish not finished by many diners, I hope they opt to remove it. Poured with this dish was a Toad Hall Pinot Noir, a light, somewhat fruity wine, but a little on the bland side in my opinion.Referencing back to the menu I found we were finally upon the meat and poultry section of the menu. Squab with Rhbuarb, Lentils and Baby Carrots was a beautiful dish. Cooked medium rare, the squab rested on roasted rhubarb and delicious baby carrots while a balsamic reduction was poured on top. A small drumstick and wing were also included and had been cooked to a necessary well done. An overall successful dish, I was disappointed with the lack of lentils (I only had 6-8 baby lentils) and found the drumstick and wing too tough and having more visual appeal than taste appeal. At this point we were notified that intermission had begun, a five minute period to gather your thoughts, smoke a cigarette or simply take a walk around the restaurant before diving into the homestretch, and the most indulgent of the courses.Getting back from the short break I was filled with anticipation for our next course, Bone Marrow with Horseradish and Garlic Toast. In my opinion, one of the more indulgent and delicious things available, bone marrow is not necessarily loved by all. The mere concept of bone marrow may be unappealing, but once you look beyond the large six inch split bone in front of you and actually dig in you will be a believer. Rich, beefy, salty, the dish was excellent. The Chef grated some superbly fresh horseradish on top adding a little kick that rounded out the dish. It was also served with two pieces of garlic toast per person as a serving vessel and for texture. Our wine pairing was a 2001 Barolo from Cascina Adelaide, bold yet smooth with a nice cherry undertone. I could have stopped here and been content with my meal. Not full, but comfortable. The meal had been very good with only a few low's. Of course this was only course number seven, so not only do you have to prepare to keep going physically, but also mentally. This was dangerous and delicious territory.Short ribs are perhaps one of my favorite foods. It was brought to my attention recently, that if short ribs are on the menu I generally gravitate to them and will order them in some shape or form. Well, fitting that TKC's 9th course was BBQ Braised Short Ribs with Foie Gras and Grits. From the description it is clearly going to be a heavy, course to say the least. A tender short rib topped with a slab of foie gras (in my case two as my dining companion did not want hers) on top of creamy grits all smothered (in a good way) in a bbq sauce made from the braising liquid. Considering my love of short ribs I may have set the bar too high for this course. It was good, very good to be exact, but not amazing, and I almost could have done without it in order to save room for the following courses, however, I did savor it and clean my plate. At this point we had actually finished the Barolo and demanded something more to drink, in a peaceful friendly way, and our server quickly obliged. Running to the main bar he grabbed another bottle of wine and proceeded to pour everyone a generous glass. Unfortunately the name escapes me, but it was an earthy red, heavier than the barolo and of course being complimentary made it even more enjoyable.So far the entire meal there had been some level of awe or wow factor incorporated into the plating or presentation of our dishes. The Smoking Kir Royale, the delicate dismantling of the corn husks for the wild bass, well the ante was upped on this next dish. Kobe Beef on a Hot Stone, not only resulted in a group sigh, but also perked everyone up from their inevitable food coma's. Traditionally a Japanese method of cooking kobe beef, mind you this was real kobe from Japan, a stone is heated thoroughly and then the beef is placed on it to sizzle and cook. It was suggested that we let the meat sear and then eat it while still very rare, all the while being careful not to burn ourselves (this was the second time in the meal we were warned about previously). The beef had been laid out on a brick of Himilayan rock salt and sprinkled with fresh pepper. You could see the fat melting on the stone as the beef cooked and then upon eating it the piece melted in your mouth. Luxurious, beefy, salty, it was everything good about beef and then some. Fortunately, everyone is served two slices and I was allowed to repeat the process this time cooking the beef to an even more rare state. The dish was accompanied by a small jicama salad with hot mustard which I steered clear of so the beef taste could linger longer.At this point I was full, the food had been very good, the wine excellent and the whole experience memorable. However, we still had two courses left, two dessert courses. To get us started we were served, in gorgeous thick chilled glass bowls, Quark Sorbet with Roasted Strawberries and Mint. An interesting dish and more of a palate cleanser than anything, it was good, but not memorable. The idea of roasted strawberries was intriguing, but ultimately it just resulted in a mushy strawberry core. Our last course however ended on a high note. A Chocolate Souffle with Smoked Vanilla Ice Cream not only was visually stunning, but was a wonderful last bite of the evening. The souffle itself towered over it's ramekin and was cut open for a chocolate sauce of some kind to be poured in. It looked delicious, but it was the smoked vanilla ice cream that was the star. Chef Malouf roasts vanilla beans in his wood-fired oven and then infuses ice cream with the vanilla finishing the scoop off with a sprinkle of smoked vanilla powder. This was the best part of the dessert and I could have eaten this without the addition of the overly soggy souffle. All of the dessert was paired with a very nice and light Muscat from Torbeck in Australia. It was a sweet, but not overpowering and went down very smooth and light.Looking back on the evening it was enough food for two people to finish easily, but with smart planning, i.e. a light breakfast and lunch prior, a single person can finish all 12-courses without major stomach problems. It is an opportunity for indulgence. A celebration of high-end ingredients and how they make us feel. Interaction with a well-run kitchen by a celebrated chef does not come easily, here it is a show for the diner. Sit back relax and enjoy, your movie screen is a kitchen, your popcorn and sodas replaced by sizzling slices of kobe beef and earthy barolo's. Two to three hours of entertainment, that while costing more than a night at the movies ($109/person all-inclusive), it certainly is more entertaining.The Kitchen Counter Menu and Small Plates Menu:Beacon offers The Kitchen Counter on Thursdays only at 7pm and has a dedicated reservation line, 212.332.0508 (different than the main number). Chef Malouf does offer a small plates menu during normal hours and seating at the counter, but you should not expect the same experience. Moving forward if you do want to dine at TKC on a different day than Thursday it is possible if you reserve all six seats per Chef Malouf.25 W 56th St, New York, NY 10019, 212.332.0508, Reservations - Required, Price - Expensive ($109/person including tax, tip and drinks)

Something I've vowed to do since the beginning of this blog is finally around the corner. After years of compiling recipes and corresponding pictures I will begin posting recipes this weekend. Ranging from the indulgent Smoked Mozzarella Baked Penne, to the more heart healthy Baked Flounder with Golden Beets. Any feedback, or suggestions on the recipes is always appreciated and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.

Watching the clock right now in eager anticipation of my dinner at the Kitchen Counter @ Beacon. Tonight my months of waiting finally come to fruition. I prepared myself by saving some cash every month and also avoiding a large lunch today. My only concern is setting the bar too high, but I will do my best to go into the meal with a completely open and clear mind. This will be easier considering the new Spring menu kicks off tonight so none of the dishes have been reported or blogged about previously. I may also break one of my rules of photography at a restaurant tonight. I generally find it somewhat rude and mood breaking, but tonight it may be necessary. With so few photographs of the food, and an opportunity to share a new menu with everyone I almost feel obligated to. Certainly there will be a lengthy and thorough review, I mean how could a 12-course meal with 6-course drink pairing not be deserving of a detailed, long review? Exactly.Update: I was unable to take pictures during dinner, not that there was a rule at the restaurant, but it just felt so unnecessary and rude. I can describe the dishes in detail and image are also available from others diners experiences late last year: http://forums.egullet.org/index.php?showtopic=109409

We all know Murray's Cheeseshop for their delectable assortment of cheeses from around the world. Some may even know of their extensive fresh pasta and characuterie, but there is more. Murray's offers absolutely delicious sandwiches. Made with cheese from in-store, bread from Amy's or Grandaisy's and an including such fillings as housemade meatloaf, Niman Ranch pastrami, and paperthin prosciutto these sandwiches are a great lunch option. Priced between $6.95 and $7.95 you won't find a much better deal in the area for something of this caliber. As I'm writing this I'm enjoying a very good sized meatloaf sandwich with fresh mozzarella. Trust me you won't settle for a plain old turkey sandwich ever again.

This weekend brought some delicious eats due in part to the Green Market at Grand Army Plaza. Saturday morning as the temperature continued to rise into the 50's, I took a stroll to Grand Army Plaza. Twice as many vendors as last week, a good sign of things to come. Strolling along the line for fish was as long as ever, and the always popular Turkey sausage at DiPaolo's was sizzling on their portable propane grill. With a small sirloin steak in the fridge I saw a perfect opportunity to create a simple juicy steak sandwich. I had marinated the steak in some balsamic vinegar, olive oil, fresh black pepper and thyme and just need the rest of the ingredients. A perfect peasant bread ($3) would yield me a few sandwiches beyond today's steak sandwich. A small bag of mixed greens priced at $12.00 a lb, I only need $1's worth, and would add a nice bitterness and would work well with the French swiss I had purchased the previous week. Rounding out my purchase, DiPaolo's Sweet Turkey Sausage, priced moderately at $6.49 a lb, I picked up a lb and a half for later use in the week.Now to assemble the Steak Sandwich you would only need a few ingredients:Small Sirloin or Top Round SteakSalt and PepperButterOlive OilPeasant Bread or CiabattaA French Swiss or Farmhouse CheddarMixed Greens or ArugulaHerb Mayonnaise (mayonnaise, parsley, lemon, garlic powder, salt, pepper)Searing the steak quickly in a cast iron pan or heavy stainless steel pan to create a nice crust is key. Make sure to season the steak liberally with salt and pepper and if you choose to marinate it beforehand pat it dry with a paper towel. Afterwards let the steak finish up in the broiler flipping once and putting a small dab of butter in the pan. Once the steak is cooked let is sit and rest before slicing it thin at an angle against the grain. While waiting for the steak to settle, cut two slices of the bread and one one side layer the thinly sliced cheese and place in the toaster. After toasting, coat the plain side of bread with the herb mayonnaise and place the greens on top. After slicing the steak place the pieces ontop of the greens and then close up the sandwich and cut if desired. Serve with additional mayonnaise for dipping if needed.Picture to come....

I love Thai food. I also acknowledge that there are many mediocre Thai restaurants throughout NYC and the boroughs. I don't generally order pad Thai anymore, but Pad See Yue (spelling varies), a good curry, and some quality appetizers are key. My problem with many Thai restaurants or takeout spots is that the food doesn't lack any depth of flavor. Either the spice overpowers everything else or the sweetness of a peanut sauce controls the dish. The great thing about Thai food is that you can taste the result of chili paste, peanuts, bean sprouts, ginger and more all together and separately. Song on 5th Avenue in Brooklyn produces dishes that generally fit this criteria.Initially I walked into Song feeling a little out of place. The decor is not my thing, a little industrial chic mixed with dark lighting, concrete colorless floors and a DJ. The crowd is a mix of couples, friends and some families all the more intriguing due to the nightclub like interior. I push on and walk past the bar, I am here for the food, not for the decor or music. The menu is relatively large, divided simply into appetizers, soups/salads, curry's, entrees and rice based dishes. A small menu of specials also sits at the bar and generally is revised every month or so. I started off with some Nuur Satay or beef satay, the simple skewered and grilled beef brushed with a peanut sauce and placed next to a cucumber and red onion salad. The dish was good, not the best satay I have ever eaten, but better than average and only $3.95. Next my table shared the house salad with the typical peanut sauce dressing, but this was a very nice rendition of the dressing. Nothing complicated, but fresh and not overpowering. A special of the catfish spring roll was delivered to the table, nice flavor and crisp vegetables, but again nothing spectacular. All things considered the meal did start off well, above average to very good appetizers made better since they were all under $3.95 a dish.Moving into our entrees we were presented with an enormous plate of chicken fried rice full of vegetables. At a more than reasonable $5.50 this portion could easily serve 4 diners with the potential for leftovers. Very nicely seasoned, it is one of the better fried rice dishes in the neighborhood. I went to my staple next, Pad See Yue (beef with broad rice noodles and chinese broccoli in a sweet soy sauce, and I was quite pleased. In my opinion a good Thai restaurant should be able to produce a top notch Pad See Yue, Song's was fantastic though a little sweet on some return occasions. The last dish was Gai Kraprow, chicken with basil and chili sauce with an assortment of vegetables. The aroma of this dish was intoxicating. Yes, taste is of course the most important aspect of food, but when something smells this good you take advantage and savor it. Each entree topped out around $8, which considering the portion size and quality of food is a steal.With all the money you're saving on food don't hesitate to order some drinks. Song has a full bar, a variety of beers and a handful of wines by the glass and bottle. More importantly, don't let the decor take away from your experience. Is it the best Thai food in the NYC area? No, not at all. However, it is very reasonably priced, very good Thai restaurant. Watch as the fires flare up from the woks in the kitchen, some searing allows for a clear view of the kitchen as entertainment. When it warms up take a trip outside and dine in the charming little garden, my favorite place to eat. Just know you don't need to wait behind a velvet rope or dress to impress, the club-like decor is merely an afterthought once you taste the food. 295 Fifth Ave., Brooklyn, NY 11215, 718-965-1108, Reservations - Recommended for large groups, Price - Inexpensive ($10-$25/person)

Restaurant Review: Flatbush Farm

***CONTENT
Sandwiched between Park Slope and Prospect Heights, Flatbush Farm is an all day dining destination. With a seasonal menu and an emphasis on local ingredients (produce from Satar Farms Long Island, potatoes from Stone Ridge Orchard in Upstate NY, and more) it is a great compliment to the already busy and every-changing dining scene in the area. With a rustic theme throughout the restaurant and the adjacent bar, Bar(n). The dining room offers a somewhat lit setting with a small bar jutting out in the middle of the long rectangular space. The bar(n), where I actually prefer to dine, is much more bar, but offers dimmer lighting, wooden tables and a more friendly and noisy environment. The garden, huge in size, offers a great space for drinks or meals once the weather heats up.Offering a diverse brunch menu of Toad in a Hole, Buckwheat Pancakes with Vanilla Maple Syrup and Smoked Duck Club Sandwich to name a few. Portions vary, so you may order up a side to really keep yourself full. For meals later in the day, you can find starters such as Pan-Fried Chicken Livers or Spatzle with Wild Mushrooms. Entrees range from Roast Duck with Braised Red Cabbage and Pureed Sweet Potatoes to a tender and juicy French Dip Horseradish Cream and a side of fries. The latter being one of my favorite meals to eat in the area and perhaps one of the better French Dips I have ever had. Although it's a weird menu system, there is also a bar menu, which can be ordered in the restaurant and is available till around 2am. Here you can order addictive artichoke dip that is cheesy with the right amount of briny bite from the artichokes. For those looking for a comfort meal order up the mac and cheese for a blast back to the days of Velveeta, but much much better. Too full for dessert, but promising to indulge next time, the offerings include chocolate bread pudding some days, cream cheese mouse, and other days molten chocolate cake.Without missing a beat, the wine and cocktail list delivers with some affordable reds and whites (bottles ranging from $24-70 and glasses starting at $6). With wines from around the world, plus a few organic options it will be easy to find something that suits your taste. If you're a beer drinker then settle in, you may be here for awhile. A handful of rotating beers on tap, Sixpoint and Victory being my favorites, as well as 16 bottled beers from the ever popular Miller High Life to one of my favorites Hitachino Nest's White Ale. A variety of cocktails are also available, but wine and beer are my recommendations as the best bang for your buck.Not everything is perfect as there are some service issues, slow and not always very attentive, and the food can be inconsistent depending on what you get. It may not be the best place for a quiet romantic meal or a place where you have limited time to dine, but overall Flatbush Farm is a great casual dining destination or simply a place to grab a drink (or two). Don't miss their BBQ's where you can find Lamb and Venison Sausage, Spareribs, Oysters and Sixpoint Craft Ale's; generally the last Sunday of every month, but varries due to weather.76 Saint Marks Ave, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 622-3276, Reservations - Not Necessary, Price - Moderate ($20-$35/person)

Restaurant Review: 'ino

Ah 'ino, the kings of the panini sandwich here in NYC. Not recently opened by any means nor an undiscovered gem, but definitely worthy of discussion and in this case praise. I dined at 'ino during lunch hours and the dinner rush and one thing was apparent, the paninis are always good and the restaurant is always crowded.With all of the choices on the menu I found it difficult to just choose one so on numerous occasions I went for the Quattro Panini , a great option where you can choose four paninis to sample for only $10. My standby is the Three Cheese which comes with crotonese, cacio, grana and truffle oil. The crisped bread goes perfectly with the melted saltiness of the cheese and the truffle oil adds a nice earthiness and depth of flavor without being overpowering. I am also quite fond of the Bresaola, Asparagus and Pecorino Peppato and Prosciutto and the Mozzarella and Tomato, both offering different flavor combinations, but always hitting the spot. A few paninis I thought missed the mark such as the Roasted Vegetables and Goat Cheese as well as the Artichoke, Fennel and Fontina. It is not that these paninis were especially bad, but rather many steps below their counterparts lacking the necessary flavors and textures you would expect here.Beyond panini's there are a variety of bruschette creations on the menu. For $3 you get one single piece, but it is generally pilled high with such toppings as butternut squash and asiago or white beans, tomato and basil. These are clear standouts along with the asparagus, truffle oil and parmesan and the goat cheese and fennel fronds. In this instance the bread works as a perfect vessel for this generally powerful flavors as well as the necessary crunch.'ino offers Tramezzini's as well which are Italian \"tea sandwiches\" or crustless sandwiches generally served on sliced bread. Salads and soups are also popular options are their are specials which rotate every few weeks, recently there was Jerusalem artichoke soup finish with fingerling potatoes.The experience of 'ino is not limited to it's top quality paninis, but also the extensive wine offerings. A double-sided list of reds and whites from throughout Italy helps transport you even further forgetting your small surroundings and the hustle and bustle feet away on 6th Avenue. Whether you are sitting at the bar or one of the handful of tables servers are more than willing to offer suggestions and tasting of any of their wines. For those who would prefer a beer, there is a short list of bottled beer as well as Brooklyn Lager on tap.With all the food and wine being so approachable, affordable and most importantly delicious it's almost irrelevant that the entire restaurant is the size of some studios around the city, if not smaller. With a kitchen the size of some cubicle's its hard to believe they are able to keep up with the orders and crowd, but the restaurant (which opened in 1998) values its simplistic approach and has mastered it quite well. As a word of advice, expect a wait so either call ahead for an update or be prepared to have a drink at the bar, during peak times waits can exceed one hour.21 Bedford St., New York, NY 10012, nr. Downing St., 212-989-5769, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Inexpensive ($10 - $20/person)

A great, and somewhat straightforward, story by Michael Pak at Epi-log (Epicurious' blog) details the simple process Dom goes through when making the famed pizza at Di Fara. As I've seen, its really not rocket science, the man just has good ingredients and knows what he is doing. It's still interesting to get the chronological images and corresponding information.Enjoy the story and visuals and if you haven't made it out there please do. Just make sure you avoid going at peak hours (12-2 and 5-7) or you will be waiting forever for even a slice.Secrets of Di Fara Pizza

Restaurant Review: Otto Enoteca Pizzeria

***CONTENT
Otto offers diner a chance to experience Mario Batali's food without the exorbitant (but sometimes reasonable) prices of Lupa, Babbo and of course Del Posto. Reservations are not easy to get, but they are attainable if you plan properly. The food here is not your average spaghetti and meatballs, nor is it your average thing crust Neapolitan pizza. Cheese plates with lavender honey, flavored olive oils and other such dipping sauces are a great start.The pizza is flavorful, though the crust goes soggy if you let it sit long. I recommend the four cheese or the prosciutto pizza. Pasta is cooked very al dente (too al dente for some people's tastes) but covered in sauces ranging from puttanesca to pesto or just a simple primavera like sauce. Batali loves smoked meats so you will find a wide range of Italian meats from simple salami to head cheese for the more adventurous.Wines are all Italian with moderately priced glasses and bottles and also some over the top pricing as well. The desserts are some of the finer options on the menu. Gelato's such as olive oil and hazelnut are irresistible with other standard chocolate and vanilla flavors being distance second choices. The olive oil is actually topped with sea salt adding a wonderful saltiness to a unique and refreshing dish. If you haven't tried it please do for your own good. The restaurant is great for groups, but not recommended for anything intimate. The volume in this place gets out of hand and you will find yourself yelling to your dining companion multiple times if you're not careful. The front wine/bar area allows for groups to sip some wine, eat some olives or cheese and wait for their table to appear on the train station apparatus at the front counter. Prices can be reasonable if you keep your drinking in check and service can be a little inconsistent. A nice option for visitors or a night out with friends.1 5th Ave, New York, NY 10003,(212) 995-9559,Reservations - Recommended,Pricing - Moderate ($20-$40/person)

Yes it's true, for one night Anthony Bourdain was in the back of the house cooking on line at Les Halles, his former stomping grounds (of 8 years ago). Now he is known as a celebrity on food, global food culture and also a highly regarded writer, but he hasn't cooked in some time. On the last episode of his show No Reservations, he steps into the kitchen where they are doing 300+ covers a night. Halfway through his good friend, and one of the best chefs in the city, Eric Ripert shows up to take on the grill station.Watch and enjoy, it's humbling and entertaining: Bourdain and Ripert cooking at Les Halles

also posted on FB....I love to watch AB on his shows... and have dined at les halles... I have not read any of his books or looked into his background... but I can't help but notice that les halles is a very plain and non-adventurous choice for a restaurant...has he offered any explanation for why he chose to stick with moules frites and not something more adventurous?

Although I don't know Bourdain personally I wouldn't let Les Halle's \"plainness\" reflect on him at all. He hasn't cooked there in 8 years and is now called \"a consulting chef\", meaning he probably makes some money off the restaurant, but doesn't really have anything to do with it. Remember, he's classically trained in French cooking. He may eat food from all over the world, but I wouldn't say he knows how to cook it all.

From a few sources (namely Brooklynian) it seems two new places are coming to Vanderbilt Ave. in Prospect Heights: Brooklyn Pizza Company next to Alieso and a new Italian place next to Le Gamin. Now what I don't understand is thy either one of these places would open? We've got Amorina, Franny's and then the mediocre Antonio's and Gino's and then plenty of Italian in Park Slope, not to mention Aliseo and Amorina up the block?Either someone didn't do their homework or someone thinks their food is just better. I sure wouldn't mind an Al Di La caliber spot closer to my home...Oh well, good business for the area at least. Any updates will be provided.

Although they are still in the works, I'm proud to say I've added to new features to the blog. First is a list of all places I've dined at in Manhattan and Brooklyn along with some useful information on my experiences. In conjunction with this I've created a map (thank you google maps) which gives a visual representation of all the places I've dined at (and can remember) across the country. Of course the labels are centralized around Manhattan and Brooklyn, but you will see a few other areas represented (CA, FL, MA, etc.). My goal is to ultimately add a small review to go along with all of the restaurants listed on the map.Links to both these tools can be found on the right side of the window.I hope you can find use in both of these new tools.Thanks,Aaron

Restaurant Review: Bar Stuzzichini

***CONTENT
Bar Stuzzinchini, which opened last year, offers what is becoming very popular food these days in NYC, Italian small plates. The Spanish tapas of a few years ago paved the way, but over the past year we've seen a handful of high-quality Italian small plates restaurants. Most recently Bar Stuzzichini was names \"Best Small Plates\" by NY Mag and was also on their best \"Cheap Eats\" list. With that aside, I've always wanted to dine here, but the Flatiron location has never been very convenient. Finally, I made my way here last Friday with a small party of three ready and willing to try anything and everything, but with high expectations.Fortunately, I had made reservations for 8:30 because the entryway was a mad house; a mix of hosts, customers, coats madness that started everything off on the wrong foot. There is a gorgeous long bar when you first enter the restaurant on the right side which is partitioned off from the dining area. Chalkboards have various wines and appertifs written on them and this area is constantly flooded with people. The entryway situation was difficult to forget as we were finally led to our table after waiting for 15 minutes; we walked by the open kitchen where meats and cheeses were carved and a number of tables before being led to a back corner table right next to the kitchen. Unfortunate about the kitchen being next to us, but fortunate because it was probably the quietest table in the house. From it's exterior Bar Stuzzichini does not appear that large, maybe seating 50, but upon entering you notice the restaurants is very very deep and can accommodate at least double that figure. Mahogany is the wood/color of choice here and the lighting is slightly dim and seems to be set for a rustic or bistro like feel. A little more wear and tear on the restaurant would do the overall look good as it still looks too fresh and \"out of the box\".Yearning to forget my poor first impressions we all scanned the menu with pleasure. I had read about the Stuzzichini Misti a selection of five small plates perfect for sharing, and a very reasonable $24, and looked forward to it. The small plates or misti consisted of a handful of Crostini, Verdure, Pesce, Formaggi, Friti and Salumi. Each dish varries in quantity, but is suitable to share with as many as three people, if you have anymore I would order double. My table selected the Baccala Fritti (salt cod fritter), Scamorze alla Brace (smokey grilled cheese), Carciofi (fried artichoke), Panelle (chickpea fritters) and Polpette (fried meatballs). Unsurprisingly the fried items are delicious with the artichoke and chickpea fritters being amazingly addictive. The salt cod fritters were probably the only one I would replace as it was just bland and paled in comparison to the other items.Next up we ordered the Crostini Misti (crostini sampler) which brought us one of each of the crostini's offered. Of the four the best was the Ricotta e Miele (Saffron Honey) with its sweet yet smokey flavor. The other three were forgettable.Knowing that would not be enough food for three people, we opted to split a pasta and chose theGnocchi all'Amatriciana (Gnocchi in red sauce with chili's and italian bacon). The dish was a great way to fill ourselves up, but seemed to fall short. The gnocchi, very small may I add, were not as light as I had expected and somewhat chewy. The sauce had a nice smokiness from the bacon and chili's, however, I would have preferred more of the fried artichoke at this point.Hoping to end on a high note, and also a little hungry, we decided to order three desserts: Crostada della Mela (baked apple tart), \"Mucca Marrone\" (a spin on a brown cow ice cream soda) and Cannolis The baked apple tart was very good, but would have been much better if it was hot. The cannoli's, served by the piece, were quite good and not overly sweet as has been the case with cannoli's I've had before. The brown cow arrived with a wonderful presentation, but in my opinion was hurt by the orange Pellegrino which was used. The orange flavor did not seem to work with the rich chocolatey carbonation.Bar Stuzzichini also offers an extensive wine list with glasses ranging from $9-16 and bottles starting in the high twenties. Beer is also available with a short list of three on tap and three bottled.From a hype standpoint, the food is quite good, but I will stick with the misti sampler next time. The service needs to be fixed, especially the front of the house. The disorganization and clutter, no matter how busy you may be, shouldn't be tolerated by the manager. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt as they've likely seen more business due to the NY Mag write up a few weeks back, but a serious fix is needed. I'll go back, but not for some time, hopefully giving them a chance to figure things out.928 Broadway, nr. 21st St.; 212-780-5100, Reservations - Recommended, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person)

Restaurant Review: Tia Pol

***CONTENT
You don't need a plane ticket to Spain to sample some amazing, authentic tapas. The location is in the middle of nowhere near the corner of 23rd and 10th and if you're not careful you will walk right by it. The front of Tia Pol is a bar where many prefer to dine and also linger as they wait for tables. Beyond the bar are a handful of tables with only a few holding more than 2. If you have bad posture don't expect to improve it here as all the seats, except for one booth, are bar stools.I recommend starting your meal with a glass, or pitcher as I usually choose , of sangria and then dive into the extremely authentic menu. The patatas bravas (rough cut potatoes with spicy aioli and the Pimientos de Padrón (piquillo peppers in sea salt) are great to snack on and a perfect start to the meal. The patatas bravas, a staple at most tapas restaurants, as some of the best I've had, though on a recent trip they were a not as good as usual. As for the peppers, well they are as addictive as potato chips. Of course that mentality changes when you get surprised by the heat, every now and again one of the peppers will pack quite a punch and there is really no predicting it. Other favorites of mine include the croquetas de jamón (ham croquettes) Other more substantial dishes include succulent pinchos morunos (lamb skewers) afixed with french bread to sop up all the jucies and a unique and memorable chorizo con chocolate (chorizo and chocolate). Small slices of wonderful chorizo are placed atop a semi-sweet chocolate spread on top of a piece of French bread. The flavors change from spicy to sweet and ultimately merge together to create something I had never tried before, but vow to try many times again. For those of us looking to stay away from meat dishes I recommend the montadito de crema de habitas con (beyos fava bean puree covered with beyos cheese of toasted bread). The puree is piled high and offers a smooth, cooling change of pace to some of the spicier dishes. If you prefer to dine as if you are in Spain try to refrain from ordering all the dishes at once. Instead order 2-3 at a time to let yourself fully enjoy the meal, and also so you don't get overly stuffed. You shouldn't feel like you are in a rush, nor should you worry about the expense. The only dishes that break the bank are a handful of specials and only a few of them are recommended. Unlike many others who've reviewed Tia Pol I have never had a problem leaving hungry, nor have I ever been worried about being overcharged.Ordering drinks is a must, and I recommend splitting a pitcher of the house-made sangria which will produce about 6 total glasses as is well worth it. Other offerings are an all Spanish wine list as well as a handful of beers.When planning your visit to Tia Pol expect waits, on a recent Monday visit the wait was 30-45 minutes for a table of 2. Trying anything closer to the weekend will most definitely require hour or more waits and recommendations are not accepted for parties under 6. This can put a damper in your plans and it's my one big problem with Tia Pol. Even so, I plan to go back as often as possible for the atmosphere, the food, the drinks and to feel as if I'm back in Barcelona.205 10th Ave, New York, NY, 212) 675-8805, Reservations - Not Accepted, Price - Moderate ($25-$35/person)

NY Mag just released their best of NY list with some wonderful incite, but also missing on a few in my opinion. Many of the restaurants they list as \"best of...\" are on my list of places to dine, but a few really stood out. I've included the links below as well as the pictures to emphasis the drool factor:Insieme: Best Lasagna. If you never heard of Insiemme, this picture below will make you want to sprint there. The photo is cheesy, indulgent and most of all absolutely delicious. I fortunately just found the recipe for this and will being taking a stab at re-creating this apparently perfect lasagna at home.El Quinto Pino: Best Uni/Low. Originally I thought it was difficult for Uni to be a lowbrow food, however, after thinking about it and seeing how El Quinto Pino (the newly opened sister restaurant to Tia Pol) creates their Uni Panini (pictured above) my thoughts changed. Having never been particularly fond of Uni I find it hard not to want to try this dish. Even if I don't like it it sure won't break the bank.Bar Stuzzichini: Best Small Plates. I've always wanted to try Bar Stuzichini since it burst onto the scene a few years back. The menu looks wonderful and I find ordering a handful of small plates one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had.The review by NY Mag further pushes me to the Brodway and 21st spot to try the carefully crafted dishes. Anthos: Best Un-Beef Burger: This lamb burger from Anthos looks fantastic and has all the accompaniments one would ever need for a burger. Michael Psilakis knows how to cook, there is no question about it, and creating this burger affirms that. See the picture below and get on the reservation line quickly.There were a few winners that I did not agree with:Aquavit: Best $48 All You Can Eat Swedish Sunday Brunch.Okay, so it may be one of the only, if not the only, Swedish restaurant in town offering an all you can eat brunch, but that doesn't mean it deserves being called out. Personally the hype behind Aquavit's Smörgåsbord brunch was just that, hype. Certain aspects of the meal were quite good and unique, but no one in my party of six found the meal memorable.I would have liked to see Market Table (possibly for \"Best Place to Get ___ and pick up some groceries) or Bocca di Bacco (best wine bar where all the employees actually speak Italian), but for the most part there were some good choices here. However, it's clear they are trying not to replicate previous year categories seeing as they are no rating the best Uni, Deviled Egg and even Weird Dessert.

Yes, you read that right. There will be a new outpost of the famed Shake Shack opening up. The new location will be on 77th and Columbus, where Jacques-Imo's used to be housed before their lease was increased.

I've been on a long hiatus due to massive amounts of work and being sick, of course at the same time. I feel it's only fitting that I enjoyed a nice lunch at Spring Street Natural in Soho yesterday where all natural ingredients are featured along with some unique vegetarian and vegan options. The restaurant is much larger than you would anticipate. With an open layout with massive amounts of natural light streaming in, the restaurant is a great place for a casual meal or even just a drink at the bar.The menu is well rounded even for lunch with a handful of appetizers, half a dozen or so salads, a selection of sandwiches, entrees and even stir-frys. You won't find any red meat on this menu, but chicken is quite abundant. If vegetables are your thing there are plenty of unique salads, grains and more. I was looking for something substantial and opted for the Chicken Burger with chipotle mayo and housemade fries. Of course it's not beef burger, but for a chicken burger it was good. It needed a little seasoning and was a little dry, but overall I'd order it again. Other dishes like Poached Salmon Salad with lentils offered all the greens you would need in a huge portion. The same could be said for the stir-frys. Service was prompt and very friendly.It may not be the best food in Soho, but if you're looking to go all natural in a casual, bright setting Spring Street Natural will please you.62 Spring Street, NY, NY 10012 (212) 966-0290, Reservations - Accepted/Not Required, Price - Moderate ($15 - $25/person)

***CONTENT
Lots of attention has been paid to Prospect Heights and Vanderbilt Ave. over the past few weeks. One of the reasons is the new \"speakeasy\" bar, Weather Up, with drinks created by the owners of Milk & Honey in the LES. Once seen as the ugly cousin of Park Slope, Prospect Heights is fast becoming and dining and drinking destination (as made clear in an earlier post of mine and by Time Out NY). While I generally focus on restaurants I found it important to speak to this gem of a bar.The trickiest part is not walking right by the bar, as it has no signs or any indication it is a bar. There is usually someone standing outside watching the door, but that's the extent of it. Entering the bar you are whisked to another age. Originally an old church, I felt as if the bar belonged in the 20's and that I should have been wearing a derby hat. Dim lighting, a gorgeously tiled ceiling (though somewhat odd) and a handful of patrons making it one of the more relaxing bar experiences I've ever had.Each drink is made with care and comes with a price tag to match, $11 for a cocktail. The master mixologists, more appropriate than bartenders, serve up unique, fresh and strong drinks adorned with caramelized ginger, orange peel and more. I opted for the Presbyterian, a bourbon based cocktail with club soda and ginger. Rounding out the drink was a long chunk of ice cut to fit into the Tom Collins glass. Other drinks are equally impressive and I plan to return to try them all. Other drinks are available, including wine by the glass (starting at $6) and beer on tap and in bottles (also starting at $6).Weather Up plans to have a finished 2nd floor, but more importantly garden this year. The garden is slated to be ready in the Spring, while the timetable for the 2nd floor was not clear. Lets just hope word doesn't spread too far about Weather Up because if they operate anything like Milk & Honey there certainly will be an effort to keep the relaxed vibe, likely limiting the amount of people in the bar at one time. Short update, my worst fear came true last night. I was turned away as the bar had reached maximum capacity at midnight. I was told it would be a 30min wait, completely unnecessary to get into any bar. I sure hope this won't become a trend.(589 Vanderbilt Ave between Bergen and Dean Sts, no phone yet), Price - Expensive ($11 a cocktail)

***CONTENT
More of a boutique of subtle Italian flavors and breads than a place to grab a slice. Amorina offers the charm of a small Italian pizzeria with its red checkered table cloths and family charm. It's also owned by the Ballerini family, who have been running Aliseo Osteria del Borgo across the street. Amorina's impressive menu pays great attention to detail and can speak to the varied flavor cravings of a sophisticated palate.My recommendation is the fennel, caramelized onion and olive pizza as well as the zucchini. The latter is a cheesy salty combination with pesto and a perfectly crisped crust. If you're looking for pizza topped with meat, look no further than the Prosciutto e Fichi, a prosciutto pie topped with fresh mozzarella, figs, thyme and parmigiano. Their pastas are equally appealing and also come with inventive and of course extremely fresh ingredients. The rigatoni with a mushroom cream sauce was scarily addictive. For desserts there are a few offerings with my favorite being the flourless chocolate cake.However, the highlights are the pizza so don't feel bad if you have no room for dessert. Credit cards are accepted and there used to be a BYOB policy with a $10 corkage fee. If you opt to purchase wine their, prices are moderate with carafe's under $20. Don't let the decor, or lack thereof, change your perception of the food or ambiance. The pizza will speak for itself.It's a neighborhood place where everyone is welcome. A small intimate meal with wine or a large group outing to catch up. Regardless of your parties intentions or size you will have a great, low-key meal that will keep you coming back for more. 624 Vanderbilt Avenue, Brooklyn, NY 11238, Phone: 718-230-3030, Recommendations - Not Required, Price - Inexpensive - Moderate ($15 - $30)

...I just returned from the florist down the street and left chuckling to myself. Every flower store in the country has probably doubled their weekly profit in only an hour or so as all us men scamper home to get flowers. Valentines sure is an interesting holiday. My father always questioned it, \"why do I need a day to say I love my wife?!\" he would exclaim. Sweet, and also very true. Regardless, I've been suckered into it all and I will be dining out with the \"special\" Valentines Day menu at a special local restaurant. What a great day for restaurants as well. Prix fixed here, champagne meal there, all at premium prices. Some of the meals are most likely worth the premium price, but others are merely an excuse to charge that premium price. A complimentary bottle of champagne is a great offer, but if it is Andre then what kind of deal are you really getting (in fact you may be doing the restaurant a favor). When the dust clears and we wake to February 15th, it's likely major money has been spent, some have gotten lucky, maybe even engaged, but we have to be able to laugh at ourselves. Wearing red to work, standing in the 30 deep line for chocolate or flowers, paying premium prices for dinners that are finished with a cappuccino adorned with a heart shaped froth; it's all kind of comical don't you agree?Happy Valentines Day Everyone.

One of the few bars in the Prospect Heights area, Soda has a huge loyal fan base. Offering happy hour until 8pm every night (claiming the longest happy hour in Brooklyn) and great prices during other hours, it's hard not to love this bar. Whether you're stopping in for one of their delicious greasy burgers or a long night of drinking you can't go wrong here. With two sections, one with rock music at night, another with more alternative/trendy tunes and couches, plus an outdoor spot, you will find your niche.The food is great if you're thinking greasy. Burgers, onion rings, a BLT or even pirogies all with enough grease to cure your hangover or get you started for the night out. Sometimes the food is a little inconsistent, like when I asked for a burger medium and it came back bright pink and rare (I sent it back for a little more cooking). Other times I am ready to give Soda the juiciest burger award. Just don't expect perfection and you'll be fine.For drinks it's hard to mess up at all. A chalkboard on the wall lists all the wines available by glass, usually 4-5 reds and whites each, and the beer on tap changes quite regularly. With Bluepoint and Brooklyn Lager always on tap and an assortment of bottled beers even the pickiest beer drinks will find something.Though its generally pretty dark, too dark if you ask me especially if you're trying to eat, the neighborhood vibe combined with great music and fair prices makes this a local favorite of mine. 629 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238, (212) 230-8393, Price - Inexpensive ($5-15/person)

So in lieu of the recent article in TONY about Vanderbilt Ave. I thought it only fitting to post some of my earlier reviews, and new, regarding the dining and drinking destinations the neighborhood has to offer. Beast, one of my favorites on Vanderbilt is a neighborhood Spanish pub in a sense. A gothic inspired tapas bar with a neighborhood following. You'll find plenty tapas dishes, but they are most certainly bigger than what you'd find over in Manhattan. No complaints though as the prices are still very fair.Dishes such as flatbread with hummus are a must have and a great way to start the meal (update: the hummus has been replaced with a black bean hummus, possibly due to the season, but it is not as good). Other hits are Blue Point Lager-Braised Short Ribs, Citrus-Marinated Skirt Steak and Seared Diver Scallops (update: it you like polenta, in fact even if you don't, you must order the creamy polenta with blue cheese as it is beyond addictive). All provide a nice journey into Spanish cuisine that almost makes you forget you're in a Brooklyn bar for the most part. Specials can be wonderful like the Venison Loin offered, but do be careful. Some dishes are inconsistent to the point where I won't order them again, like the Sauteed Chorizo which was bursting with flavor one day then tasted like it had been drowned in rubbing alcohol the next.The menu is broken out, oddly, into \"Starters and Snacks\", \"Earth\", \"Land and Sky\" and \"Ocean\" making me think back to the days when Captain Planet was popular. Not to worry, it's not confusing, just strange, and that will go away after a few plates and a few pints. Speaking of drinks, the bar offers a nice variety of microbrews as well as a full bar and a fairly extensive wine list with bottles all under $40.Brunch offers great deals, and a can't miss burger with blue cheese potato salad and a thick slab of cheddar (my vote for best burger in the neighborhood). For the late night crowd happy hour starts at 11pm and goes for a few hours pricing drinks at a can't be beat $3. 638 Bergen St., Brooklyn, NY 11238, at Vanderbilt Ave., 718-399-6855, Pricing - Moderate ($20-30/person), Reservations- recommended for groups

Time Out NY reports that Vanderbilt Ave. in Prospect Heights is quickly becoming a hot spot for restaurateurs and bar operators. Many new storefronts can be seen popping up over the past few years and it is a sign of change for the neighborhood. This comes as no surprise being a resident of the area where I've seen the place change in just over a year. The one interesting thing, as many new bars and restaurants open there are still more hair stylists/dressers than one neighborhood ever needs.Check out the TONY article, and note they left off French Bistro/Cafe Le Gamin and The Usual, the neighborhood diner.TONY Vanderbilt Ave Story

***CONTENT
Growing up in New York I've been privileged to enjoy some very good pizza. There are certain requirements for pizza in my eyes, and other New Yorkers, that follow you where ever you may grab a slice. A certain sauce to cheese ratio as well as a crisp crust worthy of folding and without drooping. Now walking into DiFara's it was hard not to have high expectations. It's been crowned best pizza in the city by magazines, newspapers, foodies and non-foodies for years. Dom Demarco has over 40 years experience so the pizza must be good, right? The lines must be justified. These are just a few questions I asked myself riding down to Midwood on the Q this past Saturday afternoon.I had planned my arrival to be between 2-3pm to avoid the crowds. I went hungry and eager. Sitting a stone's throw away from the Q is DiFara's. A run down looking corner pizza shop. The sign is old, the windows are old, it certainly looks its age (opened over 43 years ago). Walking in I am shocked, and pleased, to see a short line of only 5 people. I had a chance to get a pizza in less time than I expected (45-60min). There are unwritten rules to follow when \"dining/ordering\" at DiFara's. You go straight to the counter to place your order and you stand there until your pizza comes out of the oven. If you move (some purists may find this information secretive) your pizza may take longer. Dom and his son need to see you there to remember your order, whether you want to sit or not.Enough build up, now the pizza. I ordered a round pie with porcini mushrooms. The porcini's are canned and marinated, they're good, but not amazing. The pizza though was amazing. The cheeses melded together into a stable, but creamy texture not found on any other pizza. The crust was perfect, slightly charred, but crisp and thin. The sauce was not overpowering, but seasoned well and the pieces of canned tomato added a nice burst of flavor. Dom tops the pizza's before serving them with freshly grated Grana Padano (similar to Parmigiano Reggiano, but softer), Berio olive oil and fresh basil. Every bite was wonderful and memorable. I left stuffed, but fully satisfied. The pizza and two soda's cost me $32, not cheap by pizza standards, but if you consider the quality of the ingredients and the care Dom puts into every inch of the pizza it is well worth it.1424 Avenue J, Brooklyn, NY, (718) 258-1367, Price - Inexpensive-Moderate ($6 - $16/person), Reservations - Not Accepted

Did you know Food Network is doing a special based on Bon Appetit magazine's best restaurants in America? I think it will be on this weekend. I went through the whole list last night and this was one of 2 that were in NY. And I also said to Mike last night...I wonder if Aaron has been there and what he'll have to say about it...and here you go today. Looks like you read my mind...

Yeah, the pie was delicious. I was very happy to see all the toppings, but I have to admit, I'm happiest with the plain pie. The best burst of flavor and the easiest way to taste a true Di Fara pizza.

I finally made it to Al Di La, a jewel of a restaurant in Park Slope, and I can't wait till I can go again. All the talk about there always being a wait is true, but it's well worth it. We chose to dine at the small adjacent wine bar and waited about 40 minutes. The wait was made easier as we were quick to grab seats at the small bar (there can't be more than 7 seats) and ordered a wonderful Italian bottle of wine from a very cheery and helpful waitress. After making it to our small table in the back, again there are only about six 2 person tables, we were met by the same cheery waitress and placed our orders. A cheese plate featuring three cheeses: a nutty parmigiana reggiano, a smooth blue and an amazingly decadent cheese made from sheeps, cow and goats milk that was rich and creamy, called La Tur.Our main courses consisted of Casumzieei, ravioli stuffed with roasted beets and ricotta and covered in butter and poppy seeds, and Tagliattelle Al Ragu made with homemade pasta cooked to perfection and a creamy and meaty ragu. Both dishes were impeccable and some of the best pasta I've ever been fortunate to eat. And at only $11 and $13 respectably quite the bargain. Dessert was hard to pass up with the first option being Ricotta Fritters with homemade whip cream and chocolate sauce, a perfect indulgent end to our meal. Surprisingly all of this high quality food and wine would be expected to run you over $100, but this meal with tip was just a few dollars south of $100, a bargain in my book.Overall the atmosphere, food and service made for a intimate an leisurely dining experience that I highly recommend. Be prepared to wait at least 45 minutes, but just grab a glass of wine to make the wait go quicker. Al Di La does not take reservations at either location.248 5th Ave, Brooklyn NY 11215, 718-636-8888, Price - Moderate ($30-40/person with wine), Reservations - Not Accepted

Marcus Samuelson's new restaurant, Merkato 55, opens today exposing New Yorkers to African cuisine on a grand scale. This meatpacking district newcomers will likely be a hit due to Samuelson's past success, some great PR folks and a impressive and delicious looking menu (though I don't know all the terms on it). For me the draw will be trying something brand new. Check out some pictures from NYmag.com

So as I mentioned a few weeks back, I had to undergo a procedure on my teeth and it was going to be restricting my eating. Well, I'm three weeks away from being able to eat anything I want and it is killing me. I never realized how much bread or crunchy foods I ate until now. No sandwiches, no bagels, any pizza needs to be cut with a knife and fork. Lots of noodles, rice and food cut into smaller pieces.I'm thinking that when I can finally get back to normal, i.e. eating anything and everything, I'll indulge in a wonderfully juicy large burger with some nice crispy french fries. Now just to plan where to eat. My top choices:1. Shake Shack - the double stack (a shack burger and shroom burger) with a side of fries of course2. Market Table - the burger is delicious and the fries are irresistible3. Burger Joint - While the fries are lacking I love the way the burger actually stays together, and it's delicious4. Corner Bistro - I can't think of a better place for a burger and a beer5. Stand - I've always wanted to try their burgersIf I do change my mind and opt for something other than a burger any suggestions would be welcome. Indulgent and big, thats the type of food I'm looking for here.Of course any place I do go will be followed with a glowing review most likely due to the situation.

***CONTENT
Recently opened, The Smith brings another dining option to the East Village/Union Square area. Located in the old Pizzeria Uno location it almost appears to be dated from the outside. Walking in the restaurant you'll find it is usually packed between 6-9pm which is a good sign. The dim lighting, white tiled floors and old (some nude) pictures on the walls create a welcoming vibe. The bar to the left of the entrance is not too large, but provides a nice view of the chalkboards scribbled with wines by the glass, mixed drinks (there are many) and beers on tap.The crowd, a mixed group of NYU students, teachers and neighborhood residents, seem at home as servers swing scalding hot platters of mac and cheese and burgers onto small tables.At first glance the menu seems to be upscale bar food, but dishes like lamb schnitzel, wild mushroom ravioli and vegetable bibimbap can't be found at your local watering hole. For some the dishes may seem out of place, but I think it's risky and commendable for The Smith to offer more than just burgers, wings and steaks. The menu is diverse, just like the neighborhood, and it surely allows for you to visit when certain cravings arise. Mac and cheese, an appetizer, arrives bubbly and slightly charred in a small cast-iron pan. A little more of the broiler would have been nice, but it's indulgent, crisp yet cheesy and very good. A steak salad arrives with beautiful chunks of steak, it looked like sirloin, cooked to a medium rare. The lamb schnitzel was a sizable and tender dish, though the accompanying smashed potatoes were a little too chunky and under seasoned. Desserts are on a separate menu, but sounded delectable; party cake ice cream sundae, banana bread pudding sundae and homemade jumbo chocolate chip cookies to name a few. Unfortunately, I was too full to indulge.With a great list of beers on tap, seven at $5, as well as bottles, mixed drinks and wine The Smith can also just be a drink destination.Although the food was not spectacular the overall experience was positive. Great decor and music combined with a friendly and fun loving staff and crowd make up for some of the shortcomings in the food. 55 Third Ave., nr. 11th St.; 212-420-9800, Price - Moderate ($20 - $30/person), Reservations - Recommended

Nice review! I went to The Smith when it first opened and ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi... wow! It was amazing! I had to go back with someone else and make them try it too. The other dishes that we ordered weren't spectacular but I agree, the decor is very neat - especially the bathroom. I posted two photos from The Smith on yummr.com that you can check out. The Ricotta Gnocchi is there, good stuff!

Stunning. The first word that comes to mind as you walk up the stairs and enter the main dining room. The room is airy and surrounded by windows on three sides providing views of the Hudson river, palisades, NYC and the George Washington Bridge. Beyond the views the room is setup to maximize the dining space while allowing the servers, and there are many, to seamlessly move in and around tables. One would not think this restaurant is in Yonkers, but this area of Yonkers is fighting the stigma the rest of the city has gained and the waterfront spot is no longer an eyesore. After scanning the view and restaurant for some time, I recommend making your way to the menu, as that is where Peter Kelly exceeds expectations. The menu offers a mix of Asian and European flavors that although very different can compliment each other creating unique dishes. Warm bread starts your meal (you get a choice of a flaky roll or a hard baguette). The wait staff is on hand to get drinks orders rather quickly, but they are patient and knowledgeable. A large wine list with moderately priced bottles as well as an assortment of wines by the glass is impressive, but the now onto the food. The menu offers appetizers, entrees and side dishes (desserts are featured on a separate menu. Perhaps one of my favorite new foods and of course my recommendation, the Short Rib and Foie Gras Ravioli with Truffle Butter. Talk about indulgent. This appetizer featured 4-5 handmade ravioli stuffed with moist and tender short ribs, a little dollop of foie gras and this earthy, addictive truffle butter. Each bite was fantastic and I made sure to mop up all the sauce with the bread.Other appetizers that were very good were the Salmon Belly and Seared Tuna Special. For the main course I was lucky to sample 4 outstanding dishes. I personally ordered the grilled tuna with potato puree, carmalized soy, Chinese broccoli and chickpea fries. This dish was a perfect follow up to my heavy and rich appetizer. The tuna was cooked perfectly with a nice sear on the outside and a soft melt in your mouth interior, plus carmalized soy added a depth of flavor not found with general bottled soy sauce. My favorite entree was not mine though, it was the crisped duck schnitzel with spaetzle and glazed turnips. Pounded and breaded duck cooked to perfection with a fantastic homemade spaetzle cooked with duck confit. The dish was hearty and showcased Kelly's international palate and technique. Finally the desserts. Again, without missing a step Kelly delivers here. We ordered four desserts, each with their own distinct flavor, each amazing. I ordered the Black and Brulee. When it was placed in front of me I thought it was too beautiful to eat, it was a work of art. An orange hardened sugar pedestal held up chocolate mousse topped with a layer of creme brulee, it was decadent and light at the same time. Another favorite dessert of mine was the insanely rich butterscotch pudding. Thick and somewhat reminiscent of cookie dough it was heavenly. Overall the meal could not have been better. The restaurant should have great success and hopefully it will. The only barrier is the area and the aforementioned stigma, but hopefully Peter Kelly and the other establishments nearby can fix that. If I had one complaint it would be that I did not get to tell Chef Kelly how good of a time I had here, however, many other people did as the chef walks around regularly to talk to the patrons. One final note, make sure you use the bathroom here. The bathroom provides ceiling to floor windows allowing city and Hudson River views not normally found in a bathroom. All around fantastic. I look forward to my return armed with my wallet (it's pricey) and an appetite (the portions are pretty big). 71 Water Grant St Yonkers, NY 10701, (914) 965-1111, Highly Recommended, Reservations - Highly Recommended

Rounding out the three day weekend I was fortunate to have lunch at Stanton Social with 20 of my family members. It was a great experience as we had the top floor fairly blocked off and all to ourselves. I've dined at Stanton Social before, in the evening, and it is a fun place. Playful twists on many international favorites. The food is not always amazing, but it's always fun with only a few items being complaint worthy.The meal would be family style with a wonderful list of options: Lox platters with a LES bakeries bagels and french onion soup dumplings started us off. Following this a plate of addictable potato pancakes and bland and unnecessary toast points topped with a mini omelet. Lobster rolls and Kobe beef sliders followed and quickly filled us all up. Last but not least, we indulged in Stanton's deliciously fresh donuts with caramel and raspberry sauces. Some of the best donuts I've ever had, you can't just have 1 or 2. A great meal to cap off the weekend, the best of all three actually. Drinks were a plenty as well as laughing, crying and plenty of picture taking moments.Shun Lee Palace: 155 E 55th St, New York, NY 10022, (212) 371-8844Food - Good, Price - Expensive, Recommended dish - Peking Duck, Reservations - Recommended, but not neccessaryVento Trattoria: 675 Hudson St, New York, NY 10014, (212) 699-2400 Food- OK, Price- Moderate/Expensive, Recommended Dish - anythingstandard and the drinks, Reservations - Recommended, but not neccessaryStanton Social: 99 Stanton St, New York, NY 10002, (212) 995-0099Food - Good/Very Good, Price - Moderate/Expensive, Recommended Dish -Kobe Beef Sliders, Lobster Rolls, Reservations - Highly Recommended

Three floors where ours to peruse, party and eat for almost 6 hours. We began with cocktails and passed hors d'evours. I sampled at least one of everything:- Grilled shrimp with a lime and chili marinade - nothing special and room temperature- \"Kobe\" beef sliders with caramelized onions and cheddar - definitely not Kobe beef, but decent- Marscapone and mushroom cream topped crisped bread - great topping, poor bread selection- Risotto and cheese balls - risotto was decent, but the cheese seemed out of place and bland- Prosciutto on Toast - Nicely sliced prosciutto, but the toast was bland- Short Rib on phylo topped with cheddar - probably my favorite finger food, but I did not get the use of the cheddar cheese, it overpowered any taste the phylo had and could have easily been replaced with a light sauce- White bean soup - too much pepper and I didn't enjoy taking a shot of a thick soup at allAfter filling up on all of this, with only a few I truly enjoyed it was to the 2nd floor for lunch and the toasts. Lunch was filled with a lackluster assortment of small plates (meatballs, salads, fried buffala mozzarella, polenta fries) and followed by a selection of main courses. Not one of the main courses was very good, the best being a simple Chicken Milanese, the worst being a petite fillet that had too much wine in the wine sauce and was poorly cooked. By dessert we were all too full, but did indulge in some chocolate covered strawberries.Overall a poor showing, but understand it was a large party and that food had to be prepared for over 50 people. Not to make excuses, as too much wine in a wine reduction is inexcusable by a chef, but don't judge the place purely on a catering job. I would however be careful with some of the dishes you order and perhaps start with something safe before trying anything too exotic or unique.Part 3 of the weekend to come with a review of Stanton Social...

...is a great weekend, and with all that New York City has to offer it's hard to go wrong. This past weekend I was fortunate to help celebrate my younger cousin's Bar Mitzvah. The weekend began with a feast at Shun Lee Palace (55th btw Lex and 3rd). Our party of 20 or so crammed into the front corner at three large tables topped with lazy susan's.The menu was pre-set and family style and began with scalding hot towels (I actually burnt myself on them) and chicken lettuce wraps, fried pork and steamed vegetable dumplings. The lettuce wraps were quite good, but of course messy. However, based solely on appearance the dumplings looked delicious, but the fillings were bland and the vegetable dumplings were no better than frozen dumplings I've steamed at home. After washing the dumplings down with a nice crisp TsingTao we were presented with 2 or 3 gorgeous Peking Ducks. Brought out on a silver platter and carved table side these ducks had promise and we all drooled in anticipation. Moist and extremely meaty the duck, wrapped gently in pancakes with some hoisin and green onion, was superb and some of the best Peking Duck I have ever eaten. I would have been satisfied eating the duck all night, but there was plenty more food on the way.The next few platters brought out (in no specific order) consisted of sea bass in a very heavy miso sauce, sauteed shitake mushrooms which were treated to a bit more soy sauce than needed, a wonderful tender steak dish with chinese broccoli, bowls of fried rice which were quite bland, assorted steamed vegetables and a chow fun type dish of thick rice noodles chicken and vegetables which lacked any real depth. After surviving such a large feast, and still thinking of the duck, we were left with platters of fresh fruit and hot tea to help ease us into our food coma's.A fine meal for a large family celebration, but certainly not worth all the hype. Shun Lee provides an elegant twist on many Chinese favorites, but there's no guarantee the food will be any better than your favorite neighborhood spot. What I can guarantee is that the service will keep you pleased. Water glasses always full, new silverware and plates in an instant and plenty of waiters buzzing around to grab you a cocktail or beer. Stay tuned for part 2 and 3 where I review my experience at Meatpacking District hot spot Vento and the continually popular LES destination, Stanton Social.

Prospect Heights Brooklyn may not be thought of as a sushi destination, but tucked into a small space on Flatbush Avenue for the past 20+ years Geido has been dishing up some of the freshest fish in the area at astounding prices. This is a neighbohood restaurant and their are many regulars here every night. Walking in there will most likely be a short wait, but it's well worth it. The sushi bar on busy nights may be locked in by Geido veterans or friends, but every now and again you can get lucky. The restaurant is cramped, but not uncomfortable. Maybe it's the wonderfully friendly waitresses that welcome you and bid you goodnight one by one or the graffiti and marker covered walls showing the history of the place. Or maybe it's the ultra fresh fish displayed at the counter for prices you may never have seen before in a sushi restaurant.A Dynamite roll filled with crispy eel, ruby red tuna, tempura flakes, masago (roe), cucumber and avocado can fill up a light eater easily for under $8. Pieces of sushi, all between $2 - $5, are fresh and made with care. The white tuna is tender and smooth, while the spanish mackerel (only when in season) is topped with a garlicky paste and scallions and packs quite a kick. Other menu items include a variety of tempura dishes from shrimp to pumpkin, as well as the standard terriyaki and noodle dishes.The menu is quite expansive and you will always find specials simply pasted on the wall which change regularly. A great place for a small group (call ahead) or a slow sushi dinner for two. Next time I'll try to order omakase to really let the chefs shine. Highly recommended.Geido Sushi 331 Flatbush, Brooklyn, NY 11217 (718) 638-8866

I've been somewhat MIA lately as I went through a big move and am having a dental procedure done, which may I add is very restricting of what I eat (i.e. no breads, or hard/crunchy foods).I'll be writing more soon, but the site will be dark for a few more days.Keep Eating-Aaron

At this small East Village eatery you can have the best meal of your life or just a few bites and some tasty wine. Degustation offers a wonderful menu of small plates and small bites. The menu changes every few months or so allowing you to go back and try new things. The wine list is a good size and offers whites, reds and a handful of dessert wines.The food is inventive, colorful and not lacking flavor by any means here at this open kitchen tapas bar. It's amazing to see all of the action in such a small kitchen: grill, burners, saute station, sink and an assembly area. Watch as the chef's create your meal in front of your eyes and don't hesitate to ask a question about what they are whipping up. Wesley Genovart a rising chef so make sure to visit before reservations are impossible to get.Yes, the portions are small, but the prices are not too over the top. It's more than food, it's an experience. (Don't forget the wine as well).- Crispy Sweetbreads cucumber dill Greek yogurt with chilies- Grilled Quail with forum reduction, pistachios and frisee- Ribeye with a red onion marmalade, molasses and bone marrow- Grilled Lamb Loin with truffled cauliflower and black maitake mushrooms- Monkfish in jamon serrano broth, baby carrots and artichokes- CroquettesEvery dish listed here was amazing. The sweetbreads, my first time trying them, were crispy on the outside and soft and tender on the inside. The flavors were complex and hit you on different levels for almost every dish. The ribeye with bone marrow was so savory and rich...I could go on, but I'd rather let you experience it for yourself.

Indian sandwiches and wraps at this W.Village shop keep me coming back for more. The flavors are well rounded, with a heavy dose of heat, and the prices are very reasonable. I'd recommend the Lamb Nanini, cubed lamb tikka with caramelized onions and mozzarella cheese in between two pressed pieces of Nan bread. The Lamb Partha introduced me to stuffed nan bread and was more than filling for lunch and under $5. Limited seating and not much decor make this an ideal takeout spot.

I've been meaning to eat at Taim for some time now considering many critics have been proclaiming it the best falafel in the city. I've always found Mamoun's or Kebab House, both on MacDougal, to have stellar falafel and their price is always under $2.50. Taim is a little different. No giant spit of meat rotating, no lines out the door or assembly line construction of your sandwich. This is a slightly more high end falafel, and I could get used to it. Offering three types of falafel: green (parsley, cilantro, mint), red (roasted pepper) and tunisia (mildly spicy) you already find more variety than at your standard falafel shop. All ingredients are extremely fresh and crispy, and the pita is clearly home made as it it crisp and never a perfect circle (like the bagged pita used across the city). To accompany your falafel I recommend the ginger mint lemonade, made fresh daily. It's refreshing with a little kick from the ginger and it goes well with the spicy green sauce on the falafel. Other offerings in include standard middle eastern salads of taboulli or eggplant salad and platters with hummus and mixed falafel. The fries are something to try on my next trip as they are a popular option with the saffron aioli. The price will set you back more than Mamoun's will, $5 for a falafel sandwich, but this is a different falafel.222 Waverly Place, New York, NY 10014, 212-691-1287 (cash only)

Venturing out to meet my family for dinner this weekend I was intrigued by the restaurant we had all selected. Revamped and redesigned, Meritage in Scarsdale seems to have all the makings of a good local restaurant. Highly qualified chef who cooked at Picholine in Manhattan and La Panetiere in Rye (a highly established French restaurant), a menu that seemed generally focused and many local ingredients. Though the restaurant is in a strip mall it is rather charming, minus the ceiling which looks like its been there since the 70's. The menu is broken out into small plates, appetizers, salads, entrees, pastas and neighborhood favorites. Much of the menu seems very well put together, but the small plates and neighborhood favorites seem out of place. Duck croquettes, olive tapenade and hummus of all things adorn this very much contemporary American menu. Neighborhood favorites are even more confusing, with Veal Milanese and \"Plain Grilled Salmon\". Plain is not a very appropriate naming and is somewhat of a put off.Those are the shortcomings, but the rest of the menu really does come together. Appetizers and small plates are tasty, but really just give you something to eat until the main course arrives. A point of advice, don't fill up on appetizers, save room for the massive main courses. As a table we feasted on grilled cedar river farms hanger steak with matchstick fries, perfectly cooked duck with pecans, apples and figs, a succulent venison chop with pomegranate sauce (a special) and my personal favorite, a softball sized braised short rib on top of a potato puree and roasted root vegetables. It seems meat was my tables preference, and judging by the menu options (2 fish dishes) and the quality of the meat dishes, the chef is good with meat.After such a heavy and large meal I may find it in me to skip dessert, but to do that here I would have sorely regretted it. Trying my first bread pudding I almost fell in love. Warm bread pudding with white and dark chocolates topped with housemade vanilla gelato. Decadent, soothing, refreshing, it was impeccable and I would choose to eat it everyday if I could forgo the weight gain consequences.Meritage offers a quite extensive wines by the bottle list and about 20 wines by the glass starting around $8-9. Reservations are recommended, but not necessary and there is a friendly and generally crowded bar on site for quick bites. Average cost per diner: $45 - $55. 1505 Weaver St. Scarsdale, NY 10583, 914-472-8484, www.meritagerestaurant.com

My favorite restaurant just began serving Sunday brunch this weekend! It was, as expected, simply wonderful. Brunch, like every other meal I have eaten at Meritage, was outstanding. Included in the price is a lovely, high-end buffet and in addition a choice from a menu of wonderful things (omelets, pancakes, eggs benedict (great), and many others. It is very reasonably priced as well, considering the high quality of the food. A nice relaxing thing to do on a Sunday!

Many reviews boast that Franny's has some of the best Pizza in NYC and Brooklyn, but while my experience did not result in crowning a new pizza king, it was still quite good. Remarkably thin crust, a wonderful balance of high-quality ingredients in a bustling rustic setting. The charred, imperfect yet perfect looking pizza's are beautiful adorned with many toppings if you like or simple with only garlic, buffalo mozzarella and oregano. Local and organic ingredients help elevate the pizza's to new heights while not overpowering the wonderful crust. A wine list offering a nice selection of red and white plus a well rounded beer selection make it easy to grab a table and stay awhile. Servers are also very helpful and friendly and are more than happy to make recommendations. The waits can get long and they don't take reservations so make sure to account for potentially long wait time, especially now that that Frank Bruni has given it 2 stars.295 Flatbush Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11217, (718) 230-0221m www.frannysbrooklyn.com

Market Table in the West Village has been receiving much acclaim since it opened in the Fall of 2007 and it is much deserved. Walking into this corner restaurant you are met with a wide open pantry selling a variety of goods, a bustling kitchen and a peaceful and rustic dining room. The vibe is welcoming and this carries through to the food. It may be a foodie's haven, but by no means is Market Table snobbish or upscale. Chef Mike Price, who is extraordinarily down to earth and puts his heart and soul into cooking, delivers on meals throughout the day. Brunch offerings such as French Toast with caramelized pears and pecans is very satisfying with a nice hint of vanilla shining through. The burger, which can be considered one of the cities top five, is placed between a soft yet resistant roll and topped with cheddar and caramelized onions. With LaFrieda supplied meat, the same as Shake Shack, the burger is bursting with flavor. Dinner options range from airy gnocchi with short ribs to grilled atlantic char with a wonderful mushroom-radicchio risotto. Overall a very approachable menu with moderate prices considering the high quality of food being served. Definitely worth a return trip to try some of the other dishes or even take home the assorted meats and cheeses being offered.Market Table, 54 Carmine Street, NY, NY 10014 (212) 255-2100

No matter what you call it, a hero/sub/etc., I feel that this generally massively delicious sandwich is overlooked. I remember the days when a chicken parm hero would fill you up for the day with its crispy, cheesey saucy goodness, but now most attention is paid to panini's or artisinal sandwiches. Don't get me wrong, I love a good panini at 'ino or what not and I have no problem with the artisinal sandwiches of Bouchon Bakery and Murray's, but that overly huge, stuffed hero seems to have drifted away. The standard pizza place still offers them, but where are the inventive heroes. Think about it, a panko crusted piece of chicken with carmelized onions, ponzu sauce and frisse lettuce. Or maybe just a wonderful lamb and veal meatball parm topped with fresh mozzarella and sauteed mushrooms. It's a simple sandwich that can fill you up for a day meeting the continually evolving food culture we have. New takes on the classics, without losing that, always conveniently wrapped, oblong aluminum foil sandwich.

My first posting promises to be the lamest of all my posts. Now that I've gotten that out of the way, I can get to the point of this blog. Many of us consider ourselves foodies, or food obsessed, but I'm hoping I can provide you something different and new. I've eaten all through NYC and many places around the country, written over 100 restaurant reviews and cooked countless meals for family and friends, but to be honest I just want to talk about food. So you can expect rants on the price of eating lunch in NYC to a formal review of the best new restaurant I've been to. Enjoy and keep eating.
