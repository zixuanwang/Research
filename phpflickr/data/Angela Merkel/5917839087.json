It began full operation two days after a ceremonial opening on 26 May 2006. It is now Europe's largest two-level railway station. It is located on the site of the historic Lehrter Bahnhof. The station is operated by DB Station&amp;Service, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bahn AG, and is classified as a Category 1 station, one of twenty in Germany and three in Berlin.\n\n-On 26 May 2006 the station was ceremonially opened by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who arrived together with transport minister Wolfgang Tiefensee in a specially chartered InterCityExpress from Leipzig. A &quot;Symphony of Light&quot; was performed immediately following the dedication. Reamonn and BAP performed at Hauptbahnhof, and there were also events at the other new stations: Gesundbrunnen, Potsdamer Platz and S\u00fcdkreuz. Berlin Hauptbahnhof officially went into operation on 28 May 2006.\n\nThe opening ceremony was marred by an attack by a drunken 16-year old youth wielding a knife, who stabbed members of the public leaving the ceremony. Forty-one people were wounded, six seriously, before the youth was arrested. According to police, the youth says he cannot remember his act of violence and is still denying it. One of the first stabbing victims was HIV-positive, leading to worries that other victims may have been infected, although this did not prove to be the case. The youth was charged with attempted murder, and was sentenced to seven years in prison for attempted manslaughter in 33 cases in 2007.","visibility":{"ispublic":1,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"dates":{"posted":"1310211104","taken":"2010-08-01 00:00:00","takengranularity":"4","lastupdate":"1350327985"},"views":"189","editability":{"cancomment":0,"canaddmeta":0},"publiceditability":{"cancomment":1,"canaddmeta":0},"usage":{"candownload":1,"canblog":0,"canprint":0,"canshare":1},"comments":"1","notes":{"note":[]},"people":{"haspeople":0},"tags":{"tag":[{"id":"60309634-5917839087-12486","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Reichstag","_content":"reichstag","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-247171","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Parlamento","_content":"parlamento","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-8525","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Parliament","_content":"parliament","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-42497","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Bundestag","_content":"bundestag","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-906791","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Reichstag Roof","_content":"reichstagroof","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-56773","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Tiergarten","_content":"tiergarten","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-557","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Berlin","_content":"berlin","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-12165339","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Alermania","_content":"alermania","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-1905","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Deutschland","_content":"deutschland","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-1477","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Germany","_content":"germany","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-12454","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Hauptbahnhof","_content":"hauptbahnhof","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-268472","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Berlin Hauptbahnhof","_content":"berlinhauptbahnhof","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-3697550","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Berlin Central Station","_content":"berlincentralstation","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-13020820","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Estaci\u00f3n Central Berlin","_content":"estaci\u00f3ncentralberlin","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-3272","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Europe","_content":"europe","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-3271","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Europa","_content":"europa","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-73150648","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Largest Crossing Station","_content":"largestcrossingstation","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-3674707","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"26 May 2006","_content":"26may2006","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-73150650","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Europe's largest two-level railway station","_content":"europeslargesttwolevelrailwaystation","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-329056","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Lehrter Bahnhof","_content":"lehrterbahnhof","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-28335254","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"DB Station&Service","_content":"dbstationservice","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-29040","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Deutsche Bahn","_content":"deutschebahn","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-9888","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"DB","_content":"db","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-1316","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Train","_content":"train","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-14246","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Train Station","_content":"trainstation","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-933","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Station","_content":"station","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-441958","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Angela Merkel","_content":"angelamerkel","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-18951","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Chancellor","_content":"chancellor","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-73150652","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Wolfang Tiefensee","_content":"wolfangtiefensee","machine_tag":0},{"id":"60309634-5917839087-1003716","author":"60329982@N02","raw":"Symphony of Light","_content":"symphonyoflight","machine_tag":0}]},"location":{"latitude":52.519047,"longitude":13.375833,"accuracy":"15","context":"0","locality":{"_content":"Berlin","place_id":"zot2ouJXUbKOJRM","woeid":"638242"},"county":{"_content":"Stadtkreis Berlin","place_id":"BPfoJmlQUL8JcHDn4Q","woeid":"12596838"},"region":{"_content":"Berlin","place_id":"uxEOtndTUb4nLR9E","woeid":"2345496"},"country":{"_content":"Germany","place_id":"h7eZVDlTUb50Btij9Q","woeid":"23424829"},"place_id":"zot2ouJXUbKOJRM","woeid":"638242"},"geoperms":{"ispublic":1,"iscontact":0,"isfriend":0,"isfamily":0},"urls":{"url":[{"type":"photopage","_content":"http:\/\/www.flickr.com\/photos\/millionseven\/5917839087\/"}]},"media":"photo"},"stat":"ok"}
