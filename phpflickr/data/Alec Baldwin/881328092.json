I felt like somebody had beat me with a stick at sometime during the night, so it wasnt all that easy to pry myself out from under the sheets. \n\nI finally made it to my computer chair where I sat for several hours working a little on school stuff and trying to figure out some more things to do with photoshop. By the end of the day I'd compleled 5 Lessons of science, ready to submit and the other 5 I had started. \n\nThen I started talking to Sarah on AIM. She started calling me Sally and telling me that I was obssed with Jonathan's front teeth, the conversation got really wierd from there and she ended up proposing to me and wondering what it would be like to tell everybody at school that we were underage, married and that I was pregnant. \n\nShe's very strange. \n\nAnyway I finally got into bed around 4 and started watching &quot;The Hunt For Red October&quot; \n\nI hate Alec Baldwin....\n\nBut after I watched the first few minutes of that I started watching Sahara and fell asleep... Thank god... I was tired.\n\nI took this late, and it turned out pretty good I think. I finally got the effect that I wanted after only a few tries.
