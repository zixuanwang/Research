I chased this truck down last week when it was in San Jose (downtown near Robert's bookstore) in search of this elusive and yet much talked about bulgogi burrito. Of course having had Korean tacos and food stand truck Korean food in SoCal, I was somewhat skeptical of this new trend which had suddenly made its way up north. They have several offerings including a bulgogi burger, and tacos of spicy pork, spicy chicken and bulgogi as well as a bulgogi burrito which can also be made from spicy pork, spicy chicken or bulgogi itself. The price is reasonable and the line isn't long at all despite what some people have told me. However, I found their burrito to be okay at best in terms of the kind of Korean food I've had (Korean food turned into tacos and burritos that is ....) Their bulgogi burrito was somewhat flavorless to begin with, ordered spicy pork and bulgogi and could not tell the difference. They put beans (like re-fried beans) in their burrito which is completely non-Korean and kind of destroyed the taste of the burrito as well as the marinated meats. They did **not** have kimchi in here! I was absolutely surprised at this since it is, after all, Korean. The tacos I had in Southern California had a handful of kimchi which made it oh so flavorful. Finally, there was fresh tomatoes and lettuce in it, and that was about it. Aside from the marinated Korean meat this was just another not-that-good Mexican style burrito and I was not impressed. However, I am definitely going to try a taco the next time I find them around here again because I am determined to find the same type of goodness I tasted in Japantown in SoCal without having to drive 350+ miles to do it!
