Mon-Fri: 7:30am-9pm, Sat-Sun: 9am-9pm Among the offerings of this Italian cafe are espresso drinks, bagels, pastries, homemade gelato, fresh pasta dishes, panini sandwiches, salads, tiramisu, and beer and wine. I've eaten here a few times with a friend who's an assistant professor in the Petroleum Engineering department. Terman Engineering Center in 2003 closed its venerable Nuts and Mud snack bar in favor of this bistro operated by Palo Alto's hot Caffe Riace Ristorante Italiano.
sooo...i was originally pretty impressed by the large selection that Ciao offers. I love that they have nice pastas and the eggplant parmesan really is very tasty. But recently I've realized that Ciao is really quite expensive. I was craving (like could not get it out of my head it was driving me insane) sushi but I only had enough time to take a quick lunch break. I found some spicy tuna rolls in the refrigerated section of Ciao so I decided to try it. There was no price on the box but I assumed that 6 pieces of sushi would be around $3-4. I was wrong. Apparently 6 small dinky pieces of sushi is worth SIX BUCKS. A dollar a piece. And it was stale. SERIOUSLY???  It was worse than safeway sushi. BOO! Also, a simple cup of coffee here costs $1.45. Coffee at the Stanford Bookstore is 50 cents all day. The ladies at Ciao are still very nice, but I would only come eat here on their eggplant parmesan days.
Ciao! is awesome! Ciao offers hot fresh food like lasagna, spaghetti/pasta, paella, baked chicken,... Read more 
I think it is ok. One plus is that there is also a outdoor patio apart with indoor seating.  Would be nice if they provided biodegradable utensils without charging additional 15cents.
